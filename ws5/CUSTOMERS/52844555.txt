Very well written story of a fire-bug	This is the story of perhaps the most prolific fire-bug in the history of the United States, John Leonard Orr, who is now serving a life sentence without possibility of parole, in the U.S. Penitentiary at Lompoc, California, where in due time he will be transferred to the California State system.<br /><br />The story leads the reader through Orr's life as a reject from LA Law Enforcement, a failed LA Fire Dept. academy starter, to the acceptance by Glendale Fire Dept., a much lower-paid position, where over a period of years he became a Captain/Arson Investigator.<br /><br />As an avocation, the Fire Captain, sworn to protect the public from fires, was starting them by the hundreds, and then grabbing attention by solving \\"How\\" they were started.  He seemed to have an intuitive grasp of where to find the points of origin, and the incendiary devices.<br /><br />Orr was a copy \\"wannabe,\\" who tried constantly to impress the police with his acuity and bravery, effecting arrests (although it was not his job).  He carried guns in the shower.  But he was all a sham.<br /><br />Eventually, Orr was caught, of course, and tried, and convicted.  The evidence against him was as damning as in the O.J. Simpson case, but there was no race card to throw in, and no jury nullification factor.<br /><br />He caused the deaths of a least four, and perhaps five people, in one fire at Ole's Dept. store, and he wrote a supposedly fiction book, which reads like a very poorly written diary, and the contents of which were damning and led to his conviction.<br /><br />Orr thought he was smater than anyone else, but his own big mouth and braggadocio was his ulitimate dowlfall.<br /><br />I ordered this book and Orr's own \\"masterpiece\\", Points of Origin, after watching a presentation by Court TV.  He will not profit from his writing, as it goes to restitution, but even if he did, if the quality of his writing talent has anything to do with it, he'll die penniless.<br /><br />Joseph Wambaugh, on the other hand, is a wonderful craftsman, also from the LA Police Dept., where he was a detective sergeant.  In addition to this book, he wrote The Onion Field, The Blooding, and The Choirboys.<br /><br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre, Retired<br /><br />Oregon Dept. of Correctionseph Wambaugh, on the other hand, is a wonderful craftsman, also from the LA Police Dept., where he was a detective sergeant.

This is quite a book, describing the effect of political correctness on our national security.  Almost unbelievable!<br /><br />Fact: In early 1942, then-Governor of California, Earl Warren, who eventually became Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, with the collusion of President of the United States, Franklin Delano Roosevelt (D), had all of the Japanese/American residents on the Pacific Coast and Hawaii, including U.S. Citizens, interred in what can only be accurately described as \\"concentration camps.\\"  Their property, in most cases, was confiscated and sold, including prime agricultural land.<br /><br />The reason?:  It was thought that they represented a threat, and the U.S. government was fanning racial hatred in time of war against our enemy.

The manuscript was found in his belongings after he was apprehended, during a search of his home, on a search warrant.<br /><br />The story was on the A&E Channel, describing many of the fires he set.  Some were in buildings, and in one, children died.  Not a paragon of virtue.  Although the book is supposed to be fiction, it is patterned after actual facts as only he knew the details.  He often astounded members of his department with his deductions on how the fires started; but he was not brilliant. He had first hand knowledge.<br /><br />The proceeds of the sale go to remuneration of the damages his victims suffered, as is common on books by criminals.

It could have used the publisher's offered editing service, though.  There are many instances of the use of an obviously wrong word.  Nothing, however that seriously detracted from the story.<br /><br />The cover photo was outstanding, and because of the half-dozen hammerhead sharks shown, I must assume that it was shot by the author, who claims to be a photog.<br /><br />Frankly, I was hoping for a non-fiction book about diving, replete with many underwater photos.  The Sea of Cortez is a renowned diving area, and Ray Cannon's book, The Sea of Cortez, is an example of what can be done with such a book.<br /><br />This is a good first book for a young author who obviously loves diving.<br /><br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre	2004-11-19

I know such books are difficult to write, and to express a spiritual journey in language that resonates with an audience.  If it is a lay audience (ordinary people without a background in specialized jargon), then it becomes necessary to, somehow, find words that will express mental processes that are, finally, inexpressible.  And, of course, all books involve primarily mental processes.<br /><br />On the other hand, if the expected audience is composed of people sophisticated in what some call \\"new age\\" jargon, using Hindi terms like 'chakra,' 'Sat Guru,' and esoteric ideas such as 'Etheric Body,' and oneness with God (\\"Tat Tvam Asi,\\") then such a book can be compared to 'preaching to the choir,' which is usually not very enlightening.  That is, NEW light is rarely shed.<br /><br />I know how difficult it is, because I tried to write a small book describing my own non-Christian 'religious experience.'  The book was The Road to Damascus: Our Journey Through Eternity.<br /><br />In it, I tried to describe my own experience.  Critics reviewed the book unfavorably, as trite, a Christian apologia (although even a cursory examination showed otherwise), shedding no new light, while I was trying to describe the most earth-shaking experience of my life as honestly as possible.  I've since concluded that trying to write such a book is probably a mistake.  One cannot describe the indescribable.<br /><br />So, I hesitate to criticize Ms. Ayer's effort, here.  But, I find nothing new.  Nothing that the Vedas and the New Testament have not already adequately stated; adequate, that is, for those who can hear the message.<br /><br />I do sense a confused woman, here.  Maybe I'm wrong.  But, she seems unable to decide whether she is a Christian, or a Hindu.  Though the two religions have some common points, there are marked differences.  Christians believe that Christ was the ONLY son of God.  Hindus believe that we are all aspects ('sons'?) of God.  That the individual soul is not different than the soul of God.  And, there are certainly some points which she accepts unquestioningly, from the New Testament, which even a cursory study of the history of the beginnings of that document--specifically the historical doings of the Council of Nicaea--will cast in doubt: evidence of editing, additions, subtractioons, changes of meaning and WHOLLY INVENTED parts of what became the canon of scripture now generally accepted. A frank attempt by Costantine's scholars to reduce the various factions of Christianity to a single, cohesive belief system.  An endeavor that was certainly successful, though--at what price?<br /><br />There are a great many homilies used here from a variety of sources, including Hindus, Christians, and \\"Saints.\\"  I am somewhat put off by the whole concept of Saints, Avatars, and Bodhisatvas.  One quote she has, though, meets with my total approval:<br /><br />Those who know, don't speak;<br /><br />Those who speak, don't know.<br /><br />There is a photograph of the author on the back cover.  It shows a woman iof indeterminate age, with apparently bleached blonde hair and much eye-makeup, with an expensive white turtle neck garment.  I do not mean to be hyper-critical, but this is not the image of an ascetic.  Perhaps, like all of us, she is simply trying to look her best.  She is very attractive.<br /><br />This is a good book, with much to recommend it.  The quotations alone, that it incorporates will be worth the reading.  It obviously represents a great deal of effort.  How much original insight it incorporates is for each of us to judge. Any thought that you have not encountered before, is new to you.  I recommend the book to you, although I cannot endorse it without more personal knowledge of the author.<br /><br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre<br /><br />author of The Road to Damascus: Our Journey Through Eternity<br /><br />and other books/>and other books	2004-11-15

Not a Marine Corps sniper, but a Wermacht sniper, in the last days of World War II.  Apparently, Stephen Hunter likes to \\"reach out and touch someone\\" in his stories.  He does a lot of stories based on snipers.<br /><br />Hunter, by the way, spent his military service in the Army, not the Marine Corps.  His bio does not discuss his Army experience, but he has encyclopedic knowledge about firearms, and if he makes a statement about a given model of firearm, or its ballistics, you can bet that he's done his research.  He's done a lot of reading on the subject, but how much experience he has, again, is a questionmark.  Not, I think, a competitive shooter.<br /><br />This tale looks at the Office of Strategic Services (reinvented as the CIA) of \\"Wild Bill\\" Donovan during WWII, (much like Claire Chennault's Civil Air Transpory was reborn as Air America, the CIA outfit) and the Brit intelligence apparatus, for part of its setting.  I was interested to see, again, a reference to Ernest Hemingway--not too flattering.  He was also in Hunter's novel, Havana--drunk there, too.  I wonder what Hunter has against Papa?  Apparently just doesn't like him.  I always did.<br /><br />Another theme in this book is a strong current of sympathy for the Jewish people--not that they didn't deserve it, but I have noticed in Hunter's other books an almost obsessiveness about showing how badly treated were the blacks in the old South.  He does seem to get caught up in these matters, a champion of the \\"underdog\\",  although he uses variations on the \\"n-word\\" freely throughout all of his books, and I've read several of them.<br /><br />These are not just fault-finding comments.  Stephen Hunter is currently my favorite author in his genre, as I've said before.  He's a wonderful storyteller.  But, I think I've accurately detected both his political bent and his agenda, if he has one besides simply writing great stories.  He's that rarity, a liberal who knows something about firearms, and may even be infatuated with them.  I wish him well, and hope he continues to write great novels to a ripe old age.<br /><br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre, USN (Ret)<br /><br />author of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenance<br /><br />and other bookses.

Shooters who have read their work will recognize the real gun writers that Stephen Hunter patterns some of his characters after in this tale. Most are dead now, and at least one escapes me. Elmer Keith, Bill Jordan, Jack O'Connor, Ed McGivern, well-known gun writers and experts all, and Audie Murphy, actor and decorated warrior, are easily recognized by their physical descriptions, as well as the false names assigned to them, and in many cases their real-life predilections and stomping grounds fit the bill.<br /><br />The character known as \\"Charlie\\" escapes me, but given his loud-mouthed bragging about how many men he has killed, I doubt that he is based on any real person at all. He does not fit anyone with whom I am familiar, and so I suspect that he is pure Hunter fiction. If not, he is lawsuit bait, and I hope I never meet his real-life counterpart.<br /><br />This is another fine action thriller by Hunter using a couple of his protagonists from other stories, Earl Swagger, an Arkansas Marine, fresh out of WWII, and Sam Vincent, a former State Prosecutor.<br /><br />This story, a little different from Hunter's usual fare, develops the old Yankee theme about the abysmal cruelties suffered by blacks in the deep South; in this case, Mississippi. Like most such tales, it is considerably overdrawn, and in fact a caricature of the real South, in which, in fact, I, an Oregonian, lived for a couple of years in the mid-'thirties. (By the way, Mr. Hunter, an accurate colloquial rendition of New Orleans in the local patois is more like Nyaw'luns, than the N'Awleens you seem to favor in this book, at least as I remember it from my youth).<br /><br />I am awed by Stephen Hunter's genius when it comes to spinning a tale. Usually he does not let political correctness intrude and spoil the story. In this case he comes close, but the story survives. He knows more about firearms than the average fiction writer. Whether his knowledge is simply derived from reading gun magazines, or whether from some actual experience with firearms, it is difficult to tell. As for his knowledge of prisons and prison routine, I can tell you he has a lot to learn, speaking from twenty years experience on the subject.<br /><br />What he describes here is a caricature about as accurate as a political cartoon compared to reality, even in the deep South of the 'thirties, where I saw my first chain gang working on a highway shoulder with balls and chains on their ankles under the shotgun of a cracker guard. But, this is a common fault of screenwriters as well. Most prison movies (Cool Hand Luke, The Longest Yard, The Shawshank Redemption, Escape From Alcatraz, etc., etc.), where the American public gets most of its information about prisons, unfortunately, tend to show the inmates as poor, misunderstood, or even innocent victims of the brutal \\"guards.\\" It is disheartening to the men who work the toughest beat in law-enforcement to see themselves portrayed thus year after year, by Hollywood's mythmakers.<br /><br />But, in this story at least. it all comes under the heading of \\"poetic license.\\" There can be no doubt that Stephen Hunter is an exceptionally fine writer in his genre, who holds his audience spellbound. I love to read his stories, and hope he writes many more and lives a long, highly productive, successful life. I'm not even miffed by his cracks about the Navy (from Earl Swagger's mouth).

Loosely based on an actual historical event, when returning World War II vets decided to clean up the corrupt cesspool that was Hot Springs, Arkansas, Stephen Hunter freely admits that he has taken great liberties with history. But when there is a conflict between a cool plot twist and history, as Hunter declares, the former will always win. He is a storyteller first, last, and always.<br /><br />Hunter is a good storyteller partly because he spends considerable time researching his details in order to get things right, and make his stories plausible. Good fiction must be plausible. In this effort he has done his usual fine job, using books and experts to make certain that his details fall together on such things as the firearms he introduces (the Thompson submachine gun, for example, as well as combat enhanced .45 model 1911A1 Colt government model, and other weapons). He names some of his resources in the Acknowledgement chaper of the book.<br /><br />One place where he apparently lacked adequate research though, was in describing a sailboat, where, no doubt he thought he could \\"wing it\\" with what knowledge he thought he had. Such tiny details trip up many an author who tries to spin a yarn about something he has no knowledge of, making a fine writer and careful researcher like Hunter stand out from the rest. And, he certainly does.<br /><br />The detail? A \\"sheet\\" is not a sail. It is a rope. Some insist on calling it a \\"line.\\" Its purpose is to control a sail.<br /><br />Hunter uses the word to indicate the number of sails the boat will spread. He might better have indicated them by name, for presumably the boat was speading its jib, main, and mizzen, assuming that it was a ketch or yawl (not clarified). And, Stephen, there is no \\"twenty-two bells.\\" On a 24 hour clock, 2200 is ten PM. There are only eight bells, which are sounded, incrementally, a half-hour apart, and then at the sounding of eight bells, it begins again with one bell.<br /><br />Hunter apparently, judging from the speeches he puts in his protagonists mouth, doesn't like swabbies, and this is swabby language. But, remember this, The Marine Corps is part of the Navy, and any boot Marine should know the significance of the bell system of watch-keeping.<br /><br />But, like Ruash Limbaugh would say, \\"Just kidding!

This book, Violent Screen, intrigued me by its title because I have long noted that Hollywood, populated as it is with a preponderance of liberal, anti-gun, anti-violence sob sisters, cannot seem to make a movie without featuring gun violence, homicidal car chases, and other socially unacceptable action on a grand scale.<br /><br />The average citizen of the United States has never, WILL never, in a normal lifetime, be witness, even once, to most of the violent acts that, if you judge our society by what Hollywood portrays, is a normal daily occurrence on our streets.<br /><br />The so-called \\"Wild West,\\" for example, depicted by Hollywood, with its stand-up quick-draw shoot-outs, is the product of the fevered imaginations of screenwriters and Eastern pulp fiction purveyors. If the truth were known, Eastern cities were far more violent than the Western villages of the nineteenth century.<br /><br />But, Stephen Hunter is not judgmental about such things. His appreciation for their product goes beyond such judgments. His criticism is of their craft, not their agenda. Perhaps that is as it should be.<br /><br />Despite the fact that his novels show evidence of a writer with encyclopedic knowledge of firearms, and it is evident that he is a shooter, which he himself confesses, his movie reviews show a different man: one who is sensitive to the feminist cause, and a sensitive portrayal of the \\"alternate life-style.\\" While his novels, particularly the Bob Lee Swagger series, are filled with violence, crude language, torture, and denigrating racial depictions, in Violent Screen another writer emerges: a thoughtful, careful thinker whose sensitivities are subtle and nuanced.<br /><br />There is no doubt that Stephen Hunter is a skilled writer, with an extraordinary vocabulary, and a wonderful ability to tell a story that holds you entranced. What this book shows me is that he is also a man I'd like to know.

This is another fine account of the codebreaking activities by the British and Americans prior to and during World War II. for those of us who lived during those years, it is more than \\"interesting.\\" It is vital information about how the United States was led into that war. Perhaps an even more interesting account is that written by Stinnett, in Day of Deceit. Both books, however, have the ring of truth to them, in that each incorporates much detail, extensive footnotes, detailing dates, times, places, names, ranks, and photographs of declassified documents verifying most of their statements.<br /><br />This book was written by a Brit, assisted by an Australian Navy codebreaker (Nave) who transferred to the Royal Navy in the same capacity after spending some years in Japan, learning Japanese. He was an early codebreaker, and responsible for many breakthroughs. Now, today, the British Navy would like to deny his existence, and indeed tried to, because of his knowledge of embarrassing facts.<br /><br />The thrust of the book is that Churchill was intent upon dragging America into the war by any means possible, including inducing Roosevelt to push the Japanese into attacking us, and, say the authors, he was successful in doing so--and then kept the day and hour of the attack, of which he was aware through breaking thier code, from the United States, thereby resulting in the loss of many lives, which could have been avoided had the commanders on the scene (General Short and Admiral Kimmel) been warned.<br /><br />Because the United States Navy's archives have been \\"cleansed\\" of all intercepts of the Japanese codes, specifically the naval code known as JN-25, it is difficult to prove guilty knowledge on the part of our top commanders, including Roosevelt himself. The authors of this book make the assumption that he was innocent of wrongdoing, and naive when pitted against the wily Churchill.<br /><br />After reading Stinnett's book, however, you will come away with a different viewpoint, and a different opinion of FDR.<br /><br />But, one must remember the stakes! Both men were faced with a world in flames, and a bleak outlook for their own nations, at best. Hitler and Mussolini dominated Europe, and the Japanese were well on the way to establishing their Greater East-Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere--a sphere devoid of the hated white race, and the domination by Europe of the Dutch East Indies, French Indochina, China, the Malay Peninsula, the Philippines, the Marianas, Borneo, and eventually Australia, New Zealand, and India.<br /><br />And the United States population resisted getting involved in \\"foreign wars;\\" the isolationist movement was strong.

Our just another book about Pearl Harbor?	This is a best-selling book, by a best-selling British author, concerning the destruction of the greatest concentration of Air power in the Pacific, under the command of General Douglas MacArthur, on the ground, in the Philipines, a full ten hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor, as well as some information on the politics surrounding the attack on Pearl Harbor.  A total failure on the part of MacArthur.<br /><br />Having just read Day of Deceit, by Robert Stinnett, with elaborate, detailed information demonstrating that Franklin Roosevelt indeed indubitably knew, in advance, of the Japanese plans to attack Pearl Harbor in an air strike on December 7th, 1941, and withheld that information from the commanders on the spot, Admiral Kimmel and Lt. General Short, both of whom FDR then demoted in disgrace, as \\"patsies,\\" for \\"dereliction of duty,\\" I am underwhelmed by Costello's book, Days of Infamy.  It does, however, bring out some facts  about General MacArthur's failures to adequately prepare his command for the impending  certain attack by the Japanese forces, to wit: instantly sending a bombing raid against the Japanese air bases on Formosa (Taiwan),  which his orders required of him,  or at the very least moving the B-17s in question out of harm's way--out of range of Japanese Formosa based bombers, by sending them further South, as he could have done.  Instead, he sat on his hands.<br /><br />With the exception of General MacArthur, the motivation for President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill's blunders are quite understandable:  Both men were faced with almost insurmountable dilemmas.  It was necessary for Churchill to drag America into the war with Germany, kicking and screaming if necessary.  It was a matter of survival for Great Britain, who was the lonely combatant for freedom left on the European continent.  For FDR, faced with isolationist fervor among his constituency, but foresighted enough to know the stakes involved, it was necessary to get a cause celebre to inflame the American people into a warlike mood.  The ploy succeeded, even though it involved chicanery, double dealing, lying to his people, and many American deaths at Pearl Harbor.<br /><br />Although the facts are seemingly ugly, and American and British icons reputations suffer as a result, Churchill and FDR peformed to the best of their abilities to save their nations.  MacArthur's motives and judgments are less justifiable and bear scrutiny less well.  For those who knew him best, MacArthur was a walking, talking egomaniac who made monumental blunders with little to recommend his decisions.<br /><br />I served under him in Japan during the Korean war, and observed him in his role as the defacto Emperor of Japan. Harry Truman had him pegged, accurately in my opinion.  He would have dome better on the stage than in a military career.<br /><br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre, USN (Ret)cause celebre to inflame the American people into a warlike mood.

Most Americans alive today will view this book as ancient history.  They were not alive then, and so what Franklin Roosevelt knew, did, and the devious measures he employed to drag the United States kicking and screaming into a foreign war, against its will, and despite his promises to avoid such an entanglement, will evoke mostly indifference, yawns, and \\"so what?\\"<br /><br />But, for those of us who were alive then and, even then, suspected the President's motives and his statements and assurances, this is a fascinating document.  And, for many of us, it vindicates our suspicions that President Roosevelt purposely pushed the Japanese into attacking us at Pearl Harbor in order to draw us into the war against the Axis powers, who then dominated the continent of Europe, including the Balkans, much of North Africa, and were threatening to overrun Asia.<br /><br />The majority of the American people were dead-set against being drawn into Europe's war, and were little concerned with the fate of China.  Our cities were not directly threatened. despite the fact that the Nazis had friends in Argentina, and if England fell, would no doubt end up with clout in Canada and Mexico, the former being, after all, part of the Commonwealth of the British Empire.<br /><br />The world was in flames, and Roosevelt knew that to get America off its collective duff and help put out the fire, it would be necessary to get in the war.<br /><br />So, he drove Japan over the brink with a bellicose policy that deprived them of oil, raw materials, and scrap iron, and sailed our submarines and cruisers into their home waters.  He denied them fishing rights in waters historically available to them.  He drove them to the edge, and then pushed them over it.<br /><br />This book, through documents formerly classified and now available through the Freedom of Information Act, six decades after the fact, irrefutably demonstrates that FDR knew, through access to broken Japanese codes and other sources, that the Japanese were going to strike us in a surprise attack at Pearl Harbor, knew their fleet was underway to do so, and denied the commanders on the scene, General Short and Admiral Kimmel, the intelligence resources to protect themselves.  Then, he fired them for their failure. He expected the attack.  It was part of his plan to achieve a Cause Celebre that would motivate the American people to get in the war.<br /><br />It took this author 17 years to document this book: to access all of the documents and interview the multi-thousands of people involved.  It represents no small effort, in the interest of historical truth.<br /><br />We lost much of our Pacific Fleet at Learl Harbor on December 7, 1941.  We lost upward of 2,500 American Lives.  The goal of the American President, achieved at such a high cost, was the motivation of the American people.  Monstrous?  Perhaps, but in his defense, one must remember the stakes.  Almost inevitably, without our active entry into the war, Britain would have fallen to Hitler.  China would have fallen to Japan, and a Greater East-Asia Co-Proserity Sphere would have resulted, allied with a Europe completely dominated by the Nazis, and allied with Japan and Italy.<br /><br />Already inroads were being made into South America, and the Nazis shortly would have dominated Canadian politics as well.<br /><br />We would have been a country isolated, and doomed.<br /><br />Those were the stakes.  So, perhaps Roosevelt does not look quite so much the monster, after all.

The Illuminati were, historically, a secret society of scientists, long considered defunct, who saw the Catholic Church as their arch-enemy.  They were sought out by the Church and, like many others, the attempt was made to exterminate them and their apostasy.  In defense, they affiliated and incorporated themselves into the Masons, and vowed revenge on the Church, also infiltrating the banking industry, government, education and other public institutions.<br /><br />This novel is about the Illuminati, resurfaced and taking their revenge on the Church for its past crimes against science.  In typical Dan Brown fashion, the story is carefully researched for historical accuracy, and is riveting and suspenseful.  Brown shows us, again, that he is a great and accomplished story-teller; a master weaver of tall tales who knows how to get our attention, as he also did in The Da Vinci Code.<br /><br />This story is no less of a thriller, although it probably will not raise as many hackles as did The Da Vinci Code, due to the, perhaps, somewhat less controversial subject matter.<br /><br />The tale again uses, as the protagonist, Dr. Robert Langdon, an academian and professor of religious symbology, in the role of a detective.  Also included are such arcame scientific matters as anti-matter and the rapprochement of religion and science--especially high-energy physics, in this age of quantum mechanics.<br /><br />A fascinating yarn, with enough plausibility to the science to make it a true page-turner.<br /><br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre, USN (Ret)<br /><br />author of The Road to Damascus: Our Journey Through Etermity<br /><br />and other books	2004-10-18

Besides Hunter's continuation of the Swagger family history, a plus in itself, it is also replete with historical and semi-historical material which brought back memories.  In one incident, Gunter sort of \\"took a shot\\" at Papa Hemingway--made him out to be a drunken boor--and maybe he was, but I loved Hemingway's writing, and thought better of him.  It reminded me a little of what Steinbeck did to the memory of Doc Ricketts, in Cannery Row and Sweet Thursday.  Ir made Steinbeck very unpopular with the people in the MOnterey area that I knew who knew and admired Ricketts.<br /><br />But, all this is really beside the point: if you are writing about that period in Cuba, and you leave out Castro and Trujillo, you may as well have written about Long Island.  He works them in nicely--especially Fidel.<br /><br />So, this is another great novel from the mind of Stephen Hunter.  It is well-written, as are they all, and entertaining, exciting, suspensefull, and makes you come back for more.<br /><br />Very good. even if he does knock the Navy from time to time.<br /><br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre, USN (Ret)	2004-10-13

The plotting is superb and complex, as is usual for Stephen Hunter.  Also as usual, the research effort shows in the final product.  One of Hunter's strong points is his encyclopedic knowledge of modern firearms and ballistics, all very accurate--unusual in a novelist, most of whom don't know the receiver of a rifle from the butt plate.<br /><br />Hunter is also wonderful at breathing life into his characters.  One female critic complained because his protagonist, Bob Lee Swagger, always comes out on top. But, how would SHE write the story?  Have the author kill his hero in the first chapter, thereby reducing a 600 page novel to a 50 page short story?<br /><br />Critics!<br /><br />This is a writer who knows how to tell an adventure story, keeping his audience in suspense all the way, and making a satisfactory ending.

One complains because the title refers to untraviolet light, while in this story they use infrared (I'd bet the author knew that, and that the handle 'black light' is interchangeable).  Then there is the guy from Pennsylvania who asserts that this is a true reflection of how horribly the white race treated the blacks in the South.  I lived in Florida as a youth, and in my opinion, \\"black hell\\" is the urban North, not in the rural South.<br /><br />None of this is what the book is about.  This is an exciting adventure thriller about the son of an Oklahoma highway patrolman, retired, who apprehended, shot and killed a \\"bad guy\\" who had terrorized Oklahoma and the Texas panhandle, after breaking out of the prison in McAlester with his cousin and another man.  That story was told in Dirty White Boys, another of Hunter's atories.  This book is a follow-up, although it stands alone and needn't be read in series.<br /><br />Bob Lee Swagger is the son of Earl Swagger, an Arkansas highway patrolman who was killed by two cousins on a crime rampage, and was himself killed in the ensuing gun battle.  But, there is a mystery as to who actually killed Earl Swagger, a congreesional medal of honor recipient.  Bob Lee Swagger, Earl's son, and Russ Pewtie, son of Oklahoma highway patrolman Bud Pewtie, set out to solve the mystery.<br /><br />If you like fast-moving action thrillers, with lots of suspense, good characterization, and excellent plotting and research, you will appreciate Stephen Hunter's books, and this is no exception.  He writes masterfully, which is why he is a top-selling author in his genre.  He knows firearms, and has an encylopedic knowledge of makes, models, ballistics, and accessories.  To boot, he telegraphs a conservative's viewpoint, which is an added attraction for me (liberals tend to be gun-haters, and seem to know very little about them--and it shows.)<br /><br />As to the critics  who complain that this is not Hunter's best, I am left begging the questions: Why?  What is missing?  The plotting is still excellent.  His vocabulary is not diminished.  The suspense is maintained throughout.  The story still holds you, as do his others. What is it that makes it any less than his other stories, if that is so?  I found it just as good.  I find him at the top of storytellers in his genre.  I'm always amazed at the fault-finders who pit a great novelist against himself, like a golfer who is in a slump.  There is no slump here.  I'll read as many of Stephen Hunter's books as I can get hold of, and enjopy them all equally.  The carping critics who attempt to show their great erudition by faulting genius should, perhaps, show us how it should be done with their own book, for comparison.<br /><br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre<br /><br />author of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenance<br /><br />and other bookslittle about them--and it shows.) <br /> <br />As to the critics  who complain that this is not Hunter's best, I am left begging the questions: Why?

It is the story of a vicious convict, Lamar Pye, incarcerated in McAlester Penitentiary, just outside of Oklahoma City, his mentally defective cousin, Odell, and an ineffectual individual named Richard, whom they include in their prison break and the ensuing violent terrorization of the area in their two-state crime spree.<br /><br />The book is very well-written, and will hold you in its grip until you finish the last page.  Guaranteed.<br /><br />This is not the first Stephen Hunter novel I've been caught up in.  He often uses characters from his earlier novels in his later ones, for example Bob Lee Swagger.  I note that that particular surname, Swagger, is the name of one of Hunter's friends and resources.  What that has to do with anything, I don't know.<br /><br />Hunter obviously knows a great deal about much of his subject matter, which is probably one reason why he writes with such authority.  He certainly writes knowledgeably about firearms.<br /><br />After twenty years of experience working in Oregon prisons, however, I can only say that, if his description of Oklahoma's system is remotely accurate, it must be one of the most poorly run systems in the country.  I suspect that, rather than that, it is due to the author's overactive imagination.  Such violence and lack of control over the inmate population certainly would not be tolerated in Oregon's system.<br /><br />However, this should not be construed as a criticism of Mr. Hunter's writing.  This is, after all, a work of fiction, and generally the research is excellent.<br /><br />The language used, and the graphic descriptions of violence the book despicts makes it unsuitable reading for immature, sqeamish or sensitive minds. In fact, in prison I forbade the convicts under my supervision to use some of the words and phrases used in this book.  But, if you are inured to coarse, gutter language, it gets the point across.

The author of this book, Hugh Hewitt, says of himself that his syndicated radio show is \\"heard from Hawaii to Massachusetts, and from Florida to Washington.\\"  To my knowledge, I've never heard of him nor have I heard him on the radio.  Yet, he writes a good book, and has pretty well analyzed the various elements of the Republican and Democrat parties.<br /><br />Hewitt is a cheer leader for the conservatives, and views the Democrats--especially the left-wing of the party, including John Kerry--as unqualified to be in charge of the security of the United States.  His comparisons between George Bush and Kerry, especially on security, are telling, incisive, and right on the money, using their own actions and words.<br /><br />The weakness of the book, as far as I am concerned, is its advice on HOW to \\"crush the Democrats in every election.\\"  He makes the necessity quite clear, but how do you keep the election from being \\"close\\" when the numbers of those who vote on each side are so close.  It's not only the \\"Bush haters\\" who would vote for Adolf Hitler if they thought he could beat Bush; it's the ardent Democrats who vote the party no matter who the nominee is. And then there are the one issue voters, dedicated to their cause, and who have found a home in the Democrat party: the pro-abortionists, animal rights activists, rabid environmentalists, ultra-feminists, pro gun-control fanatics, anti-religionists, \\"alternate life-style\\" types like the North American Man Boy Love Association members, Greenpeace, Sierra Club, \\"Save the Whales\\", PETA, \\"Act Up\\",  and other such groups.<br /><br />They may not agree on everything, but they stick together and, together, they make up the majority of the Democrat party.<br /><br />Hewitt DOES have some advice:  Write letters to the editor, call radio talk shows, use web sites, etc.  Make your voice heard.  Nothing new there, I'm afraid.  Advocacy is a given, in a cause you believe in.  But, the other side does that as well.<br /><br />Briefly, this is a good book, in that Hewitt makes a good case but, I'm afraid it will still be close when the GOP is pitted against the Granola party.

Brant Bozell, that he allies himself with the \\"right tilting\\" Bernard Goldberg, author of Bias: A CBS Insider Exposes How the Media Distort the News, a New York Times bestseller.<br /><br />The claim would be true, except for one small detail: Goldberg says, in his own book, that he has never voted for a Republican in his life.<br /><br />Bozell says, in this book, that he is not a registered Republican, either, although his uncle is William F. Buckley, Jr., the founder of National Review magazine, often referred to as \\"Mr. Conservative.\\"  So there is little doubt where Bozell's sympathies lie.<br /><br />Brent Bozell is the founder of the Media Research Center.  That organization has published several books, and is the largest media watchdog organization.  This is the first book by Mr. Bozell, himself, however.  He is often a guest on television talk shows: the kind where the guests try to shout each other down.  He is a well-known critic of the media's left-wing bias and tendency to propaganda.<br /><br />This book mirrors, and reinforces, Goldberg's book, with its accusations of bias in media.  Weapons of Mass Distortion details case after case, quotes from examples of highly partisan distortions of the news, and instances of several of televisions news anchors and reporters demonstrating their blatant bias.<br /><br />It covers the disparate treatment of George Bush vs. Al Gore, the pandering to Bill and Hillary Clinton compared to the hostile interviews and the vicious attacks on both presidents Bush and their policies, the National Rifle Association, the pro-life people, Rush Limbaugh, Newt Gingrich and others with whom the radical left disagrees, as opposed to the near sainthood attached to the pro-abortionists, radical environmentalists, people who adhere to an \\"alternate life-style,\\" animal rights activists, Greenpeace, the Sierra Club, Earth First!, the feminist movement,  and all of their other allies.<br /><br />Altogether, this is a book that will receive plaudits from conservatives and, no doubt, jeers from the left.<br /><br />As a conservative, I found it interesting.  After a lifetime (75 years) of watching American politics--and especially the media's treatment of political and cultural issues--during the last five decades, particularly, and observing the drift further and further into socialism, with virtually all of our former values getting trampled and turned on their heads, I have noted both the bias reported here and its result, as the people are brainwashed.<br /><br />This book is needed and informative.

We are given graphic examples of how the power inherent in the presidency changes the men who occupy the White House--example: tying up international air traffic for an hour while the President gets a $500 haircut from a Hollywood barber on the runway at Los Angeles International Airport, knowing full well that while Air Force One is on the runway no one else can take off or land.  Talk about insensitive arrogance!<br /><br />Kessler, a Washington Post reporter with fourteen non-fiction books to his credit, and a New York Times best selling author, uses all of his sources, including interviews with well-known people in and out of this and other administrations, to elicit telling anecdotes and observations that expose the characters of this and other, former presidents.  The obvious comparisons are telling.<br /><br />The Clintons were prone to screaming obscene insults to each other in private, while projecting the image of a loving couple in public; Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon are depicted as paranoid egomaniacs; Jimmy Carter as aloof, ignoring his servants; both presidents Bush and Ronald Reagan as sensitive to others, thanking them for their services, calling them by name, and maintaining friendly relationships.<br /><br />The Clinton White House is described as being disorganized, with staff running around in dirty blue jeans and t-shirts, and littered with discarded pizza cartons and fast food wrappers, and staff meetings ending without resolution of any issues.  By contrast, the Bushes and Reagans conducted business in more dignified surroundings, the staff more appropriately dressed, and the presidents in a leadership role, seeking and getting the information they need to make decisions--not as a result of polls, but based on what they see as the best interest of the country.<br /><br />Many, many examples are given to give a clear picture of each personality discussed.  I've gotten the same impression from other authors writing about the same personalities.  When you hear people described similarly by several respected sources, the adage, \\"Where there's smoke, there's fire,\\" comes to mind.<br /><br />As a consequence, I have developed an image of the Bushes and Ronald Reagan as decent men, with high moral character and the best interest of their country at heart.  Lyndon Johnson has left a lasting impression on me as a manipulator of people, somewhat of a megalomaniac who threw his power around, but also always mindful of the best interests of his nation, and battling the long-haired, tie-dyed, pot-smokers-against-the-war.  Richard Nixon I see as somewhat of a paranoid personality, and Jimmy Carter I've respected as well-meaning but ineffective as a president. I think his heart was in the right place.  Clinton, I have no respect for whatever; I don't think he had any interest but his own at heart.  He's the only president, Democrat or Republican, I've ever thought did not hold his country's best interest primary.  I often wonder how close to reality we are in judging our leaders.  We could go back all the way to Herbert Hoover, but there's not much point.<br /><br />In any case, the critic who referred to this as a \\"wretched\\" book, I think was guilty of a strictly partisan reaction.  I think it is a fine book, edifying and a valuable look at George W. Bush as well as a frank, if brief, appraisal of several other former presidents.  Was it \\"too kind\\" to Bush?

Of course, Portland is Oregon's bastion of liberalism, and is heavily Democrat.  Had they been able, they would have created another tragedy reminiscent of November, 1963.<br /><br />They embarrass the rest of the state.  I remember that evening.  One bearded young man was caught on television cavorting nude in downtown Portland, in the middle of Burnside street.  The crowd was so rowdy that you took your life in your hands trying to drive through Portland.  No wonder the former President Bush (the forty-first president) referred to the city as \\"Little Beirut.\\")  Not, I think, an exaggeration.<br /><br />This is a good look at our forty-third president, a decent God-fearing man, and the problems he faces battling terrorism, the Bush haters, and (least of all) John Kerry.  Written by Bill Sammon, a Washington Times White House correspondent, it is eloquent and, in an election year, an incisive portrait of our president.  George Bush has a sense of humor, often self-deprecatory, is humble and thoughtful, and has restored a sense of dignity to the White House.  No longer is that hallowed home of presidents trashed with pizza cartons and the Oval Office subject to midnight tours by girlfriends of young staffers.  No longer are the president's aides allowed to dress in blue jeans and scruffy T-shirts, like college kids on a binge.  George Bush has respect for the White House, and honors it.  The American people can be assured that it is well organized, and that they can expect dignity from its occupants as they conduct our national business, as befits this great nation.<br /><br />The President remarked recently that he has been accused of swaggering; then, with a grin, he said, \\"In Texas, we call it walking.\\"  A good, moral man, who is doing his best for his country.

Almost as many as the real-life Sergeant Carlos Hathcock, who had 93 confirmed kills.  Both men used a Remington model 700 bolt-action rifle.<br /><br />Sergeant Swagger was severely wounded, and his spotter killed, by an enemy sniper.  His wounds resulted in his disability retirement, and eventual permanent retirement from the Marine Corps.  The bad guys in this book, working on contract for a central American regime, seek to assassinate an influential cleric whose politics are antithetical to their own, when the President of the United States is due to honor him with a decoration in New Orleans.<br /><br />Swagger is not aware of the actual plot, and when they tell him that the president is the subject of an assassination attempt, and want him to tell them where the assassin is most likely to strike, pretending to be CIA, he goes along.  Little does he know that he is being set up to be the \\"fall guy,\\" and that the president is not the real target.<br /><br />This is a well-plotted thriller, and it will keep you reading until you've finished the book.  The suspense is maintained, and there is enough accurate detail about firearms, ballistics, and technical details to make it all highly believable.  I have ordered another of Stephen Hunter's titles.  If he does as well with the next as he did with this one, I'm hooked.<br /><br />To make the story even more interesting, for me, Swagger, in the story, has a pre-'64 Winchester model 70 (\\"the rifleman's rifle\\") in .300 Holland & Holland (H&H) magnum caliber.  I have one of the same rifles, in the same caliber, and it, too, will shoot sub-minute-of-angle.<br /><br />This is a good book, written by one who has researched his subject.<br /><br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre<br /><br />author of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenance<br /><br />and other books	2004-08-31

His real problem is the decline in the birth rates of all of the Westernized nations; the civilized nations of Europe, and our original forbears in this country, the founders of this nation.<br /><br />Our birthrate, says Buchanan, has dropped to the point that we are no longer sustaining ourselves.  We are declining at such a rapid rate that by mid-century, we will be a minority population in our own countries.  In Europe the only nation that shows a sustainable population birth growth rate is the Islamic country of Albania.  The rest of us maintain our population growth only through immigration.<br /><br />Buchanan points to several reasons for the phenomenon: the rise of feminism and the resulting decline in the institution of marriage, the birthrate and the nuclear family, in favor of the \\"whatever feels good\\" motivation that followed the Second World War, the lack (or change) in sexual morality, the rise in humanism at the expense of Christianity, the pill, the Playboy philosophy, widespread abortion, birth control, and the tendency for women to work outside the home rather than bear and raise children, with the concomitant destruction due to all the above factors of that most important unit, the family, which radical feminists proclain it is their intention to destroy as an institution.<br /><br />Virtually every page of this book is filled with quotable self-evident material that will keep you nodding in agreement.  This is the first of Pat Buchanan's books that I have read.  I Failed to realize how much in agreement with him that I am.<br /><br />In my own life, which stretches over 75 years so far, I have personally witnessed (and abhorred) the societal changes that he talks about: the blurred moral distinctions which were once so universally clear and accepted, and are now equally universally knocked into a cocked hat by a younger generation that apparently is convinced that everything preceding generations lived by and valued is wrong and must be changed.  They are so sure that we were wrong and they are right.  They look askanse at marriage, and favor promiscuity for men and women alike, but not procreation; multiculturism, which is divisive,  but not the melting pot, which is unifying. Where once they were nationalistic, and would fight to defend their country, now they escape to Canada to avoid any self-sacrifice, and to justify their \\"peacefulness,\\" (and also to ensure that no harm comes to them) they refuse service to their country in time of war.  \\"Make love, not war,\\" is their creed.  They would happily turn over control of their lives to the United Nations--an unelected, uncontrolled body that has often demonstrated its uselessness and dislike, if not hatred, for the United States.<br /><br />I recommend a thoughtful reading of this book.  It is not another doomsday prophecy.  The predictions he makes are already in motion.  The trend is here.  India, China, Africa, all of the \\"third world,\\" is in the process of overtaking us.  The inventive, productive, civilizing Caucasians are a dying breed.  The undeveloped nations are in the process of burying us, and there seems to be little prospect of stopping the trend.

Our place at the table is being usurped by less qualified cultures which we are enthusiastically encouraged to support, and our decline and eventual demise is because of our own hedonism.

It seems that Kerry supporters have bought them all up to keep them away from the public eye, with their cover picture simulating the raising of the American flag over Iwo Jima, by a bunch of ragamuffins in the 'Vietnam Veterans Against the War'--the flag depicted upside down--(the international symbol of distress: in effect spitting on those brave men's graves, who gave so much for their country.<br /><br />\\"John Kerry first realized what a liability The New Soldier could be when he lost his first election...running for Congress.<br /><br />From 1972 on, Kerry attempted to recast his protester days to deny that the triumph of the Communists in Vietnam was ever his goal.

Men who also were awarded decorations for gallantry, and for wounds received in action.<br /><br />Many of these men state, in direct quotes, that Senator Kerry did not receive any wounds as result of hostile action, and in fact his were self-inflicted, mere scratches, requiring only band aids and no hospitalization.  That, in fact he, himself, put in for the purple hearts and the awards for gallantry, and that his reports were fabricated.<br /><br />If all of this is true, then the men who are quoted were correct, such a man certainly does not deserve to be our president, I would think.<br /><br />There are other statements: that in Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon) in a museum formerly called the War Crimes Museum, a photograph of the Senator hangs in a place of honor as one who helped the communists to win the war against the United States.  He is shown with the former General Secretary of the Communist Party.  (The photo is in the book) In a similar museum, For their women 'heroines', is a picture of Jane Fonda, smiling, with Madame Binh at her side.  It is stated that our POWs were tortured, and many died, because they refused to verify Senator Kerry's and Fonda's statements accusing our men of atrocities.<br /><br />Senator Kerry is also accused of an unauthorized meeting with the communists in Paris, while Americans were still fighting and dying in Vietnam, which, if known at the time, could have landed him in prison for giving aid and comfort to the enemy--a treasonous act.<br /><br />There are many more disturbing statements which portray the Senator in a very unfavorable light, suggesting cowardice, betrayal of his comrades by making false accusations in testimony to the Congress of atrocities on a daily basis by his fellow officers and men in Vietnam--accusations which are fiercely denied, and when in debate with the man who replaced him in command of his swift boat on the Dick Cavett show, he could not name a single atrocity that he had witnessed.<br /><br />But, in the final analysis, you are the jury.  You must decide, after reading this book, who is telling the truth--Senator Kerry, or the hundreds of men quoted and named here who served with him, in the same outfits, giving their own testimony as to what happened as they remember it.  I admit my prejudice.  I believe the testimony of these men.  But you must judge for yourself.<br /><br />I have served with such men, and I know how they react to disloyalty, cowardice, and unfaithfulness.

He went to prison for a year-and-a-half, lost his pension, after 30 years of faithful service, and as a result he feels revengeful.  Now, they need him again for a special job: a Russian agent, a beautiful young girl, has stolen a top military secret, including a device for electronic warfare and a computer disk, and the very man who set Charlie up before is begging his assistance in retrieving the stolen materials and capturing the enemy agent, with the clear implication that she will die under their interrogation..<br /><br />Charlie has his opportunity to even the score and get his good name back.<br /><br />This is a very suspenseful novel.

Amazon will not let me review it yet, because it will not be released until tomorrow, but let me tell you, it is a thriller that will hold you spellbound, as will this one: Vertical Run, his second book.

I predict that this author is destined to be our next leading writer in this genre.  He writes like a man who has 'been there,' and the details of the 'spook trade' are utterly convincing as he describes it.<br /><br />But, don't let it fool you.  Because a man writes like an ex-Green Beret does not mean he has been one.  The late R. Wright Campbell wrote a book called The Spy Who Sat and Waited, with the story set in the Orkneys.  His description of the islands and the people was so poetic and convincing, I asked him how long he'd spent there.  He answered me that he'd never been there.  He learned all he knew about the area from the encyclopedia.  Bobbie Campbell was, simply put, a born stroyteller: a troubador.  Perhaps the same is true of Joseph Garber.

Brimelow examines the inherent threat and danger to our American society and culture brought about by our current governmental immigration policies. He points out that currently we have between four and five million illegal aliens in the United States, and another one-an-a-half million legal immigrants. Moreover, many of them find it painful to assimilate into our society, sometimes because of racial or religious antagonisms, i.e.: radical Muslims, or people of color like Colin Ferguson, who killed several people on a train in New York because he hated whites.<br /><br />Brimelow also points out, accurately, that our origins (except for the native aborigines) were white Europeans, and most of them, like him, of British derivation and protestant Christian faith.<br /><br />Further, Mr. Brimelow notes, that the vast majority of native-born Americans are not in favor of the great wave of immigrants that currently inundate us, and that are changing the entire face of our population. But, they have little voice in the matter: the decisions are being made at the political level, quietly. Illegals are being granted amnesty and granted citizenship without demonstrating fluency in English, and increasing numbers are 'language isolated,' with no one in the household speaking English, formerly a requirement for citizenship. Huge numbers of illegals near our southern border come her solely to give birth, so that their children will become citizens and eligible for welfare and free medical care.<br /><br />Brimelow also assesses the cost to our school system, faced with millions of kids who are not sufficiently skilled in English, and so burden the system with extra cost, since they still must be educated--in their own language.<br /><br />In short, our sieve-like borders and our political immigration policies--often liberalized solely to attract more voters of the political flavor sought by the politicians, are swamping us. Historically, for example, Hispanics can be counted on to vote Democrat, and so Democrat lawmakers smile at relaxed immigration.<br /><br />How does it impact us, individually? I can recall, during the Second World War and the Korean 'Police Action,' when the people on the streets of this nation--no matter where you went--spoke, virtually exclusively, the English language, and looked and dressed similarly. We had a national identity. Now, we have a polyglot population. In stores we are assailed by a babble of Spanish, Vietnamese, and other languages too many to number.<br /><br />Instead of a 'melting pot,' a unifying goal to establish a national identity, the unspoken but assumed goal of everyone was to assimilate into our national identity. Today we are being bombarded with the propaganda of 'multi-culturism,' as if that were a desirable thing, but rather than unifying, it is divisive. It breaks us into groups who are often at odds: blacks, Hispanics, Koreans, Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese, Women, Catholics, protestants, etc. It is as if there was a conscious effort being made to divide us, so that we then could be more easily conquered, piecemeal.<br /><br />And our population is growing by leaps and bounds, creating overcrowding in our cities, and contributing to crime and unrest; not as a result of natural factors like childbirth surpassing the death rate, but as a result of the influx of immigrants--both legal and illegal.<br /><br />We are being swamped, and without the consent of the citizens and residents of this land of abundance, but rather by elected politicians and unelected bureaucrats who need to turn off the spigot, and stop the flood, instead od using it to further their own political agenda.<br /><br />'Take back our country' has another meaning than the sophomoric chant of the political flacks in an election year. We need to stop the alien horde, and keep it from destroying our national character.<br /><br />We can still take strangers into our borders, but selectively, judging whether they will be an asset to us, and can reasonably be expected to support themselves, and looking at their backgrounds, individually. Brimelow thinks we must. So do I.<br /><br />Joseph (Joe) Pierrein an election year.

We must believe that God loves men of good will, but there is no evidence to show that he will save fools from the results of their folly.'<br />--Somerset Maugham, Then as Now, 1948<br /><br />'I may not have been the greatest president, but I've had the most fun for eight years.'<br />--President Bill Clinton<br /><br />Lt. Col. Robert 'Buzz' Patterson, USAF (Ret) was the senior ranking military man in the Clinton White House.  He carried the 'nuclear football' (launch codes for nuclear weapons) for the president.  He has seen the white house in operation, and is intimately familiar with its operation.<br /><br />On September 11, 2001, he was a pilot captain for Delta Airlines, on his way to his plane when the World Trade Center was struck, and saw it hit on television, like the rest of us.<br /><br />His tours of duty include Grenada, Rwanda, Haiti, the Persian Gulf, and Bosnia.  He is also the author of the New York Times bestseller, Dereliction of Duty, and is the national security correspondent for Human Events.  He is well-informed and articulate. If he is also opinionated that is probably understandable.  At least he has a foundation in experience and knowledge for his opinions.<br /><br />This book is polemical.  There is little pretense of neutrality.  Col. Patterson is disdainful of liberal Democrats, and in fact makes no bones about it: he sees them as habitually giving aid and comfort to America's enemies, time after time, in all of our struggles as a nation since at least the 'Cold War.'<br /><br />If your view is the antipode, you would do well to forego buying this book and give it a pass.  It is replete with examples of instances of liberal Democrat icons working with our country's enemies:<br /><br />'But how many of them know about Ted Kennedy's active collaboration with the KGB, the Soviet intelligence apparatus?  No, this is not the stuff of conspiracy theory.  It was revealed during the 1990s with the opening of the Soviet archives after the collapse of the Russian Communist dictatorship, and by files brought to U.S. Intelligence services by courageous Soviet defectors.'--page 10.  Just one of scores of examples in the book, naming names, places and dates; quoting Congressmen and Senators engaged in activities that gave aid and comfort to the enemy for their own political aggrandizement, and purposefully betraying their own country.<br /><br />In short, Colonel Patterson plainly states that the party of Carter-Clinton-Kerry cannot be trusted with our national security.  That it has demonstrated time and time again that it is clearly untrustworthy in such matters, and that it is the party of 'Blame America First.'<br /><br />Whether he is right or wrong, I leave up to you to decide after reading his book--or, more than likely--you have already made up your mind and will either accept or reject his book out-of-hand.  So be it.<br /><br />As for me, having read it, I am once again amazed that so many otherwise good Americans continue to elect such people, and support with their money the media personalities who espouse the same bilge, and listen to the organizations who support their propaganda.<br /><br />Whatever the fate of our country, we have no one to blame but ourselves.

David Hardy and Jason Clarke are not members of the Michael Moore Fan Club.  That much is obvious, when you read their book, 'Michael Moore Is A Big Fat Stupid White Man.'  The title, of course, is a take off on Al Franken's ad hominem attack on Rush Limbaugh.<br /><br />I don't like Moore, and have not seen any of his efforts at film making because I don't wish to contribute to his coffers.  Therefore, I have not written reviews on Bowling for Columbine, Fahrenheit 9/11, or Roger and Me.<br /><br />According to these authors, Moore's 'research' on Roger and Me (speaking of the President of General Motors) was based upon his employment there for one day.  In his resume, detailed in the book, his efforts to hold jobs working with people was always a dismal failure.  Usually because he couldn't get along, was arrogant (believable) and wouldn't come to work on time.  He was fired from jobs at Mother Jones (a leftist magazine based in California), with Ralph Nader (not exactly a conservative!), NBC, Fox Studios, Salon magazine, you name it. He sued  Mother Jones for a couple of million, settled for $58,000, and used that for seed money to make Roger & Me.<br /><br />Hardy and Clarke paint a picture of Moore as a paranoid personality who cannot abide criticism, and whose 'documentaries' are, to put it mildly, less than accurate.<br /><br />I can believe it.  In Portland, Oregon, a young lady was on the local news the other night commenting about some footage Moore used in Fahrenheit 9/11 showing her brother's gravesite (he was killed in Iraq), including family members at the ceremony, to vilify President Bush as responsible for the Iraq War.  She said that her brother would have turned over in his grave.  The depiction was exactlt the opposite of his feelings about the war.<br /><br />I've heard similar comments about Bowling for Columbine--that he has utter disregard for truth, and is only interested in pushing his agenda--whatever that may be.<br /><br />According to the book, his favorite target is 'the rich,' but he is rich himself!  He claims to be from Flint, Michigan, a hard scrabble city of blue collar working people, but he was actually born and raised in a well-to-do suburb, Davison, of wealthy people.  He owns two multi-million dollar homes, one in Manhattan, and is hardly representative of the 'poor.'<br /><br />Like many leftists who champion the poor--Senator Teddy Kennedy, John Kerry, many wealthy Hollywood actors--the people with whom he pretends to identify would like to earn in a year what he throws away in a day.  Hypocrisy is the name of the game.<br /><br />This book will give you a hard look at Michael Moore.  It is polemical, but as I said before, the authors like him as little as I do, if that's possible.<br /><br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre, USN (Ret)According to the book, his favorite target is 'the rich,' but he is rich himself!

The NEA, he says, has been taken over by the 'Michigan Mafia' (a group of bigshots from Michigan) who turned it into a labor union which, despite laws forbiding teacher strikes, manage to strike anyway, and is more interested in teacher pay and benefits and less interested in the instruction of their charges (our children).<br /><br />Brimelow has carefully researched his subject, and lays out case after case demonstrating that teachers are often unqualified for their jobs. and that the ratio of teachers to students is better than it has ever been despite their constant cries of the opposite situation.  The education establishment in the United States, which now boasts a federal department rather than the community owned and run schools which was the case for our entire history, until a single generation ago, has one of the highest costs per pupil of any developed nation, and one of the most abyssmal resulting records, when the results are compared to all other civilized Western nations.<br /><br />But, until the middle of the twentieth century our country could honestly boast of the best educational systems on earth, judging by results.<br /><br />Brimelow lays the blame squarely at the feet of the two largest teachers' unions: the NEA and the American Federation of Teachers.  And, says they want to merge, in which case they would be a monopoly.  Government schools setting the standards, and a monopoly of teachers dictating their own reward system--much like the Congress of the United States.<br /><br />His cure? Two dozen recommendations (read the text for the details--they make sense.) First, bust the teachers' trust: the monopoly, which, like any monopoly, vuolates federal law.  2) Reform public sector public bargaining statutes. 3) Pass state and federal Right-to-Work laws, reducing unions' power. 4) Pass 'Paycheck Protection', protecting workers from being forced by the unions to finance political policies or candidates not of their choosing (yes, that is the case in many states).  5) Give teeth to the anti-strike laws. 6) Support independent teachers' associations and unions. 7) Apply private sector type restrictions to union encroachment on management. 8) End 'Unfunded Mandates'. 9) End bargained taxpayer subsidies to the teacher trust. 10) Provide alternative services, benefits, and discounts to teachers.  11) End teacher tenure.  12) Allow merit pay.  13)Two, three, many school choice initiatives.  14) Explore tax credits, tax deductibility of education costs.  15) Liberate the GED. 16) Hands off teacher training and accreditation. 17) Institute alternative teacher certification. 18) Liberate charter schools. 19) Break up the large school districts.  20)Privatize school services. 21) Promote union democracy. 22) Empower parents through choice. 23) Empower teachers through true professionalism, or, give teachers a stake. 24) Abolish the U.S. Department of Education.<br /><br />I thought he would never get to that last item!  Bring the schools back to the local control they enjoyed for a couple hundred years, during which time we had an education system that was the envy of the world.  Our high school graduates could read their diplomas!  Our 8th graders could spell!  Our scholars could compete with the English, French, Germans, Swedes--unlike today!  Stop throwing money at the problem.<br /><br />Case in point: my grand-daughter submitted a high school English paper, in which she used the phrase 'could have,'  Her high-school English teacher corrected the paper to read, 'could of.'<br /><br />Our children, instead of using 'I said' in speech, use phrases like, 'I go,' 'I went,' I'm like' -- and so do their teachers.  What can we expect?  The schools buy tests prepared by large corporations like McGraw-Hill, the teachers hand them out, they are answered on multiple choice answer sheets, which are then returned for machine scoring.  Lectures are purchased and given by video.  Classroom materials are delivered, taken and scored by computers.

He was an actor--and a successful one--elected by his peers to represent them as their president in the screen actors guild, Governor of the State of California which, if it were a nation would be the sixth largest in the world, and was elected by his countrymen twice to be President of the United States during a period when it faced its most dangerous adversary perhaps in its history, but certainly since the Second World War: the communist dominated Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.<br /><br /> Since the end of World War II, every president of the United States in turn was faced with the Soviet effort to destroy us and our free enterprise way of life, both from the inside and out. Only Ronald Reagan was successful in freeing us from that threat. Attempts were made by various earlier administrations to befriend them, to appease them, to achieve detent, to contain the threat of the Soviets in their attempt to achieve hegemony over the entire globe, one piece of real estate at a time, by force whenever necessary. There was no secret to it. They proclaimed their goal while pounding their shoe on the desk.<br /><br /> Ronald Reagan called them 'the Evil Empire,' to the dismay of his faint-hearted detractors, who were afraid of antagonizing them. He insisted that the only way to defeat them--which he proclaimed as HIS goal--was through strength.<br /><br /> We have long named George Washington and Abraham Lincoln among the small handful of men we call 'our greatest presidents.' There can be little doubt that Ronald Reagan is now among that honored group.<br /><br /> Not that he didn't have detractors: throughout his presidency he was vilified by his opposition, much as was Lincoln in his time. Many people alive today who are ardent political partisans of the more liberal variety and believe that socialism is preferable to free unfettered enterprise, do not want even to hear Ronald Reagan's name mentioned. It is anathema to them. For, he was one of the men who truly believed that less government, rather than more, is better for free men. That paternalistic rule, while necessary for children, is not appropriate for free men in a free society.<br /><br /> So, this is the Ronald Reagan described here by Jim Kuhn, who worked closely with Reagan for thirteen years, and saw him as a  private, but still dedicated, man. Here is what he says: '-he was bigger than life as the president of the United States. He looked, spoke and breathed the part. But when you were alone with him, he was the nicest, most regular guy in the world.' Intelligent, focused, unswerving, dedicated, and true to his wife and family, his country, and his ideals. Look back. How many presidents have we had that have failed utterly to fill that description in the recent past?<br /><br /> Some say that honor and integrity are not important, as long as a man 'does his job.' Ronald Reagan grew up in a world where it was more, not less, important. Where the means was important, as well as the end.<br /><br /> I suggest you buy this book, and read it, and get to know the man a little better. Although he has passed from us, his legacy is that the world has gained immensely from his having been in it.<br /><br /> Joseph (Joe) Pierre, USN (Ret)unfettered enterprise, do not want even to hear Ronald Reagan's name mentioned.

The author, Dr. Westermeyer, lives in Southern California.<br /><br />Depression is one of the most devastating mental problems facing our population.  Two of my brothers died because of it, through depression induced suicide.  It is not uncommon in families, many of whom, like mine, are genetically disposed to bi-polarism (which used to be called 'manic depression.')<br /><br />We are not talking here about simply 'feeling down' because of some external event, which will go away when the environment changes, but depression.  Clinical depression.<br /><br />I am not so afflicted, but it has impacted me, and I understand how serious it can be.  You are not going to talk the afflicted out of it.  But there is more than one reason for depression, just as there are multiple clinical approaches to it.  It is often addressed today, by licensed, trained professionals like this author, chemically, among other approaches.  There are drugs today to uplift the spirits and quell the disease, for it can be the result of disease.  It can be a neurosis, or it can be a psychosis.<br /><br />But, understanding helps, and self-help books, like this one, written by people who know what they are talking about, can be very useful, not only for the depressed person, but for the resource people around them who might aim them at the help they so desperately need.  It is important, though, if you have recurrent, serious depression, however, to seek medical treatment as soon as possible.<br /><br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre	2004-07-27

In those days, the were called 'Emigrants,' as opposed to 'immigrants.' The former refers to those who are leaving, the latter to those who are arriving.  There is a nice difference.<br /><br />'The Oregon Trail tested the spirit of every pioneer,' says the back cover, and indeed it did.  My grandmother, whom I lived to know very well, came to Oregon on the Trail, from Kansas, and wrote a book about her journey (she was eight on the trip) in 'Wagon Wheels A-Rollin', also available on Amazon. It was autobiographical.  The challenges were huge, and the dangers great, as the graves that litter the side of the trail (some markers still visible today) attest.<br /><br />This tale, which is fiction, is the first published fiction by this writer, Dennis Archambault.  The publisher is new to me--Danc-N-Life, of Calabasas, California.  The paperback cover and binding are unimpressive, and in appearance the book is much  like the output of many other very small publishers--inexpensive, but like Marty Robbins' advice in his song, The Cowboy in the Continental Suit, 'The moral of this story is don't judge by what they wear, underneath those ragged clothes  could be a millionaire.'<br /><br />This is a good story, well sritten.  It could use some polish, mainly in the typeset and the way the text is handled--publisher's problems, but it reads easily.  You could do a lot worse, and it is the author's first effort.

I have just finished this one as well.  I recommend it to you.<br /><br />They should have listened: the rest of the country did.  In fact, Mr Goldberg found credibility with his audience, judging from sales of the book.  He was saying things that people already believed, like Rush Limbaugh when he first started, that the people knew already and were simply waiting for someone to say out loud.  Things that were obvious, and everyone wondered at the denials and pretense of objectivity that accompanied the lies and propaganda we were being fed on a daily basis by the lockstep media who seemed to find it necessary to blame America first, and do everything possible to build up socialism and destroy our conservative valuie system.  They've accomplished quite a bit of their agenda, too.  They have persuaded many; especially the airheads in Hollywood.<br /><br />Finally, we were hearing voices in the wilderness &quot;telling it like it is,&quot; and the liberals hated it, judging by their screams of rage.  The current effort, for example, is to get Limbaugh taken off Armed Forces radio, where he is heard only because our servicemen requested him in such numbers in a write-in campaign that even the Clinton administration was forced to give him a voice, despite their hatred of him.<br /><br />After all, the first amendment guarantees free speech--especially political speech--which forbids government censorship in our free society.  It also guiarantees our right to keep and bear arms. Hah!  The Constitution that protects our Bill of Rights, and that all members of the Congress must swear to protect and defend is undefended.  They have forsworn themselves, and deny us our freedoms with every word they utter.<br /><br />Bernie Goldberg spent decades as a TV reporter.  He is widely respected, especially now that he has brought our attention to the fact that the emperor is naked.<br /><br />This book, a follow-up on Bias, is full of facts, names, places, inside anecdotes, and a glimpse of the real world of television newsrooms--where the &quot;objectivity&quot; of Dan Rather and the rest of the &quot;talking heads&quot; on the major networks, the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Boston Globe, Washington Post and the other &quot;elite&quot; media is demonstrably phony.<br /><br />No wonder the American people have lost their confidence in the main sources of most of our &quot;news&quot;.  We have gotten wise to them.  We have other, alternative sources.  Like China about the time of the Tiananmen Square incident in Beijing, we get the news through fax machines and the internet, if nothing else.  We are no longer fed their propaganda.  They are losing their audience, while that of the Fox Network, Washington Times, and magazines like National Review are gaining a stronger voice.<br /><br />This is a good book, by a veteran newsman who has been sickened by what he saw, and in telling his story has incurred the wrath of his erstwhile colleagues--evcen their hatred.  They see him as a traitor.  Some privately have told him that he's right, but that they can't agree publicly.<br /><br />You don't believe me?  Read the book.  You probably won't believe him, either, if you consider yourself a political liberal, or of you hate the President, or think your country is a &quot;bully&quot; and has brought all of the terrorism on ourselves, as many have said.

According to the hypothesis a small companion star to the earth, like a binary, but smaller and more distant (perhaps two light years distant) passes through the Oort belt approximately every 26 thousand years (don't hold your breath), causing some comets to veer from their paths and impact the earth and its neighbors, causing a large scale extinction of species, among whom in the past were the dinosaurs, and giving others, like us and our cousins, a better chance for survival.<br /><br />The author points out that the star, long known as \\"Nemesis,\\" or the \\"Dark star\\", has never been seen--nor, for that matter has the so-called Oort belt.  They are both hypothetical, with no evidence of their true existence.<br /><br />The whole idea of why species go extinct, with a life span of from one to ten million years on average, depending on the species involved is a mystery to scientists--much like the mystery of why individuals within a species must necessarily die, perhaps.<br /><br />Although the author defends, as well as finding fault with, scientific method, it sounds much like turf wars between gangs or political parties.  And some of their favorite ideas sound, well, less than reasonable shall we say.

Is a star--even a small one--so hard to see with the optics, radio telescopes, etc., that are available today?<br /><br />Yet, this hypothesis is no more far-fetched than many others, and may well turn out to be true, yet.  Mr. David M. Raup is most persuasive in his presentation.<br /><br />There are some good points made herein.  For instance the author's point that almost all species that ever existed on the earth have gone extinct--both plant and animal life forms.  He also mentions that often they simply change form, from environmental necessity, or gradually spawn new life forms.  It would seem inevitable, either gradually or catastrophically for any given species to cease to exist and another to arise.  If they died out and were not replaced, soon all life would become extinct, or if they did not necessarily die, then life forms would certainly overwhelm the earth at some point.  So, a balance is achieved, which, for whatever reason seems to be the order of things.<br /><br />And the ecologists who continually fret about how the human race is responsible for all of the earth's problems, and want to \\"save\\" all its species except their own--(an impossible task, even if they successfully destroyed all of the \\"evil\\" human beings, cockroaches would probably survive) would find that all species would continue to die, and others be reborn.  An exercise in futility, gone awry.<br /><br />I suspect that, while the sciences are playing their guessing games and one-upsmanship, the earth will continue to revolve around its poles with a jolly little wobble, continue its orbit around the sun, at least until it implodes, or explodes, and the inhabitants, individually and collectively, will continue to be born, and die, and think that they are so important that they are causing it all.

(Ronald Coleman, D-TX; Jim Mattox, D-TX; and Thomas Luken, D-OH).  John L. Jackley says that he kept a journal of his days as press secretary on the Hill for the benefit of his children, but what he witnessed so sickened him with the chicanery, dishonesty, and self serving attitudes of the Congressmen in question (and their colleagues) that he quit his job after several years of service, and this book is a result.<br /><br />The manipulation of the media, misuse of franking privileges, abuse of perks and privileges-including passing hefty raises for themselves while their constituents were struggling to stay afloat financially-the secret deals and calloused vote trading he witnessed will turn the stomachs of readers.<br /><br />His account is replete with names of prominent congressmen, dates and places, like Richard Gephardt, Thomas Foley, Ron Dellums, Bill Alexander and others of his own party, although Republicans are not necessarily immune from charges.  But, he had more contact with Democrats for obvious reasons.<br /><br />If anyone still doubts anymore that many of our elected politicians are far more interested in staying in office, with all of the perks and power provided to them, than they are of serving their constituents, this book will open your eyes.  They have provided for themselves a retirement plan which will render them millionaires, a health care plan that makes Medicare look stingy, free mailing privileges, and until recently were able to have their own bank which allowed them to kite checks with impunity, with no money in the bank to cover them.  The requirement?  They must serve two (2) years in the Congress.  You should be so lucky.  \\"In 1990, the first post Jim Wright, post congressional scandal election, 96% of the incumbents who ran were re-elected.

I wish everyone could read her book.	Just the first chapter is worth the cost of the book, and then some.  If only it reaches &quot;best seller&quot; status!  But, even then, I think that the population is so mired in ennui and self-interest, and feels so helpless to change things that it would make little difference.<br /><br />Charlotte Twight holds a doctorate in economics and a J.D. from the University of Washington  and is a professor of economics at Boise State University.  This is her subject, and she is extremely knowledgeable.<br /><br />Her message?  The United States, in one lifetime has deteriorated from a land of liberty into a socialist, controlled society where the individual citizen's every action is controlled by government; where the federal government has grown in power exponentially until it rules every aspect of our lives with bureaucratic rules and regulations, where the Supreme Court, Congress and the Executive Branch (both political parties) have usurped powers that the founders of the country would be horrified to witness.<br /><br />The Supreme Court has become the final arbiter of our Constitution, changing its meaning without going through the amendment process, and thus denying the population their rightful place in the process.  We no longer hold the power the Constitution guaranteed us when, through it, we created the federal government and spelled out its limitations and granted it certain carefully delineated powers, and made our representatives swear to uphold the Constitution, which they still must although most have probably not even read it.<br /><br />The usurpation of power by the three branches of government was not the result of a grand conspiracy, but rather the natural result of individuals seeking more power over others: empire builders seeking to gain more influence, and to selfishly better themselves at the expense of others.<br /><br />I have watched this process take place over my own lifetime (75 years), and can vouch for the accuracy of Mrs. Twight's message.  When I was a teenager, during the Depression, I never witnessed anyone worrying about paying federal income tax at the beginning of each new year.  I never knew anyone who made enough money to worry about it.  No one worried about the federal government.  Of all levels of government, the federal was the least intrusive.  The local level was most important, as it should have been--that's the level where the people have the most control. There was no payroll deduction, yet.  That started with Franklin Roosevelt.  We paid cash for doctor visits and hospital care.  There was no need for Medicare.  That was started by Lyndon Johnson.  Now, Social Security and Medicare, those two socialist programs alone, are bankrupting us.  We spend far more on them annually than on national defense, for instance.<br /><br />When the individual income tax came on the scene, with the 16th Amendment to the Constitution, it came in at one percent, and members of Congress groused about that.  One member was quoted as saying, &quot;Now it's one percent, but what's to keep it from going to two, or even three percent.&quot;  Another member responded, &quot;You're crazy!  The people would revolt!&quot;<br /><br />Where is the revolution?  Now nearly half of the average American's income goes to taxation. Fow what? Did we not have enough government regulation before? Everything but the air we breathe is taxed, and even that is regulated.  And these extra constitutional functions of government occurred insidiously, gradually, without even a protest.<br /><br />When our civilization is destroyed, it will not be with a bang, but rather a whimper, if anyone even notices.<br /><br />What is the prognosis?  Is there a chance that we will ever get back to the constitutional precepts of freedom to live our own lives without intrusion by government into every aspect, without excessive regulation, and the ever increasing cost of individual resistance to government intrusion?<br /><br />The prospect of halting the progression of socialism looks bleak.  As the author says in page 15, &quot;My concern in this book is not only the growth of dependence but also the growth of an ideology of dependence--the normative judgment that broad governmental power creating pervasive dependence on government is desirable.&quot;<br /><br />In other words, we are willing tools of our own enslavement by our own government, in the name of comfort.  We are selling our birthright--for a mess of pottage.<br /><br />Maybe Jefferson was right.  Maybe the tree of liberty needs to be watered once in awhile with the blood of revolution. I am not recommending it--only making an observation, which is still legal, I think.<br /><br />You need to read this book. I cannot recommend it highly enough.<br /><br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre<br /><br />author of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenance<br />and other bookshe prospect of halting the progression of socialism looks bleak.

A very good description.  Certainly it is unsettling, and &quot;violent&quot; is no exaggeration.<br /><br />The protagonist is Sgt. Denny Delaney, NYPD, who is assigned to security at Grand Central Station.  He has a drinking problem which has estranged him from his beautiful wife, Monica, and he is threatened with suspension without pay for his drinking problem by his friend and supervisor, Big Mac.<br /><br />The antagonist is &quot;Felix the Cat,&quot; a middle easterner, Muslim and Palestinian sympathizer who hates Americans and Israelis.  He is also a wannabe film writer, who is writing his Opus Magnus with actual events: he is staging his plot with bombing events, killing hundreds of New Yorkers, ala the September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center.<br /><br />This is a well-written thriller.  The author, like the protagonist, is of Irish descent, judging by his surname, and both favor vodka martinis--the author, in moderation. according to his biography.  He has a Masters from Columbia, and is an excellent writer as well as a great story teller--perhaps a result of the Irish in him.  I predict a fine future for him.  This book would make a great movie.<br /><br />I want to read his next one, which I'm told will be a spy story.

He uses the old English spelling, rather than the new one, which the Chinese, who speak their own tongue and use characters instead of our alphabet, have instructed us to use today: Qingdao.  I spent the entire year of 1948 in Tsingtao.  That spelling is closer to the natives' pronunciation: Ching-taw.  How they arrive at that from Qingdao is a mystery to me. Perhaps, in time, we will tell them what characters in their calligraphy they should use to &quot;spell&quot; our cities.<br /><br />Lilley was the son of a Standard Oil Company of New York (SOCONY) salesman, selling &quot;oil for the lamps of China&quot;.  He attended College at Yale, where he was recruited into the CIA, and later into the State Department.  He has been posted to Laos, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Taiwan, mostly as an agent of the CIA.  He has been ambassador to China, as well.  When he was a young man, he did not speak Chinese.  He was raised, as were most foreign people in China, in a sequestered situation--usually a walled compound with broken glass on top of the wall for security.  I've been in similar compounds.  The Mandarin dialect spoken in Tsingtao by foreigners, including servicemen, was pidgin English. Riding in rickshaws is about as close as most of us got to Chinese customs.<br /><br />When I think of China, I think of scenes in the movie, The Sand Pebbles, a depiction of a Yangtse gunboat.  Tsingtao, though, was more Westernized.  They still sell a German beer made there, brewed by Chinese, now, but originally German: Tsingtao Beer.  It is one of their leading exports.<br />Spending time in China--even a considerable amount of time--did not make us knowledgeable about their customs, as he points out.  I saw much of the Chinese people in the year I spent there with the U.S. Marine Corps (I was in naval aviation).  While I was fascinated with the people and their customs, I never felt that I knew them.  I knew the Japanese better, though I spent the same amount of time there.  They are more like we Westerners in many of their customs.  The Chinese have more of a sing song cadence to their speech patterns.  Japanese is easier to learn.<br /><br />Lilley spends much of the first few chapters of his book describing his brother, Frank, who was manic-depressive (bi-polar), apparently.  He committed suicide, a not uncommon result of that affliction, which frequently strikes the most intelligent, most promising among us.  Two of my younger brothers met the same fate.  I can sympathize.<br /><br />My greatest problem with this book was no fault of the author.  He simply was not in Tsingtao while I was there, and did not therefore discuss our chaotic conditions when the &quot;Bahloo&quot; (Communists) took over and kicked us out of the country.  They told us our lease was up.<br /><br />Since he was not there, he did not see the communist soldiers come onto the Marine Corps Air Facility from Tsang-Ko (a walled town bordering the air base), as I did, and shoot the Chinese employees we had just paid off with sugar and flour.<br /><br />We were armed, but could not shoot back.  It was not our war.  It was the beginning of my hatred for communism.<br /><br />There is much talk of how China &quot;needed&quot; the &quot;Agrarian Reformers&quot; (communists) in this book.  His father was apparently of that opinion. I think Lilley was not.  I hope not.  Much of the actual events of that time, the ascendancy of Mao Tse-Tung and the rise of his power, as the result of the activities of our State Departments activities (through the person of John Service and others) led to our loss of presence in China.  We were sold out, as in Yugoslavia, Cuba and a half-dozen other places where we backed other communists against people like General Draja Mikhailovitch of Yugoslavia whose Chetniks saved hundreds of our flyers who were shot down, and was executed by Josep Tito's Partisans, against the protests of people like Sen.

By 2003, he had lost none of his youthful anti-Americanism. 'Some of the Bush idealogues in the media compare Washington to ancient Rome.  It is a  permissable fantasy, but they should remember that (a) the Romans never expected to be loved and (b) that Rome, too, fell.'&quot; (page 70)<br />There is truth in that statement, as Gibson points out, much as we hate to hear it.  Americans want to be loved.  When the Brits ruled the world, they never expected to be admired--only obeyed and, perhaps, feared.  We, on the other hand, want desperately to be liked.  But the hand that holds out the food, and rules, is usually hated, and often bitten.  That is just a fact of life that one must expect.<br /><br />John Gibson has written an awesome compilation of facts here supporting his thesis that we, the most powerful nation on earth, are vastly despised, despite all of the sacrifices we have made in blood and money in the last century to make the world better.  Are we surprised then, that France, whom we have saved from the despotism and horror of two world wars, is among our most ardent foes?  Or the Palestinians, whom we have striven to achieve justice for during a couple of generations, holds an abiding hatred for us?  Or the Germans, Belgians, South Koreans, Spanish, Italians--all of Europe (for whom we have bled copiously), in fact, hold us in contempt or, at least distrust us?<br /><br />Even the Brits, our most trusted allies, look down on us as springing from an inferior civilization.<br /><br />As they said in the Second World War, while we were bleeding for their sake, it was said that the greatest fault of the Yanks were that we were, &quot;Overfed, overpaid, oversexed and over here.&quot;  No gratitude, even then in the midst of battle.<br /><br />But, when all is said and done, at least for the moment (which is about as long as any political system lasts in the overall scheme of things), as Gibson points out we are the most powerfful nation on earth, militarily and economically.  We have, at least for now, achieved that status while France, Spain, Italy and Russia have declined until they are no longer the masters of their own fate: the victims of socialism.  Even the proud British Empire, upon which it was once said that &quot;the sun never sets,&quot; is now a mere shadow of its former glory.<br /><br />The United States of America may not be far behind, as the ugly head of socialism rears its head, replacing our constitutional freedoms to a greater and greater extent.  But for now, at least, we are the force with which to be reckoned--the one of which to be jealous--we are the source of power.<br /><br />It is not, therefore, ours to be loved.  Rather, it is ours to be respected, if for no other reason than our strength.  That must be enough, for now.  They will, no doubt, gloat when we fall, and perhaps when and if we are as weak as they, then they will love us.  Doubtful?

Much she herself has invented.  As I have stated in another review of one of Morris's books, I've had a hard time liking him simply because he worked for Bill Clinton (and, apparently, admires him.)<br /><br />In this book, it is quite apparent, on the other hand, that he is not equally enthusiastic about Hillary, and he seems to give given an honest appraisal of her, naming both her strong and weak points.<br /><br />He seems frankly fearful that she will be elected in 2008 or 2012, and that scenario does seem likely.  She may even be the VP choice of Kerry, and would certainly strengthen the ticket this year.  I personally think Kerry will lose even with her help.  But, given the &quot;perfect storm&quot; scenario described by Morris, she could well be a shoo-in in 2008 (God help us!).<br /><br />Morris does not offer much in the way of quotes, evidence, or fact to back up his description of Hillary's paranoia and vicious streak, but enough has been written by other well-known and objective witnesses to make him believable, and his appraisal of her does seem balanced--even generous on occasion.  And he writes from decades of intimate knowledge of the Clintons, having been one of their top advisers in both Arkansas and Washington, D.C.  He may even have been one of Bill's unacknowledged procurers (only my speculation.).<br /><br />I have developed my own impression of Hillary's &quot;character&quot; from many sources, and I pray that she is never placed in a position of power greater that the one she presently enjoys.

Certainly Europe's leaders, including royalty, listened to him closely.<br /><br />Saint Germain, who first came on stage a couple of hundred years later, it is often rumored lived more than one lifetime, and even claimed to have known Jesus of Nazareth.  And there have been others down through the ages.<br /><br />One of the most notorious, though less well known than Nostradamus and St. Germain perhaps, was born in Palermo, Sicily, in 1743.  He was Giuseppe Balsamo, but is better remembered as Count Alessandro de Cagliostro, and sometimes as Colonel Joseph Pellegrini--another alias.  He traveled throughout Europe, Russia and Northern Africa mostly with his young and beautiful wife, Seraphina, whose feminine favors opened many doors for the pair.  Apparently, although he is proclaimed to have &quot;loved&quot; her, he considered her his property, and took full advantage of her &quot;assets&quot;. and jealousy was not a hindrance.<br /><br />The pair traveled in rags, as pilgrims, and in lacquered carriages as royalty.  Cagliostro (the name taken from a relative) was revered as a near saint, who succored the poorest of the poor with his healing arts, and as a mountebank and chalatan, who bilked the wealthy with his schemes.<br /><br />This account of his life is not a true biography, but rather an account of only seven of his adventures, which Iain McCalman, the author, has researched and with which he entertains us.<br /><br />Count Cagliostro made many powerful enemies, as well as admirers, including Goethe, who was inspired by him to write Faust, and who detested him; Mozart who was inspired by him to write The Magic Flute, Marie Antoinette, from whom he attempted to steal a valuable necklace, and which affair got him thrown into the Bastille by Louis XIV; and Catherine the Great had him booted out of Russia as a political subversive when he tried to convert her to Freemasonry. But, perhaps his greatest undoing was the hostile impression he made on Casanova, who turned him in to the Inquisition for being a practitioner of magic (inspired by jealousy, no doubt) and Pope Pius VI had him imprisoned for heresy, where he spent the last five years of his life, dying at the age of fifty-two.<br /><br />He was a champion of Egyptian Freemasonry, had ties with the Illuminati, was an alchemist, magician, healer, and of course, a confidence man.<br /><br />An intriguing story.

That the feds borrow from it consistently, replacing the funds taken with government bonds, which must be paid back with interest?  Have you heard that Social Security will go broke by 2030, unless it is repaired by larger premiums or less benefits, or both?  Have you heard that when FDR came up with this Ponzi sceme, it was projected that thirty-some peoples' contributions would pay for each recipient?  That has now dwindled to a ratio of 3 to 1, and is still shrinking.  If you knew all these things, then you can save yourself the trouble of reading this book, perhaps, although there is much more here.<br /><br />This book was written by a lawyer, who says that he is familiar with crises, and generally describes his experience with folks who have treated their associates and customers with less integrity than should be expected, and he tars our elected officials with the same brush.  He says that he knows whereof he speaks about the &quot;crisis&quot; in Social Security.<br /><br />The Foreword (not &quot;forward&quot;, as printed here) was written by Lynn Brewer, currently President of the Integrity Institute, Inc., and a former executive of Enron corporation, and apparently one of the whistle-blowers who brought down that vast enterprise and all of its subsidiaries.<br /><br />The book is apparently well-written, by a competent commentator on financial matters.  One is not well-enough acquainted with him to judge the degree of his competence, and so must draw their own conclusions as to his presentation.  A subjective analysis, if you will.<br /><br />My personal reaction is that I have never favored either Social Security or Medicare.  I think both socialist programs are extra-constitutional, and were doomed to start with, when they were conceived by the Roosevelt and Johnson administrations, although their intent may well have been laudable.  But, as has been said, the road to hell is paved with good intentions<br /><br />The Constitution, which is the foundation of all of our law, to which all other laws must conform, does not authorize or assign the responsibility to feed, clothe, house, or provide medical care to the citizenry of the United States.  Its function is clearly stated in the Preamble, and its authorized functions and limitations are carefully spelled out in the rest of the document.<br /><br />Every citizen should be familiar with it, and our representatives in the Congress who so blithely dismiss it and walk all over it, should be impeached or voted out of office.<br /><br />Because we have let them get away with ignoring the Constitution and their oath to support and defend it, which they all must take, the result is on our own heads.  And it is not pretty.

He presents as an expert who knows what he is talking about, and the book is full of straight answers and exploded myths and old-wives-tales.  That, plus the fact that Americans are in love with their hair, apparently, and as a result fear hair loss, coupled with the fact that hair loss is seemingly inevitable, and you have recipe for success almost as sure as selling a diet that works to a country full of fat people that worship thinness.<br /><br />I found interesting statements of fact on virtually every page of this book.  I have male-pattern baldness myself, but I come from a generation that did not worship their hair to the extent that today's generations do.  But, one of my late female loved ones had thin hair which was the bane of her life, and I know the pain and grief the condition can cause, and the negative effect on one's self confidence.<br /><br />For those folks who are impacted by hair loss, I think you'll find this book as good as any on the subject, and better than most.<br /><br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre<br /><br />author of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenance<br />and other books	2004-04-08

The term has also been used frequently to describe the People's Republic of California, and the Democrat Party.<br /><br />This author skirts that description, but pretty well describes it.<br /><br />Miller is a self-described conservative Democrat.  He reminds me of a politician in my own state, Oregon, who was against gun-control and a host of other idiotic ideas that those of the left-liberal orientation support.  I once told him, &quot;Kevin, why don't you switch political parties.  You obviously don't fit in with the Democrats.&quot;  Eventually, he did, and in fact ran for governor as a Republican.  Unfortunately, in Oregon the tail wags the dog.  The entire state is conservative except Portland, Eugene and Corvallis.  Most of the population is in Portland, and Eugene and Corvallis are pointy-headed college town filled with left-leanin liberals wearing Birkenstocks and tie-dyed shirts.  He lost.<br /><br />Many refer to the Dems as the party of the &quot;working class,&quot; while the GOP is called &quot;the party of the rich.&quot;<br /><br />What absolute nonsense!<br />Miller says he was &quot;born a Democrat&quot; and would always be one.  I became a Republican in my majority.  It has been said that when you are young if you are not a liberal, you have no heart;  when you are old, if you are not conservative, you have no brain.&quot;  There is something to that.<br /><br />The &quot;have-nots&quot; of the world (usually, that means the young) always strike out for change.  They want socialism, because they seek a &quot;piece of the pie&quot; and want the wealth re-divided, in order to automatically be given wealth they have not earned.  The older people, who have worked for what they have, are of course against re-dividing the wealth that they have earned.  They are therefor conservative, and against rapid change in the rules by which which they have lived .<br /><br />Urbanites, who typically live from paycheck to paycheck, find themselves more dependent on government than those who live in a rural environment and are more independent, raising their own food.  Thus the large urban centers, where the paper-shufflers live, tend to be more in favor of socialism.  It's the same the world over.<br /><br />Zell Miller was a farm boy, and his message tends to reflect those down-home Southern values.  He wanted to help the poor, but not support them for generations.  He thought 48 months of welfare payments was long enough--he favored teaching them skills so they could work and support themselves and get off the dole.  And he took heat for his beliefs from the liberals in his own party.<br /><br />He speaks plainly in this book about his core values and the things he has tried to do.  Probably he will never change parties, but his values are more in tune with the GOP than the Granola Party.  He supports G.W. Bush for president, is against gun-control and abortion--at least &quot;late term&quot; abortion--and seems to think it is better to be self-supporting than on the dole.<br /><br />In other words, he is a Southern Democrat, which the &quot;Down East&quot; liberals have never understood, and likely never will, and that is why they will never carry the South--a point he clearly makes.<br /><br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre, USN (Ret)<br /><br />author of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenance<br />and other books, who typically live from paycheck to paycheck, find themselves more dependent on government than those who live in a rural environment and are more independent, raising their own food.

It would be difficult to write a better review of what the book is about than Joseph & Laurie Hyink (below) have done.  In THE NAME OF THE ROSE. also by Eco, I was first introduced to his work.  I found it fascinating although somewhat irritating because there were so many Latin phrases that were not translated (and I am not conversant in Latin).<br />If this sounds too bothersome, check out the movie, THE NAME OF THE ROSE, starring Sean Connery as William of Baskerville.  The film version of the story is truncated, necessarily, and much less intricate (see my review of both the book and the movie).<br />In this book, the same thing applies, but in more languages than Latin.  There is also much untranslated Hebrew, as well as some French, Portugese and Italian.  Nevertheless, the book is surprisingly easy to follow.<br />The plot is intricate, and as others have said, pages of secret hermetic and esoteric organizations are listed, as well as a veritable history of grand conspiracy theories is exposed and commented upon, with all of the nuances of disputed doctrines and beliefs, spells, etc.<br />Umberto Eco seems to be a veritable encyclopedia of knowledge in the esoteria arena.  His books (the two I have read so far) show a massive vocabulary, which he uses shamelessly.  If one were to fully understand each word used, it would be necessary to look up a word a minute, using a better dictionary than my 1913  unabridged edition of Webster's, which contains 2,620 pages of dictionary plus 150 pages of gazeteer and reference at the end.  Many terms used, I'm sure he coined on the spot.<br />Dense verbiage? Yes.  Intricate?  Certainly.  Slow moving? Yes, that too.  But, in spite of all that, this is a wonderful book.  It is necessary to recognize the characters' often sardonic, cynical, sarcastic dialogue.  They are young, left-wing intellectuals, after all, who thrive on skepticism.  They are making fun of the organizations whose followers they are studying.  Their minds are often befuddled by alcohol, too, as they seek the connections they are after.  The \\"diabolicals,\\" as they term their vanity publishing authors of esoteric material--the victims of their vanity publishing business--are seen by them as gullible half-wits, until...<br />But, you must read the story for yourself.  It would be unfair of me to give too much away.  It has been said that Umberto Eco is not for everyone.  I personally like his work very much.  Whether that is a comment on me, or on Umberto Eco, is for you to decide.inds are often befuddled by alcohol, too, as they seek the connections they are after.

But you don't need to own a boat to appreciate and find this volume useful.  Are you contemplating a vacation in the vicinity of the Bahamas, Turks, Caicos, or the Dominican Republic?

Then, there is Self Rescue, by John Cantwell Kiley, Phd, MD.  It is a remarkable volume, chosen by Psychology Today as its book of the month.  And of course, there are all of the imitators.<br /><br />This one is, perhaps, different than you might expect.  Written by a philosopher who is also, almost incidentally, a chiropractor.<br /><br />It is well-written, easy to read and apply, and will, very possibly, help you to enrich your life--although, in the final analysis, you pretty much get out of life what you put into it, in my experience.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I recommend this book to you, if you are looking for a plan to help yourself, as well of course, as Dr. Kiley's, Naploeon Hill's, and Dr. Norman Peale's.

It does contain many untranslated Latin phrases, but I submit that the main thrust of it is easy to follow, if you simply pay attention to the parts that you do understand, and realize that the characters, a young German novice, Adso,  traveling with his English monk &quot;master,&quot; William of Baskerville, stop at the Abbey of Melk, in Italy, where a conference in which he will take part, is imminent.  Throughout the book the religious viewpoint is dominant, as one might expect since religious matters dominated much of philosophy as well as theology in the early 1300s, where the tale is placed.<br /><br />William is to be involved in a conference between representatives of the Pope, John XXII, and the Emperor of France, who are in conflict over matters of church doctrine.  William is representing the interests of the Emperor, in the role of a conciliator.<br /><br />There is much dialogue in The Name of the Rose about conflicting doctrine and splinter groups in the church, many of which the mother church, primarily through the person of the Pope, declare to be heretics.<br /><br />If this sounds deadly dull to the reader, it is not as bad as it might sound.  Indeed, given the history of that time--much of which is related here--it plays a large part in the mystery itself.<br /><br />The story is told through the eyes of Adso, the novice, who wrote the manuscript the story was found in, supposedly, as an old man long after the occurences it descibes.<br /><br />Murders in the abbey play a central role in the story, and William, as a former Inquisitor, is tasked with their solution by the Abbot, Abo.  Involved is the abbey's library, which is off limits to all save the librarian and his assistant (the latter becomes one of the murder victims) and the monks employed in the Scriptorium, where they copy and illuminate the library's treasured volumes--one of the greatest collections in the world at that time.<br /><br />I find this book to be gripping, despite my lack of knowledge of Latin, and not too difficult to follow.  The viewpoint of Adso is that, one quickly discovers, is based upon his view of the world as he sees it, given only the knowledge that a fourteenth century youth would actually have.  They say it has been made into a movie.  I will have to get a copy, to see if it does justice to the book.<br /><br />I have developed an interest in the work of Umberto Eco, the author, and will have to read some of his other works.<br /><br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre<br /><br />author of The Road to Damascu: Our Journey Through Eternity<br />and other books-one of the greatest collections in the world at that time.<br /><br />I find this book to be gripping, despite my lack of knowledge of Latin, and not too difficult to follow.

Things like, &quot;I've always been heavy,&quot; or &quot;I just am not coordinated and never have been,&quot; both are negative suggestions which, if you state them often enough convice you that they are true, and they become true.

I read and reviewed his last book, as well as this one.  So I wrote to my sister, who has more experience than I in this area.  Below is her response:<br /><br />&quot;I've read Michael Newton's stuff and I think it's good, though it is sort of a composite story, and probably oversimplified.  I am convinced that each soul's journey is absolutely individual, though there is no doubt an order and pattern to our growth, as with all living beings.  So generalizations are at most a sketchy outline.<br /><br />&quot;There are guides and teachers, but they are us!  We exist in many dimensions, on many levels.  And the 'learning' is only about remembering who we are, which is divinity; All That Is.  As you well know, it takes some preparation to live our day-to-day lives with that awareness.  So we go through a 'learning process' to recognize what we already know absolutely.<br /><br />&quot;Also, Spirit is infinitely creative, and so we build stories and journeys and lessons, etc. just to exercise and experience our creativity, which is how we remember who we are.  To quote a favorite teacher of mine 'We are, in every now moment, a perfect, eternal expression of the Source'.  There is no ultimate destination as such, nothing we have to do or become before we are 'okay'; but Spirit has to create and do in order to know itself.  So we do these incredibly rich stories because we live eternally, and 'it's the only game in town'.<br /><br />&quot;Anyway, I do think regression hypnosis is very valid, although my own reincarnational memories came simply through meditation and asking for guidance.  The biggest hurdle is probably that we tend to dismiss those perceptions and not give them validity.<br /><br />&quot;I'd be willing to bet everyone has memories they can't explain.  If there are strong emotions associated with them, they are most likely personal memories.  But it's all simultaneous, and lives aren't experienced in a linear progression (neither is time itself).  We can meet other versions of ourselves in the same time frame (I've experienced this also).  I'm also certain it is grander, more intricate and mysterious than we can begin to comprehend, which is what makes it an eternal adventure.  Praise Be.&quot;<br /><br />So, there you have it!  This is an extremely honest woman with vast personal experience that I know about.

It is only my opinion.  It may not be yours.  Please do not take offense.  You may express your own opinion as well, if it is in conflict with mine.<br /><br />I must be the black sheep here.  I found this book to be well-written, and I found myself relating to much of it, but...<br />Aye, there's the rub!  The 'but'...<br />I have had some personal experience in this area, and the things I relate to include a strong belief (based on experience) that we do, indeed, have numerous successive existences, and that we do, indeed, live them often alongside other kindred souls with whom we have spent other lifetimes.  There is indeed a carryover from other lives, even though amnesia reigns.<br />In other words, we are eternal \\"souls\\" if you will.  We have existed forever, in the past, and we will continue to exist, in the future, forever.  Eternity is thus made acceptable by breaking it up into finite bites; but there is no \\"goal.\\"  This is where I depart from the esteemed doctor Newton.  He has new souls being created, and goals whereby each soul \\"grows up\\" through learning via life challenges.  In the eternal past which we have lived through already, if there were ever a goal, we would have accomplished it long ago.<br />The reason for life is simply to have as many experiences as possible, including not only happiness, but pain as well.  For God to have company, and view Himself through all possible viewpoints.  A God that invented time and space, as well as the Earth. It is how the universal mind manages eternal life--by living and seeing itself through the eyes of individuals--animals as well as people.  As the Advaita Vedanta says, \\"There is only One.\\"  There is but one soul in existence, and it views itself through the eyes of all the individuals in creation.  God, if you wish, is at the center of each individual.  So, how can there be old souls and new souls?  All are the same age, aspects of the same one: eternal.  To have company, God must make it from himself: there is no \\"other\\" from which life can be created. The Universal Mind alone decides what life it will  be \\"next\\" (not necessarily linearly--in fact they can be, and are, often simultaneous) without coaching from any \\"Teacher.\\"<br />One proof is in the definition of \\"nothing.\\"  Existence requires a witness, and you are that witness.  The definition of \\"nothing\\" is NO YOU.  You are the only witness ever available to you that anything exists.<br />Dr. Newton has it all down pat: a super huge corporation, with a heirarchy of teachers, guides, judges, and of course, at the bottom, the \\"whites,\\" us ordinary types.  Quite a bit like the various belts of the martial arts specialties.  Everyone has their very own, individual \\"soul.\\"  They even have soul nicknames, according to the Newton system.

So revolutionary, so original, so convincing, that the most faithful Christians will be moved; here is the book that has sparked worldwide controversy.&quot;<br />Many questions, and few answers.<br /><br />Holy Blood, Holy Grail is the result of over a decade of careful research by its three authors, who came to whatever conclusions they were able to make only after sifting through thousands of documents, seeking answers; answers which were often illusive.  But they  found much circumstantial evidence which led them to educated conjecture, often speculative, but nevertheless enough to satisfy any reasonable, open-minded jury.<br /><br />I heard about this book through reading others which dealt with the same general subject matter.  It did not disappoint, but the reader should be forewarned:  it is not light reading.

The author draws heavily on Holy Blood, Holy Grail for her factual data in addition to her own research, but she makes her point more clearly and The Woman With The Alabaster Jar is much more readable.  Holy Blood, Holy Grail contains more dense verbiage, and the authors develop their facts and surmises slowly and their themes very carefully, item by item.  It gets tedious at times.  Not so with Margaret Starbird.  She comes right out with it.<br /><br />The thrust of both books is that Yeshua bar Yosef (better known by his Greek name, Jesus) was married to Miriam of Bethany (better known as Mary Magdalene) and sired a daughter by her.  After his crucifizion, Mary moved to Egypt where her child, Sarah, was born, and then to Provence on the Mediterranean coast of France.<br /><br />The Catholic church tried to stamp out and eradicate the idea that Mary and Jesus were married and had a child because it threatened their orthodox views, and murdered 15,000 people in the Provence area in their effort, who believed the fact that Mary and Jesus had started a bloodline which survives yet.  In the Inquisition, many thousands more were killed for the same reason:  their &quot;heresy,&quot; in the eyes of the church.<br /><br />The theory is that the organizations known as the Knights Templar and the Priory of Sion protected the secret genealogy of the holy bloodline, and the proofs of the sang raal (holy blood, which became known as the Holy Grail).<br /><br />Starbird and the three authors of Holy Blood, Holy Gail make a plausible case--even a convincing one.<br /><br />These hypotheses were the background for the recent best-seller, The Da Vinci Code, by Dan Brown, who also drew heavily on Holy Blood, Holy Grail for his fictional mystery.<br /><br />The research is very thorough, although there is clearly much persuasive speculation involved.<br /><br />I do not recommend this book for orthodox Christians who are convinced that the Bible, as they know it, is the inspired word of God and not to be questioned.  This is a book better suited to people with a background in religious history, who are familiar with the Council of Nicaea and its activities, and the part played by Constantine and Theodocius in suppressing the so-called &quot;heretical&quot; gospels and other writings that were denied entry in the canon of scripture, and the editing, deletions and additions made to those that were included.<br /><br />It is not clear that the truth of the matter is portrayed in these books, but it is quite clear that there is much evidence to support their plausibility.  On balance, this is a more likely story than the virgin birth or resurrection of the dead, as portrayed in the orthodox version of the Bible.<br /><br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre<br /><br />author of The Road to Damascus: Our Journey Through Eternity<br />and other books, as they know it, is the inspired word of God and not to be questioned.

The author, Dan Brown, draws heavily on the book, Holy Blood, Holy Grail, by Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh and Henry Lincoln who spent more than a decade in researching the historical facts behind the story.  I did some research of my own. The organizations named indeed exist or existed as claimed: the Prieur du Sion dates back to 1099, and whose grand masters included such luminaries as Leonardo Da Vinci and Isaac Newton--not exactly lightweights--and apparently one of the more modern (1885) leading figures was a priest named Berenger Sauniere, abbe at Rennes-le-Chateau (also the surname name of the murdered curator in the story), and was followed by the Knights Templar, the Ordre du Sion's  military arm, (which was originally founded during the Crusades by Godfroi de Bouillon, who was named King of Jerusalem by the Pope, and was the leader of the first Crusade, AND who claimed to be a direct descendant of Jesus through Mary Magdalene; and the Opus Dei, which still exists at its headquarters at 243 Lexington Avenue in New York, exactly as stated by the author, and exactly as he described it.<br />The novel is obviously placed in the future, as the Pope is described as more liberal than the present pope, John II, and is his successor. The criticisms by present members of Opus Dei on their unofficial website qv:(Opus Dei: their unofficial homepage) quite apparently overlooked that fact in their criticism of The Ds Vinci Code. Actually, as the story unfolds, Opus Dei members involved fared quite well, and were certainly not maligned.<br />This book has caused a firestorm of criticism, primarily from the orthodix Christian community who are outraged by the claim that Yeshua (better known by his Greek name: Jesus) and Mary of Bethany (better known as Mary Magdalene) were married, had a child, and whose bloodline is still extant today.  This is a &quot;heresy&quot; that the  Catholic church tried to stamp out by murdering 15,000 residents of Provence, on the Mediterranean coat of France; a crusade which the Vatican launched in 1209 and lasted a generation.  That was followed by the Inquisition, which tortured and killed thousands more for their &quot;heresy.&quot;  These are historical facts, disputed by no one.<br /><br />This is a crackerjack of a tale, and it is little wonder that it ranks third in sales on Amazon (out of their over two million titles).<br />To begin with, the curator of the Louvre, in Paris, is murdered and an American, Professor Langdon--an expert in religious symbology--becomes involved, as does the curator's granddaughter, who is a cryptographer. The two of them set out to solve, not only the crime, but the mystery of the Holy Grail. I prefer not to tell more of the plot.<br />There are many surprises and unexpected twists in the story, but underlying it all is a generous history lesson that tells much about the early history of the Christian faith, much of it relating to the Gnostic Gospels which were found in the Egyptian desert near Nag Hammadi in 1945; the Roman Emperor Constantine and his part in suppressing most of the eighty some Gospels in favor of the four which were &quot;blessed&quot; by his scholars at the Council of Nicaea, and where the idea of the divinity of Jesus, the immaculate conception and the resurrection were given coinage by his &quot;scholars&quot;.<br />The Da Vinci Code certainly has an agenda: to give the legend of Mary Magdalene a wide audience, which it does in spades--and obviously, judging by its wide readership, it has achieved its purpose handsomely and quite plausibly.<br />Those who most strongly ctiticize The Da Vinci Code obviously do not do so because of the writing, editing, or research. All of those functions are quite acceptable if not outstanding. So, their criticism is because the story undermines their own religious faith. An understandable reaction.<br/>But, this book is an education in itself. I have done a great deal of research myself in this area, and I can tell you that I admire Dan Brown's effort immensely. He has done well to bring, even if it is in fictional form, so much information<br />in such an assimilable form to so many people, most of whom will not have heard it before.<br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre,<br />author of The Road to Damascus: Our Journey Through Eternity<br />and other books/>But, this book is an education in itself.

He is a recognized, respected scholar in his field.<br /><br />Although this is a book for laymen in that it reads easily, and is bereft of the usual scholarly jargon, the individual gospels, letters, and acts, etc., are often murky and hard to make sense of.<br /><br />I think it is because we are unfamiliar with the idioms in use at the time they were written, and the culture from which the writers sprang.<br /><br />For example, today, to indicate anger in our culture, many people use the uncouth, course phrase &quot;pissed off.&quot;  That language is tantamount to Aramaic in the beginning of the current era, which then was the language in common use by the people in the Holy land.  In a thousand years, our language will have evolved as it has continually in the past.

So much of it rings true: the way it is presented (an author stumbles on a story while in India), the details, the conversations, the factual zoological elements, the humanness of the characters.<br /><br />I was intrigued by the life of the teenaged Pi Patel in India and his fascination with religion. While no particularly deep or new theological epiphanies came out of it for the reader, from the view of a boy of sixteen or less, it seemed quite normal. My aunt spent 35 years as a missionary in India, and the story's background rings true, from what she told me about the land.<br /><br />The family life was interesting, and all members were well-developed human beings so that there was nothing to detract from the reader's gullibility (or should we say,&quot;acceptance?&quot;): this might be non-fiction--a REAL story of a REAL human-being.<br /><br />It is my belief that humans are naturally gullible creatures: if someone races into a cafe and shouts, &quot;There's been a terrible accident down the street!&quot; everyone believes them with no other evidence than their word , and wants to know more. Only incongruous details destroy our gullibility. And we test our gullibility regularly through our troubadors--our storytellers--laughing with relief only when we see through their deception. We are mental creatures, and like other carnivores sharpening their claws and establishing their territorial claims on trees, we sharpen our skills by relating to stories.<br /><br />I was enthralled with the adventure on the high seas--all very believable. Ships DO vanish. I've been there, and the ocean is indeed vast and has many moods, all of which seem to be captured here. The plight with the zoo animals aboard the lifeboat seemed to me to be perfectly plausible and well-described. The animal reactions between Richard Parker and Pi Patel even seemed extremely plausible. In short, Yann Martel had me in the palm of his hand. The universe loves a story, and a storyteller is God's gift.<br /><br />The implausiblility that finally led me to the inescapable conclusion that this was fiction, and not non-fiction posing as fiction, was the carnivorous floating island! Such a phenomenon would certainly have been discovered--probably centuries ago-- and would by now be overrun by zoologists, anthropologists, botanists, and others. It would be better known than the Seychelles. But it was this very implausibility that demonstrated the author's imagination, and proved beyond doubt his rank as a troubador.<br /><br />Without the island sequence, the book might well have been accepted widely as non-fiction--simply an extraordinary tale recounted to the author as it was described in the beginning, which would have been a sad thing. A great talent would have been short-changed.<br /><br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre<br /><br />author of Handguns and Freedom--their care and maintenance<br />and other bookshad me in the palm of his hand.

Unfortunately, it is not a way approved of by Bolitho, and it leads to problems.  Bolitho is in constant contact with the admiral because he is flag captain.<br /><br />As usual, in this series, there is a lot of sea action, as well as excursions against the enemy on land, a great deal of bloodshed, and Bolitho is blessed with the company of many of his oldest friends.<br /><br />This is pure Alexander Kent.

I did some research of my own.  The organizations named indeed exist or existed as claimed: the Prieur du Sion dates back to 1099, and whose grand masters included such luminaries as Leonardo Da Vinci and Isaac Newton--not exactly lightweights--and apparently one of the more modern leading figures was a priest named Berenger Sauniere, abbe at Rennes-le-Chateau (also the surname name of the murdered curator in the story), and was preceded by the Knights Templar (which was originally founded during the Crusades by Godfroi de Bouillon, who was named King of Jerusalem by the Pope, and was the leader of the first Crusade, AND who claimed to be a direct descendant of Jesus through Mary Magdalene; and the Opus Dei, which still exists at its headquarters at 243 Lexington Avenue in New York, exactly as stated by the author, and exactly as he described it.<br />The novel is obviously placed in the future, as the Pope is described as more liberal than the present pope, John II, and is his successor.  The criticisms by present members of Opus Dei on their unofficial website qv:(Opus Dei: their unofficial homepage) quite apparently overlooked that fact in their criticism of The Ds Vinci Code.  Actually, as the story unfolds, Opus Dei members involved fared quite well, and were certainly not maligned.<br />This is a crackerjack of a tale, and it is little wonder that it ranks third in sales on Amazon (out of their over two million titles).<br />To begin with, the curator of the Louvre, in Paris, is murdered and an American, Professor Langdon--an expert in religious symbology--becomes involved, as does the curator's granddaughter, who is a cryptographer.  The two of them set out to solve, not only the crime, but the mystery of the Holy Grail.  I prefer not to tell more of the plot.<br />There are many surprises and unexpected twists in the story, but underlying it all is a generous history lesson that tells much about the early history of the Christian faith, much of it relating to the Gnostic Gospels which were found in the Egyptian desert near Nag Hammadi in 1945; the Roman Emperor Constantine and his part in suppressing most of the eighty some Gospels in favor of the four which were \\"blessed\\" by his scholars at the Council of Nicaea, and where the idea of the divinity of Jesus, the immaculate conception and the resurrection were given coinage by his \\"scholars\\".<br />The Da Vinci Code certainly has an agenda: to give the legend of Mary Magdalene a wide audience, which it does in spades--and obviously, judging by its wide readership, it has achieved its purpose handsomely and quite plausibly.<br />Those who most strongly ctiticize The Da Vinci Code ovviously do not do so because of the writing, editing, or research.  All of those functions are quite acceptable if not outstanding.  So, their criticism is because the story undermines their own religious faith.  An understandable reaction.<br />But, this book is an education in itself.  I have done a great deal of research myself in this area, and I can tell you that I admire Dan Brown's effort immensely.  He has done well to bring, even if it is in fictional form, so much information<BR>in such an assimilable form to so many people, most of whom will not have heard it before.<br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre,<BR><BR>author of The Road to Damascu: Our Journey Through Eternity	2004-01-28

Bolitho is wed and his 74-gun ship-of-the-line Hyperion goes into dry dock for a refit, including a new copper bottom, removing the forest of weed from her hull which has accumulated during her years of continuous service, slowing her down considerably.<br />Then, after six-months of a complete refit, she is ordered to blockade duty off France, and seconded to the command of Commodore (the lowest flag rank) Mathias Pelham-Martin, who proves to be an incompetent, egotistical officer who holds his rank only because of political influence ashore, and whose superior holds an old grudge against him.<br />I suspect that Kent uses these plots which include incompetent, unfeeling superior officers because virtually all of his adult readers have experienced such leadership at one time or other, rather than because the British Navy was rife with them.  Certainly in the U.S. Navy, the superiors I served under were virtually all competent and dedicated officers. The incompetents get weeded out by the system rather rapidly.  But the stories all seem to revolve around the Queegs and Blighs, as if they were common phenomenon.  And every office, factory or warehouse knows of a supervisor who has been promoted because of politics or the \\"Peter principle,\\" or an incompetent female who has slept her way to the top.<br />In this story, Kent takes us again on a chase to the West Indies and back, with lots of sea action, drama between him and his brother, Hugh, and nephew, and other twists of plot.<br />As usual, he breathes life into his characters and the story holds you spellbound.

The author writes lyrically, sensitively, and intelligently about a subject that often draws sneers from intellectual snobs.<br /><br />An example from the foreword:<br /><br />&quot;The purpose of this offering is to increase astrological awareness and comprehension, and give you the ability to apply this knowledge to your own life.<br /><br />&quot;Astrology as it is learned today is both art and science. That is to say, it fully engages both hemispheres of the brain, the rational and the intuitive. It is a marriage of astronomy and mythology. To do good astrology it is imperative to cast accurate charts, which requires objective observation and accurate calculation. Interpretation rests upon a wealth of accumulated observation, wisdom and diligent study; knowledge of myths and symbolism, and the mysterious and elusive ability to find themes, synthesize and grasp the overall pattern, which is unique to each individual born into space and time.<br /><br />&quot;The assumption behind our use of astrology is not that the planets or the heavens actively control, determine or direct our lives. It is rather the relativistic concept that the universe is an interactive energy continuum, or more accurately, a vast hologram. Each particle contains, reflects and interacts with the whole pattern; hence the ancient Hermetic Principle, &quot;As above, so below&quot;. Whatever energy dance is being performed in the heavens resonates with and reflects the energies that move our lives. The purpose of studying and applying this knowledge in our lives is increased self-awareness, psychological integration [wholeness], and better timing: So that we may know the proper season to sow and to reap, and to rest. Or, to say it another way, so that we can dance our lives in rhythm and harmony with existence.<br /><br />&quot;Astrology is essentially the study of harmonics. It is learning to read the music of the celestial dance. It is joyous to move in harmony with the cosmic symphony. It is futile to resist or deny its influence in our lives.<br /><br />&quot;Harmonics is a basically simple, yet all-encompassing subject. Pythagoras believed and taught that everything is based on numbers. And the numbers are alive, they are frequencies and fluctuations. They flow and interact dynamically in every moment of existence. This play is harmonics, the music of the spheres. Astrology is its study, and music its expression.<br /><br />&quot;Planets are huge, multi-dimensional foci of energy, each with its own persona; its values, needs, issues and agendas. Each has a unique frequency pattern to which we are attuned in some deep, mysterious level of our awareness. Planets constantly move and interact with each other, and we, consciously or otherwise, resonate with their dance and song. It is the ebb and flow of life.<br /><br />&quot;Each of us (and everything in existence) has a unique frequency signature which is reflected in our astrological birth chart and also, I believe, encoded in our DNA if we could but read the knowledge stored there. Truth to tell, we can and shall. It is a part of who we shall become as we awaken into higher dimensions of being.&quot;<br /><br />That has to be the most rational, lyrically expressed exposition on the subject that I have ever seen, and one with which any thinking person can identify.<br /><br />The book includes an expose' of the chart, and what it means, the various houses, signs of the zodiac and the planets which rule each one (as well as the asteroids), and the impact upon our lives.<br /><br />What the author does not mention, but a fact of which I am aware is that atrologers utilize the same ephemerus (or nautical almanac, which navigators use) that is used by astronomers to measure the aspects of heavenly bodies.  I know of it because I am a sea-going celestial navigator.<br /><br />I have always wondered at astrologers' insistence that our lives are influenced by the sun, moon, and planets--although I am fully aware that ships have less draft (they ride higher on their plimsoll lines) as the moon passes overhead, and certainly crime rates are affected by the moon's phase.  But planets are so far distant, that their influence, it seems, must be insignificant.  But Gyan Surya's explanation makes sense to me for, there is no doubt in my mind that the universe is a hologram and that we are all part of one harmonious moving stream against which we may struggle, or with which current we may float along in peace.<br /><br />May I recommend this book to all who are open-minded on the subject, and curious to read more.<br /><br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre,<br /><br />author of The Road to Damascus: Our Journey Through Eternity<br />and other booksour lives are influenced by the sun, moon, and planets--although I am fully aware that ships have less draft (they ride higher on their plimsoll lines) as the moon passes overhead, and certainly crime rates are affected by the moon's phase.

He writes in a fluid, narrative form that makes the book easy and interestimg to read, and John Adams seem to be a a real human being with whom you can relate.  He deals with Adam's faults as well as his positive traits, and his challenges and relationships with others, as well as his love and respect for Abigail.  A remarkable man.<br />One reviewer bemoans Adams' and Jefferson's attitude toward slavery and the fact that the \\"slave trade\\" was not condemned in the Declaration of Independence, forgetting, apparently, that the slaves were legally purchased valuable property then, and that at the time, slave holding was an accepted practice throughout the world.  The Congress at the time was trying to bind the states together, not to drive wedges between them.<br />This book does not indulge in questioning the cultural practices at the time of John Adams, but rather attempts to describe and explain them.  I think the author does a masterful job, and depicts the genius of our founding fathers--and especially John Adams--as accurately as possible.  I think he does a wonderful job, and makes the history of the day a delight to read, and understand.<br />As far as I am concerned, at least, McCullough has done a masterful job, and he depicts John Admas and his contemporaries neutrally, while still remaining sympathetic to their problems and the fine line they walked in seeking their independence from Great Britain, putting their lives on the line in the process.<br />I fail to see how any American today can find fault with the fathers of our country, considering the information they had, the education available to them, and the monumental task they faced.  For myself, I am unutterably grateful that such men were available, with their wisdom and foresight.<br />I am particularly impressed that they recognized the dangers of a democratic form of government, and rejected it in favor of a Constitutional representative republic, which, it seems, since that time we have gradually, insidiously, relinguished in favor of the socialism we are living under today, irrespective of the Constitution they so carefully crafted.<br />John Adams, as our first vice-president, second president, representative to France and England, and a recognized genius by most historians was certainly one of the most influential of our founders, and deserves the gratitude of us all, considering his life in retrospect.<br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre, USN(Ret)<br /><br />author of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenance<br />and other books<br /><br />.itutional representative republic, which, it seems, since that time we have gradually, insidiously, relinguished in favor of the socialism we are living under today, irrespective of the Constitution they so carefully crafted.<br />John Adams, as our first vice-president, second president, representative to France and England, and a recognized genius by most historians was certainly one of the most influential of our founders, and deserves the gratitude of us all, considering his life in retrospect.<br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre, USN(Ret)<BR><BR>author of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenance<BR>and other books<br /><BR>.	2004-01-03

This one, they say was written first, but I suggest you read them in the chronological order of the protagonist's (Richard Bolitho) career. beginning with the one titled, Midshipman Bolitho.  In that order this is number four, in which he is given command of a frigate, the Phalarope, his second command. Bolitho's naval career starts at the tender age of 12, but the first book in the series picks him up at the age of 16--already a veteran midshipman.<br /><br />Kent is a first rate story-teller.  His main concern is the story, rather than a mass of technical detail about ship's rigs, sails, etc., which are of interest to some of us, but of less interest, perhaps, to those who simply want to get on with the story.  None of his stories drag.  There is action a-plenty, including lurid descriptions of men getting their heads blown off and their limbs amputated.  Hand-to-hand combat is common in boarding parties and on dry land expeditions.<br /><br />I have some personal experience with sailing vessels, having built and sailed my own ketch-rigged sailboat on the Pacific with my family, and so far as I can tell Kent's sail handling descriptions, although necessarily abbreviated for the sake of the story, are technically accurate.  I am more familiar with fore and aft rigs than square riggers, though.<br /><br />This book concerns the end period of the American Revolution.  Bolitho's Phalarope is operating in the West Indies.  It is refreshing to see that war through the eyes of a British naval officer, and it rings with truth.  The final battle, pitting the French Admiral De Grasse against the British George Rodney and Hood, at the sea battle known as the battle of the Saintes, in the Caribbean, ends in glory for Bolitho.<br /><br />Bolitho is called upon to command the Phalarope after the death of a harsh captain who drove his crew to the edge of mutiny, and to make matters worse, his complement was filled out with rogues who were not wanted by other ships of the fleet, by an admiral who disliked him.<br /><br />This is a very good book, which, if you are like me, you will enjoy and find it hard to put down.<br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre, USN (Ret)<br /><br />author of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenance<br />and other bookss complement was filled out with rogues who were not wanted by other ships of the fleet, by an admiral who disliked him.<br /><br />This is a very good book, which, if you are like me, you will enjoy and find it hard to put down.<br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre, USN (Ret)<BR><BR>author of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenance<BR>and other books<br />	2003-12-24

In this one, after the peace is signed at Versailles between France and England following the American Revolutionary War, the protagonist of the series (this is number five in the Bolitho series), Richard Bolitho, is given command of a 24 gun frigate, the Undine (a fifth rater), and ordered to India, where his task is to assist in taking over a Spanish post, which is to revert to the British flag.  The post's governor is an admiral under whom he has previously served, and who is trying to restore his reputation after a bad command call in a previous sea battle..<br /><br />There is skullduggery almost immediately, including plots to sabotage the deal by the French, who are in league with local pirates, and a love affair with a British government officer's wife.  Bolitho, it would seem, is naive about women and driven more by his glands than his brain (as are many young men).<br /><br />In any case, this is a whale of a story, and it will keep you reading far into the night--especially if you have reached the age when vicarious adventure is more appealing than the more dangerous kind, as have I.<br /><br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre, USN (Ret)<br /><br />author of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenance<br />and other books	2003-12-24

So far this is the fourth in the Bolitho series I've read, by Alexander Kent (a pseudonym).  That must tell you that I like the series.  I have also ordered, and just received the next three in the series.<br /><br />Like O'Brian's Captain Jack Aubrey series, it is best to read these books in order, since they are in a chronological series as far as the protagonist's career is concerned.  Richard Bolitho was born and raised in Cornwall of a seafaring family.  He went to sea as a midshipman at the age of twelve.  The series picks him up at age 16, in Midshipman Bolitho, the first book of the series, when he was serving on a ship-of-the-line--a third rater.  There are actually two stories in that first book.<br /><br />Each book will stand alone, but I think it is better to read them as the fictional hero lived it, in order.  There are a great many books in the series.  I'll be sorry when I've read the last one--number 26, Relentless Pursuit.<br /><br />Kent is obviously very knowledgeable about the sea and the square rigged ships of the Royal Navy circa the late 18th and early 19th century, as well as the customs, hardships, and naval strategy of the time.  But, to him, the story comes first, and he is a master story-teller.  The action never drags, and his characters seem to live.

The year is 1777 and they are anchored off Staten Island as part if the inshore squadron under Admiral Coutt.  Trojan's captain is the remote Captain Pears, and the first lieutenant a man named Cairns.  In our modern navy, Cairns would be called the Executive Officer--next under the captain in the chain-of-command.<br /><br />There is much action for Trojan, both as convoy escort, and in attacking a fort in North Carolina and again in the Carribean.  Bolitho is of course heavily involved, in shore parties, as well as sea battles, and eventually gets temporary command of a prize and undergoes a sea battle in his own command.<br /><br />This is a great series, and Kent (a pseudonym) displays more than a speaking acquaintance with the royal navy, its customs and conditions, in the late 18th century (not the 19th, as the Library Journal says in their review).<br /><br />This is the third in the Richard Bolitho series, preceded by Midshipman Bolitho, and Stand into Danger.  I am currently reading the fourth book in the series, Sloop of War.  It is a thoroughly entertaining series, especially (but not exclusively) for aficianados of sea stories, and particularly historical square-riggers.<br /><br />I recommend that the reader begin with the first book of the series, Midshipman Bolitho, and read them in order as they portray the protagonist, Richard Bolitho, through his career in  sequential order.  Each story does stand alone, however.<br /><br />It is interesting to see the American Revolution through the eyes of an officer in the Royal Navy.<br /><br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre, USN (Ret)<br /><br />author of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenance<br />and other books	2003-12-12

My family physician brought my attention, in the first place, to Patrick O'Brian's series of books about the adventures of Captain Jack Aubrey of the British Navy in the days of wooden ships and iron men.<br />I was not new to naval fiction.  I cut my teeth on Howard Pease's stories of the merchant marine, which inspired me, directly, to ship out at the age of 16 on an 8,000 ton freighter, in the \\"black gang,\\" as a fireman.  Subsequently, I joined the U.S. Navy on my 17th birthday and eventually I built my own ketch-rigged sailboat, the \\"Wild Goose,\\" and sailed her on the Pacific with my family.<br /><br />I am somewhat of a connoisseur of naval fiction, especially as it relates to sailing vessels. The late Patrick O'Brian was a master of the genre, and his details of square riggers sailing rig and of life aboard vessels of the late 18th century were unsurpassed.  Many of his actions were taken directly from admiralty records.<br />Alexander Kent is more of a storyteller, and he does not depend so much on detail of the sailing rig.  He is more interested in the story, and his stories are superb!  He keeps you reading far into the night to see how it comes out.  I would read the books through in one setting, if my schedule allowed.  My doctor recommewnded this series, also.<br />Like O'Brian, Kent (a pseudonym) follows the career of a single extraordinary seaman, Richard Bolitho, from Midshipman on to command.  Bolitho began his career at the age of twelve, although the series pick him up at 16, a seasoned midshipman, in the first book of the series (which I have reviewed) \\"Midshipman Bolitho,\\" in which he is assigned to a 74 gun ship of the line, the Gorgon.  \\"Stand into Danger\\" picks him up as a third lieutenant on the Destiny, a frigate.<br />There is plenty of action in both stories. I have the third book in the series, now, and have the fourth on order.  That should tell how much I like the series.<br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre, USN (Ret)<br /><br />author of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenance<br />and other bookss and Freedom...their care and maintenance<BR>and other books	2003-12-07

The other one was the Patrick O'Brian series built around the adventures of Captain Jack Aubrey and Dr. Stephen Maturin.  That series was great! The late Patrick O'Brian was a master story teller, and he knew his square riggers in detail.  Hollywood just made a movie based on his first book in the series, Master and Commander.<br />Alexander Kent is a pen name, and this series also holds great promise, judging from this book, Midshipman Bolitho, who was born in Falmouth, in Cornwall, and the story picks up in October, 1772.  This book actually contains two stories, beginning with the 16-year-old Midshipman Richard Bolitho's assignment to the British 74 gun ship-of-the-line Gorgon, on a peacetime assignment to patrol the West African coast for pirates and slavers.  Bolitho, who started his naval career at the age of 12, is a veteran, at 16, as the story starts and is already looking forward to his lieutenant's examination.  He comes from a naval family, numbering a father who is a post captain, and a grandfather who was a rear admiral.  His family's history is the cause of friction between him and his division lieutenant, a gouty, bad-tempered character named Tregorren.<br />The second story is closer to Richard's home, in Cornwall, while he is on leave, and concerns smugglers and wreckers who lure ships on the rocks for their cargos in the dead of night.<br />Altogether, the stories kept my interest to the end, with good suspense, lots of action, and great descriptions of nautical scenes, ship's maneuvers and good research into the period (end of the 18th century).  Dialect and usages used in the dialogue rings true and are well done<br />I intend to continue with the series, and have ordered the next two books in the series, Stand Into Danger and Gallant Company.  I really enjoy these stories of wooden ships and iron men.  I have some speaking acquiantance with the sea and sailing; I was in the merchant marine at the age of 16 myself, as a fireman on an 8,000 ton frieghter, joined the navy on my 17th birthday (from which I am retired), and built and sailed my own ketch, the Wild Goose, on the Pacific with my family.<br />I love good sea stories, and grew up on Howard Pease's books about the merchant marine.  He was largely responsible for my hitchhiking to San Francisco and shipping out at a tender age.<br />This is a good series.  I recommend it to you, if you love to read adventure stories about the sea and the men who go down to her in ships.<br /><br />Thanks again, Dr. John!<br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre...marine at the age of 16 myself, as a fireman on an 8,000 ton frieghter, joined the navy on my 17th birthday (from which I am retired), and built and sailed my own ketch, the Wild Goose, on the Pacific with my family.<br />I love good sea stories, and grew up on Howard Pease's books about the merchant marine.

The Nag Hammadi library was discovered in the Egyptian desert, near Nag Hammadi, in 1945.  The library was composed of scrolls buried by the Gnostics, who in the fourth century maintained a monastery nearby.  They were contained in a buried clay jar, in an apparent attempt by Gnostic Christians to save them from destruction by the Constantinian Christians who had orders from the Christian Emperor, Constantine, to destroy all such writings as heresy, along with those who adhered to them.<br />Over the nearly 2,000 years buried in the desert sand, time took its toll, and many of the scrolls were fragmentary as a result. Yet the 38 scholars who undertook the translation from the ancient Egyptian (coptic) in which they were written, did a magnificent job: not only translating, but also making commentaries comparing them to those gospels which Constantine's scholars considered canonical, and discarding all others as heretical.<br />This volume is one of the results, with the various codices identified with the translators, and beginning with their commentaries.<br />Other volumes of a similar nature, including two books by Dr. Elaine Pagels--one of the translators--\\"The Gnostic Gospels\\" and \\"Beyond Belief,\\" are also available on Amazon.  Dr. Pagels taught at Barnard College, where she chaired the Department of Religion, and Columbia University.  She is currently professor of religion at Princeton.<br />The Nag Hammadi Library consists of twelve codices as well as fragments of a thirteenth, and fifty-two separate tractates.  A brief history of the effort to translate and edit the materials is included in the preface to this book.<br />The struggle to eliminate the Gnostics and their ancient literature, by the Constantinian Christians (who prevailed and became the universally accepted Christianm church) was highly succesful, so much so that the only evidence of the Gnostic literature, for centuries, were the disparaging remarks in the writings of the orthodox authors referring to the heretics.<br />Until the discovery of these scrolls, in 1945!<br />For those who are interested in this subject matter, this is a most interesting book, and one you will wish to own.<br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre<br /><br />author of The Road to Damascus: Our Journey Through Eternity<br />and other booksr centuries, were the disparaging remarks in the writings of the orthodox authors referring to the heretics.<br />Until the discovery of these scrolls, in 1945!<br />For those who are interested in this subject matter, this is a most interesting book, and one you will wish to own.<br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre<BR><BR>author of The Road to Damascus: Our Journey Through Eternity<BR>and other books	2003-11-22

We had each read her (then) new book, The Gnostic Gospels.  She was one of the group of scholars who translated the Nag Hammadi scrolls, found in the Egyptian desert in 1945, and so we met her in her office for a brief discussion.<br /><br />Dr. Pagels is a serious, recognized scholar of early Christianity and its literature and history, and she now teaches at Princeton.<br /><br />This book describes the early schisms between what was to become the orthodox Catholic (universal) Christian church and the ones called the \\"Gnostics\\".  The main difference between them is the position of the gospel attributed to John, and that (Gnostic gospel) attributed to Thomas.  John's version claimed that Jesus (the Greek name of the Jewish teacher named Yeshua, or Joshua) was identical with God--literally, God descended to earth in the form of a man--which both Jews and most early Christians would have considered blasphemy, and Thomas' version, which implied that any person could experience God directly, essentially without the need of a priest, bishop, or pope to intervene in the process--a view abhorrent to the organized church which had established such a hierarchy, and in later centuries thrived by selling dispensations and maintaining power over the multitude through tithes and threats of excommunication.<br /><br />The actual \\"canon\\" of the scriptures, declaring some to be inspired by God and discarding others as heretical was decided at the Council of Nicaea, where scholars empowered by the Christian Emperor Constantine, whose wish it was to settle the differences between the many Christian sects, and create one orthodoxy for everyone, made the fateful decision.  As a result, the Gnostic writings were declared heretical, and ordered destroyed.  It was nearly successful:  for hundreds of years, virtually the only evidence of their existence was the animosity in writings of non-Gnostic writers attacking them--until 1945 when a clay jar full of scrolls was found, well-preserved, in the Nag Hammadi desert of Egypt by an Egyptian shepherd.<br /><br />The word gnosis translates to a deeper wisdom, or knowledge of a spiritual truth previously accepted by faith alone, and described the acceptance by the Gnostics of the premise that man needs no intermediary to have the experience of union with God.  This has been the stance of many Hindu Vedas (scriptures), specifically the Advaita Vedanta, and the most advanced Hebrews and followers of Islam, for centuries.  The Hindu saying, \\"Tat tvam asi\\" translates to \\"Thou art That,\\" and elsewhere clearly states that the individual soul is not different than the soul of God.  The Advaita Vedanta (the last of the Vedas) claims that there is only one soul in existence, which plays all of the parts in the universal dance.<br /><br />Johannes \\"Meister\\" Eckhardt, a Catholic priest, was preaching much the same message, and for his heresy was summoned to Rome for punishment.  Fortunately, perhaps, for him, he died on the way.  Throughout human history there have been many who have had the experience, which many call \\"enlightenment,\\" of coming to acknowledge that they are one with God.  One such, of course, was Siddhartha of Gautama, better known as the Buddha.  In more recent times, in the United States, we were blessed with a man named Alan Watts.  One of his books is called, The Book:  The Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are.<br /><br />I recommend all of his writings to you.<br /><br />This book contains not only the translation of the Gospel of Thomas from the coptic (ancient Egyptian) but, perhaps most important, the scholarly, enlightened commentary upon it by Dr. Pagels.

I met her briefly several years ago, in New York.<br /><br />Only fragments of The Gospel of Mary Magdalene were found, of the total 19 pages.  Pages 1-6 are missing, as are 11-14.  However, the pages that were found and translated from the coptic are of great interest since they primarily purport to be quotations of Yeshua (better known by his Greek name, Jesus) and conversations between his disciples.<br /><br />A tension between Mary Magdalene, who is described as being closer to Yeshua than the others, and Peter, is evident: &quot;How is it possible that the Teacher talked in this manner with a woman about secrets with which we ourselves are ignorant? Must we change our customs and listen to this woman?  Did he really choose her, and prefer her to us?&quot;  Then Mary wept and answered him: &quot;My brother Peter, what can you be thinking? Do you believe that this is just my own imagination, that I invented this vision?  Or do you believe that I would lie about our Teacher?&quot;<br /><br />Is his reaction only male chauvinism, or pure jealousy?<br /><br />The scrolls found in the Nag Hammadi are important because the Gnostics were opposed by the dominant Constantinians, who tried to stamp them and their writings out, and refused to allow them into the canon of the New Testament.  I once heard that Constantine's scholars went into a room, and when they came out, said that the books included in the canon were chosen because they &quot;jumped up on the table&quot; of their own accord, and the ones that did not were not included.<br /><br />I can't verify the statement's truth, but it is no more far-fetched than some others.<br /><br />The antiquity of the Nag Hammadi books alone, as well as the subject matter, should make them as valuable as any of the other gospels.<br /><br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre<br /><br />author of The Road to Damascus: Our Journey Through Eternity<br />and other books.<br /><br />I can't verify the statement's truth, but it is no more far-fetched than some others.<br /><br />The antiquity of the Nag Hammadi books alone, as well as the subject matter, should make them as valuable as any of the other gospels.<br /><br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre<BR><BR>author of The Road to Damascus: Our Journey Through Eternity<BR>and other books<br />	2003-10-30

Jensen	Books	5	47	53	N	N	An excellent treatise on nature vs. nurture	Frank Miele (the author) acts as a \\"devil's advocate\\" in this book, as he interviews psychologist Arthur R. Jensen, who is a well-known geneticist.  Miele says, in his preface,<br /><br /> \\"In this book, I skeptically cross-examine Arthur R. Jensen on Jensenism' how and why he believes the scientific evidence is even stronger today that:<br /><br />\\"'IQ is real, biological, and highly genetic, and not just some statistic or the result of educational, social, economic, or cultural factors:<br /><br />\\"race is a biological reality, not a social construct; and, most controversially of all,<br /><br />\\"the cause of the 15-point average IQ difference between Blacks  and Whites in the United States is partly genetic.'\\"<br /><br />Jensen went from being a highly respected but little-known educational psychologist and professor at the University of California, Berkeley, until he was solicited, in 1969, to write a 123-page article for the prestigious Harvard Educational Review which began with the opening sentence, \\"Compensatory education has been tried and it apparently has failed.\\"  With that article he became a highly controversial figure because of his contention, which runs counter to the institutionalized politically correct view among social scientists, that heredity is of more importance than environmental factors in determining human intelligence.<br /><br />Jensen, no racist by any stretch of the imagination, demonstrates throughout this book \\"the interviews which were conducted through e-mail\\" mainly through statistical analysis and other valid research methodology, the care with which he had arrived at his tentative conclusions.<br /><br />As with The Bell Curve, by Herrnstein and Murray, The Blank Slate, by Steven Pinker, and Race Evolution and Behavior, by J. Philippe Rushton, all scholarly, well-researched books on similar subject matter, the advocates of the more politically correct view that the races may differ in virtually every other respect except intellectually, are attacking the message by attempting to kill the messenger.<br /><br />The interviews that comprise this book are just short of hostile to Dr. Jensen in their tone, never granting agreement or accord, and with every answer, no matter how persuasive, the author merely changes the direction of attack.  In fact, in the beginning, he announces his skepticism.<br /><br />But, Dr. Jensen more than holds his own.  The e-mail interview method seems to be a good one, since obviously both parties are enabled to be precise in their quotes and double-check everything before sending the question or answer.<br /><br />We are given little information about the author, Frank Miele, except that he is a senior editor of Skeptic magazine, that his articles have appeared on \\"many web-pages,\\" and that he lives  in Sunnyvale, California, with his Great Dane dog, Payce.  However, his questions of Dr. Jensen seem relevant and well-researched.  The book is important, however, only because of Dr. Jensen's answers, which are invariably direct, careful, and backed up with very persuasive data and statistics.

Yet, there does creep in some evidence of his predilections. For example, he mentions on page 240 that Justice Harlan appears to be favorable to eugenics--a dirty word since the Third Reich--and then immediately follows that observation with the statement that Harlan had voted \\"for the NAACP in Brown v. Board of Education\\" (in favor of Affirmative Action in higher education.) A non sequitur unless the subjective perception of \\"racism\\" is viewed as a more important consideration than the constitutional requirement of equality before the law.<br />He begins by giving a detailed analysis of sports history--over half the book, I think--resulting in the seemingly inescapable conclusion that black athletes dominate virtually all of the sports in which they compete, far out of proportion to their representation in the population. The author is a runner, and thus much emphasis is given to running. Again, it would be difficult to come to any other conclusion than the innate physical superiority of people of black African descent, particularly in running and jumping.<br />He seems to be reluctant to the point of refusal, on the other hand, to grant that there can be any concomitant assumption that there is any racial (he prefers the term 'population') difference in intelligence. In fact, he seems reluctant to admit that there is any such quantifiable characteristic as intelligence in the human species. He does mention J. Phillipe Rushton's book which addresses that question specifically, \\"Race, Evolution and Behavior\\"--which I have reviewed for Amazon.com--with respect, although he told me privately that there is much there with which he disagrees. He mentions, as well, Hernnstein and Murray's book, \\"The Bell Curve,\\" which I have also reviewed here.<br />He mentions the political impact of the genocide practiced during WWII and its negative impact on serious post-war research into racial genetic differences (hence, the book's title), and the UN-led political effort to peddle the notion that all races are genetically equal, and that individuals are 'Tabla Rasa' (blank slates), on which the only significant influence is environmental experience--the model accepted by most social scientists today, a subject addressed in The Blank Slate, by Steven Pinker.<br />This book demonstrates again, to me, what I have known since I attended art school in the early 'fifties: there are average significant physical differences between the major races --\\"populations\\" if you wish--of which you must be aware if you intend to depict them in pictures; specifically, the Mongoloid, Caucasoid and Negroid. That there should be average mental and temperamental differences as well seems undeniable, particularly when coupled with my own observations around the world over three-quarters of a century. To me, this does not mean that one race is \\"superior,\\" or another \\"inferior.\\" It is just apparent (to me) that the various populations have used differing methodologies in coping with the differing environments with which they were faced, with concomitant evolutionary differences. We are more alike than different, and there are greater differences within racial groups than between them, but to deny the existence of racial differences would be, and is, utter folly.<br />The Mongoloids and the Caucasoids did, in fact, generate vast diversified societies, the wheel, written language, navigation skills and other intellectual accomplishments in cold, harsh climates, while the Negroids and other aborigines languished with none of the above in a relatively benign, forgiving climate. That much is pretty much undeniable.<br />Altogether, this is a valuable book--particularly if you are interested in sports and black athletes' contributions--and to a lesser extent the impact of genetics on the above, since the author's scientific qualifications for writing such a highly technical book may be questionable. Although his writing skills are superlative, to what extent his potential bias colors his research is an unknown quantity.  I personally accept him at face value as an intelligent, curious man seeking the truth.<br />Joseph H.

I think he was an amoral philanderer with no conscience, and probably the only president of the United States ever elected who held his own interest in higher esteem than that of his country.  I have lived through many administrations, both Democrat and Republican, beginning with the first year of Hoover's administration.  I held no other president in utter contempt except Clinton.  Most had at least something about them to admire.<br /><br />Obviously the authors of this book agree with my own evaluation.  This book is a reprise of most of the known scandals and crimes committed by William Jefferson Clinton and his co-conspirators.  As such, it may appeal to many who continue to dwell on him.<br /><br />As for me, I don't want to be reminded of him anymore.  I want to forget him.  We now have a president with integrity, and I want to forget Bill Clinton.<br /><br />This book was written before the election of George W. Bush, and so the motivation for writing it was probably an effort to influence voters by reminding them of Clinton's sins.  No such motive exists any longer, and thus there is no longer any good  reason to buy this book and rehash ancient history.  Yesterday's politics belong to yesterday.

It is not polemical or disputatious, nor does the author Bob Kohn indulge in slander, histrionics or invective to make his points.  Rather it is a reasoned expose of the deliberate, careful use of propaganda techniques by the New York Times to promote and advance their liberal editorial ideology into their news division, coloring their straight news stories to persuade readers to view events from a liberal perspective, with a negative view of the conservative outlook.<br /><br />The crux of this book is best illustrated by a joke that has been circulating around the Internet:<br />The Pope was visiting Washington, D.C. and President Bush  took him out for an afternoon on the Potomac, sailing on the presidential yacht.  They were admiring the sights when, all of a sudden, the Popes hathis white zucchettoblew off his head and out into the water.  The secret service guys started to launch a boat, but Bush waved them off, say6ing, Wait, wait.  Ill take care of this.<br />Bush then stepped off the yacht onto the surface of the water and walked out to the Holy Fathers little hat, bent over and picked it up, then walked back to the yacht and climbed aboard.  He handed the hat to the Pope amid stunned silence.<br />The next morning, the New York Times carried a story, with front-page photos, of the event.  The banner headline read: BUSH CANT SWIM.  (page 2<br /><br />Journalistic Fraud is more than simply an accusation, with multiple examples, of the egregious politically inspired deliberate slanting of straight news stories intended to implant the Times liberal ideology among the readers;  it is also a short course in journalistic technique, including the reverse pyramid style of writing, journalistic ethicsor lack thereof (past and present)and how to commit advocacy journalism so that it appears to be straight news.<br /><br />I strongly suggest that, no matter what your politics, you buy and read this book.

He was a featured speaker, and to say that I was impressed would be an understatement.<br /><br />In this book, he discusses transpersonal psychology, involving a shift in awareness.  Our psychologists and psychiatrists need to engage themselves in this transformational system and get outside the accepted paradigm of the current model of reality that scientists work within today, accepting certain basic assumptions, and move on to the equivalent of the quantum theory of consciousness.<br /><br />He points out in another of his books, Beyond the Brain, that the Newtonian/Cartesian paradigm (a system of thought based on the work of Isaac Newton and Rene Descartes) is still accepted and the orthodox foundation of precepts in use in psychiatry, psychology, anthropology and medicine. He points out that physics has moved on to a new paradigm: relativity and quantum theory and beyond, while the previously named sciences have languished, and opines that it is time for psychiatrists and psychologists to re-examine their fundamental belief structure as well.<br /><br />Grof said, at the seminar, that he was originally--in Czechoslovakia where he originated--a dyed-in-the-wool Freudian, until he began to perceive difficulties with that approach. He grew from there. He was one of the original medical investigators to use d-lysergic acid diethylamide in serious psychiatric research, from which he derived some astonishing results.<br /><br />Grof was formerly Chief of Psychiatric Research at the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center and Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. He is no lightweight airhead, but rather is a highly qualified, credentialed and credible researcher. This and his other books are well worth your time, if you have the necessary vocabulary and the scientific background to benefit from them.<br /><br />Grof makes a bold argument that understanding of the perinatal and transpersonal levels changes much of how we view both mental illness and mental health. His research in transpersonal experience evokes serious questions into such areas as reincarnation and the spritual side of the human being.<br /><br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre,<br /><br />author of The Road to Damascus: Our Journey Through Eternity<br />and other booksGrof makes a bold argument that understanding of the perinatal and transpersonal levels changes much of how we view both mental illness and mental health.

Perhaps the largest hurdle remains: getting the book published and out on the market where people may buy it.<br /><br />This book looks at those problems, and contains a great deal of very good advice.<br /><br />Even the biggest publishers take a loss, or just barely break even, on most of the titles they publish. They are supported by the handful of titles that achieve the most attention, and become big sellers. Like the movie industry, only a few become stars. And, of course, the giant's share of their promotion budget goes to the books which show the most promise, leaving the ones who really need it out in the cold.<br /><br />It is a humbling experience for a would-be author to go into a large bookstore, see all of the shelves full of books, and realize that his book will just be one more of the hundreds of thousands of new titles that show up each year.<br /><br />So, this book fills a need. How about publishing? The primary functions of the traditional publisher are selecting books that will sell in the first place, editing, proofreading, design, production and--most important--marketing. In most cases, the new author is the primary marketing agent for his book, anyway. Why should he give up 90% of the sales price when he must shoulder the main responsibility of the publisher?<br /><br />The author, who created the book, must usually be satisfied with 10% royalties, with the publisher retaining 90% for their production and marketing efforts.<br /><br />So, more and more writers, faced with aloof publishers who will not even read their book, let alone buy it, are taking the self-publishing route. They need Dan Poynter's book. It tells them what they need to know.  It is indeed,as one reviewer said, the GPS of publishing.<br /><br />First, this manual contains some basic rules on how to write a marketable book. Then, the problems they will face in producing it, and finally--certainly not least--promoting it in a crowded marketplace.<br /><br />He does a very good job. I only noted one neglected area in the first edition, and it was the very area in which I was most interested: Print-on-demand publishing.<br /><br />Well, I must tell you that Dan Poynter has corrected that deficiency. In this, the latest edition of the Self-Publishing Manual, the entire area of Print-on-Demand (POD), as well as Print-Quantity-Needed (PQN)is amply covered with the latest available information. I have certainly learned things of which I was not formerly aware from the book.<br /><br />Print-on-demand is a new force in the marketplace. Some of the publishers who are utilizing it are simply vanity houses, but many others are not. The era of one-off book publishing is here (POD), along with printing only the quantity actually required (PQN) which is much the same. No more need to warehouse long press runs until they sell, or necessity to pay inventory taxes on warehoused books waiting to be sold. The POD printer will print a single volume or a thousand, as needed, and mail it to the customer for you, and send the publisher a monthly check, less the cost of printing. It is a force that is changing the face of the publishing industry.<br /><br />The new technology is particularly good news for those books that sell only a few copies a month, or a year. No longer must they be dropped from the publisher's catalog and go out-of-print. They can simply be digitally archived and printed as needed for the occasional sale.<br /><br />There are problems unique to the &quot;New Book Model,&quot; which Dan Poynter addresses in detail. For the new author contemplating self-publishing, or the author whose work has gone out-of-print, but for which there is still a residual market, this book is one which you should read. There is information here that you are not likely to find addressed anywhere else.<br /><br />I cannot recommend it too highly.<br /><br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre,<br /><br />author of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenance<br />and other bookshould read.

You sent out your manuscript to dozens of publishers, and just when you were about to give up, a small publisher liked it, and has published it; but they have virtually no promotion budget!<br /><br />Or, perhaps you self-published, or went to a Print-on-Demand (POD) publisher where you paid a nominal amount and they designed your cover, set your type (without proofreading), listed you on Books-In-Print and with the big wholesalers like Ingram Book Group and on Amazon.com, BarnesandNoble.com and others.  But, they do not market it, and no one will read it unless they buy it first.  It's existence is just your little secret!<br /><br />In either case, like most first time authors (and many with considerable experience) you discover that selling your book is up to you. You can expect very little help from the publisher other than listing it and, although that is important it surely will not get you on the Best Seller list no matter how great your book is.<br /><br />This book was written for you. There are some very good ideas in it, and they are things that you can do. Booksignings, book reviews, special events, of course! But, this little book is full of other things that you can do to bring attention to yourself and your book: things like making your own bookmarks, and leaving them with your tip in restaurants.<br /><br />I suggest that you buy this one.

Brian Greene is a high-energy physicist of the first rank, and he does an excellent job of explaining the history and background of theoretical science, which led to the latest superstring theory. Beginning with Newtonian physics he leads the reader through relativity and quantum mechanics with clear, logical, everyday illustrations, although his explanation of quantum mechanics did get a little rarefied-understandable for sub-atomic behavior that is often described as \\"weird.\\"<br /><br />He explains the incompatibility of general relativity and quantum mechanics, and the resulting need for a unifying theory, which gave rise to the string theory, which seems to have the potential to become a Theory of Everything (T.O.E.):<br /><br />\\"The moment you encounter string theory and realize that almost all of the major developments in physics over the last hundred years emerge--and emerge with such elegance-from such a simple starting point, you realize that this incredibly compelling theory is in a class of its own\\" --Michael Green, formerly of Queen Mary College --one of the pioneers of string theory<br /><br />What is string theory? Simply put, it proposes that the basic, radical building block of all sub-atomic particles, energy and matter is not a point particle, but rather a one-dimensional string-loop about a hundred billion billion times smaller (the so-called Planck length) than an atomic nucleus which vibrates at an undetermined, but potentially infinite number of wavelengths, amplitudes and tensions, comparable to a violin string The various wavelengths and amplitudes give the \\"particles\\" their characteristic properties.<br /><br />Our present-day experiments are unable to resolve the microscopic stringy nature of matter: Greene says we would need an accelerator to slam matter together with energies some million billion times more powerful than any previously constructed accelerator in order to reveal directly that a string is not a point-particle, so discoveries in the foreseeable future depend upon mathematical formulae and the resulting deductions.<br /><br />String theory so far claims that such strings are nature's most fundamental ingredient and that if the presumed point-particles composing electrons, quarks, protons, neutrons, positrons, photons, etc., could be examined with a precision significantly beyond our present capacity, each would be seen to be made of a single, tiny, oscillating loop of string. In physics, oscillation is to vary regularly between maximum and minimum values, as an electric current.<br /><br />Brian Green has done a masterful job of explaining in layman's terms some of the most abstruse theoretical science currently being discussed and studied by some of the foremost high-energy physicists on the planet.<br /><br />Joseph Pierre<br /><br />author of THE ROAD TO DAMASCUS: Our Journey Through Eternity<br />and other booksectly that a string is not a point-particle, so discoveries in the foreseeable future depend upon mathematical formulae and the resulting deductions.<br /><br />String theory so far claims that such strings are nature's most fundamental ingredient and that if the presumed point-particles composing electrons, quarks, protons, neutrons, positrons, photons, etc., could be examined with a precision significantly beyond our present capacity, each would be seen to be made of a single, tiny, oscillating loop of string.

Is it because it is the political disease of all urbanites, or because of their liberal professors in the journalism schools? Goldberg has perhaps hit the nail on the head. He thinks it is because everyone with whom they associate think alike, and they are not even aware of their bias, but think that they are simply &quot;middle of the road,&quot; because they simply do not meet any other view in their circle of friends and acquaintances, and because they see everyone who is conservative as &quot;right-wing nuts,&quot; a term that includes everyone who does not agree with their leftist world-view.<br /><br />Goldberg gives an example of such provincialism--he quotes New Yorker film critic Pauline Kael, who in 1972 couldn't figure how Richard Nixon had won the presidency. &quot;I can't believe it!&quot; she said. &quot;I don't know a single person who voted for him!&quot; Nixon carried forty-nine of the fifty states to McGovern's one.<br /><br />Goldberg's point, and I think it is accurate, is that--as New Yorker's tend to think of themselves as the center of the universe, and everyplace else as 'flyover country,' and as John Podhoretz has said, they &quot;can easily go through life never meeting anybody who has a thought different from their own,&quot; so it is with The Mighty Journalism Elite. There is no plot, no conscious conspiracy, they simply think alike. As several polls have shown, 98-percent of them consistently vote for the most liberal candidate in every election. They are even more liberal than their constituency. His point is well taken.<br /><br />All this from a man who, as Goldberg says of himself, &quot;I have never voted for a Republican candidate for president in my entire life!&quot;<br /><br />As for Goldberg's book, BIAS, if it has a flaw it is probably that it is, perhaps understandably, too polemical. He paints an ugly picture of Rather, not only as a biased liberal, but also as an intolerant, mean-spirited, arrogant bully whom even the network executives fear. His treatment of Connie Chung (because she got more air-time than Rather during the Oklahoma City bombing incident, during which time he was on vacation) was indefensible if accurately portrayed, and caused her to be fired--all due to his jealous egotism.<br /><br />So, much of this book--particularly the first part--comes off as primarily a personal defense and an apparent attempt to justify what many of his co-workers characterize as disloyalty. But, as the book develops, and he expands on his thesis--that the elite media is biased toward the liberal view, on the social and cultural issues as well as politically, the case he builds is pretty much inarguable.<br /><br />But then, it has been so obvious that, as Bernie Goldberg says, &quot;it's hardly worth discussing anymore.&quot;<br /><br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre<br /><br />author of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenance<br />and other booksnter of the universe, and everyplace else as 'flyover country,' and as John Podhoretz has said, they &quot;can easily go through life never meeting anybody who has a thought different from their own,&quot; so it is with The Mighty Journalism Elite.

He uses that uncommon commodity known, for some strange reason, as &quot;common sense.&quot;<br /><br />Sowell points out`the ludicrous incongruities of the liberal &quot;philosophy&quot; in terms so plain and unvarnished that only one attempting a proctological examination on themselves could miss it.<br /><br />An example: &quot;The point of being a superpower is so that no one will attack you and require the sacrifice of more and more young Americans like those buried in this cemetery.  We were attacked at Pearl Harbor because we were sitting ducks who had allowed our military forces to dwindle away until we had an army smaller than Portugal's--and not enough equipment even for this small force.&quot; Page 7.<br /><br />Or: &quot;Multiculturism is one of those affectations that people can indulge in when they are enjoying all the fruits of modern technology and can grandly disdain the processes that produced them.  None of this would be anything more than another of the many foibles of the human race, except that the cult of multiculturism has become the new religion of our schools and colleges, contributing to the mushing of America.  It has become part of the unexamined assumptions underlying public policy and even decisions in courts of law.&quot; Page 19.<br /><br />Or:  &quot;Much of the current uproar about IQ differences between blacks and whites does not get down to the rock-bottom question: What is there to explain?  The average score of blacks in IQ tests in the United States is about 85, compared to a national averge of 100.  Is that unusual?  No.  It is not.&quot;  He goes on to explain that various groups of various ancestries have had IQs of 85 at various times and places, and he names some of them, and says that the phenomenon is not peculiar to the United States, and he admits that he doesn't know why.  Even American aoldiers of the First World War had lower IQs than our soldiers of the Second World War.

His grandparents immigrated to the United States in the late 1800s. He was a Vietnam war resistor 1967-72, and is a retired U.S. Navy Surface Warfare officer, having spent two years of duty in the Indian Ocean off Iran in the late '80s.<br /><br />His sympathies seem to be with the Muslims and the Arabs, judging from the book's content.<br /><br />He holds advance degrees in communications and journalism with dual majors.<br /><br /> This book is well-written and well-presented by the publisher, with no glaring editing failures that I could detect. The cover is attractive and well-designed.<br /><br />As for the message, Mr. Aboud is apparently convinced that Jewish Americans control the American media, and that they are behind a vast propaganda effort to discredit the Arab population of the world, constantly depicting them in the worst possible light while simultaneously driving our national policy to favor Israel. He names several movies to support his thesis, among other examples. This is not a new accusation.<br /><br />There is a voluminous bibliography and index at the book's end, with footnotes at chapters' ends, to facilitate the feeling that the book is well-documented and researched.<br /><br />My reaction to the message? I can't ignore the hard facts that the World Trade Center, Pentagon, the U.S.S. Cole, Marine barracks in Lebanon and the recent housing complex bombing in Saudi Arabia, as well as airliners and U.S. Embassies and the passenger liner Achille Lauro hijacking, and attacks on a Berlin nightclub frequented by Americans were all the work of Arab terrorists.  Still, there are no doubt injustices on the other side, too.<br /><br /> All of the above events are not Jewish propaganda.  So, perhaps the reader should have their salt-shaker handy.<br /><br />American liberals, however, seem to favor the Arabs lately. Certainly Hillary Clinton has appeared to.<br /><br />It is also demonstrably true that Israel on one occasion bombed and strafed an American ship (Accidentally?

His grandparents immigrated to the United States in the late 1800s.  He was a Vietnam war resistor 1967-72, and is a retired U.S. Navy Surface Warfare officer, having spent two years of duty in the Indian Ocean off Iran in the late '80s.<br />He apparently has advanced degrees in communication and journalism.  I'm guessing that he holds an MA degree with dual majors, which would fit that description.<br />This book is well-written and well-presented by the publisher, with no glaring editing failures that I could detect. The cover is attractive and well-designed.<br />As for the message, Mr. Aboud is apparently convinced that Jewish Americans control the American media, and that they are behind a vast propaganda effort to discredit the Arab population of the world, constantly depicting them in the worst possible light while simultaneously driving our national policy to favor Israel. He names several movies to support his thesis, among other examples.<br />There is a voluminous bibliography and index at the book's end, with footnotes at chapters' ends, to facilitate the feeling that the book is well-documented and researched.<br />My reaction to the message?  I can't ignore the hard facts that the World Trade Center, Pentagon, the U.S.S. Cole, Marine barracks in Lebanon and the recent housing complex bombing in Saudi Arabia, as well as airliners and U.S. Embassies and the passenger liner Achille Lauro hijacking, and attacks on a Berlin nightclub frequented by Americans were all the work of Arab terrorists.<br />  <br />These events were not all Jewish propaganda, and so it is not all one-sided as the book seemingly purports to show.<br />On the author's side, it does appear that much of the American media is Jewish dominated--certainly the music and show business industries seem to be, and no doubt they push their own version of history, just as they push their own version of American politics (liberal Democrat, which includes most Jewish voters) in their movies and, where they can, in the television news as well as the elite news media, which is one-sided and heavily dominated by the liberal left's political view and social agenda in its slant.<br />The American liberals, however, seemed to favor the Arabs recently.  Certainly Hillary Clinton has appeared to.  Or maybe they are just anti-American, no matter who the adversary is.<br />It is also demonstrably true that Israel on one occasion bombed and strafed an American ship (Accidentally? Try telling that to the crew!) and that they have actively engaged in espionage against us, their greatest international benefactor. Which, to me, just demonstrates that you can't trust even your friends in internatuional affairs.  They are all opportunists.<br />But, in spite of the author's case, made here, I think that radical Muslims have demonstrated that their hatred of the United States knows no bounds and they are willing to die to harm us, which is not to say that all people of Arab extraction in this country fall into that category.<br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre, USN (Ret.)<BR><BR>author of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenance<BR>and other books	2003-08-08

For proof, check out the reviews on these pages. Usually reviews on books of this ilk, attacking the liberal ideology, mostly get five star reviews from conservatives and little notice from the liberal ideologues. But this one is obviously more threatening to them, and they have pulled out all the stops on attacking it. They are writing attack reviews pretending to be conservatives, and voting en bloc against the five star reviews. It has their attention. That's good!<br /><br />Treason was bound to average three stars. Conservatives give it five, and the liberals whom it attacks obviously rate it as low as possible out of sheer hatred. The only thing that affects its rating is the number of each group that review it, and since it is so threatening they are pulling out all the stops while Ann just sells more books (see its sales rank).<br /><br />It is very well written, well edited, and full of facts, names and history that are well documented in the voluminous references at the end of the book. The facts and names are pretty well indisputable, and the history is all documented, and can be checked with a little research, using Ann's references and the internet.<br /><br /> What does Ann say in this book? You need to read it! I wish it could be made available to all Americans, and that all would read it, even if only out of curiosity.<br /><br />It describes how the liberal establishment has always defended communists--even spies like Alger Hiss and the Rosenbergs--passionately, refusing to believe their guilt even when it was demonstrated beyond a doubt; how they have vilified traitors' accusers, like Whittaker Chambers and Joseph McCarthy, even when the Venona project which broke the Soviet codes in 1943 and was kept secret even from Roosevelt and Truman (the code-breakers didn't trust Democrats because they were Soviet sympathizers, and their administrations were riddled with communists) decoded Soviet cables to its agents in America proved them right, and that the accused were indeed paid Soviet agents. It describes how FDR and Truman promoted Hiss even after being informed by the FBI that he was a spy, and how Dean Acheson and other top officials stood by him and refused to believe his guilt even after it was proven.<br /><br />It describes how the lefties always take the side of our enemies against their own country, and make it our fault that the terrorists attacked us on September eleventh, and describe their own country as an international \\"bully,\\" and even travel to North Vietnam to give comfort to the enemy, posing by the anti-aircraft guns that are being used to shoot down our airmen.<br /><br />Is \\"treason\\" too harsh a word?

I've had a hard time liking Dick Morris in the past, partly because he was a pal of Clinton and one of his most trusted advisors, and I view Clinton with utter contempt.  How any honest man could talk himself into working with Clinton, I cannot understand.  Now he is a commentator on the Fox network, which is the least partisan of all the networks.<br /><br />In this book, however, Morris makes some specific points about the elite media--pointing out for example that the New York Times has been acting as a propaganda arm of the Democrat party, often to the detriment of the country in general, with superb documentation, and naming many Hollywood leftists:<br />\\"These icons of stage and screen,song and dance, are no longer content with making us tap our feet.  They want us to change our minds.  But they bring to their advocacy their old habits--they follow scripts.  They are not intellectuals.  They are actors, actresses, singers, and stars who are impersonating deep thinkers.  The same skills they use to persuade us that their stage characters are really in love, or really locked in mortal combat, they now employ to try to convince us our country is going in the wrong direction. Their skills are formidable.  But let's not forget the reality:  These are human parrots, mouthing lines fed to them by the fashionable, social, trendy elite.

It reads as smoothly as any spy story by Clancy, and with as much suspense.  The characters are alive and recognizable.<br /><br />In any good fiction, there has to be enough of a grain of truth to make the story plausible.

So much of it rings true: the way it is presented (an author stumbles on a story while in India), the details, the conversations, the factual zoological elements, the humanness of the characters.<br /><br />I was intrigued by the life of the teenaged Pi Patel in India and his fascination with religion.  While no particularly deep or new theological epiphanies came out of it for the reader, from the view of a boy of sixteen or less, it seemed quite normal.<br /><br />The family life was interesting, and all members were well-developed human beings so that there was nothing to detract from the reader's gullibility (or should we say,\\"acceptance?\\"):  this might be non-fiction--a REAL story of a REAL human-being.<br /><br />It is my belief that humans are naturally gullible creatures:  if someone races into a cafe and shouts, \\"There's been a terrible accident down the street!\\" everyone believes them with no other evidence than their word , and wants to know more.  Only incongruous details destroy our gullibility. And we test our gullibility regularly through our troubadors--our storytellers--laughing with relief only when we see through their deception.  We are mental creatures, and like other carnivores sharpening their claws and establishing their territorial claims on trees, we sharpen our skills by relating to stories.<br /><br />I was enthralled with the adventure on the high seas--all very believable.  Ships DO vanish.  I've been there, and the ocean is indeed vast and has many moods, all of which seem to be captured here.  The plight with the zoo animals aboard the lifeboat seemed to me to be perfectly plausible and well-described.  The animal reactions between Richard Parker and Pi Patel even seemed extremely plausible.  In short, Yann Martel had me in the palm of his hand.  The universe loves a story, and a storyteller is God's gift.<br /> <br />The implausiblility that finally led me to the inescapable conclusion that this was fiction, and not non-fiction posing as fiction, was the carnivorous floating island!  Such a phenomenon would certainly have been discovered--probably centuries ago-- and would by now be overrun by zoologists, anthropologists, botanists, and others.  It would be better known than the Seychelles.  But it was this very implausibility that demonstrated the author's imagination, and proved beyond doubt his rank as a troubador.  <br /><br />Without the island, the book might well have been accepted widely as non-fiction--simply an extraordinary tale recounted to the author as it was described in the beginning, which would have been a sad thing. A great talent would have been short-changed.<br /><br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre<BR><BR>author of Handguns and Freedom--their care and maintenance<BR>and other books<br />	2003-06-09

Lott is primarily an economist who has held positions at the University of Chicago, Yale, Stanford, UCLA and other respected institutions of higher learning. He was also the chief economist of the United States Sentencing Commission in 1988-89.  He is no lightweight in the field, and he knows how to interpret statistics.  Not only statistics that he himself has gathered, but those for every county in the United States over a period of several years that were gathered by the United States government.<br /><br />Using the government's own figures, he wrote \\"More Guns Less Crime,\\" evaluating the violent crime results emanating from the 33 states with \\"must issue\\" concealed carry laws as opposed to those without. The \\"must issue\\" laws, in effect, insist that law-abiding citizens who pass certain requirements must be issued a concealed carry permit for a handgun, regardless of the local sheriff's feelings about gun-control or an armed populace.<br /><br />His evaluation of the statistics?  Those states without the \\"must issue\\" laws, many of whom forbid the law-abiding to carry the means of defending themselves regardless of the U.S. Constitution to the contrary, have a considerably higher rate of violent crime and shootings, and in effect because of their gun-control laws are costing their citizenry hundreds of lives, thousands of injuries, and millions in property loss and damage.<br /><br />John Lott says, on page 13 of this, his new book, \\"My role as an economist is not to consider whether Americans have a 'right' to own guns, to keep them unlocked, to sell them at gun shows, to carry guns with them wherever they go, and so on.  My only objective is to study the measurable effect that gun laws have on incidents of violence, and to let the facts speak for themselves.\\"<br /><br />And this he does, very effectively.<br /><br />In \\"Bias Against Guns\\" he does an admirable job of demonstrating how the press and television virtually always report shootings of children nationally, although such events (as he shows) are extremnely rare--for example, whereas 34 children under the age of six were accidentally shot in one year, in the entire nation, 43 were drowned in 5-gallon buckets!<br /><br />He also looks at multiple shootings, where two or more people are shot by the same perpetrator, as in schools, restaurants, shopping malls and other public venues--acts of terrorism included.  IN this he looks not only at the United States, but also at Israel where such events are every day occurrences, and how the Israelis handle the problem, and how best to deter such events.<br /><br />As he points out, the media almost never report any of the 2,500,000 cases where firearms are used for defense against criminal attack and dangerous animals.<br /><br />As he says, brandishing a gun and thereby causing an attacker to flee is not news.  When man bites dog, that is news but when dog bites man--a much more frequent event--that is NOT news.<br /><br />Not only the press, but the government also--particularly under the administration of Bill Clinton--spent millions on advertising campaigns vilifying firearms and using spurious<br />and misleading facts and figures.  Polling organizations word their public polls in such a way that it seems the public is in favor of gun control, whereas the opposite is true. Never do they ask the question,\\"Does private possession of firearms, on balance, create more good than harm?\\"<br /><br />And the latter, according to the statistics, is exactly the case.  On balance, guns among the population do more good and stop far more violence from occurring than they cause.<br /><br />The gun-control advocates, especially including the media, tend to use emotion-laden individual cases to make their point, but as Lott points out, the only responsible way to judge the situation, in a population of 275 million, is through the statistical approach, and to do a cost/benefit analysis.  In the case of privately owned firearms, the benefits hugely outnumber the the cost in lives, pain, and property.  Furthermore, privately owned firearms are the only clear, effective deterrent to crime--more than longer, tougher sentencing laws, capital punishment, and certainly more than gun-control which has never worked, anywhere.<br /><br />This is a fine book, and as with his last,\\"More Guns Less Crime,\\" is worth your time if you have an open mind.  If, however, you have your mind made up that gun-control is the only answer to all of our problems of violence and you view any other side as \\"gun culture\\" propaganda, then you should pass on this one.

It is one that I wish everyone could read--especially those who think that they have overcome a hard life.<br />Mei Liu was born in the Hunan Province of China in 1929--also, coincidentally, the year of my own birth. She and her family lived through those tumultous years in China before the country was unified under Sun Yat Sen and warlords ruled, as well as before the Japanese invasion and afterward the war between The Kuomintang (Nationalists) and Mao Tse-Tung's Eighth Route Marchers (Communists).<br />No one who was not in China in those days can possibly appreciate the conditions that the brave, resilient Chinese people lived through. I was there--as it happens, at the same time and in the same town as was Mei (Tsingtao, on the Shantung Peninsula to which she refers to by the new name Qingdao; the English spelling preferred by the current Communist government). I was stationed with the U.S. Marine Corps there for all of 1948--the last year The Nationalists held the mainland--thanks largely to the support our State Department gave Mao. I left shortly before Dr. Liu,in 1949.<br />Mei Liu escaped the communist takeover and went to Taiwan, as did many of my Chinese acquaintances, where she studied medicine. Eventually, she came to the United States where she pursued a distinguished career in neuropathology, divorced and singlehandedly raised her family.<br />In her later life, she returned to both Taiwan and Hunan where she taught and was re-united with many of her relatives.<br />Now, she is retired and lives in Honolulu.<br />This is a heartwarming, deeply affecting story of a brave woman who has survived much and has contributed enormously to science, the communities she has lived in and to her family. And, of course, to me. Simply reading her story has altered my own viewpoint on many things.<br />Please, do yourself a favor and read this one!<br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre, USN (RET)<br /><br />author of The Road to Damascus: Our Journey Through Eternity;<br />Handguns and Freedom...Their Care And Maintenance;<br />and other bookso Damascus: Our Journey Through Eternity;<BR>Handguns and Freedom...Their Care And Maintenance;<BR>and other books	2003-03-21

Thank God for Mona Charen! She reminds us, in this, her book, Useful Idiots, of the wrong-headed things that members of the liberal far-left said and did; things that some of us have apparently forgotten.<br /><br />In the Vietnam era alone, just to name one example in which they took the side of an enemy that was busily killing our servicemen, they abused the United States with their chants of \\"Ho,Ho,Ho Chi Minh!  The Viet Cong are going to win!\\" while waving the enemies' flag.<br /><br />Many of the anti-war \\"Political Pilgrims\\" went to North Vietnam and posed, smilingly looking through the sights of the NVA anti-aircraft guns,the purpose of which was to kill our airmen (Jane Fonda) and sneered at the suggestion that our POWs were being badly treated, while praising the \\"gentleness\\" of the enemy and comparing the United States (unfavorably) with the communist regime.  Were they punished, upon their return, for their treachery and traitorous behavior?  Far from it!  In the case of Fonda, she went on to a lucrative career as an admired actress and exercise guru.<br /><br />One such \\"war protester\\" who led anti-American rallies in London, and made an admiring trip to the socialist paradise, the Soviet Union, was rewarded by his countrymen by being elected President of the United States.  He admittedly \\"loathed\\" the armed services of which he became Commander-in-Chief!<br /><br />Who needs enemies, with friends like these?<br /><br />This book is not a diatribe, as some reviewers on the political left are fond of saying.  Nor is it filled with invective, or name-calling.  It is, rather, a history of many of the quotations of those who ALWAYS have taken the part of the communist regimes against our country, and always, always, always placed the blame on the country that nourished them and blessed them with privilege, wealth and comfort.<br /><br />Who are these people?  Here are some of the names in this book, along with their own  damning words.  Let their own quotes condemn them:  Ron Dellums, Susan Sontag, Bill Moyers, Jane Fonda, Dick Gregory, Donald Sutherland, Lillian Hellman, Owen Lattimore, George McGovern, David Crosby, John Kerry, Noam Chomsky, Graham Nash, Mary McGrory, Sidney Hook, Hendrick Hertzberg, George Ball, Seweryn Bialer,  Corliss Lamont, Peter Collier, David Horowitz, Ramsay Clark, Rev. William Sloan Coffin, Jr., Mary McCarthy, Jonathan Schell, Al Hubbard, Tom Downey, Phil Ochs, and of course Tom Hayden--the list is long.<br /><br />And, of course, those icons of the left leaning press who pushed their own agenda with more regard for their anti-war views than the truth as they reported the struggle in Vietnam: Walter Cronkite, Peter Arnett, Morley Safer, and many others.  This book is full of details that these folks must wish were forgotten<br /><br />Do I believe Mona Charen?  What is not to believe?  I remember hearing much of it myself, with absolute dismay at the time.<br /><br />In my case, I do not condemn the Democrat Party.  I know many patriotic Democrats.  The people Charen is pointing at are on the far-left.  They are the ones who have always admired communism, made excuses for its excesses and failures, and found nothing but guilt and reason to hate the land of their birth.<br /><br />This book should be an eye-opener for those young people who are not politically aligned as yet, and will benefit from identifying the enemy within, as well as both those in the Democrat and Republican Parties who represent the true values of middle America.  Those cynics who believe that this great country is the \\"World's Bully,\\" and not deserving of their love and allegiance should visit some of the other nations--especially those whose inhabitants are desperate to escape--and come to America.<br /><br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre, USN (Ret)<br /><br />author of Handguns and Freedom...Their Care and Maintenance<br />and other bookswn quotes condemn them:  Ron Dellums, Susan Sontag, Bill Moyers, Jane Fonda, Dick Gregory, Donald Sutherland, Lillian Hellman, Owen Lattimore, George McGovern, David Crosby, John Kerry, Noam Chomsky, Graham Nash, Mary McGrory, Sidney Hook, Hendrick Hertzberg, George Ball, Seweryn Bialer,  Corliss Lamont, Peter Collier, David Horowitz, Ramsay Clark, Rev.

It is a fascinating look at some of the details of hatching and raising birds, but it could use some illustrations.

They are apparently willing to accept the innate physical differences of the various races: the oriental eye-fold of the Asian, the longer limbs and typical steatopygia of the African, and the various skin color differences--and probably they will even acknowledge the undeniable genetically generated athletic prowess of African, but--heaven forbid!--one should never acknowledge that there may be racial mental propensities as well!<br /><br />Pinker points out that both nature and nurture come into play in forming the individual human being, as well as the culture within which he dwells.<br /><br />The social \\"sciences\\" ignore the formative realities of human existence because it is \\"politically incorrect\\" to do so these days.  A pseudo-scientific version of \\"All men are created equal,\\" which in the Declaration of Independence related to their position in the eyes of God, not their physical or mental capacities, which would have been an asinine assumption.<br /><br />In so doing they are blind to the facts, and even distort them purposely on occasion, as did Margaret Mead in her \\"studies\\" of Pacific Islanders in which she clearly falsified their sexual and child-rearing practices to make her point, as has been demonstrated in more recent studies of the same peoples, and verified by some of the very subjects of her work, who laughed at her statements.<br /><br />Until the social sciences clean up their act and face reality, their hopes for status as a true science will never be established, and they will continue to be viewed with amusement, not only by practitioners of the true sciences, who measure and are able to replicate their theories, but by the well-informed layman as well.<br /><br />Joseph Pierrees, which would have been an asinine assumption.<br /><br />In so doing they are blind to the facts, and even distort them purposely on occasion, as did Margaret Mead in her \\"studies\\" of Pacific Islanders in which she clearly falsified their sexual and child-rearing practices to make her point, as has been demonstrated in more recent studies of the same peoples, and verified by some of the very subjects of her work, who laughed at her statements.<br /><br />Until the social sciences clean up their act and face reality, their hopes for status as a true science will never be established, and they will continue to be viewed with amusement, not only by practitioners of the true sciences, who measure and are able to replicate their theories, but by the well-informed layman as well.<br /><br />Joseph Pierre<br />	2003-02-21

Of course many in the West have sought it out as a source of ancient pornography, but the artwork represented in this book is not as anatomically correct as that which can be found in Playboy or Hustler, and therefore is less useful for voyeuristic titillation.  However, for the student of Eastern religions, especially the Tantric tradition, it will be found to be unsurpassed.<br /><br />The Hindi text, both in their calligraphy and the alphabet, and fully translated into English, is beautifully done.

The writing is good, and no doubt the propaganda he is dishing out is effective, especially to those urbanites who live in cities where guns are virtually banned, and therefore the inhabitants are ready-made defenseless victims for the predators in their midst who have no respect for the law and are therefore armed--and consequently, because of their lack of self-protection they are often victimized; and Josh Sugarmann is that rarity, a gun-banner who demonstrates in the first chapter that he has at least a minimal understanding of the mechanics of firearms.<br />So, we can stipulate that he is glib, probably intelligent, and that he knows full well what he is up to. He quotes two other sources of misinformation--Michael Bellesiles (who has recently been \\"outed\\" as a complete fraud with his book, Arming America: The Origins of a National Gun Culture)and the infamous Dr. Arthur L. Kellerman, who came up with the \\"statistic\\" that a handgun in the home is 43 times more likely to kill a family member or acquaintance than an assailant. A statistic that resulted from a totally discredited \\"study,\\" and a \\"statistic\\" which the nation's leading expert on the subject, Dr. Gary Kleck--a criminologist--described as absolutely ridiculous.<br />There is no point in arguing with these people and their so-called statistical \\"evidence,\\" since their main argument is to the emotions, rather than the intellect, and is aimed at an audience of urbanites who, for the most part, have little or no knowledge or experience of their own with firearms.<br />But, the thing about Sugarmann, Kellerman and Bellesiles that is most disturbing to me is that these men are well-educated and intelligent and know what they are doing: they are trying to destroy our God-given natural right to defend ourselves--a right recognized and affirmed in the Bill of Rights (the first ten amendments to the Constitution of the United States). They know what they are doing.<br />So, this book is well-designed, well-written, and well-presented; but it is pure garbage. Absolute propaganda. Know that going in, if you intend to buy it.

Having been involved in the publication of seven books myself (three of my own), I understand the frustrations encountered in the editing process, especially the small publishers' deficiencies in that regard. Many do no editing at all. One might expect a better effort from Touchstone Press. However, the minor discrepancies in this book did not disturb me as much as some others who have reviewed it. I found enough truth and insight in it to make it a valuable addition to my library.<br /><br /> Lehman was born in 1942, fourteen years after me, but he has a very good grasp on the historical Navy. He was Secretary of the Navy from 1981-'87. I was especially interested in his comments on the era between the end of the Second World War and the beginning of the Vietnamese struggle; the clash between the civilians (politicians) who are constitutionally in charge of the Navy, and are usually neither trained nor equipped to formulate military strategy but rarely realize it, and the professional military minds who have experienced battle, studied strategy and tactics in War College and from their colleagues, and who are, unfortunately for all of us, dictated to by the former. Sometimes, as with Korea and Vietnam, notably, with disastrous results.<br /><br />Lehman particularly describes, without rancor or emotion, the role that Harry S. Truman had in devastatingly disemboweling our Navy after WWII--a time when I was a career man in the Navy and effected by his decisions--and his basic dislike for the naval service. In the First War, he had been a 2nd Lieutenant in the Army, and resented the Admirals and the Navy. Lehman also describes the role that Truman and the politicians around him had in destroying James Forrestal, Secretary of the Navy and later the first Secretary of Defense--eventually leading to his mental breakdown and suicide.<br /><br />I was not disturbed, personally, when he fired Douglas MacArthur, whom I served under while he was de-facto Emperor of Japan and whom I considered to be a walking, talking ego, as did most others who served in Japan and Korea under him at the time. His Inchon landing escapade--usually noted as a brilliant tactic by historians and a sycophantic press because it succeeded--was pure luck. There can be no question about that, and his decision to hit the other side of Korea at Wonsan was an unnecessary strategic disaster, which is also not subject to question, as Lehman notes, since that location was taken overland before the amphibious landing could take place through the harbor minefield, where we lost two of three minesweepers in the process of trying to clear the 3,000 mines there.<br /><br /> Truman had an immense ego, unmatched, unfortunately, by accompanying mental vigor, and his attention to foreign policy and his knowledge of strategy was sporadic. MacArthur, who was also ego-centric, irritated him by being late to a meeting in the Pacific, and his insistence that we hit the communists where they were hurting us--north of the Yalu. However, his failure to believe his own intelligence officers who told him the Chinese were in Korea, was another major disaster. Truman's hesitation to let him cross the Yalu was due to his fear that we would anger the USSR.<br /><br />They were already supplying the Chinese with MiG-15s and the pilots to fly them. Like, when you are in a fistfight, you don't want to hit your opponent too hard, or you'll make him mad.<br /><br />I am no idle reader concerning this period. I came home in a stretcher on a hospital plane with a bunch of First Marines from the \\"Frozen Chosin,\\" who had been fighting in 40 below weather against an entire Chinese army. Most of them were due for amputations from severe frostbite.<br /><br />Had it not been for Forrestal's early grasp of the situation vis a vis the USSR, and his struggle to keep an effective naval service, we'd have been in deeper trouble thanwe were at the time. Truman wanted to completely decommission the entire Marine Corps, and but for Forrestal's efforts, he would probably have succeeded. In those days, they thought that the atom bomb was all we needed.<br /><br />It was much the same in Vietnam, where the personal approval of Lyndon Johnson, was required before Navy pilots could hit a secondary target if for any reason they could not attack their primary target. The infamous \\"Rules of Engagement\\" in Vietnam, as well as Korea, cost us dearly and delighted our enemies who had no such restraints. The eagerness of politicians to cover their own political gluteus maximi has cost the lives of thousands of our warriors.<br /><br />Our warriors never lost a battle, but--we lost the war in Vietnam. Go figure!<br /><br />All of the above are detailed in this book. The personal political strife between politicians and our battle-trained warriors is, seemingly, never ending. Constitutionally, the politicians are entitled to lead, but by nature they are rarely qualified for the task.<br /><br />The contrast is seen in the so-called \\"Desert War\\", where George Bush, who had been a combat naval aviator, had the wisdom to turn his military people loose to do their job without interference. We enjoyed fewer casualties there than in any other war in history. His big mistake was to intercede and stop our victorious army before the job was completed, for political reasons. Now, we will probably have to finish the job without the, at least nominal, help of our \\"allies,\\" again having to amass the troops, ships, tanks, materiel and supply lines which were all in place in 1990.

This book deals with just about any motorcycle you will find on the market.  It goes into detail on their history, mechanics, operation, their (relatively) safe use, and gives some good advice on what to buy and what not to buy as a first motorcycle.<br /><br />On the latter subject, the author (Darwin Holstrom) advises the newcomer to stay away from the big twin cruisers and touring bikes--because of their weight, not because of their engine size and power.  And they are heavy!  My 2000 Kawasaki Vulcan Nomad (90 cu. in.) weighs in at about 750 lbs, wet.  Add 350 lbs. of rider and passenger and some underwear and shaving gear, and you're at over half a ton on two wheels.<br /><br />There are advantages: with such a large machine--especially if it is well-lighted, you are more likely to be seen by drivers of automobiles, who are responsible for most of the mayhem that happens to motorcyclists.<br /><br />This is an excellent book, written by a man who is quite obviously very knowledgeable about the subject matter. He claims over twenty years of motorcycling experience.  It covers just about every aspect of motorcycling that you can think of, including street strategies (apologies to David Hough), riding in the dirt, hill climbing, touring--you name it, it's in here. A very entertaining and enlightening book.<br /><br />The Complete Idiot's Guide to Motorcycles is replete with inumerable photos, drawings, cartoons and witicisms, as well as a very complete glossary of terms and an index of subject matter covered.

At 20,000 miles a year average, which is about what I put on the odometer these days, that's 50 years of driving.  In my case, I have about 60 years of driving experience.  I'm older than David Hough.<br /><br />That's a lot of motorcycling, and in his case, judging by the two books of his that I've read, I believe him.  He is obviously a very experienced rider, and his advice is very good.  He is passing along his experience and wisdom on avoiding road rash, and it would be well to heed it.<br /><br />His other book which I have read and recommend, is Street Strategies.  It is sort of a condensed version of Proficient Motorcycling.  There will be another one out shortly, they say, which will be titled More Proficient Motorcycling.  I will buy that one, as well.<br /><br />To learn from others is wiser than to have to learn everything yourself from your own experience, especially when the most important lessons are usually the result of bruises, or worse.  When I bought my first motorcycle--a Honda CB250 &quot;Hawk&quot; back in the mid-'sixties, I had a totally inexperienced instructor--me.  My next was a (very) used 1946 74 cu.in. Harley-Davidson knucklehead, with a suicide clutch and a tank shift.  I have also owned a little trail 55cc Honda.  Today, I ride a 2000 90 cu.in. Kawasaki Vulcan Nomad.  How times have changed!  I'm signed up for a motorcycle riding class, because I figure there are still a lot of things to learn.<br /><br />Motorcycling is not the safest mode of transportation, but it is fun, and if you stay on top, it's a good way to stay young and vital.<br /><br />So, buy this book and learn about how to avoid the pitfalls and keep on enjoying the freedom of motorcycling.  Proficient Motorcycling is full of photos, drawings, facts and figures and safety tips, entertainingly written and illustrated. You won't regret buying it.<br /><br />Joe Pierre<br /><br />author of Handguns and Freedom ..their care and maintenanceis full of photos, drawings, facts and figures and safety tips, entertainingly written and illustrated.

Bernard Goldberg has written a good, truthful book from the standpoint of an insider--a well-known insider to all of us, with nearly 30 years in front of the camera--telling us, as he says himself, that the TV network news has a \\"liberal bias [that] is so blatantly true that it's hardly worth discussing anymore.\\"<br /><br />So, why is he discussing it?<br /><br />Well, for one thing he wrote a 'whistle-blower' Op-Ed piece in the Wall Street Journal back in 1996 admitting to that well-known bias, that cost him his job at CBS News and that incurred the undying hatred of Dan Rather, of whose own bias, Goldberg says, Rather is not even aware.<br /><br />The obvious bias of the media elite, and the reason behind it, is a subject that I have wondered about in my own book, \\"Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenance.\\"  Why are the vast majority of the elite media icons so liberal?  Is it because it is the political disease of all urbanites, or because of their liberal professors in the journalism schools?  Goldberg has perhaps hit the nail on the head.  He thinks it is because everyone with whom they associate think alike, and they are not even aware of their bias, but think that they are simply \\"middle of the road,\\" because they simply do not meet any other view in their circle of friends and acquaintances, and because they see everyone who is conservative as \\"right-wing nuts,\\" a term that includes everyone who does not agree with their leftist world-view.<br /><br />Goldberg gives an example of such provincialism--he quotes New Yorker film critic Pauline Kael, who in 1972 couldn't figure how Richard Nixon had won the presidency.  \\"I can't believe it!\\" she said.  \\"I don't know a single person who voted for him!\\"  Nixon carried forty-nine of the fifty states to McGovern's one.<br /><br />Goldberg's point, and I think it is accurate, is that--as New Yorker's tend to think of themselves as the center of the universe, and everyplace else as 'flyover country,' and as John Podhoretz has said, they \\"can easily go through life never meeting anybody who has a thought different from their own,\\" so it is with The Mighty Journalism Elite.  There is no plot, no conscious conspiracy, they simply think alike.  As several polls have shown, 98-percent of them consistently vote for the most liberal candidate in every election.  They are even more liberal than their constituency.  His point is well taken.<br /><br />All this from a man who, as Goldberg says of himself, \\"I have never voted for a Republican candidate for president in my entire life!\\"<br /><br />As for Goldberg's book, BIAS, if it has a flaw it is probably that it is, perhaps understandably, too polemical.  He paints an ugly picture of Rather, not only as a biased liberal, but also as an intolerant, mean-spirited, arrogant bully whom even the network executives fear.  His treatment of Connie Chung (because she got more air-time than Rather during the Oklahoma City bombing incident, during which time he was on vacation) was indefensible if accurately portrayed, and caused her to be fired--all due to his jealous egotism.<br /><br />So, much of this book--particularly the first part--comes off as primarily a personal defense and an apparent attempt to justify what many of his co-workers characterize as disloyalty.  But, as the book develops, and he expands on his thesis--that the elite media is biased toward the liberal view, on the social and cultural issues as well as politically, the case he builds is pretty much inarguable.<br /><br />But then, it has been so obvious that, as Bernie Goldberg says, \\"it's hardly worth discussing anymore.\\"<br /><br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre<br /><br />author of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenanceand as John Podhoretz has said, they \\"can easily go through life never meeting anybody who has a thought different from their own,\\" so it is with The Mighty Journalism Elite.

This book covers the whole gamut.  It discusses the history of the motorcycle, including several facts of which I was unaware; engine configurations; how to get the most power from your motorcycle; categories of motorcycles; advice on buying (not so much brands, as types); accessorizing your bike; clothing and protective gear; how to ride and how NOT to ride; potential disasters (like a synopsis of Hough); preventive maintenance and repairs; and group riding.<br /><br />In the back of the book the author includes a very complete appendix on clubs and associations, alphabetically by state, as well as a very complete index of subject matter.<br /><br />The book is very well written, in plain, matter-of-fact English, without pretense, and replete with several lack and white photographs--and a few pages in color--although I noticed that they heavily favored the Harley-Davidson motorcycles.  (There were also several Suzukis, a couple Moto-Guzzis and a BMW or two, but Kawasaki and Yamaha were conspicuous by their absence in the black and whites, although Yamaha was represented in the color section.)<br /><br />Although I own a Kawasaki Vulcan Nomad, I didn't feel slighted, because the text was full of good advice no matter what cycle you are interested in, whether it's chain, belt or shaft drive.  For repair or service details he recommends the service manual and owner's manual for your particular bike, which only makes sense.<br /><br />Author Drew has twenty years of experience (it says on the back cover)as a motorcycle writer and mechanic, and he has an obvious predilection for Harleys.  He's owned eight motorcycles.<br /><br />I think this is an excellent book to have in your library whether or not you own a motorcycle, but would be especially invaluable if you do own and ride one.  It contains lots of excellent advice which, if followed, could save untold misery and even, perhaps, your life.<br /><br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre<br /><br />author of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenance<br /><br />and other bookshor of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenance<BR><BR>and other books	2003-01-22

Although THE BREAKAWAY POPE is masquerading as fiction, it is much more than simply a story about a fictional pope.<br /><br />John Cantwell Kiley is that rarity, a man who holds doctorates in both philosophy and medicine.  He is the recipient and beneficiary of the finest educational resources available to a human being on the planet, and is the author of several books, including EINSTEIN AND AQUINAS: A RAPPROCHMENT; EQUILIBRIUM; HEART OF A SURGEON; and SELF RESCUE--the latter a best seller that was chosen book of the month by Psychology Today magazine in 1990.  His books have boasted introductions by such luminaries as William F. Buckley, Jr., and M. Scott Peck, author of THE ROAD LESS TRAVELED.<br /><br />First, last and always, Kiley is a metaphysician, and so this book is primarily a metaphysical discourse.  Unlike most fiction, it boasts voluminous appendices, posing questions such as, \\"Why is Egoism true madness?\\", \\"What is Enlightenment?\\", \\"How is Eternity Entered?\\" and many others.  Questions that are deep and strike at the heart of human existence.<br /><br />There is also a Glossary at the end of the book, dealing with common terms and the author's sometimes uncommon definitions, which are based upon his own beliefs and understanding.<br /><br />So, while the story line is important, involving the successor to the present pope, John Paul II--a successor named after the original Pope, the Apostle Peter--who is faced with a world unlike any that previous popes have encountered including the possibility of thermonuclear war, it serves primarily as a vehicle for Kiley's own philosophy, from which there is much to be learned by anyone with less understanding of the issues discussed--which includes most of us.<br /><br />The church heirarchy, upon which the story is founded, is not an unfamiliar subject to the author, who is himself an ordained priest (of the Eastern Rite, although he was raised a Roman--a different apostolic succession--and Roman Catholic priests attended his ordination.)<br /><br />This is probably not a story that will have wide appeal to those who simply wish to be entertained by a shallow love story, or murder mystery, but I predict that it will be greatly appreciated by thoughtful people with advanced education or interest in philosophy, ontology, and the great questions that have long mesmerized the philosophical minds among us.<br /><br />The introduction is by William F.

The book is full of diagrams similar to those one makes for an accident report, showing the vehicles involved and the path they follow leading to collison or other problems.<br /><br />There are the sharks, who drive agressively, tailgate and swerve in and out of traffic: accidents looking for a place to happen.  Then there are the left-turn artists who either don't see or ignore the cyclist coming at them.  There are the dopey drivers who are oblivious to their surroundings, or those who are primping or talking on the cell phone as they drive.  He describes them all and gives good advice on how to handle them, and you can follow with him--especially if you have already experienced some or all of them.<br /><br />This book is equally applicable to automobile drivers, in many cases--the main difference being that they have some armor around them, although it is far more flimsy than most of them realize.<br /><br />I have ridden motorcycles over the years, and my latest is a cruiser that is well lighted, weighs 743 lbs., and is almost as large as a car--and a lot quicker.  It is more visible than a small sport bike, but it is still vulnerable.  I had a lady pull out in front of me from a supermarket parking lot when I was traveling at about 25 miles an hour who, when she saw my front wheel stopped about two inches from her driver's side door, turned white as chalk.<br /><br />On another occasion a lady pulled out of a mall driveway onto a five-lane street, crossed three lanes, pulled diagonally in front of a stopped bus waiting for a light to change (which obstructed the vision of the Harley rider who was alongside the bus one lane over.  Instead of pulling temporarily into the buses' lane until she could ascertain what might be coming up on her right, she crossed in front of the bus--and the bike--apparently trying to get into the curb lane to make a right turn at the next intersection.  The bike didn't have a chance.  At about 25 MPH he plowed into her passenger side door, messing up his expensive custom bike and breaking his leg in the process.<br /><br />These are two types of things that I have witnessed, both of which are described in Hough's book.<br /><br />Do I recommend this book to you?

Well, we do--by accident--but we don't need their books to know what they think.  All that is necessary is to read the daily newspaper (any daily newspaper, with few exceptions) or turn on the television, or watch any Hollywood movie.  We're deluged with their message!<br /><br />And, I know in advance that this review will be panned by some who hold the philosophy that Flynn excoriates.  That's to be expected.  They won't pan it because the book is badly written, or because his references are inaccurate, or his research is faulty; it will only be because they don't want to hear it.<br /><br />Daniel Flynn's book is informative, and I found in it some names that surprised me.  Yes, he gives the lefties' names, quotes, dates and places.  He has meticulously researched his statements.<br /><br />There are, as he points out, a bunch of left-wingers out there who hate their country, and take every opportunity to disparage it and tear down its institutions; who burn the flag, scorn patriotism, and invariably support the regimes that would destroy their own country.  Flynn names many of them, and quotes their statements.  He also attempts to explain their motivation.  If there is any doubt in your mind that such people exist, or if you have suspected it but don't know who they are then I suggest that you read this book.

I think I first read ATLAS SHRUGGED thirty or so years ago, and it had an impact on me, and later, when I loaned it to my son (now 50) it had an impact on him, too.  Ayn Rand had a political philosophy she called &quot;objectivism&quot; which she thought would be presented to advantage in a fiction book.<br /><br />As many have noted here, she was not a great fiction writer, but she got her idea across.  As fiction, the book was lacking in many ways.  She was given to long-winded speeches exposing her philosophy, and of course she was dead set against socialism--which endears her to many, including me, and she was an advocate of enlightened self-interest which, when closely examined, is a positive force in the world.  Of course, the socialists think that they are guiltless, or would like to be, when it comes to selfishness--but they are kidding themselves.<br /><br />I have a recently published book, titled &quot;HANDGUNS AND FREEDOM...Their Care and Maintenance,&quot; which I recently sent to a friend as a gift because he is a wonderfully skilled writer and a fellow conservative. He sent me a check for the full retail price with the following message,<br /><br />&quot;I'm sure you've heard Rush [Limbaugh] giving away a free year's subscription to his newsletter to one of his callers.  I've always waited to hear one of them say, 'I'll send a check for my subscription, since I pay for what I want and for those things of value that I receive.'  Enclosed is my check.<br /><br />&quot;Perhaps it's a hangover from a book that I'm almost finished reading, after having it sit unread on my shelf for years --'ATLAS SHRUGGED,' by Ayn Rand.&quot;<br />Here's a man who practices what he preaches.  The world would be better off with more like him, in my opinion.<br /><br />As for Ayn Rand, as I recall she was Russian born, and had a colorful life.  She was often the center of controversy, but there can be little doubt that she, like my friend, believed in what she said.  I've read others of her books, including &quot;THE FOUNTAINHEAD,&quot; &quot;THE NEW INTELLECTUAL,&quot; and other of her writings.  It may be true that she was an idealist, or a utopian, but I'd greatly prefer her version of an ideal world to that of the socialists who prefer equality of result to equality of opportunity, and transfer of wealth from those who work hard for what they have to those who hardly work at all.<br /><br />There is an old saying, &quot;The society that robs Peter to pay Paul, can always count on the support of Paul.&quot;  There are a lot of 'Paul's' in America today.<br /><br />I recommend her books highly, but keep in mind that, in my opinion, their chief value is in the philosophy presented, and not in her skill as a fiction writer.

Not surprisingly, reviewers of this book either love it or hate it--give it 5 stars (as have I) or 1 star, and those who do the latter protest because they can't give it no stars at all.<br /><br />The reason?  Ann Coulter writes passionately, and she minces no words--she is a conservative, and she dislikes the liberals' polemics, which she claims are mainly lies, ad hominem attacks and slander--a claim she backs up very effectively with detailed quotes, naming names and places.<br /><br />She discusses, in detail, the left-leaning elite media and gives examples of the way in which they ignore people with whom they disagree, like Phyllis Schlafly, and build up liberals like Gloria Steinem, who--according to Coulter--is a ridiculous figure and a failure at all she attempts, who had to sleep with a media mogul to get money to keep her magazine, Ms., going.<br /><br />And, yes, she names him.<br /><br />Love it or hate it, this is a book to reckon with.  It is certainly polemical, but she lists her sources, names names, gives explicit quotes, and makes her argument hard to refute.  The result?  Liberal readers go nuts!  They can't argue with her, so they indulge in name-calling and disparage her parenthood--the very things she says they do, in the book, rather than make coherent arguments.<br /><br />When they don't like what they hear from someone who accuses one of their icons--i.e.: Linda Tripp, Paula Jones or Catherine Harris--they attack their looks, calling them \\"ugly and evil,\\" \\"a snitch, and an ugly one at that,\\" \\"Barracudaville,\\" or \\"smelling of gunpowder and garlic,\\" instead of refuting the accusations.  \\"This,\\" says Coulter, \\"from the party of Bella Abzug.\\"<br /><br />She makes a good case for media bias, as well, and says that the elite media is far more liberal than even the Democrat constituency.  And she pretty much makes an irrefutable case for her claims.<br /><br />So, as a conservative--biased as I am--I think it is a good book.  From my standpoint, it reads like the truth.  But then, I am, as the liberals would say, just a \\"Redneck\\" in \\"Flyover\\" country; not a Hollywood star, like Sean Penn, with vast knowledge of foreign affairs.

Many of us have hungered for a book like this for a long time--a reasonable voice that explains our conservatism<br />in plain language that anyone can understand, and that exposes the fallacies inherent in the liberal political view.<br /><br />Hannity points out that American liberals are not evil or anti-American, only misled and mistaken in their goals and policies.<br />His book is endorsed, on the back cover, by such conservative stalwarts as William J. Bennett, Rush Limbaugh, Dr.James C.Dobson and Newt Gingrich. The book<br />is also endorsed by former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who says of it:<br /><br />\\"LET FREEDOM RING is a cogent plea for the moral clarity and courage needed to defeat the militant terrorism that imperils our civilization. Hannity minces no<br />words, and is at once provocative and thought provoking. He should be read by supporters and opponents alike, and those interested in the debate over the future<br />direction of free societies.\\"<br /><br />Quite an endorsement, coming from a political head of another sovereign nation. Mr. Netanyahu understands both the common enemy and the stakes involved,<br />having spent his adult life fighting them.<br /><br />A few short months ago, before the holocaust of last September, some of the harsh things about liberalism that Hannity says might have seemed like reckless<br />exaggeration; however, since that date Americans have awakened to the reality that the greatest threat against us, and our greatest enemy is not, as Albert Gore<br />stated in his book, Earth in the Balance, the \\"growing concentration of carbon dioxide now circling the earth.\\" Nor is it American families and workers exercising<br />their freedom by driving their automobiles, trucks and SUVs. Rather, as September 11th, 2001, has shown us, there are more immediate concerns than the fate of<br />the Spotted Owl.<br /><br />According to Hannity, protecting our air, land, and water from pollution is certainly important, but protecting our homeland from crazed, rabid, suicidal terrorists who<br />hate us not for anything we've done but simply for what we are, and who clap their hands and dance with joy at the news that they've killed 3,000 innocent men,<br />women and children simply because they are Americans, is of more immediate importance.<br /><br />It is hard to argue with that sentiment.<br /><br />In this book, Hannity goes to great length to explain the deficiencies and incongruities of the liberal philosophy, and looks at some of the great mistakes made by the<br />last liberal administration--such as refusing an offer by Sudan to turn over Osama bin Laden in 1996, not once but several<br />times.<br /><br />This is a truly important book. For conservatives, it is \\"preaching to the choir\\" although it will be informative, and to those of the liberal persuasion it will be anathema,<br />and if they deign to give it any notice, it will likely be a vindictive rant. But, if there is anyone left with an open mind it should be of interest.<br /><br />As for me, I am frankly part of the choir.<br /><br />Joseph Pierreand water from pollution is certainly important, but protecting our homeland from crazed, rabid, suicidal terrorists who<BR>hate us not for anything we've done but simply for what we are, and who clap their hands and dance with joy at the news that they've killed 3,000 innocent men,<BR>women and children simply because they are Americans, is of more immediate importance.<br /><br />It is hard to argue with that sentiment.<br /><br />In this book, Hannity goes to great length to explain the deficiencies and incongruities of the liberal philosophy, and looks at some of the great mistakes made by the<BR>last liberal administration--such as refusing an offer by Sudan to turn over Osama bin Laden in 1996, not once but several <BR>times.<br /><br />This is a truly important book.

This is a detailed examination of case after case after case, where armed citizens refused to be victims, thereby saving not only their own lives, but the lives of others as well.<br />The National Rifle Association has been running a dozen such stories every month in their publications for years, under the headline The Armed Citizen, but their cases are taken from daily newspapers with little other information. Robert Waters has done more; he has personally interviewed many people involved in such incidents, and this book is the result.<br />As Waters points out, a problem exists which results in many people rejecting the concept of self-defense with a firearm, and that is the fact that the elite media in this country (and elsewhere) typically are anti-firearm. That is, being preponderantly politically liberal, they do not believe or accept that the public should be armed for its own defense, as the Bill of Rights states. In fact, because the Second Amendment states that \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed,\\" they assert that it is the government's right to bear arms that is protected, rather than the right of the people--thinking that the militia is an arm of the government. They ignore the plain fact that all citizens are part of the militia, and that the National Guard is NOT a militia, but an arm of the government.<br />The elite media do slant the news to fit their own view, with the result that these incidents are not national news and are only found in local dailiesand on the local TV news. Only the criminal shootings make it to the national news, with the result that the public gets a distorted view. There are far more unreported cases of firearms being used for defense than reported cases of guns being used for criminal purposes.<br />In fact, Waters says, the Bill of Rights is all about protecting the people from the government, and not the other way around.<br />Like many others, I personally believe that the requirement that a citizen of the United States have a permit to carry concealed is unconstitutional on its face, since such a license costs money--sometimes a significant amount of money--and that is clearly an infringement on an inalienable right. But, because it is an uphill battle against \\"city hall,\\" I, like many others, paid my money and got the permit.<br />Oddly, in the state of Oregon, where I reside, no permit is required to carry a pistol openly in a holster, but a permit is required to carry concealed! I submit that carrying openly is an implied threat which makes others uneasy--especially in cities where the inhabitants are typically ignorant where firearms are concerned; whereas no one feels threatened by the carry of a concealed weapon since they do not know of its existence.<br />The whole thing is exactly backwards, and yet even the NRA and other constitutionalists are going along with it.<br />Some of Waters interviewees make the same point.<br />The best point that Waters makes in this book is his refutation of the old liberal saw that private gun ownership is dangerous, when as he points out so well, exactly the opposite is true, as he says in his title. Guns SAVE lives; thousands of lives.<br />He details one five day period with 12 local newspaper stories of incidents where people saved their own lives and the lives of others through the use of their privately owned firearms to stop predators. They not only saved their own lives, as he points out, but also the lives that those same predators would likely have taken in the future had they not been stopped in their tracks. Many of the people they saved who would have been future victims are no doubt political liberals and advocates of banning the private ownership of firearms themselves, who have no idea of the debt they owe.<br />This is certainly a valuable book.<br />Joseph Pierre<br />editor, George Tooley's Beginners Book on How to Handle Firearms Safely<br />author of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenance<br />and other booksto Handle Firearms Safely<BR>author of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenance<BR>and other books	2002-10-01

It is a self-published book, very well written and extensively researched. The author has assembled a great many facts about the Vietnam War, including the designations of various military groups involved, and has obviously studied several conspiracy theories closely. In other words, the story has a plausible ring--an essential of all good fiction.<br />Whether the author, Harold Thomas Beck, has any actual personal military experience is open to question, but his book is highly readable.<br />The story revolves around the life of one Charley Reed and his various loves who all seemed to think he was the greatest lover since Don Juan. But Charley, a Green Beret, or \\"snake-eater\\" as they were known by most Vietnam veterans, was killed in an auto accident--or was he?<br />There is a great deal of sex in the book, with well-written and highly explicit accounts of the details of the act. In fact, most of the characters seem to be veritable sex machines, copulating at the drop of a hat--and the hat seems to drop almost continuously; so much so that the depiction of the act becomes tedious. It was the only aspect of the book that seemed totally implausible to me.<br />The action moves along well, and the author manages to work in details of the the explosion of TWA flight 800, blaming terrorists; the twin towers holocaust of September 11th, 2001; and allusions to the assassination of John Kennedy, making Lyndon Johnson an accomplice,whom he also accuses of manufacturing the Gulf of Tonkin incident for which there is some good evidence, much as Lincoln is reputed to have pushed North Carolina into firing on Fort Sumpter and FDR pushed the Japanese into attacking us--in each case to prepare the country emotionally for war.<br />The book is extremely unflattering to the Johnson administration, to say the least, in spite of the fact that the author seems also to hold conservatives in low esteem.<br />This is a good novel. One has to keep in mind constantly that, as the author says, \\"It should not be construed as anything but fiction.\\" Too often, perhaps, readers of really good fiction come away with the idea that an author's daydream is based on fact.

The author, Walter J. Williams, has done a massive amount of research on the subject and opens each chapter with letters and news articles written by observers of that massive quake,during which the Mississippi actually was caused to run backwards for a period, due to the shifting of elevations in its bed.<br /><br />As Williams explains, most earthquakes are caused by the twenty-two mile thick platelets of the earth's crust--floating on the near liquid molten material under them, like the skin on hot milk--colliding; for example the Pacific plate pushing inexorably under the North American plate on the Pacific Coast, as was true of those along the San Andreas fault, especially the great San Francisco Earthquake of 1906 and the subsequent California earthquakes and others in the States of Washington and Oregon. The resulting slippage and the resistance of the continental plate has created the Coast Range and the Cascade and Sierra ranges of mountains with their concomitant boils and pimples, the volcanoes that periodically erupt there.<br /><br />The great rift that runs under the Mississippi River, however, is different. It is the result of an ancient attempt by the continent to separate into two continents, which failed but left a great weakened fault line running from Cape Girardeau, Missouri, to the Gulf of Mexico, called the New Madrid Fault. Other fault lines spread out from it like strands on a spider web.<br /><br />The last big quake there caused little loss of human life, due to the fact that it was only lightly populated. In this story, however, the author predicates another (inevitable, the only question is 'when?') quake on the New Madrid fault, which triggers slippage of the adjacent fault lines as well, causing a mammoth 8.9 (on the Richter scale) earthquake--about the largest release of energy of which the earth is capable, one thousand four hundred times as powerful as a 5.5 quake--in the heavily industrialized and populated Mississippi basin.<br /><br />The story follows many characters, all well drawn and easy to identify with, both before, during, and after the earthquake. He also has done a magnificent job of plotting the very plausible collateral effects: floods as the levies fail, fire from the inevitable gas line ruptures and butane tank spills, as well as downed electric and phone lines, totally disrupting communications. Other issues are deadly mixtures of chemicals in a chemical plant like sulphuric acid and carbon tetrachloride (cleaning fluid) resulting in phosgene gas, killing thousands, and the near total destruction of a nuclear power plant.<br /><br />Altogether, the story is spell-binding as well as educational. Reading it, one can project the things that might result from any major natural disaster, and thus make some preparations \\"just in case.\\"<br /><br />More than that, other mind-bending scenes--like the protagonist who is stranded in a cottonwood tree surrounded by the flooding Mississippi and finds himself face to face with a large, aggressive cottonmouth moccasin intent upon killing him.<br /><br />The characters are diverse, from an aerospace engineer to a morose teenage boy who loves to skate, to an End Times preacher who has prepared for years for the \\"tribulation\\" stockpiling food and guns and ammunition, to a futures speculator on the market, to a Gateway Arch guide, to a racist sheriff, to a managing engineer of a nuclear power plant and more.

It mainly dealt with the reactions of people to the disaster, which included the failure of law and order.<br /><br />Another fine one was Alas Babylon, by Pat Frank, which dealt with the reactions of the people in a small Florida town following a destructive atomic war.<br /><br />And of course, there was On the Beach by Nevil Shute, which also dealt with a post atomic war world and an American submarine crew stranded in Australia, where the physical effects of the radiation in the northern hemisphere was delayed by coriolis force.<br /><br />In this book, the world-destroying catastrophe was a huge comet which struck the earth, resulting in total destruction of much of the world through tsunamis, earthquakes, torrential salt rains, and the resulting loss of millions of lives and of all government, national state and local, and hence of all governmental controls and functions.  Impotent police, firemen, and elected functionaries; everything and everyone whose function was to maintain order are gone or reduced to non-entities.<br /><br />Money is worthless, food and other essentials like clothes and gasoline are scarce and generally go to the strongest or the best armed.

There is no electric power, and candlelight replaces it for lighting.<br /><br />The book deals with the lives, before and after, of several people, from a country mailman to a U.S. senator, and of course the astronomers,  astronauts and others who were intimately involved as well as vignettes of secondary characters as the story develops.<br /><br />The character development is excellent, and the book absolutely captured me.

In hardcover, the pages are silver, the dark blue typography is a beautiful old-style Roman, perhaps Garamond or Times, good-sized and leaded out for easy readability.  And the illustrations are unsurpassed.<br /><br />First, the illustrator:  Gustave Dore was born in 1832, sixty years after the birth of Coleridge.  He died in 1883.  Coleridge preceded him in death by 49 years. Coleridge was born in 1772 and died in 1834.  Dore was born in Strasbourg, and was a renowned illustrator who was doing lithographs at the age of thirteen.<br /><br />The fact that Dore was a near contemporary of Coleridge is important because we can be assured that the characters' costumes in his illustrations reflect the actual dress of the time Coleridge was describing.  The ships also are correctly drawn and beautifully detailed.<br /><br />To say that his illustrations complement this classic epic poem is an understatement.<br /><br />As to the poet, some wag said once of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, that \\"a half-great poet had a wholly great day.\\"  I have also heard that Coleridge is supposed to have written his epic in one sitting, in a great burst of inspiration.  I can't vouch for that, but it is truly a masterpiece--of that there can be no doubt.<br /><br />I recall trying to memorize it when I was in high school, about sixty years ago.  I loved it then, and I still do now.<br /><br />For the price, this book is an absolute steal.  No library is complete without this poem, and of all the renditions I've seen of it, this is by far the most beautiful.	2002-08-18

The plot is good and the action moves right along. He is a skilled writer and has experience in the area in which his story is involved.  He was a Canadian military intelligence officer and electronics adviser to their National Defense Headquarters.<br /><br />The story revolves around the commanding officer of a Canadian fighter squadron, Lt. Cdr. Douglas White, a drug smuggling ring that uses a fake USAF base in Canada to fly drugs in from Mexico, and the shooting down of a Canadian Air Force Arcturus patrol plane by the drug smugglers fighter escorts (Russian built MiG  'Foxbats' showing USAF insignia.)  Commander White sets about to bring the mystery to resolution.<br /><br />Altogether, this is a good story which will hold your interest.  The cover art is good, and the publishers have done a good job, with only minor proofreading problems.  For example, the word 'dais,' (referring to a speaker's platform) is consistently misspelled 'dias,' and one character's name is variously spelled 'Concorde' and 'Concord.'  Small, insignificant errors that do not detract from the reading pleasure.<br /><br />Altogether, this is a fine story and I'm pleased that Mr. McTavish is working on his second novel.<br /><br />Joseph H.

The effete literati sneered at his work, and accused him of writing doggerel. But, the people have always loved his work.  He was truly a 'people's poet.'<br /><br /> His first volume of poetry, The Spell of the Yukon and Other Verses, sold out while it was still on the presses. Two of his ballads, The Shooting of Dan McGrew and The Cremation of Sam McGee, are among the most memorized poems in history.<br /><br />The Shooting of Dan McGrew alone made him a half-million dollars, which was a sizeable fortune in his time.  He never had to do manual labor for his bread again, after its publication.<br /><br />This volume of his work contains not only all of his best-known poems (those contained in both The Spell of the Yukon and his second, longer collection, Ballads of a Cheechako), but also many of the photographs of the famous Northwestern photographers, Clarke and Clarence Kinsey -- famous not only for the photography of the Klondike gold rush, but also for Clarke's later photographs of Pacific Northwest logging, some of which were included also in my father's book, When Timber Stood Tall.<br /><br />This is a high quality coffee table book that you will not only delight in reading before the fire on a winter's evening or when that confining office job is getting you down, but it will also display well on your coffee table, where it will draw friends' attention like a magnet.<br /><br />For Robert Service is, without a doubt, one of the best-loved of the world's poets. His poetry stands alongside that of Kipling, Coleridge and Poe in the public's affection.<br /><br />Joseph Pierre	2002-08-14

Indeed, for the last several generations of politicians it sometimes seems that principle has been replaced by expediency in our public servants.<br /><br />John Adams and Thomas Jefferson were, without any doubt at all, true geniuses who mastered a large variety of disciplines, from literature to philosophy, theology, governmental design, the mastery of several languages, engineering, astronomy, navigation (see their remarks concerning Nathanael Bowditch, pp. 534,536,540), and especially diplomacy and political intrigue.<br /><br />Jefferson's remarks about the pronunciation of the ancient Greek language (pp. 536-539) shows a deep and penetrating interest in a subject that today is of interest only to advanced scholars.  Indeed, most of their correspondence in their later years demonstrates an interest and, indeed, vast knowledge on a wide variety of subjects. Theirs was an age of generalists -- men who were conversant on a broad range of subjects -- as opposed to today, when we tend to specialization.<br /><br />Much of their early correspondence included references to Dr. Benjamin Franklin, with whom they were associated while the three of them represented the United States in Europe and England, in creating trade treaties and diplomatic ventures, including relations with the Barbary states (pirates).  Abigail Adams also engaged in correspondence with Thomas Jefferson, and many of her letters are included.<br /><br />We are in debt to several scholars who compiled the materials in this book from the libraries and writings of Jefferson and Adams, of whom Lester Cappon, the editor of this volume, has given much credit.<br /><br />This book is a gold mine for anyone interested in either of these great men, or in the early history of the United States, or for that matter, the world during that epoch.<br /><br />Joseph PierreAdams, of whom Lester Cappon, the editor of this volume, has given much credit.<br /><br />This book is a gold mine for anyone interested in either of these great men, or in the early history of the United States, or for that matter, the world during that epoch.<br /><br />Joseph Pierre<br />	2002-08-10

So did I.<br />I never promised her a rose garden, but now we have one, and it's a pure delight.  Before we started, I bought two books; this one and Pierre-Joseph Redoute's Roses.  In case you are unfamiliar with that gentleman, he was the Audubon of flowers, and especially roses and lilies.  His artwork is exquisite.<br /><br />This book, formerly published as Enjoying Roses, was created by the editorial staff of Ortho Books.  The project editor was Janet Goldenberg, and it was written by Ann Reilly.  The illustrators were Cyndie Wooley and Ron Hildebrand, and the photography was Saxon Holt.  The resulting volume is stupendous!<br /><br />Unlike Redoute's book, which is entirely illustrated with his artwork, the flowers in this book are primarily illustrated with beautiful full color photography.  The illustrations are primarily technical line drawings showing how to prune, disbudd, plant in containers, and plant bare-root roses, etc.<br /><br />The book details how to select roses and use them in your landscape,how to plant them and care for them outdoors, as well as how to grow them indoors.  It also goes into the history and lore of the rose, and discusses (and shows) many of the world's finest, most cherished roses.<br /><br />Altogether, if you are growing roses, or if you just like to look at them and want to know more about the culture of roses, this is a book you should have!<br /><br />Joseph Pierre	2002-08-09

Example: &quot;Life is like stepping onto a boat which is about to sail out to sea -- and sink&quot; (Susuki Roshi). Or, &quot;Must I forgive my brother?  You must forgive your brother seven times.  Nay, seventy times seven times&quot; (the Bible).<br /><br />The insights garnered from the great religions (and other sources) are interspersed with the author's own observations, with which you'll find little to dispute.<br /><br />Another reviewer has characterized Stephen Gaskin (the author) as a &quot;hippie.&quot;  My guess is, he's probably correct.  In the 1960s (and later) many--if not most--of the &quot;hippie&quot; community used psychedelics and marijuana, which resulted in some astonishingly profound epiphanies and religious insights.  This book reads like<br />other &quot;new age&quot; books which I've read: notably, Richard Alpert's (otherwise known as 'Ram Dass') Be Here Now.<br /><br />In any case, it's a good book.  I doubt that it will offend anyone, of any religion.<br /><br />The only fault I find with the book is that, on several pages the type is overlayed over photographical material, rendering it difficult to read.  This is a common graphic design problem with many books of this type, where the designer is trying to achieve graphic beauty at the expense of readability, which is usually a mistake.  I find no fault at all with the content.<br /><br />Joseph Pierre<br /><br />author of The Road to Damascus and other books	2002-08-08

I could say many of the same things about it that I said about Mr. Tolle's book.  There are a few differences, but the basic message is the same: right Now is where all life occurs. The past is finished and cannot be changed, and its main function is to enable us to use the wisdom gained there to make our choices Now.  The future is not yet here, and is not predestined.  Our choices, which we can only make right Now have a dynamic effect on what the future will hold. All actions, choices and changes are made in the immediate Now.  Everything that was ever done was done in a Now.<br /><br />The other message which (Mr.) Shannon Duncan teaches is the importance of examining the beliefs and prejudices you hold.<br />As Dr. Robert Anthony said, &quot;If you don't change your beliefs, your life will be like this forever.  Is that good news?&quot;  Or, Ludwig Borne's statement, &quot;Getting rid of a delusion makes us wiser than getting hold of a truth.&quot;  But perhaps Henry Ford got more directly to the point when he said, &quot;He can who thinks he can and he can't who thinks he can't.  This is an inexorable, indisputable law.&quot;<br /><br />We have all heard people say things like, &quot;I've never been good at math.&quot; And so, of course, they are not good at math.  And those who say, &quot;I've always loved to paint&quot; are usually proficient at painting.  Such preconceptions and thoughts are a powerful form of self-suggestion, or self-hypnosis, if you wish.<br /><br />What if you examined your self-assessment and your beliefs about what you can and cannot do for their objective accuracy? Will the negative assessments stand up to close scrutiny?  What objective evidence is there that suggests their accuracy?<br /><br />This is the kind of thing this book is about, together with some relatively simple exercises to help you achieve inner peace.<br /><br />Like The Power of Now, the refreshing thing about this book is not that it contains any wisdom not previously available--for those conversant with Eastern wisdom, many of these observations are &quot;old hat,&quot; but the Vedas, the writings of the Buddhists, and the Tao are so filled with Eastern jargon and nomenclature that it makes the lessons found there hard to assimilate for a Westerner.  The refreshing thing about this book is that it was written in plain English by a contemporary Westerner--and written very well indeed, I might add. It is extremely easy to understand, and the exercises are relatively easy to accomplish with any investment of effort at all.<br /><br />I recommend this book highly; especially to those souls who are unnerved by their chattering minds, and whose own thoughts of remorse over past actions or fears of the future are causing them mental anguish.<br /><br />You will find peace here, if you read this book, take it to heart, and practice the author's exercises.<br /><br />Joseph Pierre<br /><br />author of The Road to Damascus and other booksrcises to help you achieve inner peace.<br /><br />Like The Power of Now, the refreshing thing about this book is not that it contains any wisdom not previously available--for those conversant with Eastern wisdom, many of these observations are &quot;old hat,&quot; but the Vedas, the writings of the Buddhists, and the Tao are so filled with Eastern jargon and nomenclature that it makes the lessons found there hard to assimilate for a Westerner.

Dyke is good, and explains a lot; especially the last paragraph, wherein he says,\\"The reading (and study) of [this book] is essential to an uderstanding of that mythical hero, the Robin Hood of the Southwest, who was once just a bucktoothed, thieving, murderous little cowboy-gone-bad, Billy the Kid.\\"<br /><br />Of course, the author, Pat Garrett, was not an unprejudiced reporter of events, for it was he who ended the life of William Bonney, also known as William Antrim (his foster father's surname). It is also interesting I think, in passing, to mention that Billy the Kid was not a product of the West, but a transplanted New Yorker.<br /><br />Elsewhere, you will read that Pat Garrett's writing effort is poor, and leaves much to be desired. He readily admits it. In his own words, he says, \\"I make no pretension to literary ability, but propose to give to the public in intelligible English, 'a round, unvarnished tale,' unadorned with superfluous verbiage.\\"<br /><br />Garrett is motivated, he says, by an \\"impulse to correct the thousand false statements which have appeared in the newspapers and in yellow-covered cheap novels.\\"<br /><br />And, there is no doubt at all that the stories of Billy's exploits were greatly exaggerated by an Eastern press eager for stories of gunplay and adventure on the Western frontier. Today's myth of Billy the Kid is largely descended from the pulp stories created by the inflamed minds of Eastern \\"journalists\\" and the latter-day Hollywood screen-writers who have made no attempt at all to portray the truth.<br /><br />Pat Garrett claims to have known Billy throughout the period known as the \\"Lincoln County Wars,\\" and having listened to Bonney's reminiscences around campfires and says he has interviewed many persons since Bonney's death. That much would seem to be undisputed.<br /><br />Bonney was born in 1859, six years after the birth of another Southwestern hardcase, John Wesley Hardin. In fact, they were contemporaries and were raising hell at the same time. Bonney, however, died young at the age of 21, in 1881. Hardin died at the age of 42--twice Billy's age--in 1895. And, if the rumors are true, Hardin probably killed twice as many men. They both started young. Both are reputed to have had fearful tempers. Neither were killed in the face-to-face \\"quick draw\\" shootouts so dear to the hearts of Hollywood writers. Instead, both of their executioners used stealth to kill their quarries.<br /><br />According to Garrett, in Pete Maxwell's darkened bedroom, where he shot Billy to death, Billy was holding a butcher knife in one hand and drawing his double-action Colt \\"Lightning\\" revolver (\\"self-cocker\\") with the other, while asking in Spanish, \\"Quien es? Quien es?\\" (\\"Who is it? Who is it?\\") They were, again according to Garrett, at point blank range. The only other witness was Pete Maxwell. There are other versions to the story, including one which insists that Bonney was unarmed except for the knife, which he had used to cut off a chunk of beef from a hanging carcass outside, because he was hungry.<br /><br />My question is this: it is undisputed that he was holding the knife, and the reason for which he had it. So, where was the beef? It is unlikely that he ate it raw, or stuck it in a pocket. Probably he was holding it in his other hand, intending to cook it. In which case, if he had a revolver tucked in his waistband, he must have had to drop the beef to fetch his revolver.<br /><br />It is probably of little importance; a Billy Bonney armed with a butcher knife, at close quarters, would still have needed killing. But, did he make the fatal mistake of coming to a gunfight armed only with a knife?<br /><br />I think that this is an important book, if for no other reason than the relationship that existed between the author and William Bonney.

As Therese Littleton says in her editorial review, \\"Hawking's The Universe in a Nutshell aims to remedy the situation, with a<br />plethora of friendly illustrations to help readers grok some of the most brain-bending ideas ever conceived.  Does it succeed? Yes and no.\\"<br /><br />The average bright-normal reader, with a better than average vocabulary, but a limited education in Einsteinian physics, quantum physics, string theory, mathematics, astronomy and high-energy physics will find this tough sledding.<br /><br />The illustrations are beautiful, but the subject matter put forward is so esoteric and arcane (to the layman) that it is difficult, if not impossible to grasp.<br /><br />The basic concepts are probably totally foreign to any but the theoretical physicist.  To those of us who live in a macrosopic world, with our feet on the old, familiar ground, it is hard to understand theories that can only be described mathematically.  Einstein's concepts were, perhaps, marginally understandable by most of us when illustrated by analogies of trains going down tracks in opposite directions and passengers playing catch inside them, or we could even understand what he was getting at with the twins paradox, even if we found it hard to believe.<br /><br />But, quantum physics, I submit, stretches the imagination almost to its limits. Beyond that, wormholes in space, string theory, and the other esoterica that is currently being produced in the think tanks and laboratories of the theoreticians boggle the mind. That time/space is \\"shaped\\" like a pretzel as Hawking's book presents it on page 33, requires a suspension of disbelief to assimilate the concept.<br /><br />I find no fault with Stephen Hawking, or his theorizing.  I certainly cannot fault his book.  I simply do not comprehend what he is dishing out.  If I did, I might be qualified to argue with him.  These theories are so \\"far out\\" that the average layman even with a better than average education will have to set them aside and trust that Hawking and Thorne and the rest are actually dealing with reality, and not simply pulling our chain.<br /><br />At least, it's a nice coffee table book.

In fact Siddhartha of Guatama, the Buddha, a Hindu, expounded on these same ideas 600 years before Christ, and the Hindu Vedas are full of the same theme.  Buddhism, of course, also explores the area.<br /><br />That does not make this book any less valuable.  For one thing, it is written by a Westerner who does not use Eastern jargon and nomenclature. And Tolle has a handle on his subject matter.<br /><br />Tolle's main thrust is that, in order to achieve inner peace, one should try to stay in the Now, since the past no longer exists and the future has not yet arrived.  In point of fact, everything that happens, or ever has happened, takes place in the Now.  Now is where we reflect on the past, where remorse for past actions takes place, and where our fears and hopes for the future reside.  But the only action we can ever take is right here, in the Now.<br /><br />The other main point that the author makes is the necessity to quiet our chattering mind, and not to identify our thoughts as our Self.  The real Self is the observer, who stand outside the mind and uses thought (the brain) as a tool.<br /><br />I wrote a book addressing most of the same points, with very similar conclusions, after experiencing some of the same things as Eckhart Tolle. Tolle, it seems to me, makes his point better than I did.<br /><br />There is much to be learned from this book.

He is variously described as \\"stupid,\\" and \\"lazy,\\" and simply a no talent bum; a would-be artist without talent.  Actually, I have seen some of Hitler's drawings reproduced, and they were quite good--and I am a retired professional commercial artist.<br />If he was so utterly lacking in charisma and positive traits, how then, pray tell, did he manage to capture the imagination of an entire people?  I think that, had he but held the line and decided against invading Poland and making the Jewish people his scapegoat, we would be celebrating him to today as one of Germany's greatest leaders.<br />If Hitler had anything to do with the powerful symbolism of the National Socialist party (The Swastika, etc.) and the striking uniforms of the German Army and the Luftwaffe--and I have no doubt his was the last word--he shows a very strong sense of graphic drama.  It will be a while before the world again views such powerful graphic symbolism.<br />Aside from that, Wykes makes a flimsy case for Hitler's having contracted a case of syphillis in his early life in Vienna.  The case is extremely circumstantial, and I think dubious.  Throughout his adult life, he appeared to be of robust good health and physically attractive. Besides, even if true, so what?  The point seems to be that anyone with \\"the syph\\" is automatically a worthless scumbag.  Therefore it's worth tagging Hitler with it, or at least his being a sexual pervert, which many others have intimated.<br />Losers don't write history, and there is much that Hitler's regime perpetrated that led to a binge of hatred after the war on the part of the vistorious allies. Much of it, of course, was propaganda (yes, we, too, created propaganda.)<br />This is not meant to be a defense of Hitler, which would be a difficult task even if I were an admirer, which I'm not, but it would be refreshing, after nearly sixty years, to be able to read a somewhat neutral account of the Second World War, written by someone not infected with virulent hatred for the losers.<br />After the \\"Civil\\" war in the United States, histories were written by the victors who made Abe Lincoln out to be a saint who freed the slaves, and the Southern states to be cruel<br />slave-masters who deserved whatever they got.  Of course, such an account is far from the truth.  Lincoln was in fact a dictator who nearly destroyed the Constitution, and suspended the Bill of Rights during his term,imprisoning his political enemies without trial and bringing about a totally unnecessary war that caused over 600,000 American deaths.

You be the judge, after reading this book. We know a few things from history:<br /><br />Afer swearing on the Bible to &quot;protect and defend the Constitution&quot; (not the nation, or the Union) as all presidents are and have ever been required to do prior to taking office,<br />he suspended the Bill of Rights, including Habeus Corpus early in his administration and throughout his tenure in office and subsequently imprisoned thousands of politicians, editors, publishers and ordinary citizens in the North who disagreed with his policies in Lafayette prison (and elsewhere) without trial, effectively silencing his opposition by force.<br /><br />He pushed South Carolina into firing on Fort Sumpter so that he could have a Cause Celebre, and then invaded the South with an armed force.<br /><br />To free the slaves? Hardly.  In a well-known letter to Horace Greeley, he stated bluntly, &quot;If I could save the union without freeing a single slave, I would do so; If I could save the union by freeing some slaves and not others, I would do so.&quot;  Lincoln, in all of his political history many times denounced abolition and in fact stated clearly that he did not think the races were equal.  The result of his &quot;Emancipation Proclamation&quot;(which was unconstitutional):  Not a single slave was freed.  It applied only to slaves in rebel-held territory.<br /><br />His objective, stated many times, was to &quot;Save the Union.&quot;  In fact, the war that cost the several states a total of more than 600,000 lives out of a 30 million population (given today's population that would equal 5 million deaths -- 100 times those lost in Viet Nam) was not about slavery at all -- that was merely a peripheral matter --it was to prevent those states who had joined the Union voluntarily from leaving it voluntarily, as every scholar of that day and this agrees they had every legal right to do.  In fact, on the occasion of the Louisiana Purchase, the Northeastern States were so incensed that many thought seriously of doing the same thing, and no president except Lincoln would have even remotely considered keeping the family together at the point of a bayonet.<br /><br />The war was fought over a difference in political philosophies:  Lincoln and the Republicans (and previously the Whigs) favored a<br />large, powerful central government. The Democrats in those days (a different tribe than today's Democrats) favored federalism -- in other words, state's rights and a weak, decentralized government (how times have changed).  They thought that the United States was, and should be, a collection of sovereign nations, and the federal government simply their agent, its powers closely delineated in the Constitution.<br /><br />The  Southern States nearly won their freedom in the First Battle of Manassus, and if &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson had only had his way, in this first battle of the &quot;civil&quot; war, it would all have been over.  But, President Jefferson Davis refused to give him the 10,000 troops he needed to pursue his victory and take Washington.  Davis later reflected it was one of his &quot;great mistakes.&quot;<br /><br />Lincoln was, in fact a dictator, although he is usually described as a &quot;benevolent&quot; or even a &quot;great dictator.&quot;  He usurped powers that presidents since him have taken to themselves, using his precedent, that are totally unconstitutional -- such as &quot;war powers.&quot;  The Constitution does not allow for extra-constitutional powers for the president, or anyone else under any circumstance.<br /><br />In fact, Lincoln got the government he wanted.  His was the first income tax.  Now, look at it!  And a great central monolithic federal giant over whom no on has any true control, least of all a president.<br /><br />Would it have been better if we had followed Jefferson's or Jackson's version of what our nation should be?  Could a confederation of sovereign states with the federal government simply acting as their agent have coped with the world we live in today? A world without federal land grabs such as BLM and the national parks (which are extra-constitutional), with no huge federal socialist social programs such as social security, or medicare, or medicade, or the huge military establishment we now enjoy?  How about the Interstate Highway network?<br /><br />We cannot re-write history, and our guesses, if we could, knowing only what he knew at the time, might be no better than Lincoln's.<br />Whether Booth acted too late to stop a tyrant before he caused 600,000 deaths in battle in the worst war this country has ever endured,  many more cripples disabled for life and the almost total destruction of the Southern States who 'enjoyed' martial law for another dozen years after their defeat, under carpetbaggers; or whether booth was truly the monster he was made out to be at the time, and &quot;Father Abraham&quot; the finest president we have ever known, which many believe today,  is something that we will probably never know for sure.<br /><br />There is this:  Every other Western nation that held slaves, including Great Britain, Brazil and many others stopped the practice at about the same time without any bloodshed at all.  The United States certainly could have as well--the methods were well-known by Lincoln and others.  &quot;The War of the Rebellion,&quot; as it was then called, was not about slavery, it was a tragedy for which we are still paying and will continue to pay. Had it never occurred, and the Confederate States simply been allowed to go their way in peace, is it not probable that they would have eventually rejoined the Union?<br /><br />For myself, I doubt that Lincoln was the scheming monster portrayed here, I think that like many others who have made monumental errors that have cost humanity great losses, he was well-meaning in his intent, and possibly precipitate in his passions.  But that is only my gut feeling.  I had ancestors who fought on both sides and am a Northwesterner, so my view is about as neutral as you can get.<br /><br />This is a book to read, and then make up your own mind.  It seems well-researched, and will certainly be contrroversial.<br /><br />Joseph Pierre><br />Would it have been better if we had followed Jefferson's or Jackson's version of what our nation should be?

She was of 12,100 tons displacement,powered by 8 Mann Diesel Engines of 54,000 shaft horsepower, and boasted six 11 inch rifles(cannon), eight 5.9 inch, six 4.1 inch, eight 37 millimeter and eight 21 inch torpedo tubes.  In addition she carried two Arado scouting seaplanes.<br /><br />Graf Spee was built as a commerce raider, and had orders not to engage enemy battle vessels, even if they were inferior.  Her captain, Hans Langsdorff, was an old navy man who believed deeply in the code of honor exemplified by the man whose name the ship bore.<br /><br />As a commerce raider, Graf Spee was very successful, and in only a few short months was responsible for sinking over 50,000 tons of allied shipping; however, Langsdorff had an appreciation for the value of human life and always allowed the crews of the vessels he sank to escape before he sank their ship.  Indeed, he took them captive on Graf Spee, and trans-shipped them to his supply vessel for transportation home.<br /><br />But Langsdorff and the Graf Spee's luck was about to run out off the east coast of South America.  On December 13, 1939, Graf Spee ran into a flotilla of British heavy warships,who were hunting her: the cruisers Exeter, Achilles and Ajax.In the ensuing fight, with her heavier guns, Graf Spee nearly destroyed Exeter, who was forced to retreat to the Falkland Island; however, she was badly mauled because orf her light armor plating and forced to retreat to a harbor for repairs that could not be made at sea.  So, Langsdorff took her up the Plate River to Montevideo, Uruguay, a neutral port, where he hoped to make repairs.<br /><br />The Uruguayan government, however, was friendly with the British and gave Langsdorff an ultimatum:  leave Montevideo within 24 hours or have the vessel interned.<br /><br />So Langsdorff, faced with a superior force augmented by the arrival of another heavy cruiser, the Cumberland, and limited sea room to fight his way out due to his deep draft and the shallow waters, chose to scuttle.  He trans-shipped his crew to the German freighter S.S. Tacoma, and scuttled Graf Spee in international waters.  He then shot himself, after he saw his crew safely to Argentina, which was more friendly to Germany than was Uruguay.<br /><br />My interest in this book is enhanced by the fact that I was a crew member on the 8,000 ton freighter S.S. Tacoma, in 1945, after it had been captured and leased to the U.S. War Shipping Administration.  I was a fireman aboard her, at the tender age of 16.<br /><br />This is a compelling book, and one which gives another view of the German Navy than we were given during that period.  At least some of their men were, as the title says, Men of Honor.e repairs.<br /><br />The Uruguayan government, however, was friendly with the British and gave Langsdorff an ultimatum:  leave Montevideo within 24 hours or have the vessel interned.<br /><br />So Langsdorff, faced with a superior force augmented by the arrival of another heavy cruiser, the Cumberland, and limited sea room to fight his way out due to his deep draft and the shallow waters, chose to scuttle.

This is the story of a Vietnamese girl (Tina Le), who is skilled in math, physics and computers which she is studying at a fictional California state university, but who is having difficulty with her English as a Second Language (ESL) course which is a requirement.  Her instructor (John Goddard) is a Vietnam war vet who has flashbacks to that war, and is emotionally scarred by it.<br /><br />The story is told in alternating entries in their diaries, so that the readers is exposed to both viewpoints and therefore has a \\"God's eye\\" view of the events that transpire.<br /><br />Both Tina Le and John Goddard are caught up in and victimized by the machinations of the sadistic head of the English Department who apparently has it in for the minority students who comprise much of the student body, and especially those of oriental extraction.  Tina Le is victimized because she is an oriental, and John Goddard because he is a competent and caring instructor.<br /><br />Altogether this is a good story, well-written and compelling.  It is made better because the author, William Hart, has a doctorate in English, which he earned at USC, and has taught basic writing and ESL in the very system of which he writes.  It therefore carries the ring of truth that makes any fiction story better.<br /><br />Joseph Pierre<br /><br />author of The Road to Damascus and other books	2002-03-19

The name, meaning flower in Spanish, was adopted by their first and only surviving descendant who was a master of horse breeding and horsemanship.<br /><br />The main story begins with his descendant, Antonio, his self-centered wife, Feliciana (\\"Fez\\") and their son Gil, and their adventures in getting to and settling in Texas when Antonio's moorish blood creates an intolerable situation for him in Spain with the Spanish inquisition, brought on by his perverted and greedy half-brother, a Jesuit priest.<br /><br />I don't wish to give away too much of the story, because it is a delight and you will want to read it for yourself.  The author, Jan Hutson, though, in her introduction, says that the facts, figures and events portrayed are historical, and the Flores, Ybarbos and other colonial families in the story are based on real people and events related to her by family members, although the specific characters in the story are fictional.<br /><br />In any case, this is a truly wonderful book, a delicious story, and one that I have greatly enjoyed.  I hope that Jan Hutson writes more, as her talent for story telling is great, as demonstrated by this and her other book, \\"The Chicken Ranch,\\" the story of which led to the great movie starring Dolly Parton and Burt Reynolds, \\"The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.\\"<br /><br />Joseph H.

He is a polished, impressive, baritone speaker with a slight European accent who presents as a serious, knowledgeable scholar.

He was a featured speaker, and to say that I was impressed would be an understatement.<br /><br />In this book, he speaks of paradigms--the model of reality that scientists work within, accepting certain basic assumptions.  He points out that the Newtonian/Cartesian paradigm (a system of thought based on the work of Isaac Newton and Rene Descartes) is still accepted and the orthodox foundation of precepts in use in psychiatry, psychology, anthropology and medicine.  He points out that physics has moved on to a new paradigm: relativity and quantum theory and beyond, while the previously named sciences have languished, and opines that it is time for them to re-examine their fundamental belief structure as well.<br /><br />Grof said, at the seminar, that he was originally--in Czechoslovakia where he originated--a dyed-in-the-wool Freudian, until he began to perceive difficulties with that approach.

His knowledge of previous scientific discoveries and formulae is extensive and well expressed, and he works in his own ideas persuasively and with clarity.<br /><br />He explores, as well, the traditional religious opposition to evolutionary theory and exposes the reluctance of fundamentalist religious leaders to the evolution of species--particularly the evolution of man--due primarily to their literal interpretation of the creationist myth.  He sees such reluctance as absurd, given the fossil evidence, and relates particular, specific evidence in support of his view.<br /><br />Mr. Allen also postulates a basic, inherent attraction between even the most minute sub-atomic particles as an attempt to achieve fusion with God.  He opines that:<br /><br />&quot;There can, of course, be only one sensible conclusion: We must deduce that many spirits of a low order may--in conformity to some cosmic law--be combined to produce fewer entities, of a higher overall nature or status!  Solely by recognizing the principle of fusion, as a dynamic feature of the universe, may we escape an otherwise absurd situation.&quot;<br /><br />Thus, he unapologetically espouses a First Cause, an underlying spirit to creation--a motivation, if you will--and an overall direction, or plan.  He argues convincingly against the Big Bang theory, spends several pages discussing gravitation, and is an exponent of both evolution and reincarnation.<br /><br />This is an intriguing book, and should be controversial due to the author's stance on such subjects.  I have found it both stimulating and believable.  The author is evidently extremely knowledgeable about the subjects of which he writes.<br /><br />One minor criticism:  Due simply to the abstruse nature of the subject matter, and the intellectual effort needed to gain the basic knowledge required to comprehend the discussion, this is not a book that everyone will be able to follow.

When the paper's editors tried to drop his column some years ago the reaction from the reading public was so instantaneous and strong that they had to change their minds.  Jerry's column, &quot;Country Chaff,&quot; still runs in the paper.<br /><br />This book is a collection of Jerry's best pieces, and is a pleasure to read.  Articles about the sad spectacle of a wrestling bear whose teeth and claws have been removed, pitted against a &quot;brave&quot; drunk, whom it defeats simply by falling on its opponent, or a hawk that has taken up residence on his farm, and Jerry's thoughts on its future, given the shrinking habitat it faces.<br /><br />This is the writing of a sensitive man who is a keen observer of nature and its inhabitants, including the human ones.  Often humorous, but always reflecting his refreshing insights.<br /><br />A book that is well worth your time, and twice the price that is being asked at least.<br /><br />Joseph Pierre<br /><br />author of The Road to Damascus and other books	2001-10-13

Priscilla was raised as a pet, living in the house, house-trained to wipe her hooves before entering the house after playing outdoors.  Unfortunately, she did not know she was a pig, and after she grew too large for living in the house it was necessary to move her to the barn where she would live with other pigs.<br /><br />This is a charming story by the woman who actually raised Priscilla.  It is written from the pig's viewpoint and is therefore a fiction, but the pig about whom it was written was real, and is reportedly as described, including her ability to turn on the television with her nose.<br /><br />A fine story for children.<br /><br />Joseph H.

My problem is that I had difficulty in liking (identifying with) any of his protagonists.<br /><br />The female protagonist, Kathy, is a former coke addict who smokes her brains out, lighting one cigarette after another, is cast as a homewrecker and a drunk, and seems an all around loser.  Almost incidentally, San Mateo County (not the IRS as another reviewer stated) has wrongfully auctioned off her house for non-payment of taxes due to an address mistake on their part. An event that she could have avoided had she simply read her mail.  It is hard to feel sympathy for her....<br /><br />For some hard to define reason, given the rest of her \\"personality,\\" she is troubled by the loss of her house, which was given to her as was her new car, by relatives.<br /><br />Then there's Colonel Behrani--another really hard guy to like.  He is depicted as part of Shah Pahlavi's itinerary, who, according to the author, drove over the bodies of living children in Iran before he was deposed--not intentionally, mind you.  He was simply indifferent.  Behrani beats his wife and is unwilling to right the wrong he has inflicted on Kathy when he discovers that he has innocently purchased her wrongfully auctioned house.  He is the most likeable character, to me, but falls far short of evoking sympathy.<br /><br />Finally, our hero, the sheriff's deputy who picks up Kathy, a street woman with the morals of a tabby cat, and dumps his loving, innocent wife and kids because he is \\"unhappy!\\"  Poor guy!  *sob*  He admits to planting evidence, and throws his weight around under false pretences trying to scare Behrani into vacating the premises that he has legally purchased.  Talk about corrupt cops!<br /><br />So, the story is well-written, but frankly I don't care how it turns out, or who wins or loses.<br /><br />I prefer a story with characters that you can care about, and get involved with.  This one just doesn't have it for me.  Some will say that it is saved by its \\"realism,\\" but we face reality every day.  In fiction, it's nice to escape into a world where motives and right and wrong are more clearly drawn than in everyday life, and the \\"good guys\\" and the \\"bad guys\\" are more easily recognizable.  We are surfeited with reality every day.  It's nice to take a vacation from it in books.  At least that is my reaction....

It is well-written, but it defies common sense that it was chosen as a &quot;#1 Best Seller&quot; by such august organizations as the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Business Week and USA Today Money.  Actually, the best seller status results from brisk sales, rather than from intrinsic value or profundity, both of which are, I think, somewhat lacking.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it is an interesting tale, probably more suitable for adolescents than adult business people.  Yet Merrill Lynch, Exxon, General Motors, Kodak, Marriott, Whirlpool and Xerox have &quot;hailed&quot; it.  Of course many of the same organizations also bought into Transcendental Meditation, and hold seminars for their employees in which they &quot;confess&quot;, cry on each other's shoulders, and generally purge themselves in front of their co-workers, which has always seemed asinine to me.  But large corporations often fall prey to such mechanisms.<br /><br />Joseph H. Pierre<br /> author of The Road to Damascus: Our Journey Through Infinity	2001-07-18

His style is his own, but his sense of humor is delightful and he understands kids.  He still remembers what it was like to be ten or twelve years old and full of Walter Mitty fantasies which could kick in anywhere, anytime.  Even during math class.<br /><br />This story rings true except for the far-fetched adventure of flying an RB-47H to check out Cuba, but even then it is just plausible enough that you want it to be true.<br /><br />The kid language rings true for the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis.  Lord! Can that have been 40 years ago?<br /><br />These are &quot;Air Force brats&quot; caught up in the world of the cold war, the big missile crisis, the aviation culture and the innocence of puberty in a world of Mutually Assured Destruction.<br /><br />I hope Tom Hanley continues to write.

The family consists of William and his wife Kitty, their four children, their spouses and grandchildren, as well as the servants and close friends and relations. He is always referred to as &quot;The Brig&quot; and she as &quot;Duchy,&quot; short for the Brigadier and the Duchess although he has never been in military service, nor is his wife truly a duchess. Their children consist of three boys, all married, two of whom went to war (officers, of course) in the First World War. The daughter is unmarried and in love with another woman, but there is no sexual relationship.<br /><br />The first book, The Light Years, begins in 1937.  This one progresses from March 1942 through the winter of 1944/45.  The series is not really about military action, although that is always in the background and some events are alluded to in their conversations, but rather it concerns the actions and reactions of individuals in the family--their private thoughts and lives; especially those who started the series as children.  Many of the chapters are from one or another of their viewpoints.  Their sexual relationships are referred to obliquely, but happily without explicit details.  The daughter mentioned in the last paragraph, for instance, is in love with a lesbian, Sid, but there is no physical consummation of their passion for each other due to the daughter (Rachel's) disgust at physical intimacy of any kind, with male or female.  Sid longs for such a relationship, however, and finds it elsewhere--and then is confronted with guilt and conflict as the fruits of her deceit.<br /><br />One of the girls tells her lover, an American officer, that her parent's generation would be appalled at their affair, stating that their generation in England does not indulge in affairs.  Of course, unknown to her, they do but are discrete about them.<br /><br />This is a most interesting series.  The author is obviously familiar with the environment and the people, and the resulting insight into the British character is enlightening.

This is one of his atypical stories, like Night in the Solomons and Last of the Breed.  It is set in modern times.  However, unlike the other two mentioned, it is set in the American West--namely the San Juan River country of southwestern Utah.  Anasazi country--  The one-time home of the &quot;Old Ones&quot;--the Southwestern cliff dwellers the Navajos called the Anasazi, who seem to have simply disappeared off the face of the earth.<br /><br />There is a touch of fantasy and myth in this tale, but the setting and the geography are true and accurate as is typical of Louis' work.<br /><br />His hero in this story is Mike Raglan, a professional investigator, who is summoned to the Four Corners country by a letter from an old friend, and drawn into mystery and violence, where he eventually learns of the legacy of the &quot;Old Ones.&quot;<br /><br />L'Amour lived the stories of which he wrote.  He left home at 15, and worked as a circus roustabout, boxer, miner, logger and cowboy.  He was an officer in tank destroyers in WWII, and traveled the world as a merchant seaman.  But his first love was always the American West.  His heroes were invariably tall, broad of shoulder and narrow of hip, and leather tough.

Furthermore, he knew about the environment and people of whom he wrote.  His details were therefore accurate.  He was a Westerner, and had traveled the world as a circus roustabout, boxer, merchant seaman, army officer in WWII, cowboy, miner and logger.  He was a man's man, and he wrote great stories.

I may have read them all, but I hope not.  I hope there are a few more out there, somewhere.<br /><br />This book, however, is different.  This is the kind of  authentically detailed story that is his hallmark, but it is more modern.  It is about U.S. Air Force Major Joe Mack, whose forbears were Sioux Indian.  When his experimental aircraft is forced down in the USSR, he is captured, and no one but he and his captors know he is a prisoner.  He escapes a prison camp, and is forced to survive the Siberian wilderness in an effort to make it to the Bering Strait, which he will have to cross to get back home.  He is pursued relentlessly by a Yakut scout who knows the land intimately.  Joe Mack must think like a Sioux to escape.<br /><br />Louis Dearborn L'Amour (originally Lamoore) lived the lives that he portrayed.  He was a roustabout, merchant seaman, boxer, cowboy, logger, miner, and an army officer during WWII in tank destroyers.  He was shipwrecked in the West Indies, sailed a dhow on the Red Sea, and circled the earth on merchant ships.  He wrote a hundred books, and had more million copy best-sellers than any other author.

Smith seems to like strange protagonists, considering that his primary market is the United States.  His hero here is a Russian national, Arkady Renko, who has come to Cuba to identify the body of a Russian acquaintance whom the Cubans all seem to think is a spy.  The suicidal Renko is a prosecutor's investigator in Russia who has recently been devastated by the death of Irina, his lover, who was dosed with ampicillin, to which she was allergic, by an inept Russian medico.<br /><br />The Cuban's love for Russians has turned to hatred as a result of the ruble tap being turned off, and the fall of the USSR.and subsequent democratization of Russia.  The Policia of the Nacional Revolucion (PNR) has scheduled no investigation into the death of his acquaintance, Sirgei Pribluda,, and the Russian Consulate wants nothing so much as to ignore the whole thing. Renko's reluctance to certify that the bloated remains, unrecognizable after two weeks in an innertube in the bay, is actually Pribluda adds to the tension.<br /><br />And, that's only the beginning!

His other son, Rupert is a schoolteacher and painter who lost a wife in childbirth and replaced her with a 23-year-old selfish airhead beauty whom his children detest. Eventually, Rupert also joins the firm.  Each of the sons have children.

Her stories are refreshingly decent.  The protagonist is an Episcopal priest, Father Tim Kavanagh.  He believes what he preaches, and not only talks the talk--he walks the walk.  The stories take place in a small North Carolina village of approximately 200 population, Mitford--the kind of place everyone would like to live, if they could.<br /><br />Karon keeps your interest, as evidenced by the fact that she is a best-seller with this series, but she does not resort to foul language--the nastiest word in the book is 'poop'--violence, explicit sex or car chases to keep her readers interested.  These are thoroughly decent stories, written by an author who has decorum and restraint, and whose tales you would not be ashamed to read to your children or your mother.<br /><br />In this story, Father Tim--a never-been-married bachelor--takes in an eleven-year-old boy from his disabled, poverty-stricken  grandfather who has him because his drunken mother is unfit.  He also adopts a nondescript dog &quot;as big as a sofa,&quot; deals with the many problems of his parishioners, and begins to fall in love with his neighbor--at the age of sixty.<br /><br />In this series it would be well to start with this book and then immediately proceed to book number six in the series, &quot;A Common Life,&quot; which for some unknown reason was published out of chronological sequence.<br /><br />If you are like a great many others, you will quickly become a fan of Karon, who has written children's stories as well, most notably &quot;Jeremy,&quot; the story of a stuffed rabbit which she wrote for her own daughter--a book which has received much acclaim.<br /><br />Joseph Pierre<br /> Author of The Road to Damascus: Our Journey Through Eternity	2001-06-07

Former crime reporter Chris Bird covers the subject of firearms, their efficacy in reducing crime, techniques for concealing them, when to use them and not to use them, and the ethics, responsibilities and legalities involved in their use for self-defense.<br />The book is replete with dozens of anecdotes of people who have had experiences where the use of a handgun saved them or their friends or family from serious injury or death, the massive effects of adrenalin and ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone secreted by the pituitary gland) usually present in life or death situations like gunfights, and instances like the one at Luby's Cafeteria, where a single armed person could have saved many lives.<br />Bird covers the operation and nomenclature of both revolvers and semi-automatics, and discusses the pros and cons of the desirability of one over the other for self protection. He also discusses at minimal length the requirements of the various states with \\"shall issue\\" concealed weapons laws, and tells you where and how to get more information directly from the state involved.<br />Gun-control arguments, pro and con, are discussed, although clearly the author is dismissive of the arguments in favor of more gun control laws, and ascribes the effort to disarm the public to people who know nothing about firearms or their use and are afraid of them as a result of their ignorance. Their arguments are usually emotional, anecdotal, resort to ad hominem attacks, and are dismissive of the facts and statistics. I agree with him in that evaluation.<br />Altogether, this is one of the most informative, valuable books on how to choose, carry, and shoot a gun in self-defense around. The author mentions several others that are also very useful. One he does not mention, however, is one by the late George L. Tooley, \\"George Tooley's Beginner's Book on How to Handle Firearms Safely.\\" Tooley spent 45 years in law enforcement and corrections, and taught generations of officers how to shoot and handle their weapons.

She thinks he is a wimp because he does all the chores around the house without grumbling--washes the dishes, feeds the kids, makes the beds, does the laundry--while she curses at him and dashes off to work.  He works also, as a computer nerd.  In the office, a tyrannical boss dominates him.  He never swears, and apologizes for everything, including things that are not his fault.  Even his two teenaged kids lack respect for him, and yet expect him to intervene in their squabbles.  He is a responsible wimp.<br /><br />Then, he has a dream about bikers and a character named Bob, and things begin to change for him.  Harley Davidson motorcycles enjoy a dominant place in the story, which I was happy to see.  I used to own a 1946 kick-start &quot;Hawg&quot; with a suicide clutch and a tank shift.  Sometimes I wish I still had it, old as I am.<br /><br />The story is well written, and the plot is interesting.  It is reminiscent of Ayn Rand's &quot;Fountainhead,&quot; and &quot;Atlas Shrugged,&quot; in that the author has an agenda which in some instances dominates the story with long passages dedicated to his philosophy, which is all about the war of the sexes, the feminization of American society--or, if you will, the emasculation of American men by the feminist movement.  The author spends a lot of time and dialogue explicating and defending his hypothesis that some men are just &quot;too nice,&quot; and that they need to find their &quot;inner warrior&quot; and defend themselves against harpy wives.<br /><br />For my part, I see the situation in more simplistic terms.  I think that there are naturally predators and victims in both sexes--carnivores and grazers, warriors and farmers--and to try to change a grazer into a warrior by sending him into the woods to scream and vent his rage or join a support group of similarly afflicted males, is probably an exercise in futility.  When a wimpy male marries a controlling female, both get what they deserve.  But this is Colyer's book, not mine.<br /><br />The story is also evocative of Carlos Castaneda's Don Juan series, with its reliance on supernatural events and personalities.  And, like both Castaneda and Rand, Colyer seems to have attracted an enthusiastic group of admirers who identify strongly with his hypothesis.<br /><br />My only real criticism of the book is that it needed a better job of editing, designing and marketing.  In other words, the publisher has failed in his main obligations.  In the editing,  words are repeatedly obviously missing.  Misspellings are few, but like many small publishers today, the end product shows lack of attention to detail.  In design, the typeface chosen for the text is a sans serif, which is always a poor choice for long body copy.  A Roman typeface is demonstrably much better for readability.  And in the marketing department, the book's sales rank tells the whole story--although the book is just out, and that could change.  I hope it does.

He perceived a need for a book intended for people who simply want to qualify for their CCW (concealed carry) permits and to conduct themselves responsibly when they carry their weapons.<br />He does a good job addressing that audience. The book is carefully written, and all of the information it contains will be helpful to novices who want to learn more about firearms, their handling, and the incumbent responsibilities incurred concomitant with carrying a concealed firearm. Thirty-one states at last count have \\"must issue\\" laws, permitting any law-abiding citizen with no history of mental illness or a criminal record to qualify for a concealed carry license. Many of us have them. They have been found to reduce violent crime in those states with such laws, and in fact have saved many lives, as statistics show. A hostile press has downplayed the demonstrated efficacy of an armed populace in reducing crime by simply not reporting the 2.5 million instances per year in the United States where armed citizens have used firearms to prevent crimes, while dramatically playing up each of the far fewer instances where a gun is used in a crime (school shootings, etc.).<br />But, a lot of the people who are new to firearms need the information in this book, and another one written by the late George L. Tooley: \\"George Tooley's Beginner's Book on How to Handle Firearms Safely,\\" which is also available on Amazon. It is very similar to this book by Bill Clede. Both authors have been law enforcement officers. Tooley spent 45 years in law enforcement and corrections, most of it teaching other officers to shoot and care for their weapons. His book is more heavily illustrated than Clede's, and in some areas more detailed. It contains less information on when to shoot and the legal ramifications, and more on shooting accurately and safely, and the details of firearms and how they work. Both books are aimed at the same audience.<br />Joseph H.

Aubrey's wife, Sophie, suspects him of having an affair with the stowaway, Mrs. Oakes, although he is innocent.  He, in turn, suspects her of having an affair with the local parson, who pursued her before their marriage.  Stephen finds his wife, Diana, gone to parts unknown, and his girl child whom he has never seen, is suspected of being an idiot.<br /><br />Jack is given a new command, promoted to Commodore, and embarks on an effort to stop the slave trade out of Africa, as well as to frustrate a French squadron from interfering in Ireland.<br /><br />No one knows square-rigged ships as well as the late Patrick O'Brian, the author.  His 19th century sea battles are often taken directly from British Admiralty records, but more than that his dialogues are replete with period expressions and turns of phrase that add greatly to his stories.

Soon the reason for the strange sea and weather becomes evident as an erupting volcano causes damage to both ships.  The story revolves around British intelligence agent Dr. Maturin's attempt to influence political events in Peru, several battles at sea with the concomitant taking of prizes, battle with a pirate, deaths and injuries in battle, and the nearly deadly  struggle of Dr. Maturin's medical assistant, the Rev. Martin, with his conscience.<br /><br />No one knew nautical lore and  the square-rigged vessels of the Napoleonic era  (ca. 1800) as well as Patrick O'Brian.

Thanks to the good offices of Amazon's out-of-print and rare books service, I have obtained a copy of this excellent reference book.  About nine inches by twelve inches in size, with an attractive 4-color process (full color) photographic cover, it is an eye-catching coffee table type of book.<br /><br />More important is the information on Washburn instruments it provides; John Teagle has done his homework (and his research) well.  The book is replete with informative old Washburn ads, beautiful full-color photographs of antique as well as modern Washburn guitars, mandolins, banjos and other instruments.<br /><br />He also confirms my suspicion, which I voiced in another review, that Gorge Washburn's real name was George Washburn Lyon--hence the business name Lyon &amp; Healy.  It appears that there was even a George W. Lyon guitar at one point, probably around 1890.  Lyon died in 1894, while Patrick J. Healy, the merchandiser of the two partners, lived on until 1905, but between the two of them they had built an instrument manufacturing empire.  The Lyon &amp; Healy harp is still the world's finest.<br /><br />The book details many Lyon &amp; Healy triumphs, awards and firsts--including the acknowledged first &quot;Dreadnaught&quot; guitar, decades ahead of the famed Martin D-1 and D-2s.  Altogether a book full of information about America's first and leading guitar manufacturer, world-famous for high quality instruments long before Martin and Gibson made the cut.<br /><br />I am particularly interested in this famous old line because I own a fine example of the George Washburn New Model of 1897-a parlor guitar with amazing tone and resonance, with Brazilian rosewood back and sides, spruce top, and ebony fingerboard, ivory nut and saddle on the ebony bridge, with mother-of-pearl position inlays on the fingerboard.  Their plainest, smallest model.  It probably retailed for $15, when new.  I've turned down $500 for it.<br /><br />This is the only book on Washburn I have ever seen.  It was published in New York by the Music Sales Company in 1996, and is already out of print.  The copy I received is mint, however, and it didn't take Amazon long to locate it for me.

This is another in his series with Captain Jack Aubrey and Dr. Stephen Maturin as his protagonists.  The two, although dissimilar in every way, are great friends and sail together, Aubrey as commander, and Maturin as ship's physician--and intelligence agent for the Admiralty.<br /><br />The period is the Napoleonic wars, the ship is His Majesty's hired vessel, the Surprise, a brig, and this story begins in Australian waters, having just left the penal colony there.  Shortly after leaving, the Surprise is overhauled by a packet with orders to proceed to the Hawaiian (Sandwich) Islands, to protect British whaling interests there.  Oh, and an ex-convict stowaway (Clarissa Harvill) is discovered in the cable-tier, hiding in the anchor rope.  It takes Stephen Maturin to discover her past.<br /><br />Thus the story begins, and O'Brian, with his usual brisk narrative pace maintains your interest throughout.<br /><br />Patrick O'Brian had few, if any equals when it came to knowledge of square-rigged vessels and their history in battle.  Many of his stories reflect actual actions, taken directly from British Admiralty history.  Not only is his nautical terminology accurate, but he also uses period expressions that lend reality to his tales.  I cannot find it in my heart to award anything he has written with less than 5 stars.<br /><br />Let me suggest that the reader would do well to start with the first book in the series, Master and Commander, and take them in order.

She introduces her protagonist, Father Timothy Kavanagh--a newly retired Episcopalian priest--to a new island parish, to fill in until they find a new permanent priest.  He and his wife, Cynthia, leave their home in Mitford for the small North Carolina offshore island of Whitecap, where they confront the problems of several of the parishioners there, in addition to the burglary of their home in Mitford, the problems of their foster son, Dooley, with the law, hurricane force storms, and the anger of a talented but anti-social neighbor who is holed up in his mansion, refusing to face the world.<br /><br />Karon skillfully weaves the stories together in this narrative, which kept me reading avidly until I had finished all 400 pages.  She draws her characters from among people I--and you--have known all of our lives.  They live and breathe.  Father Tim is no plastic hero; he is a flesh and blood man with fears and weaknesses.  He is afflicted with diabetes, for example, and gets seasick.  Nobody but one who has been dreadfully seasick at some time in their life could possibly have written of it as sympathetically as does Jan Karon.<br /><br />This is a skilled writer who does not depend upon clich&eacute; violence, explicit sex or filthy language to grab your attention.  She does it instead with convincing stories about normal, good, everyday people whose problems and solutions get and hold your attention.  Strong religious themes are a large part of her work, but the affect is not saccharin.<br /><br />Joseph H.

The main character is an Episcopalian priest who loves his wife, and (believe it or not) believes what he preaches.

The characterizations are excellent, the people live and breathe and their motivations are utterly real.  Furthermore, the author demonstrates amazing insights into human nature.  The tale was never boring to me.<br /><br />This is the fourth book of Karon's I've read in this series, and I loved them all.

Books	4	1	1	N	N	The second edition is pretty much the same	The second edition of this little book, sent to me by the publisher as a result of my former review (below), does not seem significantly different than the first.  It is still a good little book, with much valuable information.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as far as I am concerned, the faults remain pretty much the same, and are of an esthetic nature.  Although the main type is very readable, for no discernable reason the type within the parentheses is of a smaller size--a disconcerting 'design' element--and there remain altogether too many parenthetical statements and too many instances of the use of bold face type for emphasis.  Standard practice is to use italics.<br /><br />The only problem is that it makes the publisher look amateurish, and the book harder to concentrate on because of the deviation from standard practice.  Yet, the book itself is a valuable contribution.  It deals with subject matter that is of nearly universal interest--since most families are impacted by mental illness in some way--and the author writes about it convincingly, and from what appears to be a knowledgeable perspective.<br /><br />I have one reservation: the author is writing about abstruse scientific matters, and yet he admittedly lacks the formal education in those areas that would seem to be a necessity.  In other words, how can you trust his conclusions?  Does he have all of the facts? Is he capable of dealing with context when he makes an assessment?<br /><br />I do not wish him ill, but those are my qualms when I read the following statement, &quot;if serotonin inhibits the making of cerebrospinal fluid, a shortage of serotonin might be a causative factor in hydrocephalis--water on the brain.&quot;<br /><br />When I go to a doctor and ask a question like, &quot;When I have hay fever, and come into contact with a powerful allergen, is there a cumulative effect?&quot;  It seems logical to me that there would be, but the doctor knows better, and says &quot;I doubt it.&quot;  That is the kind of fine judgment that special medical education supplies.<br /><br />So, get the book, but--be careful about accepting all of the author's conclusions.

Yet, there does creep in some evidence of his predilections. For example, he mentions on page 240 that Justice Harlan appears to be favorable to eugenics--a dirty word since the Third Reich--and then immediately follows that observation with the statement that Harlan had voted \\"for the NAACP in Brown v. Board of Education\\" (in favor of Affirmative Action in higher education.) A non sequitur unless the subjective perception of \\"racism\\" is viewed as a more important consideration than the constitutional requirement of equality before the law.<br />He begins by giving a detailed analysis of sports history--over half the book, I think--resulting in the seemingly inescapable conclusion that black athletes dominate virtually all of the sports in which they compete, far out of proportion to their representation in the population. The author is a runner, and thus much emphasis is given to running. Again, it would be difficult to come to any other conclusion than the innate physical superiority of Africans, particularly in running and jumping.<br />He seems to be reluctant to the point of refusal, on the other hand, to grant that there can be any concomitant assumption that there is any racial (he prefers the term 'population') difference in intelligence. In fact, he seems reluctant to admit that there is any such quantifiable characteristic as intelligence in the human species. He does mention J. Phillipe Rushton's book which addresses that question specifically, \\"Race, Evolution and Behavior\\"--which I have reviewed for Amazon.com--with respect, although he told me privately that there is much there with which he disagrees. He mentions, as well, Hernnstein and Murray's book, \\"The Bell Curve,\\" which I have also reviewed here.<br />He mentions the political impact of the genocide practiced during WWII and its negative impact on serious post-war research into racial genetic differences (hence, the book's title), and the UN-led political effort to peddle the notion that all races are genetically equal, and that individuals are 'Tabla Rasa' (blank slates), on which the only significant influence is environmental experience.<br />This book demonstrates again, to me, what I have known since I attended art school in the early 'fifties: there are average significant physical differences between the major races --\\"populations\\" if you wish--of which you must be aware if you intend to depict them in pictures; specifically, the Mongoloid, Caucasoid and Negroid. That there should be average mental and temperamental differences as well seems undeniable, particularly when coupled with my own observations around the world over more than seven decades. To me, this does not mean that one race is \\"superior,\\" or another \\"inferior.\\" It is just apparent (to me) that the various populations have used differing methodologies in coping with the differing environments with which they were faced, with resultant evolutionary differences. We are more alike than different, and there are greater differences within racial groups than between them, but to deny the existence of racial differences would be, and is, utter folly.<br />The Mongoloids and the Caucasoids did, in fact, generate vast diversified societies, the wheel, written language, navigation skills and other intellectual accomplishments in cold, harsh climates, while the Negroids languished with none of the above in a relatively benign, forgiving climate. That much is pretty much undeniable.<br />Altogether, this is a valuable book--particularly if you are interested in sports and black athletes' contributions--and to a lesser extent the impact ofgenetics on the above, since the author's scientific qualifications for writing such a highly technical book may be questionable. Although his writing skills are superlative, to what extent his potential bias colors his research is an unknown quantity.<br />Joseph H.

Of all the books I've ever read about contemporary America, its politics, politicians, social structures, institutions, welfare state system, social problems and prospects, this book is head and shoulders above the rest, in my opinion. The author, Larry Elder, who is a black conservative radio talk-show host, has a profound understanding of the main problems that face us as a society and their prospective solutions. Unfortunately, my fear is that loud-lunged zealots with far less insight are drowning his book and his message out with their drivel.<br />\\"The statist government view shared, for the most part, by both Democrats and Republicans, assumes a large government role in nearly every facet of our lives. Whether education, health care, transportation, charity, the statist view says, 'Let government do it.' Not only does the Constitution forbid the federal government from assuming these responsibilities, most state-run functions can and should be performed by the private sector...\\" (Page 190)<br />The \\"ten things you can't say in America\\" are stated in his chapter heads, in the table of contents:<br />1. Blacks are more racist than whites<br /> 2. White condescension is as bad as black racism<br /> 3. The media bias--it's real, it's widespread, it's destructive<br /> 4. The glass ceiling--full of holes<br /> 5. America's greatest problem: not crime, racism or bad schools--it's illegitimacy<br /> 6. There is no health-care crisis<br /> 7. America's welfare state: the tyranny of the status quo<br /> 8. Republicans vs. Democrats--maybe a dime's worth of difference<br /> 9. The war against drugs is Vietnam II: we're losing this one, too<br /> 10. Gun control advocates--good guys with blood on their hands<br />This is the only public man today with whom, as far as I can see from his writing, I agree 100 percent.<br />I hope you read this book, and I hope you are persuaded, as I am, that he is absolutely 100 percent correct.<br />Joseph H.

He is a prolific writer on a variety of subjects, and almost as opinionated as am I.<br /><br />This book is, as the author describes it, about freedom and hope, with some violence thrown in.  His protagonist, Tom Dedlass, is, like the author himself, a computer aficionado, and the story is future-based with elements of science-fiction, in an autocratic society, and it depicts the human reactions to such an environment.  The question is not really, &quot;Could this happen here?&quot;  Of course it could.  The question is, How Would People React, If It Did?<br /><br />The author, Charlie Coombs, has used his imagination to visualize how people would react in a repressive society, reduced to bartering for their existence under a fascistic government, and with the memory of a past in a free society.<br /><br />I suggest that you buy this book, and speculate with Charles Coombs.<br /><br />Joseph H.

These stories in the Mitford series are a puzzlement to me; there is no plot!  In this particular story, it is all about the Episcopal priest,  Father Timothy Kavanaugh, getting married to his next-door neighbor, Cynthia.  There is no single over-arching conflict to resolve--no villain; only the myriad small tales of the village's inhabitants within the main story of the preparations for the marriage.<br /><br />There is no real suspense at all, only the interplay of the personalities involved.  In so small a village, everyone interacts with everyone else, and the beauty of the story is to simply absorb the atmosphere the author manages to impart of a friendly village inhabited by nice people.<br /><br />Jan Karon says she writes &quot;to give readers an extended family, and to applaud the extraordinary beauty of ordinary lives.&quot;  In this, I think she succeeds admirably.<br /><br />This book will not appeal to detective story aficionados, or those who like to read things in the James Bond genre, but it was a delight for me, anyway.  I would have given it 5 stars, except that I had expected the story to continue the series, and so was disappointed.  The events in this book, number 6 in the series, actually precede the events in number 4, &quot;Out to Canaan.&quot;  I have no idea why it was published after the other.

His education was in communist schools in New York--the first chapter is \\"Red Diapers,\\" the second \\"Commie Camp\\" (summer camp), and the third \\"The Little Red Schoolhouse.\\" He was apparently born in late 1937 or early 1938, and as soon as he was able to comprehend, he was filled with the communist line. He belonged to the communist Labor Youth League, and eventually the Communist Party USA. In college in Wisconsin, he was an activist member of the Labor Youth League, a communist front. Throughout his life he despised the United States, and fomented unrest and dissension everywhere he went--until he was in his mid-forties, when he abruptly changed his political view.<br />This is his story, replete with the names of his activities and his comrades, including Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, Bob Dylan, Tom Hayden and many other well-known public figures in the \\"movement.\\"<br />He portrays the communists and socialists with whom he associated and their anti-American activities with remarkable candor, as well as the organizations with which he was associated (Communist Party USA, Democratic-Socialist Organization Committee, Democratic Socialists of America, Students for Democratic Action, Students Non-violent Coordinating Committee, Weather Underground, Young Communists League, and many others) and the political in-fighting and jockeying over slight differences in doctrine. He also depicts the extensive infiltration of the far-left philosophy into the top levels of academia, if there was ever any doubt.<br />After years of activism, often in a leadership role, he was turned from socialism through the experience of researching, and eventually writing a book about the Rosenberg spy case. He went into his research as a Rosenberg partisan, convinced of their innocence, but soon became persuaded that they were, indeed, guilty of espionage--a position that was anathema to his friends and associates, although many privately agreed with his discovery. His book, \\"The Rosenberg File,\\" resulted--and alienated all of his former friends and comrades, who saw him as a traitor. Then, he began to question the entire movement--as many others have done.

The so-called &quot;Savannah Theory.&quot;<br /><br />A couple of things bothered me about that theory:  bipedal running, which the theory postulated, is far less efficient than quadrupedal locomotion.  The fastest land animals on earth are quadrupeds and they are all covered with fur.  It didn't make sense.  Also, humans have a subcutaneous layer of fat, which contributes not only warmth but also flotation, and we are unique among the primates in that regard.  That would have been the first thing to go, rather than fur, if cooling was the desired evolutionary result.  Evolution follows the same path, generally, in similar species, in order to accomplish a given result.<br /><br />Hagstrom has carried Elaine Morgan's hypothesis further, though.  He speculates on the causes of human monogamy, male facial hair, and the placement of sex organs, etc.  Much of it is certainly speculation, but his deductions seem reasonable.<br /><br />If you are interested in the subject of human evolution, this is a book that you should certainly have in your library, along with those by Desmond Morris, Robert Ardrey, and, last but certainly not least, Elaine Morgan.<br /><br />Joseph H.

Books	4	34	39	N	N	An informative little volume	Less scholarly than Stephen Halbrook's \\"That Every Man Be Armed,\\" or \\"The Right to Keep and Bear Arms\\" by the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, chaired by Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah)--this is nevertheless a well-reasoned and valuable little booklet. Only 96 pages, in large easily readable type, it is a valuable addition to the gun-control debate. I would like to see it widely read.<br />I have a couple of quibbles, or perhaps reservations about the author's personal conclusions: on page 5, as one of the six parties who contribute to the lack of substantive discussion on gun-control he contends that \\"big business\\" has no interest in promoting our model of government. That statement reeks of the paranoid class-warfare philosophy espoused by the very socialistic promoters of gun-control whom he scorns. An unfortunate stance.<br />I think that it is an unwarranted assumption. Later, he also blames big business for the content of school textbooks (which fail to teach our system's principles) and for the views expressed in the press, which he says they \\"control.\\" I also doubt those claims, and think they are unjustified. Editorial staff controls the editorial content of newspapers, magazines and textbooks. The owners, by and large, are simply interested in readership, which enables them to sell the product or advertising and make money. Therefore, they hire professionals, whom they leave alone to do their jobs. Why many, if not most, of the professionals in those areas are exponents of gun-control is potentially a more revealing question, the answer to which may lie in the institutions from which they spring and the politics of the professors who teach them.<br />The bulk of the book is informative and well-researched. For one who is truly concerned about the recent attacks on the Second Amendment--the palladium of the Bill of Rights--as am I, there are a great many very good, scholarly books available, several of which he mentions in his bibliography.<br />I recommend this little book to you. My fear is that Americans have grown too apathetic to pay much attention to their government, or the Constitution and its Bill of Rights, and their representatives are too self-centered.

This is the first book I've read by Jan Karon, and I must admit that I was enthralled.  It is the fourth in a series, &quot;The Mitford Years.&quot;  I probably should have read the previous three books first, usually a good plan with a series like the long Aubrey/Maturin series by Patrick O'Brian.  But this book stands alone very well.  Oddly, I'm now starting the sixth book in the series, &quot;A Common Life: The Wedding Story,&quot; in which the events described obviously precede the events in &quot;Out of Canaan.&quot;  I'm frankly perplexed that Karon would write them apparently out of order.<br /><br />&quot;Out of Canaan&quot; is the story of the rector of an Episcopal church, his wife and friends in the very small southern community of Mitsford.  In fact, nearly the entire population of 200 souls seems to be involved in the story in some way.  Everyone knows everyone else.<br /><br />This is really a good story.  The protagonist and most of the other characters are devoted Christians, and there are many Christian references: Bible quotations, hymn lyrics, and other references.  The story will probably not be appreciated by atheists, but may be of interest to folks of other religious faiths who can identify with the human feelings portrayed, and ignore dogma conflicts.<br /><br />Although there is some conflict in the plot--otherwise, there would be no story--one cannot characterize it as suspenseful.  For those impatient people who demand suspense and a brisk pace toward the resulution of the conflict, this book might be characterized as &quot;boring.&quot;  For me, it was a delightful experience.

Our adversarial two party political system has created an atmosphere that encourages those on each side to overlook the good qualities of their adversaries, and to dissemble and create propaganda designed to destroy public confidence in their opposition's leaders. So it has been with Ronald Reagan.<br /><br />As the book notes, those of the more politically liberal persuasion have often sneered at him because he was &quot;only an actor,&quot; ignoring the fact that everyone had to be something before they became political figures.  Is a failed haberdasher superior to a successful actor?<br /><br />In fact, sneers aside, Reagan was in the top rank of American actors, as well as a popular president. He was good at what he did.<br /><br />The editors point out that his detractors have denigrated his mental ability, and accuse him of not fully understanding what was happening in the world. His critics say that he was simply a pawn of the &quot;corporations,&quot; and deride him because he once was caught dozing in a meeting. Has there ever been anyone who has not dozed in a boring meeting in a warm room when they have been up half the night working?<br /><br />This book is composed of radio addresses by Ronald Reagan, between the time he left office as Governor of California and the time he became President of the United States. He wrote them himself, in longhand. They are incisive, contemplative, and thoughtful essays on the state of the world and reflect his feelings and thoughts on both domestic and foreign situations and policy. The editors have faithfully transcribed them, indicating his own corrections, deletions and editing. No other hand edited his work. Photographs of the actual handwritten pages on 8.5&quot; X 14&quot; legal pads, in his own handwriting, accompany the typeset essays--demonstrating to his critics that it was, indeed, Ronald Reagan's own work--often done in an airliner between speaking engagements. They are a clear demonstration of a keen, analytical mind at work. A mind with a voluminous, detailed knowledge of world affairs and history.<br /><br />This book will not, of course, change the minds of his bitter critics but for those open to the evidence, it demonstrates clearly the greatness of this man who became one of our most popular presidents; whose single-minded resolve and clear thinking was directly responsible for the fall of the Berlin wall and the eventual demise of imperial communism and the inglorious end of the Soviet Union with the concomitant threat of nuclear war that hung over our heads for decades; an event that had been the goal of every American administration since the end of the Second World War.<br /><br />Some didn't need this book to demonstrate his acuity.

While encamped on a river within sight and sound of enemy pickets and listening to the stories of his peers, he begins to doubt his courage.<br /><br />The story is filled with images of the horror and carnage of war, although written lyrically and sensitively.  If there is a lesson, besides the dreadfulness of large numbers of men trying desperately to kill each other, it is that one and the same man can experience depths of cowardice and pinnacles of courage and brave acts, depending upon his surroundings and how they affect him.<br /><br />I loved the story in my 'teens, and I am still greatly impressed by it in my seventies--and I have seen the elephant!<br /><br />Joseph H.

And a total departure by Grisham from his usual stories featuring lawyers. Not a lawyer in a carload--not a lawyer character in the book. I think it is the best thing he has ever written.<br /><br />Inspired by Grisham's own childhood in rural Arkansas, &quot;A Painted House&quot; is told in the first person by a 7-year-old boy who lives with his parents and grandparents on their cotton farm in Arkansas. The story is reminiscent of Samuel Clemen's &quot;Tom Sawyer,&quot; or &quot;Huckleberry Finn,&quot; but without any black characters. Also, pardon me all of you Mark Twain fans, but I think it is better written. I know that is a sacrilegious statement!<br /><br />There is the struggle for survival against the weather that all small farmers face, the labor problems--hiring Mexicans to harvest the crop alongside &quot;Hill People&quot; and preventing the inevitable friction between them, an effort doomed to failure--the constant threats of rainstorm, flood, tornadoes, and working under the scorching sun; labor shared by even the 7-year-old boy--and then there is the constant worry about the loved one fighting in Korea, and the secret he left behind.<br /><br />There is violence, murder, secret forbidden love--all told through the eyes of a young boy. The characters are absolutely authentic and lifelike. You've known them all, at some time in your own life.<br /><br />If you miss this book, you will have missed one of the truly great ones!<br /><br />Joseph H. Pierre	2001-04-17

Tate Collier is a top-flight trial lawyer, formerly a prosecutor, with a silver tongue.  His nemesis is a likewise gifted psychotherapist.  Aaron Matthews is determined to wreak revenge on Tate and his family, Tate's ex-wife Bett and estranged daughter 17-year-old Megan.  When Megan disappears, Tate and Bett are drawn back together in an effort to find her, with the help of Konnie, a cop and friend.  The rest of this tale develops in this 275 page mystery by Jeffery Deaver, one of our top best-selling  mystery authors.<br /><br />The story kept me awake until 2:30 a.m. finishing it.  Deaver writes smoothly, and the pace is brisk.  The convolutions of the plot are easy to follow, characters are well-developed and believable.  The language is a bit rough in places, and some of the sexual escapades are unambiguous, but not overly explicit.  It is not a children's tale.<br /><br />I recommend this one as good, exciting escape material.<br /><br />Joseph H. Pierre	2001-04-16

Then, add the fact that the page design is at least very good, if not great, each page with a unique, individual design, and the writing is excellent, and in some cases downright lyrical.<br /><br />That is a good description of this book, &quot;The Information Inferno.&quot;  Only a scant decade ago, it would have been impossible to produce such a book at a price that would be acceptable for the average book-buyer.  The cost of the 4-color-process negatives alone--necessary for offset lithographic printing--would have been astronomical.  Either of the other two major printing processes then in use, letterpress or gravure, would have been at even greater cost.<br /><br />I am a retired commercial artist, and have specialized in print.  This is an astonishing effort.<br /><br />So, it seems impertinent, perhaps, after such a paean, to offer criticism.  But there are a couple of critical things to say about it; things that I would have done differently.  The selection of type fonts--and the sheer number of them--and in some cases the lack of contrast between the type and its background--make the text hard to read.  Some of the early type is in color, and is depicted with each letter flaming, which makes it even more difficult to read.  It is true that the theme is a hellish inferno, and thus the type reflects the theme, but it does give up readability in the process.  I think the designer realized that, and made the trade-off knowingly and purposefully, but in my school, readability was everything in a book.<br /><br />The theme that runs throughout the book is that we are deluged with information, a situation that increases the complexity of our world to the edge of intolerability.  The explosion of information since Gutenberg, followed by electronic media and, yes, the internet, has accelerated not only the dispersion but also the development of new ideas exponentially.  The author, who styles himself &quot;Whodini,&quot; is correct in his evaluation of the situation, if perhaps a bit overboard in his reaction to it..<br /><br />Altogether, I predict that this book will quickly rise in the charts.

I was wrong!<br /><br />This book, &quot;Absolute Power,&quot; by David Limbaugh carries the saga of corruption, degeneracy and wantonness even further.<br /><br />Beginning with the debacle of rogue federal agencies' slaughter of nearly 100 men, women and children at Waco, Texas, in February of 1993 under the direction of the federal Department of Justice, the book next details the federal attack on the tobacco industry, supposedly to retrieve taxpayer's money, spent on tobacco's victims by Medicare, Medicaid and the armed forces--ignoring the fact that smokers as a group, because of their early deaths, SAVE the government huge amounts of money they would have cost Social Security--an amount estimated at $29 billion a year by the Congressional Research Service. The Clinton Administration also ignored the fact that those very socialist programs--Medicare and Medicaid, costly as they are, were put in place by a previous Democrat administration: that of Lyndon Johnson, and that it is not a constitutional function of the United States government to provide for, or insure, American citizens' health needs, and that those very programs have increased the costs of medical care to the public in this country exponentially. Also ignored is the fact that government, through its taxation, derives more profit from the sale of cigarettes than do the tobacco companies themselves.<br /><br />I'm not personally a smoker, but I am a shooter, and it was under the Clinton-Gore Administration that the same deplorable attacks by the government were begun on another completely legal industry--which makes a product protected, in fact, in the Constitution itself--the firearms manufacturers. So far, thankfully, those attacks are being rebuffed by the courts, but not without cost to the industry.<br /><br />Then Limbaugh details the sorry spectacle of the White House Travel Office firings, in Bill and Hillary Clinton's effort to replace it with some of their Arkansas and Hollywood cronies. A debacle that encouraged William Safire to refer to Hillary Clinton as a &quot;congenital liar.&quot;<br /><br />In a chapter titled, &quot;The Mother of All Scandals,&quot; the infamous campaign finance scandal is dealt with, with its sorry tale of illegal foreign campaign contributions, money laundering, and lax  security of military secrets.<br /><br />&quot;With Janet Reno providing legal cover, the Clinton-Gore administration was able to do all this, and more, with impunity,&quot; says Limbaugh. This is a comprehensive, case-by-case critique of the Clinton Justice Department, and by extension the Clinton Administration, beginning with the firing of all 93 United States attorneys, simultaneously, when Reno took office--thereby signaling the total politicization of perhaps the most important agency of the executive branch of our government.<br /><br />With any luck, this will be the last of the books that detail one of the sorriest episodes in U.S. history. We can hope that the amoral Bill Clinton is past history now, and that Hillary will turn out to be a flash-in-the-pan and fail to be re-elected, even in New York, and that we can move on.<br /><br />I, for one, would like simply to be able to forget them, for they have shamed us.<br /><br />But, this is an important book. It demonstrates that James Madison, who wrote the Constitution, was right when he said, &quot;In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty is this: You must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.&quot;<br /><br />The great weakness of our system is that it depends upon the wisdom of the people to select leaders who are moral, honest, and who put the good of the nation first. In Bill Clinton, we failed to do that.<br /><br />Joseph H. Pierre, USN (Ret.)s of our system is that it depends upon the wisdom of the people to select leaders who are moral, honest, and who put the good of the nation first.

Morris was not only a television personality in England, with his &quot;Zoo Time&quot; show, but was also curator of mammals at the London Zoo for several years. He got his Ph.D. in Ethology from Oxford, and is best known for his book, &quot;The Naked Ape,&quot; although he has written many scientific articles and several other books as well.<br /><br />Morris writes well, and this book is composed primarily of anecdotes, many humorous, of his experiences with animals as well as several well-known people, some of which were less than flattering. His doctoral dissertation was on the Ten-spined Stickleback (a fish). While the book describes some of his adventures with the fish, and his roomful of aquariums, there is little about the contribution to science in his dissertation. He also worked with birds and mammals, and again the book is replete with anecdotes, but short on scientific information.<br /><br />Although he claims to be an ethologist (one who studies animal behavior in their natural habitat without disturbing them), virtually his entire experience, as evidenced by this autobiographical account, has been with imprisoned zoo inmates who, by definition, are not in their natural environment at all, and are often &quot;humanized,&quot; a fact about which he complains.<br /><br />I was a bit troubled by his reference to &quot;Hemingway-cowards,&quot; referring to big-game hunters, since I have been a hunter, although I suppose it is normal for an animal lover to hate hunters. I thought the slur against Hemingway was gratuitous and uncalled for. He also describes his love of non-representational art--particularly surrealism--and his encounters with Salvatore Dali, Pablo Picasso, Dylan Thomas and others are entertaining.<br /><br />In this book, as well as in &quot;The Naked Ape,&quot; Morris briefly mentions Alister Hardy, whom he knew, and who was a pioneer of the Aquatic Ape Theory (AAT). He does not derogate the theory directly, but neither does he grant it credibility--rather, he quotes a derogative remark about it. Pity. In &quot;The Naked Ape&quot; he clearly favors the Savannah Theory, which proposes that the proto-humans dropped from the trees in their receding arboreal environment onto the savannah, running as bipeds, and shed their fur in an attempt to cool off from their exertion; a theory which ignores the fact that quadrupedal running is much more efficient than bipedal, that the fastest animals on earth are quadrupeds, and that they are covered with fur. It also ignores the human subcutaneous layer of fat, the only possible use for which is warmth--common in other re-entries, like whales. Only the aquatic theory makes sense given all of those qualities.<br /><br />Morris is a great popularizer of anthropology, in the same sense that Carl Sagan was a popularizer of astronomy and space travel. Both men have their detractors among serious scientists, but both have contributed much to popular interest in their respective fields.<br /><br />Joseph H Pierref the Aquatic Ape Theory (AAT).

His father had been a small-town Kansas lawyer.  Henry left because he lost his faith, and entered law school instead, where he excelled, and eventually was hired by a prestigious Chicago law firm at a high salary, and became thoroughly involved with the highly competitive world of corporate mergers and take-overs, and was going with a beautiful stockbroker, Elaine, who was as upwardly mobile and ambitious as he, himself.  He was swimming with the big sharks, and was good at what he did.<br /><br />Then, Henry's world was transformed by the death of his home-town's leading citizen who owned most of the local real estate and businesses, Tyler Crandall.  His father had written Crandall's will, and Henry was called back to Council Grove, Kansas, to read the will, which was a bombshell because it had disinherited the logical heir.  Henry had inherited the case from his father. In it he was named executor.<br /><br />The will left the bulk of the estate to the town madman, whom everyone called the &quot;Birdman,&quot; because he was usually accompanied by a tame vulture whom he called simply &quot;bird&quot; when he preached fire and brimstone sermons in the park, which he did on a daily basis.

In &quot;The Bonesetter's Daughter,&quot; set in San Francisco and in North China, Amy Tan tells the story of Ruth Young and her mother, LuLing, in a story that reflects much of her own background. In the story, Ruth is a successful &quot;book doctor,&quot; a ghostwriter who translates other people's thoughts into a coherent book--a skill at which she is adept.  She is the &quot;as told to&quot; name below the author's, although the real creative effort is her own.<br /><br /> Like Amy Tan herself, Ruth is in her forties, and the similarities do not stop there.  While the book is not strictly autobiographical, there are a great many parallels between the author and Ruth.  For example: both of their mothers were stricken with Altzheimers disease, and both had stormy relationships with their Chinese mothers, both of whom were suicidal.<br /><br />Ruth's mother, LuLing, came from China in the late 'forties, as did Amy Tan's mother.  The story is told in three parts: first is Ruth's ten-year relationship with Art and his two daughters--teenagers in the story--with whom she lives; a relationship that is in trouble for reasons that Ruth cannot determine or resolve.  Art seems to be a self-centered individual who takes advantage of Ruth's tendency to always place her own interests secondary.<br /><br />The second part of the story is LuLing's own story in China, which, fearing memory loss, she is writing, in Chinese calligraphy and which she eventually presents to her daughter.  Ruth, because of their difficult relationship lets the manuscript gather dust for seven years, untranslated.  LuLing's life story is a tale of tragedy and suffering, lost love and a tempestuous relationship with her own mother, Precious Auntie, which  later--after her mother's death--haunts her.<br /><br />Finally, in the third section the focus is on Ruth and what she does with her new knowledge.  The crux of the novel, however, is the second part: the story of LuLing in China, her turbulent relationship with her mother, and the war-torn environment of China in the 'forties.<br /><br />The story is about relationships, and the search by both LuLing and Ruth for their family's Chinese background, which is enveloped in mystery involving, among other things, the discovery, which actually took place in 1929-1937, of  the bones of Homo-erectus, also known as Peking man, which were found in a cave at Zhoukoudian, near Peiping (now known as Beijing).<br />  Amy Tan has drawn on her own experiences to create her characters.  In fact, in an interview with Nita Lelyveld, she says that her own mother was her muse.  She could hear her mother's voice saying the things that LuLing said, and that she &quot;did her best never to listen to her mother.&quot;  In a parallel to Ruth's relationship with LuLing, and in turn, LuLing's with her mother, she says &quot;my mother drove me crazy,&quot;<br /><br />This is a sensitive, emotion-driven story about mothers and daughters, told by an excellent writer who has lived the things she writes about.

He was, very apparently, a thoroughly decent man and it shows in this book.  Perhaps I like him because his background is so similar to my own, although his was in rural Georgia--the son of a farmer--while mine was in Oregon--the son of a logger.  And also the life he describes would not have been considered upper middle class in Oregon, as he suggest it was in Georgia, but rather lower down the scale.<br /><br />His description of the details of life seems absolutely accurate, for the last generation to grow to adulthood without the benefits(?) of television.<br /><br />One of the very interesting incidents he tells about is an uncle in the Navy who was stationed on Guam at the outbreak of the war, and was subsequently captured by the Japanese.  His beautiful wife and two children left their home in San Francisco to stay with the Carters in Plains, where she received word that her husband had died in captivity.  So, she returned to San Francisco where eventually she re-married.<br /><br />But, her husband had not died, although he was half-starved and had lost 100 pounds..  After the war he returned home.  When she discovered that he still lived, his wife immediately had her marriage annulled, but the Carter women persuaded him, in his diminished state, that she had committed adultery (by re-marrying) and so he divorced her.  Carter tells the story without judgmental comment.<br /><br />During the Depression we lived under similar conditions to those he describes: I've lived in houses without indoor plumbing or electricity, where we used the Sears &amp; Roebuck catalog for toilet paper in the outhouse, as did he.  We are of a similar age, and many of the conditions he describes were endemic in the United States at that time.<br /><br />He describes one of the early moves of the Roosevelt administration-to plow under a quarter of the cotton crop, and kill and burn 200,000 young hogs (shoats) in order to raise prices, at a time when huge numbers of people were starving.  His father, a Democrat, never forgave Roosevelt for that policy, and never again voted for him.  Nor did he ever like the &quot;New Deal.&quot;  Mr. Carter also discusses other inequities and difficulties with the federal bureaucracy as it incrementally intruded into private citizens' lives, but, again, non-judgmentally.<br /><br />But, mainly this book is not about politics.  It is about a young boy, and young man, growing up in the rural South at a time before racial animosities were stirred up, but while a definite class system existed and the only class lower than the blacks in the South (where I also lived during that time) were the &quot;poor white trash.&quot;<br /><br />Jimmy Carter writes explicitly and, I'm sure, truthfully.<br /><br />Joseph Pierrer plumbing or electricity, where we used the Sears &amp; Roebuck catalog for toilet paper in the outhouse, as did he.

This is a neat little book.<br /><br />The author, Jay Arthur, was apparently motivated to write a book designed to instruct you and me in how to motivate ourselves and everyone we come into contact with, but without manipulating them.  He is very clear on that.  It's apparently not nice to intentionally manipulate people, as long as you can get them to do what you want without such nefarious methods and intent.  There's apparently a subtle shade of difference there!<br /><br />There are several very funny, professionally drawn cartoons in the book, as well as aphorisms, quotes and witty sayings on about every other page, in large bold type which help to illustrate his thoughts.  They are almost worth the price of the book all by themselves.<br /><br />The meat of the book is advice on how to motivate yourself and others, and to change opinions and attitudes from those with which you disagree (negative thoughts) to those more in line with your own opinions and desires (positive, reasonable, healthy thoughts).<br /><br />Mr. Arthur is a motivational speaker and consultant who works with people who &quot;want to master the mysteries of the mind and companies that want jungle medicine for the corporate soul.&quot;<br /><br />Through the book, it is apparent that he also hopes to merchandise his motivational videos and other books on the same subject matter.<br /><br />This is a small (145 page) hardcover book with large, easy to read type.  If you are interested in this kind of subject matter it would probably be money well spent.  At my age, simply awaking every morning is a major accomplishment.

Of course virtually all humans would agree with that.<br /><br />Much of this book would seem to reflect undeniable fact, for those of us who accept the apparent gradual changes of organisms over thousands of generations in their attempt to survive in a changing environment--a case usually termed &quot;evolution.&quot;<br /><br />For those who deny evolutionary &quot;theory&quot; in favor of creationism, this will be a boring book, and a waste of time.<br /><br />One particular facet of Morris's view of human evolution both disturbed me and led me to further investigation: his mention of the theory that pre-hominids had passed through a re-entry phase which brought about dramatic physical changes in our species that made us unique among other primates, our cousins, who shared our last common apelike ancestor.<br /><br />Specifically, the theory, the Aquatic Ape Theory (AAT) as it is known, he only briefly mentioned and seemed content with the view that our earliest ancestor, faced with a receding arboreal African environment which became insufficient to support all of the primates and thus forced them out, dropped from the trees and hit the African savannah running bipedally, and changed their diet to include meat, shedding their fur as they ran to cool off.<br /><br />Problem: The fastest animals on earth are quadrupeds, and are covered with fur.  Also humans have a subcutaneous fat layer that provides warmth (and flotation.)<br /><br />Eventually, I found Elaine Morgan's books (The Aquatic Ape Hypothesis, and Scars of Evolution,) which I found much more persuasive than the Savannah Theory which he espoused.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Desmond Morris and Robert Ardrey (The Social Contract, and African Genesis,) have made huge contributions and should be read by anyone with an interest in this subject.<br /><br />Joseph H.

They say he's entertaining.<br /><br />This book is interesting, sometimes amusing, and it is quite obvious throughout that Mr. O'Reilly is almost as opinionated as me, and possibly as arrogant in his beliefs.  I find little in the book that I disagree with strongly, and nothing that is very enlightening.  It is amusing, and my friends are right--it is entertaining.  Probably it would mean more to me if I had watched his show and knew more about him.<br /><br />While I tend to agree that class is a more important determinant than race in achieving some measure of success in our society, I think he overstates its importance.  His opinion seems to be colored overmuch by some of the stuffed shirts he has known, who consider it a faux pas to say &quot;tuxedo&quot; rather than &quot;evening dress.&quot;  I don't know any people who would elevate such a transgression to the level of importance that would lead to any discussion of the matter.<br /><br />I have known wealthy people who were crass and stupid, and poor people who had class and manners.  I've known stupid people with Ph.D.s and very bright, highly literate and intelligent people who never completed college.  I have even known an honest, hard-working politician.  In brief, generalizations about people and professions, with which this book is replete, are generally vastly oversimplified.  And that's another generalization.<br /><br />Apparently O'Reilly is of the opinion that he is a plain-spoken controversial maverick with much of interest to impart.  It seems to me that this book is a frank attempt to cash in on his fame, and that there is little of great importance between its covers that contributes anything of value to the culture.  Perhaps I'm wrong.<br /><br />Joseph H Pierre	2001-03-10

The main cast is a group of poor young college students who are mentored by one of their law professors, George Passant, a man of remarkable gifts who exerts a crucial influence on the lives of the young people he has gathered around himself.<br /><br />Passant attracts the devotion of the group, and helps them with advice, lending them money and generally persuading them of their worth and motivating them to go on to greater things.  He also parties with them.  Eliot is one of the group who goes on to become a solicitor (lawyer).<br /><br />Passant is a passionate, scrupulously honest idealist who is endlessly optimistic about human value and worth; a penchant that leads him into quixotic ventures, and eventually into trouble with the law on a fraud accusation, from which Lewis Elliot eventually extricates him.<br /><br />The story is entirely about complex human motivations and relationships, with no violence, explicit sex, high speed auto chases or any of the other devices deemed so necessary by modern fiction writers.  Yet it is fascinating, full of tension, and holds the reader's interest to the end.<br /><br />C.P. Snow is also the author of The Search, The Affair, Homecoming and several other best selling novels of his day.  This as a story that caught and held my interest.<br /><br />Joseph H Pierre	2001-03-04

However, his conclusions are shadowed by his admitted lack of formal education and credentials to write knowledgably on such an abstruse subject.<br /><br />Those who have such qualifications and credentials usually publish their insights in peer reviewed journals, and write in such technical jargon that their thoughts are indecipherable by laymen, which is exactly the way they want it.<br /><br />Mr. Walmann has done a masterful job of explaining his thought processes, but the thoughtful reader is unavoidably disturbed by the realization that other, more qualified people who have the necessary skills and knowledge in chemistry, bacteriology and biology and who have spent their lives seeking answers, must have thought of the same things.  What were their answers?<br /><br />His first words in the Prologue, I must admit, caught my immediate attention: &quot;When one gets to the later years of life, as I find myself, one may sometimes stop to wonder about life itself.  For me, the most amazing part of life is my awareness of my existence.  Scientists study and think mightily about how living things may have come about on earth, but I consider it a much greater miracle that we know that we exist.&quot;<br /><br />Amen!<br /><br />His answers may be correct.  I hope that they are, and that others pursue his hypotheses.<br /><br />My criticism of the book does not primarily involve its content, in any case.  My harshest criticism goes to the publisher for the lack of editing and the lousy typography.  The cover is professionally rendered.<br /><br />This is a very small book, only 164 pages including the Index, Glossary, and References.  There can be no excuse for not doing a better job of editingit. The text jumps between 12 point and 10 point type without rhyme or reason.  Instead of the occasional use of italics for emphasis, it uses bold face, underlining, and all caps.  Every other phrase, it seems, is parenthetical, and within the parentheses the type is a different size.  Altogether, the effect is disconcerting.  It is as if the author himself, without any training in the graphic arts, had set his own type.  The illustrations are similarly amateurish, and detract from the quality of the book.  No doubt the author drew them, too.<br /><br />Which is the same criticism I have of a layman trying to write a book on the medical arts.  One must sympathize with his motivation, but not necessarily accept his conclusions.<br /><br />Having a disease is one way to learn a great deal about it, but having had an appendectomy, no matter how interested you are in the procedure, does not qualify you to remove another's appendix. <br /><br />And yet, despite all of the problems delineated above, it is a good book.  It encourages people to think more about a great, heart-rending problem that destroys families, costs society billions of dollars, and ruins untold lives.<br /><br />Joseph H Pierre<br />	2001-02-26

The other one was &quot;Scars of Evolution,&quot; and both books have been an enlightening experience.<br /><br />Elaine Morgan is that rarity, a scientist who can write so that the layman can understand.<br /><br />This book deals with the theory--she calls it merely an hypothesis--that early pre-hominids (our ancestors) went through an aquatic period, when they lived in shallow water, which accounts for our relatively hairless bodies, bipedal stance, subcutaneous layer of fat, eccrine sweat gland system, controllable breathing, downward pointing nostrils and other characteristics that make homo sapiens unique.<br /><br />She discusses other theories put forward by paleoanthropologists and other scientists respectfully, while discussing their flaws, many of which they themselves acknowledge.<br /><br />I first heard of the Aquatic Ape Theory (AAT) decades ago, when I first read Desmond Morris's book, &quot;The Naked Ape,&quot; in which he mentioned the theory briefly. He apparently believed that our pre-human ancestors dropped out of the receding African arboreal environment, hit the savannah running, and shed their fur as they ran in order to cool off. Of course that does not account for the subcutaneous layer of fat which is more characteristic of aquatic animals like the whale, and which functions to provide both warmth and flotation. The AAT made more sense to me, and I have been on the lookout for this book ever since.<br /><br />Elaine Morgan does not disappoint. Her careful reasoning is welcome and persuasive. I am delighted with both of her books and shall read her latest with interest.<br /><br />Another valuable insight she shares in this book, which was of great benefit to me, was the diving reflex common to all diving mammals.  She said that cold water splashed on the face reflexively causes the heart to slow down, and produces vasoconstriction.  When a loved one recently experienced tachycardia, I had the opportunity to use that knowledge.  A wet, cold washcloth dropped on her face instantly (within 5 seconds) reduced her 260 per minute heartbeat to a slow, steady, regular beat and saved us an ambulance trip to the hospital.<br /><br />Thanks, Elaine.<br /><br />Joseph Pierrecently experienced tachycardia, I had the opportunity to use that knowledge.

His writing style is dense, with many allusive references, detailed and extravagant descriptions of background, rather heavy usage of foreign (non-English) terms and passages, and an often-intimidating vocabulary.  Still, it is not difficult to follow the story.  One finds them self not understanding what is happening, or to whom, until the author clears it up, sometimes.  For example, at a chapter's beginning, there is an entire page devoted to describing a coach ride to Paris, including the trees, the texture and nature of the road, French peasants friendly waves, the horses, and on and on, before the identity of the passengers is revealed.<br /><br />The story is set, for the most part,  in 18th-century London, where John Lempriere, a classical scholar, is writing a dictionary of mythological characters and their activities in an attempt to exorcise the demons raised by his father's violent death, which he witnessed on the island of Jersey.  Lempriere is in London because of his father's will, where he discovers a 150-year-old conspiracy by a cabbala that has kept his family from a vast fortune--their one-ninth share of the fabulously wealthy East India Company.<br /><br />Criticism aside, Lawrence Norfolk has a lyrical style that is intriguing.  This is not an ordinary meat-and-potatoes novel.  It is entertaining, imaginative and extravagant.<br /><br />Joseph Pierre	2001-02-14

It has the same haunting quality as &quot;On The Beach,&quot; or &quot;Alas Babylon.&quot;  They depicted a world following a nuclear war, with differing results.  This story uses a grass blight to achieve basically the same result, a world-wide disaster that presages the end of civilization as we know it.<br /><br />The story itself takes place in England, and portrays the events following the destruction of all grass species by disease, including grains, with the resultant loss of grazing animals and looming human starvation.<br /><br />The main story is the human reactions that follow--how the characters cope with the situation, and how they react and are changed by the anarchy that results.  The story promotes thought about how much we rely on external controls in our daily life, and the necessity of individual internal control in our everyday struggle for existence, especially in such dramatic life-threatening situations.<br /><br />A good book, if you can find a copy.<br /><br />Joseph Pierre<br />	2001-02-05

It was temporary duty, and I was not a Marine, but I got to know them very well--at least the &quot;airedale&quot; Marines.<br /><br />As they say, &quot;Some of my best friends are Marines!&quot;<br /><br />It was an unforgettable year, and W.E.B. Griffin has captured the spirit, the 'esprit de corps,' of &quot;The Corps&quot; in these three novels, and in his other stories.  It is often summed up this way: &quot;Once a Marine, always a Marine.&quot;<br /><br />W.E.B. Griffin is best known for chronicling his beloved Marine Corps in fictional form.  His depictions ring so true that Marines around the world read, and their eyes grow damp.  Of course, it would be better not to accuse them of such emotion.<br /><br />These three novels present an epic tale of the battle for the Solomon Islands in 1942 between the United States and the Japanese empire.  It is about Marine fighter pilots, grunts,  Coastwatchers operating under the very noses of the Japanese forces, generals, colonels and privates and their wives and sweethearts--tales of valor, loyalty, love and the challenges of fighting a war in which the end result was very much in doubt.<br /><br />I recommend W.E.B. Griffin's version of the Corps.  I recommend the Marine Corps as a service.  I recommend reading these stories.

Cooking can be as creative as any other art, and recipes are often adaptable.  Substitutions of ingredients and addition or subtraction of other ingredients or changed amounts are up to the cook, according to their own taste requirements or simply to see what new taste results.<br /><br />This is a good cookbook.  I have used it over the years, and some of the recipes are old standbys that I return to frequently.  For example, on page 299 is an excellent recipe for chili con carne.  I substitute sirloin or stew meat cut into approximately 1&quot; cubes for the chopped beef.  I also like to throw in an extra red pepper just for color, and sometimes lighten up  on the chili powder, depending on the taste of those I'm cooking for.  My 96-year-old mother-in-law loves my chili, but likes it a little milder.  For those who like it hot, adding a few jalapenos will wake up the taste buds and make the eyeballs sweat.  Chili was originally made without beans, until the Great Depression era, when beans were added to add bulk cheaply.  Hamburger as a substitute for top grade beef was also an economy measure that has become synonymous with chili.  I retain the beans for the flavor, but revert to the original use of prime beef as the meat ingredient.<br /><br />Another recipe from the book that has proven popular with my friends and family is the one for Nova Scotia Black Fruitcake, on page 699.  It has become a family tradition for me to make it every Christmas.  I make it with brandy usually, adding the booze over a period of a month or so unsparingly, keeping it moist while it ages, wrapped in cheesecloth in a cool room.  It is delicious.  Everyone has heard that the original Christmas fruitcake is still with us, having been passed from person to person over the centuries--the implication being that it is undesirable.  This one is delicious, and very popular!  The liberal use of brandy helps to encourage its disappearnce, of course.<br /><br />Those are only a couple of recipes out of 800 pages of them.  The book is full of them, categorized and indexed for easy use, with no wasted space for lecturing or philosophizing.  It is my next to favorite cook book, after The Good Housekeeping Cook Book, 7th Edition, (1944), which is no longer available except at auction.<br /><br />If you like to cook, and like to try new things, this is a fine basic cookbook.

Three of the great classics of World War II in one volume!<br /><br />Tales of the South Pacific, by James Michener, was a Pulitzer prize winning novel by one of the greatest authors of the twentieth century.  Renowned for his detailed research, and for his storytelling ability, Michener has been described with every superlative in the book.  This story may be his finest, and served as the basis for the Broadway musical and the movie, &quot;South Pacific.&quot;  The setting is a tropical paradise; windswept coral isles and the nurses, soldiers and sailors caught up by the war, and the inevitable romances that resulted.<br /><br />Mr. Roberts, by Thomas Heggen, is the story of a much-loved navy lieutenant juxtaposed against the rigid, incompetent captain of a navy cargo vessel, the &quot;Reluctant,&quot; whose duties take her from boredom to tedium and back again with little relief for the crew.  The story is anything but boring, however, and the characters are unforgettable.  In the movie version, Henry Fonda portrayed the herois Mr. Roberts movingly.  The story mixes poignancy with satire, and is both hugely funny and profoundly tragic.<br /><br />Battle Cry, by Leon Uris (another giant of literature), depicts life in the United States Marine Corps as it was during the great Pacific War.  The story takes you from boot training to the foxholes with the fighting Marine Corps, who probably suffered more than any other branch of service in the Pacific in the early to middle 'forties.  Faith, hope, and desire are all epitomized in this story, often described as the greatest novel ever written about the Marines.<br /><br />Anyone interested in those days of Pacific conflict should have this book, unless they already have these three great stories in another form.<br /><br />Joseph H.

The text flows smoothly and develops naturally, so that you are not aware of the author, but only the story--as it should be.  For a first novel, David Scott has done exceptionally well.  I'd like to see more from him.<br /><br />The story is about the internet, behind the scenes, and the constant struggle for more 'hits' ('eyeballs').  As a webmaster of an entertainment website, I can appreciate that, although my site gets hits in the hundreds a day, while this story is talking millions.  The details ring true.  Japanese lifestyles today, as depicted in the story, are outside of my experience, but then, I was there fifty years ago when the exchange rate was 360-1.  The Japanese characters are believable, and I think they are authentically drawn.<br /><br />Scott is obviously knowledgeable about e-business, as his truncated bio indicates, and it shows in his dialogue and storyline.  He depicts the internet as a fast-paced, youthful scene, with big gambles, huge losses and potentially great gains.  For a reader in his seventies, it is a humbling look at the future.  The sex is uninhibited, as might be expected, the characters seem real, with real flaws and valid motivations, and the backgrounds described are convincing--as if the author were describing scenes with which he was familiar, which he no doubt was.<br /><br />Richard Williams is the offspring of a powerful media mogul, and has a hard time asserting his independence and individuality.  In fact, he is a seriously spoiled, thoroughly unlikable, weak, dissolute, self-indulgent, dissipated young man without much to recommend him except his father's fortune.  That begins to change when he is virtually disinherited.  You'll have to read the story to see how it all turns out.  It is a page-turner.

His focus is on revolutionary events and cultural advances (and retreats).  Beginning with the spotlight on religion and the religious revolution brought about by Luther and his contemporaries, he continues through a history of the Renaissance and its revolutionary movements in art and culture, pointing out among other things that the great figures did not evolve out of a vacuum, but from a stimulating ambience created by highly gifted figures around them.  &quot;Together, by what they do and say, they help to keep stirred up the productive excitement; they stimulate the genius in their midst; they are the necessary mulch for the period's exceptional growths.&quot;<br /><br />Of course, actual revolution--the violent, military sort--also works to evolve society, either forward or in regression, as does the advances in science, politics, medicine, philosophy and literature.  Barzun is an astute observer, as well as an exceedingly effective reporter of his observations.  His writing style is clear and lucid, and very easy to read.  Nor is he retiring about expressing his views and thoughts.  Clearly, he thinks that Western culture is in a state of decline at the present moment.  The word 'decadence' in his title is a reference to the current period, but the condition may presage the Spring of another, modern Renaissance.<br /><br />This is a large volume; nearly 900 pages, but it is a book to savor.  Barzun has spent a great deal of time and effort giving us this insight into our past, chronicling not only the events, but also their meaning and the anticipation of events they portend.  To say simply that this is a &quot;good book&quot; is to do it a disservice.  It is a substantial contribution to understanding our cultural history and its meaning to us.  In my opinion, it is one of those rarities, a great book.<br /><br />Joseph H PierreJoseph H Pierre<br />	2001-01-28

In it, he gave a favorable mention to Elaine Morgan's books, &quot;The Aquatic Ape,&quot; and &quot;The Descent of Woman.&quot;  I ordered both from Amazon.com, but also ordered &quot;The Scars of Evolution&quot; since it was most readily available.  The reason  for my interest was that she apparently advocates the Aquatic Ape Theory (AAT) which I have thought to be the only reasonable theory that adequately explains our relatively hairless bodies, bipedal stance, subcutaneous layer of fat and several other characteristics, since first I heard of it in a very brief mention in Desmond Morris's book, &quot;The Naked Ape,&quot; many years ago.<br /><br />When Morris said, and apparently believed, that our early ancestors dropped from the trees of their receding arboreal African habitat and hit the savannah running, shedding their fur as they ran to cool off, I thought the idea ludicrous.  If that were so, why would they keep their layer of subcutaneous fat, the only purpose of which is warmth?  And, if speed were their goal, why go bipedal.  The fastest animals on earth are quadrupeds, and are covered with fur.  Compared to quadrupeds, bipeds are slow and clumsy.<br /><br />This book is the exposition of the aquatic ape theory for which I have been looking ever since.  It is a masterful illumination of the theory, addressing elements that I had not even considered.  Morgan, whose educational background and formal training in anthropology are not mentioned in the book, sad to say, is quite obviously highly qualified to comment.  Her evident knowledge of anthropology and paleontology is exceeded only by her extensive knowledge of human physiology.  She speaks with the easy assurance of a physician on arcane subjects such as the sebaceous glands, the vermiform appendix, sweat glands and the spine and her statements are easily checked for veracity, and obviously highly germane to the subject.<br /><br />It is rare to find such a slim volume (less than 200 pages) with so much information.<br /><br />Morgan points out that which should be obvious to any thinking person: evolution does not have any goal, it is rather reactive to the environmental forces brought to bear on the organism.  Furthermore, not all evolutionary changes redound to the long-term advantage of the species.  The organism, and the species, seeks only survival in the current circumstance.  Whatever mechanism for survival works, over time, becomes the favored one for the group.  Over hundreds or thousands of generations, the changes in the organism that result are what we call evolutionary.<br /><br />The Aquatic Ape Theory postulates a re-entry period for that group of primates that became our early ancestors.  Probably, it is theorized, they lived in shallow water when their environment was inundated, and after a long time returned to a terrestrial lifestyle.

At the time it was written (and I first read it), the scenario depicted in it was a real threat.  People were building bomb shelters in their back yards.  I considered it, but did not because I knew enough to realize that such measures were futile.<br /><br />The protagonist, Randy Bragg, moves his family to the small Florida town of Fort Repose when he realizes that a nuclear attack is imminent.  The book, though, is not primarily about the military aspects, or science, or fighting back.  It is about survival of the people after the attack has destroyed the infrastructure of society and anarchy reigns, and how they cope with it.  Contrary to the opinion of many, it is not science fiction.  It is an attempt to warn people who lived at the time it was written, and such an attack was a real possibility, what problems they would face if and when it occured.  The characters are well-drawn, the situations realistic and well-thought-out, and the subject was of immediate interest--in fact, its possibility haunted us all, in those days.<br /><br />In point of fact, it is the kind of situation that could, even today, follow any major natural disaster or terrorist act which would disrupt the normal functions of government and the operations of public utilities, resulting in anarchy and the &quot;law of the jungle.&quot;<br /><br />When one reads the criticism of today's high school child, that it was a &quot;boring&quot; story, it demonstrates how far we have come since those days of the cuban missile crisis, for example, when I worked fifty miles from home, and worried when I went to work that I might be separated from my family, including my wife and five young children, by a nuclear strike and not see them again.  In those days, it was a real possibility, likely to occur at any moment, and we all knew it.<br /><br />It was not boring.  It was a daily, living nightmare.<br /><br />This book made the same impact on me, when I first read it, as Nevil Shute's book, On the Beach.  At the time I read them, I prayed that they did not reflect the future, but thought they might.<br /><br />It was a time I'm glad we've passed through, and that modern children cannot remember or sympathize with.  But a time we should not forget.<br /><br />This is easily a five-star book, but it clearly does not have the impact today that it had when it was written.<br /><br />Joseph Pierre, USN (Ret)the same impact on me, when I first read it, as Nevil Shute's book, On the Beach.

He assumed that the strategy had failed, and that the war had been waged, and the northern hemisphere had been destroyed by a combination of atomic blast and the nuclear clouds that emanated from those blasts.<br /><br />Australia, though, in the southern hemisphere--being a non-combatant--had come out unscathed in the war, and because of Coriolis force, was thus far not affected by the nuclear clouds of death.  Coriolis force is that force which is created by the revolution of the earth on its axis which causes water draining in northern hemisphere sinks to circulate clockwise, while that in the southern hemisphere does so counter-clockwise.  However, since there is a co-mingling of winds at the equator, the southern hemisphere was predictably doomed, and the folks who lived there knew it.<br /><br />The story is about the reaction of the doomed people in Australia, and their reaction to the awful knowledge of their impending deaths, and how they handled it.  The protagonist, Dwight Towers, is a U.S. nuclear submarine commander who, with his crew and boat, are in Australia.  There he meets Moira Davidson and they fall in love.<br /><br />Some of the throat-catching moments are when the American sub travels to the United States, and the silent streets on San Francisco are described.  In the movie version, it was Seattle, and one of the sailors--a former resident of the Seattle area--leaves the ship to go home, a futile gesture, of course.<br /><br />The story describes the various emotions of those facing certain death from nuclear radiation.  The death of the entire human race; inescapable, inexorable death, and how they handled it.  Bitterness, of course, and recklessness (What can they do, kill me?) as well as foolhardy acts of courage (What? I might be killed?).<br /><br />This is a thought-provoking book.  Only the shallow will describe it as &quot;out of date.&quot;  One of the truly memorable reading experiences of my life.

He died on August 9, 1896, after a gliding accident the day before.  Just before his death, he said, &quot;Sacrifices must be made.&quot;<br /><br />This is his book.  It was read by virtually all of the original aviation pioneers.  The American aviation pioneers, Orville and Wilbur Wright, who [Orville] made their first successful powered flight on December 17, 1903,  considered him their hero.  Lilienthal studied birds closely, and from them he learned how they change the dihedral and curvature of their wings in flight, in order to conform to the conditions of the ocean of air in which they swam.  The Wrights learned from him, and warped the wings of their craft in flight to bank and turn.<br /><br />We are justified in calling Lilienthal the Father of Gliding Experiments--perhaps even the Father of Aviation.  Next time you lift off in a jetliner, it would not be amiss if you thought of this man who literally gave his life for his dream of flight.<br /><br />Birdflight as the Basis of Aviation was first published in 1891, and this, the 2001 edition, is an unabridged copy of the original, complete with Lilienthal's own diagrams and formulae, and with a Preface written in 1911 by A.W. Isenthal, who translated the original into English after Otto's death.  Like the Wright brothers, Otto was assisted in his work by his brother Gustave, who died in 1933.  Some of this book was written by Gustave.<br /><br />This is truly a remarkable volume.  It represents Lilienthal's life work and is a compilation of the results of the numerous experiments made by the brothers.  Although some of Lilienthal's calculations have been improved upon since this book was written, his work was the first light to pierce the darkness of ignorance on what has since become the science of aerodynamics.  Today's hang gliding enthusiasts owe him a great debt of gratitude.<br /><br />The art of photography was developed in France circa 1839, and thus this book contains several photographs of Lilienthal gliding in his light, unpowered aircraft.<br /><br />If you are an aviation enthusiast, of whatever age or experience, this is a book you will want to add to your library.<br /><br />Joseph Pierree circa 1839, and thus this book contains several photographs of Lilienthal gliding in his light, unpowered aircraft.<br /><br />If you are an aviation enthusiast, of whatever age or experience, this is a book you will want to add to your library.<br /><br />Joseph Pierre<br />	2001-01-13

This book has something for everyone: a postgraduate in English literature will likely need a dictionary by his side while reading it, unless words like 'theriantropes,' 'rhodomontade,' or 'heautomorphism' roll of his tongue easily. Neither of the latter two are in my unabridged dictionary. The author, Will Self, has outdone William Buckley in the use of words outside the normal lexicon, throughout the book. In addition, he has made up some words and terms to fit the exigencies of the story. But, despite the sometimes-incomprehensible vocabulary, the story is easy to follow.<br /><br />On the other hand, a reader seeking lurid descriptions of sexual activity will be find it in some of the graphic depictions in this book, written in crude monosyllabic Anglo Saxon terms that are all too easy to understand. The first few pages are replete with that, as well as 'recreational' drug abuse by the protagonist, Simon, his 'consort' Sarah, and their friends. The obsession with sex runs throughout the book, however the justification for it becomes evident as the story unfolds.<br /><br />Great Apes was recommended to me by an esteemed acquaintance, who is also a reviewer. Despite the recommendation, I almost trashed it early on because of what I perceived to be gratuitous gutter language; meaningless, needlessly smutty sex and casual drug use.<br /><br />It would have been a mistake.<br /><br />I won't give away the plot, which takes place in England, but early on the protagonist, Simon, an artist of the first rank, his girlfriend and a bunch of his friends and sycophants go on a drunken bar-hopping, drug-using spree. He ends up in bed with his girlfriend, Sarah. In the morning, he wakes up to discover that his bedmate is a chimpanzee. He loses it, and when the ambulance arrives to take him away, the attendants are also chimps. In fact, the whole world is populated with chimps.<br /><br />Simon thinks he has gone mad. The doctors who are treating him, also chimps, tend to agree. But, of course so is Simon a chimp.<br /><br />The story of his attempt to free himself from his delusion grips you. The author tells the story from a chimp point of view, where signage takes the place of speech (silence is rendered 'signlence' or 'novocal' and gesticulation replaces verbal communication. To place a phone call is to 'pant-hoot.')<br /><br />So much for style and the plot conflict. If you are squeamish about graphic depictions of sexual activity, or if scatology offends you, or gutter language is something you try to avoid--this book is literally filled with depictions of disgusting behavior and raw language. Be warned!<br /><br />Nevertheless, it is a masterfully written, imaginative story that held me to the end, and I must own that I think the author is a genius in his chosen genre.<br /><br />Although the depictions, activities and language are often disturbing, the story justifies their use, I think, and I have no problem awarding the work five stars, from my viewpoint.<br /><br />Joseph Pierreto agree.

It is fair, I think, to say that it was not written for popular consumption, but rather as a treatise aimed at the author's colleagues.  The evidence is clear: in order to understand the bulk of the book, one must be conversant with statistical formulae and procedures, and have more than average knowledge of evolutionary anthropology, psychometrics, and psychology.  The book is replete with graphs and formulae, and much of the language is technical.<br /><br />It has been called &quot;incendiary,&quot; &quot;racist,&quot; and the publisher of the first edition &quot;caved in to [the] pressure&quot; and withdrew from publishing the book and apologized for having distributed it.  (See the Preface to this , the third edition.)<br /><br />&quot;Why this attempt to trash or suppress this book?&quot; asks the author in the Preface, &quot;Because there is no stronger taboo today than talking about race.  In many cases, just being accused of 'racism' can get you fired.  Some vocal groups in academia and the media simply forbid an open discussion of race.&quot;<br /><br />But, J. Phillipe Rushton is no racist.  He is a scholar, and an extremely well-qualified scholar at that.  Despite the efforts of left-wing egalitarian social scientists to discredit his work because of the inescapable conclusions it presents, it is clear that his approach to his subject is neutral and clinical.  Like Charles Murray's The Bell Curve, he is being attacked because he is the messenger, and the presents he brings are antithetical to their cherished belief that nurture (environmental effects), not nature (genetic evolution) is the reason for the divergence in SAT scores between the races.  His worst sin is that he makes an excellent case, and is very persuasive.<br /><br />This book is about genetic factors and their differential effect on the three main racial branches of the human species; the Mongoloid, Caucasoid and Negroid.  It is heavily researched, footnoted, attributed and extremely scholarly.<br /><br />What the author found, after twenty years of studying the three major races, is that in the brain size, intelligence, sexual behavior, fertility, personality, maturation, life span, and crime and family stability rates, Orientals fall at one end of the spectrum, and Blacks at the other, with Whites in between.  Orientals are slower to mature, less fertile, less sexually active, have larger brains and higher IQ scores.  Blacks are opposite in those characteristics.  And he has much evidence--hundreds of studies--to show that the reason is genetic, and that there are good, solid natural reasons for the variations.<br /><br />The chicken is an egg's way of producing another egg.  The organism is the gene's way of producing more genes.  Whether the methodology chosen for the organism's success is production of more offspring, as in a relatively benign climate like Africa, or in a harsher environ like Siberia, to develop better tools, shelter, domestic animals, and depend upon the careful nurture of fewer young, the problem is still successful procreation of the organism's genes.  Over time, the human body responds to the demands made on it.  When wit is required, it develops.<br /><br />This is an extraordinary volume.  For those interested in such subject matter, I highly recommend it.  Ignore the altruistic &quot;all men are created equal&quot; fanatics who would suppress and censor it in the name of Political Correctness.<br /><br />Joseph H Pierre, attributed and extremely scholarly.<br /><br />What the author found, after twenty years of studying the three major races, is that in the brain size, intelligence, sexual behavior, fertility, personality, maturation, life span, and crime and family stability rates, Orientals fall at one end of the spectrum, and Blacks at the other, with Whites in between.

He died in 1966, but in his lifetime he wrote some stellar books, all with heavy metaphysical elements, of which Steppenwolf is probably the best known.  Others were Demian and Magister Ludi (The Glass Bead Game.)<br /><br />This is without doubt my favorite.  Siddhartha is the tale of the spiritual journey of the protagonist, Siddhartha.  It is no accident that he has the same name as the Prince of Gautama who became better known as The Buddha.  For me to tell you about the story would spoil it for you, for it is the story that is important.<br /><br />If you have any inclination to seek answers to the great metaphysical questions which have captured the attention of the world's greatest minds since the dawn of recorded history, then you should love this book. If you have no curiosity, no soul, you will probably just 'not get it.'<br /><br />Siddhartha is, in my opinion, a genuine masterpiece.<br /><br />It has been said that there are three types of people in the world: those who make things happen; those who watch things happen; and the vast majority, those who have no idea anything has happened.<br /><br />Maybe it could be narrowed down to just two: those who seek, and those who just 'don't get it.'<br /><br />Joseph H Pierre	2000-12-29

Kissinger, he says, thinks disorder is worse than injustice (although great injustice is worse than a little disorder.)  He says that the primary role of politics is not to control wickedness, but to limit &quot;righteousness.&quot;  He points to the Nazis, the Jacobins, the ayatollahs and others who have made revolutions, as &quot;self-righteous.&quot;  He also points out that the American Revolution was actually an evolution, in that it developed gradually rather than precipitously.<br /><br />Kaplan is an admirer of Kissinger, whom he sees as the pre-eminent American foreign policy framer--head and shoulders above Vance, Muskie, Haig, Eagleburger and Christopher.  He ranks George Shultz and James Baker higher than the aforementioned, but sees Albright as &quot;ineffectual.&quot;<br /><br />Robert Kaplan is an astute observer of world politics  He is a foreign correspondent for the Atlantic Monthly, with vast experience traveling and reporting in foreign lands, has written several widely respected books on foreign policy, and has served as a consultant to the U.S. Army's Special Forces regiment.  His book BALKAN GHOSTS was chosen by the New York Times as one of the best books of 1993, and AN EMPIRE WILDERNESS by the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times as one of their best books of the year.<br /><br />In this book he predicts a bleak prognosis for the future, particularly in the Third World, but also for democracy in this country (a fact seemingly borne out in the recent election farce.)  In fact, Kaplan has reservations about the future of democracy in many places.  He thinks that for democracy to work, there must be an established, strong bureaucracy, viable institutions in place, and a robust middle class.  The attempts by liberal idealists to plant it in, for example, sub-Saharan Africa, are doomed to failure-and that fact has been amply demonstrated in recent history.<br /><br />In short, Kaplan is a realist.  He points out that intervention by the United States in the underdeveloped world should be rare, and only in instances when Washington and the nation at large support it.  Then the development policy must be accomplished without &quot;overstraining&quot; us, its criteria must be clear, and it must not &quot;set us up for failure,&quot; as was the case in Somalia and elsewhere.  He advocates proportionalism, which he describes as &quot;the argument in favor of promoting the use of contraceptives&quot; by some Catholics, &quot;as a means of reducing abortion&quot;; a solution abhorrent to idealists.  The art of the possible, with compromise  the most effective tool.<br /><br />Democracy, he explains, is not always a good thing, and autocracy is not always a bad thing.  It depends largely upon the environment, geography and history of the region being governed; and he gives an ample number of examples of the successes and failures of each, and the underlying reasons, as he sees them.<br /><br />He observes that multi-national corporations are replacing governments as maintainers of order and equilibrium in much of the world, as governments fail in their function.<br /><br />Kaplan points to the west coast of sub-Saharan Africa as a prime example of anarchy, with hordes of restless, violent young men preying upon a chaotic society and spreading the AIDS virus-a world in which government has become ineffectual--and then he seems to extend that example to predict the fate of the world, generally.<br /><br />It occurs to me that he may be using a bad example, ignoring the genetic predisposition to rage and violence of the indigenous people of that region, which has been amply demonstrated worldwide, and which is not typically evident in other peoples of the world to the same extent.<br /><br />Perhaps the future will be less bleak than he thinks, to the extent that the propensities and predilections of other races differ from his example, and the resulting cesspool that they have created since they attained &quot;freedom&quot; from the colonial powers.

It is not the place of society to secure our everyday environment so that we may be free from the perils of day-to-day living.  It is our responsibility and our duty as citizens of this Republic to face down life's challenges without voting ourselves other people's money to do so.  Our experiences should then be duly passed to our children so they don't grow up to be a burden on their neighbors.&quot;<br /><br />WRITE WINGER is a book of opinion--the author's opinions--on a variety of subjects: ethics, politics, college, Indians, guns, morality, multiculturism, women, tolerance, religion, and other mundane subjects.<br /><br />Hubbell is, indeed, on the political right.  His views on most of the above subjects are what is today called &quot;conservative.&quot;  On virtually everything, I find myself in agreement with him, and so I have vastly enjoyed his book.<br /><br />I should add, quickly, that those from the left side of the political spectrum--liberals--will probably find less to enjoy, and will be vehement in their indignation if they should read his book, which they probably will not.<br /><br />I would give WRITE WINGER five stars, except for one significant flaw: it shows no signs of editing.  If there was an editor responsible for editing it at the publishing house, he should be flogged!<br /><br />There are many turns of phrase that could have been vastly improved with a little minor effort.  There is one instance where, for example, the author meant to say &quot;dominant,&quot; and mis-typed &quot;dominate&quot; (first line, page 66).  There can be no serious question of his vocabulary being adequate.  The mistakes are obviously inadvertent and should have been caught.  One has the impression that the text is exactly as written, in the first draft, without a second reading.<br /><br />That said, I found the book as stimulating as the first time I heard Rush Limbaugh on the radio, in the early 'nineties.

It succeeds admirably.<br /><br />Gerard Logan is a successful artistic glass blower whose friend, jockey Martin Stukely, dies in a fall during a steeplechase.  After his death, his valet gives Logan a videotape following his boss's instructions, thereby embroiling Logan in a series of frightful dangers and adventures.<br /><br />Author Dick Francis is the former jockey to the Queen of England.  His mysteries always involve horseracing, but also usually have a secondary area of interest; in this case, glassblowing, which he always deals with expertly and knowledgeably.  Murder is also typically involved.  Francis is a master storyteller, and his tales are a pure pleasure to read.  This one is no exception.<br /><br />Another characteristic of Francis' stories is the unusual ways in which pain is meted out to his protagonists, who cannot seem to make it through without experiencing some vast discomfort at the hands of the villain.  In this case, when the 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit glassblowers' furnace was introduced, with a five-foot punty iron tipped with molten liquid glass, I knew instantly how pain would be inflicted, and it curdled my blood.<br /><br />This is a story that held my interest to the end, in the time-honored tradition of British murder mysteries.  Generally, Francis keeps the language clean and when sex is alluded to, it is hinted at and relatively unobtrusive.  Francis has class.<br /><br />I like his work.<br /><br />Joseph Pierre	2000-11-16

Thomas, is the book you are looking for whether you are a novice or an experienced writer who has decided that self-publishing is the way to go.<br /><br />In most cases, whether you sell your manuscript to a publisher, or publish it yourself, you still must do whatever promotion is done.  Writing a book and promoting it are two entirely different challenges.  Can the same person write it, publish it, and promote it -- insuring that enough copies are sold to make it a successful venture?  The answer is yes, according to Thomas, and she gives you in-depth examples of fourteen people who did so, and how they did it.<br /><br />Self-publishing has grown into a lively industry in the United States, with an estimated 7,000 authors a year opting to start their own publishing business.  The people Thomas writes about have all done so successfully, and have made money doing it.  They have either cleared at least a... profit or have sold their book rights for a substantial sum.  Some are earning incomes in five or six figures.<br /><br />One of the trends Thomas has observed is the number of small self-publishers who have sold their books to large publishers.  They have used their self-publishing effort to demonstrate that, in fact, their books are salable, and thus gained the interest of the big houses that, in some cases, have either turned down their manuscripts or have refused to read them at all.<br /><br />Small presses are steadily taking substantial market share from the big Eastern publishing houses.  Books that the big East Coast publishers have haughtily refused to look at are being published across the country, and are selling thousand of copies.<br /><br />In Chapter One, &quot;Self-Publishing 101,&quot; Thomas talks about some of the necessary facts that people embarking on a self-publishing venture will need to know.  Most of the rest of the book is devoted to the successful publishers who have pulled it off, including their design sources, printers and wholesalers and other service providers.  She also lists many of these sources in an appendix.<br /><br />I am not myself a self-publisher... You will find this book useful, whether you are a novice or an experienced author.

This is a novel, designed for light reading.  I found it entertaining, well written, and a pleasant way to spend a few hours.  So, shoot me!<br /><br />British television meteorologist cum physicist Perry Stuart goes off with his friend and co-weatherman Kim to fly through a hurricane in the Caribbean as a vacation diversion, and they barely escape with their lives, and that's only the beginning.<br /><br />Dick Francis, former jockey to the queen of England, is a great yarn-spinner.  His tales always involve horse-racing, but they typically have another central theme as well.  Murder is usually, if not always, involved, and frequently international espionage as well, as in this one.<br /><br />This book is a quick read.  I read it in a few hours, over a weekend.  Francis writes very well, and his plots are plausible and his characters well fleshed out.  This is a good story, and up to his usual standard of excellence.  I don't know if he was a winning jockey, but he is certainly a winning story-teller.<br /><br />Joseph Pierre	2000-11-06

We must not question that!  Like we are all equal physically: blacks do not, on average, have longer limbs; the Japanese are not, on average, shorter in stature.  It's all only skin deep.  Is it okay if some of us have blond hair and blue eyes?  Is that where the racial differences begin and end?<br /><br />It's the diet that makes the percheron bigger and stronger, the green pastures it's raised in that makes the thoroughbred fast--but, it is certainly not its genetic inheritance!  All that effort to breed for speed is wasted.<br /><br />Professor Diamond ascribes it all to guns, germs and steel, and to the luck of the draw.<br /><br />&quot;The peoples of Northern Europe contributed nothing of fundamental importance to Eurasian civilization until the last thousand years; they simply had the good luck to live at a geographic location where they were likely to receive advances (such as agriculture, wheels, writing, and metallurgy) developed in warmer parts of Eurasia.&quot;<br /><br />Warmth apparently, according to Dr. Diamond, was an important factor:<br /><br />&quot;The sole North American societies to develop writing arose in Mexico south of the tropic of cancer.&quot;<br /><br />So, why did the sub-Saharan Africans not develop writing, or the wheel, or metal weapons and utensils on their own, while the ice-bound Scandinavians did?  They certainly are from a warmer climate.<br /><br />He says &quot;the proximate explanations are clear: some peoples developed guns, germs and steel, and other factors conferring political and economic power before others did; and some peoples never developed these power factors at all.&quot;<br /><br />In that, of course, he is right.  Where he is wrong, I submit, is in his conclusion that individual racial characteristics had nothing at all to do with it.<br /><br />The fact is that the original inhabitants of sub-Saharan Africa, even after a couple hundred years of intimate familiarization with modern machinery and European colonization in, for example, the Belgian Congo, when they achieved their &quot;freedom&quot; and took over the established infrastructure, defecated in and made campfires in the halls of plush hotels, and sold human body parts in their marketplaces.  When the machinery ran out of gas, they simply left it where it stopped, unable or unwilling to maintain it.<br /><br />After ten or eleven generations in the United States, people of black African extraction still, on average, test out 15 points below European Americans on the Stanford-Binet IQ scale.  In Africa, where there is little or no infusion of Caucasian genes, they test a full 30 points lower--on average.  Asians test higher than Caucasians.<br /><br/>Of course, intelligence is only one characteristic that varies from race to race:  athleticism is another.  Is it sheer coincidence that black athletes dominate many sports in the United States?  Or is it because they are genetically superior to Caucasians in athletic prowess?  Why do Asians, although a minority, attain more PhDs in physics and math?  Is it unreasonable to grant that they are mentally superior in those areas, as a race?<br /><br />Racism is one thing.  (The term was coined in the mid-twentieth century.) Denial of the obvious, and exercising convoluted reasoning and indulging in unreasonable, unsustainable theorizing in an attempt to avoid facing the truth in the name of Political Correctness is idiocy.<br /><br />This book is well-written and nicely edited, but the arguments presented are so full of holes that any freshman can see through them, without putting on his rose-colored glasses.<br /><br />Joseph Pierrer /><br />Of course, intelligence is only one characteristic that varies from race to race:  athleticism is another.

This is a beautifully illustrated, beautifully presented book depicting the tomato in all its glory.  Much of the full-color photography was done by the author himself, who, among other things was the editor and publisher of a high-quality slick magazine in the Monterey, California, area, when I lived there.<br /><br />Gary Ibsen was a good customer of my commercial art business, and we were friends, back in the 1970s.  But, this book is not about Gary.  It's hero is the tomato (Fruit, or vegetable?) in all its forms and varieties.<br /><br />The book contains tips on planting and growing tomatoes, as well as an education on the differences between the varieties,  and recipes from notable chefs on how to use them and enjoy them.  And, of course, it is replete with a great many fine full-color photographs, all well-presented and illustrative of the fruit, for the tomato is a fruit--the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to the contrary notwithstanding.<br /><br />Well done, Gary Ibsen!<br /><br />Joe Pierre<br /> former owner of Publisher's Art Service	2000-10-18

The quotes Roessler has collected, both attributed and unattributed, demonstrate clearly the abysmal depths of confusion, ignorance and raw stupidity of some of our country's leaders. Some of course are simply faux pas, and no doubt some are tongue in cheek, but you will laugh your way through the book.  Guaranteed.  And of course, that is the point of the book.<br /><br />Some of the things it misses, like the Secretary of Defense who couldn't pronounce the word 'nuclear,' (he called it nook-you-ler), which weapons he controlled, or the Secretary of State who called espionage es-SPY-onage, or the Surgeon General who thought that &quot;ever chile should be a wanned chile,&quot; are equally indicative of an incompetent vocabulary.<br /><br />I won't say that it proves that the election process that produces such &quot;leaders&quot; is flawed, but it certainly provides strong anecdotal evidence that either the process, or the voters' judgment, or both,  has placed some people of questionable intelligence in high positions of leadership.  It makes one wonder if perhaps it would be well to administer some form of intelligence test on wannabe candidates for high office, with at least the same minimal requirement as the civil service qualifications required of a dog catcher.<br /><br />But, this is a funny little book, and truly the source of some unbelievable quotes.

I am delighted with his writing, and the stories.  A pure delight from beginning to end.  He has been an actor, a publisher, and a university professor, and was educated at Oxford, among other places--all of which would be unimportant to the reader of fiction if he did not also have a genius for storytelling, which he did.<br /><br />His death, in 1995, was a great loss.  I say that because I have read these stories, and I'm sorry that there won't be more.<br /><br />From other reviews you will get an idea of the subject matter.  No need to embellish what has been so well said by others.  I loved this man's writing: his erudition and command of the subjects he covered--the world of the theater, carnivals, legerdemain and illusion, and his obvious depth of knowledge of Jungian psychoanalysis was entertaining and educational.<br /><br />I am going to be looking for more books by Robertson Davies.	2000-10-06

He has lived in India, but now  lives in Port Townsend, Washington--a delightful little seaport town on  Puget Sound with a Victorian atmosphere.<br /><br />This book also begins in a  small Washington town: Hazel Dell.  Perhaps an unlikely setting to begin a  novel, but appropriate in some ways considering the story line.<br /><br />The  story involves the impending visit by the United States' Secretary of State  to Israel, and a plot by Islamic fundamentalists to thwart the peace  process by killing her.  The U.S. and Israeli governments are determined to  keep a lid on the situation, and so they enlist the services of a  well-known archaeologist, Dr. Wil Wilson, to help them to unobtrusively  search for explosives.  No one is prepared for what they found.<br /><br />It is  an intriguing story.  The characters are well drawn, and the motivations  believable.  If I have a criticism, it would be that some of the religious  reactions are vastly overstated, but you will have to read the book and  decide that for yourself.<br /><br />Joseph Pierre	2000-09-13

There are probably few people in the United States with his  encyclopedic knowledge of guitars. I have corresponded with him myself, and  he was very helpful<br /><br />But, I am disappointed in one aspect of the book.  I own an 1897 model George Washburn guitar which was made in the nineteenth  century by Lyon &amp; Healy. It is a small bodied &quot;Parlor  Guitar,&quot; with Brazilian rosewood sides and back, spruce top, and ebony  fingerboard and bridge. It has beautiful tone, and I love the instrument.  It is almost as beautiful as when it was built, and because of the aging of  the wood, I'm sure that it plays better.<br /><br />In this book, Gruhn only  briefly discusses Washburn's guitars, and the short reference is buried in  the Gibson pages (which is very detailed), because in the late '20s, when  the Tonk Brothers acquired the Washburn brand from Lyon &amp; Healy, Gibson  built a few of them between 1938-40.<br /><br />George Washburn (someone has said  that his last name was actually Lyon, hence Lyon &amp; Healy) was an  American guitar maker, and he built superlative guitars. I've heard that  his closest competition at one time was Martin. To give him short-shrift in  such a book as this, I find incomprehensible. It isn't as if Gruhn did not  know about the guitars--he told me much of what I know about  them.<br /><br />But, perhaps I nitpick. This is a fine book. I recommend it to  any guitar aficionado who is buying, selling or trading guitars--especially  American-made guitars--or even one who simply wants to learn more about  these wonderful instruments.<br /><br />Joseph Pierre	2000-08-30

Nevertheless, it is very revealing, and the photography  and illustration is wonderful--much of it in full color.<br /><br />&quot;Nothing  happens without God's will,&quot; said von Richtofen, &quot;This is the  only consolation which we can put into our soul during this  war.&quot;<br /><br />In modern warfare, all pretense at chivalry and knightly  honor is gone.  Not even a memory of it remains.  Warriors kill their  &quot;enemy,&quot; both the enemy warriors and the civilian populations  with impunity, at long distance, with detachment and clinical precision.  In von Richthofen's time, at least in the beginning, it was different.  Their airplanes were made of sticks and fabric stuck together with animal  glue.  Their guns were primitive, and to fly at all, regardless of enemies  trying to kill you, was a dangerous proposition.  They were the pioneers of  aerial warfare, still clinging to the old traditions of the cavalry, and  honor, and courage, and chivalry toward a vanquished (&quot;unhorsed&quot;)  enemy.<br /><br />Their commanders forbade the wearing of parachutes, thinking  that it would encourage cowardice and the abandonment of the fight and  their valuable aircraft.  So, when the wings tore loose from the fuselage  in a high-G maneuver, or when the aircraft burst into flames, the aviator's  doom was sealed, and a horrible death resulted.<br /><br />On June 6th, 1917,  Manfred von Richthofen was shot down and received a head wound, with which  he was hospitalized.  He returned to duty.  On April 21st, 1918, less than  a year later, Rittmeister Manfred von Richthofen, intent upon shooting down  Lt. May's Sopwith Camel, of the 209th Squadron of the RAF, was himself  caught from behind by a burst of machine gun fire by Capt. A.R. Brown.  Brown saw him stiffen as he saw the burst of tracer.  He kept after his  quarry, Lt. May, though, as Brown pulled up and clear.  They flew behind  the English lines at treetop level, May twisting and turning, and von  Richthofen following each move with his red Fokker triplane.  The Baron was  hit by ground fire and landed his airplane, dead.  He had been officially  credited with 80 air-to-air kills, the largest number of any aviator on  either side in the First World War.<br /><br />This is an interesting book, both  for the insight into the Baron von Richthofen's character, and for the  information included in it about World War One aircraft and  tactics.<br /><br />Joseph Pierrecer.

Dyke is good, and explains a lot; especially the last paragraph, wherein he says,&quot;The reading (and  study) of [this book] is essential to an understanding of that mythical  hero, the Robin Hood of the Southwest, who was once just a bucktoothed,  thieving, murderous little cowboy-gone-bad, Billy the Kid.&quot;<br /><br />Of  course, the author, Pat Garrett, was not an unprejudiced reporter of  events, for it was he who ended the life of William Bonney, also known as  William Antrim (his foster father's surname).  It is also interesting I  think, in passing, to mention that Billy the Kid was not a product of the  West, but a transplanted New Yorker.<br /><br />Elsewhere, you will read that Pat  Garrett's writing effort is poor, and leaves much to be desired.  He  readily admits it.  In his own words, he says, &quot;I make no pretension  to literary ability, but propose to give to the public in intelligible  English, 'a round, unvarnished tale,' unadorned with superfluous  verbiage.&quot;<br /><br />Garrett is motivated, he says, by an &quot;impulse to  correct the thousand false statements which have appeared in the newspapers  and in yellow-covered cheap novels.&quot;<br /><br />And, there is no doubt at  all that the stories of Billy's exploits were greatly exaggerated by an  Eastern press eager for stories of gunplay and adventure on the Western  frontier.  Today's myth of Billy the Kid is largely descended from the pulp  stories created by the inflamed minds of Eastern &quot;journalists&quot;  and the latter-day Hollywood screen-writers who have made no attempt at all  to portray the truth.<br /><br />Pat Garrett claims to have known Billy  throughout the period known as the &quot;Lincoln County Wars,&quot; and  having listened to Bonney's reminiscences around campfires and says he has  interviewed many persons since Bonney's death.  That much would seem to be  undisputed.<br /><br />Bonney was born in 1859, six years after the birth of  another Southwestern hardcase, John Wesley Hardin.  In fact, they were  contemporaries and were raising hell at the same time.  Bonney, however,  died young at the age of 21, in 1881.  Hardin died at the age of 42--twice  Billy's age--in 1895.  And, if the rumors are true, Hardin probably killed  twice as many men.  They both started young.  Both are reputed to have had  fearful tempers.  Neither were killed in the face-to-face &quot;quick  draw&quot; shootouts so dear to the hearts of Hollywood writers.  Instead,  both of their executioners used stealth to kill their  quarries.<br /><br />According to Garrett, in Pete Maxwell's darkened bedroom,  where he shot Billy to death, Billy was holding a butcher knife in one hand  and drawing his double-action Colt &quot;Lightning&quot; revolver  (&quot;self-cocker&quot;) with the other, while asking in Spanish,  &quot;Quien es? Quien es?&quot;  (&quot;Who is it?  Who is it?&quot;)  They  were, again according to Garrett, at point blank range.  The only other  witness was Pete Maxwell.  There are other versions to the story, including  one which insists that Bonney was unarmed except for the knife, which he  had used to cut off a chunk of beef from a hanging carcass outside, because  he was hungry.<br /><br />My question is this: it is undisputed that he was  holding the knife, and the reason for which he had it.  So, where was the  beef?  It is unlikely that he ate it raw, or stuck it in a pocket.  Probably he was holding it in his other hand, intending to cook it.  In  which case, if he had a revolver tucked in his waistband, he must have had  to drop the beef to fetch his revolver.<br /><br />It is probably of little  importance; a Billy Bonney armed with a butcher knife, at close quarters,  would still have needed killing.  But, did he make the fatal mistake of  coming to a gunfight armed only with a knife?<br /><br />I think that this is an  important book, if for no other reason than the relationshipthat existed  between the author and William Bonney.  I recommend it.  My version is in  the hard cover.<br /><br />Joseph Pierreionship that existed  between the author and William Bonney.  I recommend it.

He was shot in the back of the head while standing at the bar in the Acme Saloon by John Selman in El Paso on August 19th, 1895. This book was published a year later by Smith & Moore Publishing in Sequin, Guadalupe County, Texas. It sold, in paperback, for fifty cents each.<br />Hardin was one of the real, genuine hard cases, in those days. It is said that he killed at least a score of men. By some accounts, it was at least 40.<br />Hardin was born in 1853, the son of a Methodist preacher, who proudly christened him after their faith's founder. No doubt he was expected to follow a spiritual path. It was not to be. He killed his first man, a freed negro who was full of his new freedom, and was going to chastise Hardin with a club out of anger for losing a wrestling match to the boy and his cousin the day before. Hardin killed him with a revolver.<br />Texas was administered at the time--immediately after the War between the States--by Northern carpetbaggers, and Hardin's life as an outlaw commenced.<br />He was captured, eventually, in Florida by Texas Rangers and brought back to Texas where he served time in prison. He was obviously intelligent and more literate than the average. After his release, he became a lawyer, and so his autobiography reads well, with probably no more self-justification and self-aggrandizement than most autobiographies.<br />It is said that he had his pockets lined with leather, so that he could carry his pistols without wearing out his clothing. Not a carry method conducive to the idiotic Hollywood myth of the \\"fast draw.\\"<br />John Wesley Hardin was a dangerous man with an ungovernable temper. His story, as told by himself, is more literate than most and highly readable. How well it adheres to the absolute truth is anyone's guess.<br />I found it most interesting.<br />Joseph Pierre<br />author, Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenance	2000-08-21

Yes, they call them &quot;Luthiers,&quot; and this is one of the books  that will get you started in learning the trade.  But, you need not have  building guitars for a living as your goal to enjoy and value this  book.<br /><br />Anyone who has a broken or damaged instrument, should know when  it is time to take it to a Luthier for the needed repair, or when it is  something he might tackle himself.  In the latter case, it would be well to  have this book, and one written by Hideo Kamimoto, called Complete Guitar  Repair.  Of the two books, this one is by far the most complete, as you  might expect. Kamimoto's book is more specifically aimed at repairs, as the  title suggests.<br /><br />Any guitar player, after he or she learns the scales  and how to place their hands and fingers on the instrument and to tune it,  will sooner or later develop a respect and curiosity for their instrument.  They will want to know what makes one instrument sound better than another,  or why the action is harder on the fingers on one, and relatively soft and  quick on another.<br /><br />What is the difference in strings, what wood gives  the best resonance in a sound board, why the differences in sizes and  shapes?<br /><br />Gradually, as your interest widens, you will come to this kind  of book.  This is one of the best.  From it, you will learn all of the  above, and more.  If you are willing to invest years, and acquire the tools  and the skills, perhaps you will eventually build your own guitar.

James Sherry, of  Chicago, was (and perhaps is still) an officer of Antiqua Casa  Sherry-Brener, Ltd., which in 1969 imported some factory-made classical  guitars from Japan, replete with the following label:<br /><br />Constructor de  Guitarras<br /> Antonio Hernandis<br /> Exclusivas Distribuidores<br /> Antigua  Casa Sherry-Brener, Ltd.<br /> No. 1  Madrid  1969<br /><br />I own one of the  guitars, which, from the label, one might suppose was manufactured in  Madrid.  Perhaps parts of it were.  Nowhere on the guitar, however, is  there any hint that it was manufactured or assembled in Japan, which two  different nationally recognized experts have assured me was the case.  it  is an absolutely beautiful guitar, well worth the price I paid.<br /><br />This  appears to be a very complete instructional book for the classical guitar.  It is well illustrated, both with photos and artwork (all black and white),  showing the parts of the guitar, its construction, tuning techniques, how  to sit and place the hands and fingers.  Very complete, indeed.<br /><br />Quite  a bit of the book is devoted to musical scores, with a good variety of  pieces.  There are also, of course, chord charts (minimal) and a dictionary  of musical terms.<br /><br />There are a great many instruction books for  beginning guitar players.  This appears to me to be as good as any.  It is  not a &quot;quicky&quot; method, but contains instruction in reading music,  as well as graphic depictions of some playing techniques utilizing the  fingers and fingernails.<br /><br />For the best instruction, one is advised to  get a competent teacher and receive one-on-one instruction.

Mansfield, Physics Today<br /><br />Truly a worthwhile book. The man who wrote  the Foreword to my own book, THE ROAD TO DAMASCUS, John Cantwell Kiley,  M.D., Ph.D., attempted a similar feat in his doctoral dissertation to that  attempted here by Capra--to compare the worlds of high energy physics and  that of Eastern mysticism.  His effort did not have the popular circulation  of Capra's book, of course, and was far more abstruse, though no less  insightful, perhaps.<br /><br />Kiley's dissertation was made into a hard-cover  book (no longer available), EINSTEIN AND AQUINAS: A RAPPROCHEMENT, and is  an attempt to compare Albert Einstein, the theoretical physicist, with  Saint Thomas Aquinas, although they would seem to have little in common.  Kiley studied at Princeton when Einstein was there, and so had a close up  view of him, and he knew Aquinas from his studies of the Saint. He found  the rapprochement he sought in their respective  epistemologies.<br /><br />Capra's book is much easier for the layman to grasp,  and is a delight to read. I recommend this book highly.

It is fiction, although many readers will see it as  &quot;based on fact.&quot;  It rather depends upon the reader's own belief  system, how they will view the book.<br /><br />Redfield has used the book as a  vehicle to expose his own philosophy, in much the same way as Ayn Rand used  Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead, but of course their philosophies are  different.  In fact, one could almost say that they are diametrically  opposed to each other.  Where Rand was a rationalist, Redfield is, well. .  .<br /><br />To best describe Redfield's premise, and the theme of the story,  perhaps it would be best to describe the readers who will probably most  enjoy the book: those who will exclaim over its probity and the  integrity--nay, saintliness--of the author.<br /><br />They will look you in the  eye fiercely and argue against adding fluorides to water, genetic  manipulation of, or adding &quot;chemicals&quot; to, food; or eating  &quot;dead&quot; food.  They will be vegetarians.  They will be certain  that large corporations are evil, and that &quot;materialism&quot; is the  bane of human existence.  They will be persuaded of the positive power of  love, and convinced that anger, the lust for power over others, and  violence are the ultimate destroyers of civilization.  <br /><br />These are the  people who will most enjoy this book, because Redfield is a champion for  all of those causes.<br /><br />The secret of Shambhala (Shangri-La) is the  &quot;Power of Prayer.&quot;  That becomes obvious at once.  But, prayer is  not simply wishing, or hoping, or idly asking God for a boon.  It is a  strong expectation.  It is the belief that something good (or bad) will  happen.  This is the force by which we shape our world, with the help of  angels, according to James Redfield's protagonist, whose name is never  given.The book is written in the first person.  He and his alter-ego,  Wilson James-who suddenly appears in the story without explanation, with  cryptic allusions to other adventures (and insights) of which the reader is  assumed to be aware--go to Tibet because a teen-aged girl tells them they  ought to, where the protagonist (and the reader) hope to discover their  reason for going to Tibet.<br /><br />In Tibet, their spiritual quest leads them  into conflict with the all-powerful atheists of the Chinese government, who  shamelessly apply force and violence and fan their paranoia, which, of  course, weakens their spiritual strength.  The government agents who dog  their every move, seem to know more about their quest than they do, and yet  they are supposedly motivated by the need to learn from our clueless  friends their purpose and destination.  It must have been tough for Chinese  intelligence to explain their mission to the comptroller and get funding  for the project!<br /><br />In all candor, the book held me to the end.  I read  it in one sitting.  (Although there are 238 pages, the type is large and  well spaced out, so it reads quickly (particularly if you skip over the  sermons lightly.)  The plot is airy-fairy, and the conflict is too  improbable to engage your critical intelligence.  Yet, read it I did.  As  in all good fiction, there is enough of a germ of truth in the underlying  premise it to make it, if not plausible, at least entertaining.  Do I  recommend it?  Sure! <br /><br />A most unusual novel.   <br />	2000-07-31

It is fiction, although many readers will see it as &quot;based on fact.&quot;  How they will view the book rather depends upon the reader's own belief  system.<br /><br />Redfield has obviously used the book as a vehicle to expose  his own philosophy, in much the same way as Ayn Rand used Atlas Shrugged  and The Fountainhead, but of course their philosophies are different.  In  fact, one could almost say that they are diametrically opposed to each  other.  Where Rand was a rationalist, Redfield is, well. . .<br /><br />To best  describe Redfield's premise, and the theme of the story, perhaps it would  be best to describe the readers who will most enjoy the book: those who  will exclaim over its probity and the integrity--nay, saintliness--of the  author:<br /><br />They will look you in the eye fiercely and argue against  adding fluorides to water, genetic manipulation of, or adding  &quot;chemicals&quot; to, food; or eating &quot;dead&quot; food.  They will  be vegetarians.  They will be certain that large corporations are evil, and  that &quot;materialism&quot; is the bane of human existence.  They will be  persuaded of the positive power of love, and convinced that anger, the lust  for power over others, and violence are the ultimate destroyers of  civilization.<br /><br />These are the people who will most enjoy this book,  because Redfield is a champion for all of those causes.<br /><br />The  &quot;secret&quot; of Shambhala (Shangri-La) is the &quot;Power of  Prayer.&quot;  That becomes obvious at once.  But, prayer is not simply  wishing, or hoping, or idly asking God for a boon.  It is a strong  expectation.  It is the belief that something good (or bad) will happen.  This is the force by which we shape our world, with the help of angels,  according to James Redfield's protagonist, whose name is never given.  The  book is written in the first person.  He and his alter-ego, Wilson  James--who suddenly appears in the story without explanation, with cryptic  allusions to other adventures (and insights) of which the reader is assumed  to be aware--go to Tibet where the protagonist (and the reader) hope to  discover their reason for going to Tibet.<br /><br />In Tibet, their spiritual  quest leads them into conflict with the all-powerful atheists of the  Chinese government, who shamelessly apply force and violence to thwart them  and fan their paranoia, which, of course, weakens their spiritual  strength.<br /><br />No plausible reason for this persecution is given, except  the intense curiosity of the Chinese government, which apparently already  knows more about the quest than does our hero, anyway.  Getting funding for  the operation must have been a chore for their intelligence  service.<br /><br />In all candor, the book held me to the end.  I read it in one  sitting.  (Although there are 238 pages, the type is large and spaced out,  so it reads quickly--particularly if you skip over the sermons lightly.)  The plot is airy-fairy, and the conflict is too improbable to engage your  total attention.  Yet, read it I did.  As in all good fiction, there is  enough of a germ of truth in the underlying premise to make it, if not  plausible, at least entertaining.  Do I recommend it?  Sure!

That was a mistake.  I was disappointed because he offered no background, or justification, or source for his ideas.  he simply laid them  out pedantically, as fait accompli.<br /><br />This book is much better.  I can  see why it achieved critical acclaim.  It is a clear attempt to explain  physics to the layman in terms that he will understand.  It still has some  faults, but generally he does an excellent job.<br /><br />Well, maybe not  faults--just misplaced emphasis.  For example, he goes on at great length  explaining the connection between wavelength and frequency and amplitude,  charting them and talking them to death, although they are very simple,  easy to understand concepts.  He does the same thing with three-dimensional  coordinates.  But, when he comes to difficult material to grasp, he often  slides into incomprehensible language, for example:<br /><br />&quot;In a quantum  mechanical experiment, the observed system, traveling undisturbed between  the region of preparation and the region of measurement, develops according  to the Schrodinger wave equation.  During this time, all of the allowed  things that could happen to it unfold as a developing wave function.  However, as soon as it interacts with a measuring device (the observing  system), one of those possibilities actualizes and the rest cease to exist.  The quantum leap is from a multifaceted potentiality to a single  actuality.&quot; (Page 75).<br /><br />Pretty turgid prose.  What he is talking  about is the firing of a photon through a shield with two slits in it, at a  wall where the hits were registered.  Much of the book could have been  written in far simpler terminology, while approximating the activity  discussed in more intelligible terms for the layman.<br /><br />However, that  said, Zukav does a good job of explaining some very difficult material.  Probably the scientists whom he ran the manuscript by contributed to the  confusion by insisting on language more precise than was needed in order to  get the ideas across.<br /><br />He does manage to express the mysteries  uncovered by high-energy physicists, and the  tendency of quantum  mechanics, more and more, to resemble statements made hundreds of years ago  by the Eastern mystics.<br /><br />I recommend this book, and have no difficulty  assigning it five stars.<br /><br />Joseph Pierre,<br /> Author of The Road to  Damascus: Our Journey Through Eternityuscript by contributed to the  confusion by insisting on language more precise than was needed in order to  get the ideas across.<br /><br />He does manage to express the mysteries  uncovered by high-energy physicists, and the  tendency of quantum  mechanics, more and more, to resemble statements made hundreds of years ago  by the Eastern mystics.<br /><br />I recommend this book, and have no difficulty  assigning it five stars.<br /><br />Joseph Pierre,<BR> Author of The Road to  Damascus: Our Journey Through Eternity<br />	2000-06-17

He knew his subject inside and out.  For example, here's a passage that demonstrates his knowledge of the square-rig and  sailing:<br /><br />&quot;'Man the fore clew-garnets.'<br /><br />&quot;His mind was  wholly concerned with making up these lost miles, for not only had the  Spartan gained this flying start, but the Surprise's former gain was now so  much handicap.  The first high gusts reached the frigate's royals and  skysails: she swung round: she gathered steerage-way, and as the sun went  down, turning her nascent wake blood-red, he began to make sail.  Hitherto  she had been beating up, with an array of sharply-braced square sails and  staysails reaching almost to the sky; now she was to have the breeze on her  quarter, or very near, and he set studdingsails aloft and alow, with a  ringtail to the driver, bonnets, of course, and save-alls under the  studdingsails and even the driver boom, brought the foretack to the cathead  with a passaree, cast off the maintack and hauled the weather-clew of the  maincourse to the yard.&quot; (page 97-98)<br /><br />O'Brian was not simply  making up those archaic terms.  He was describing actual procedures and  using real ship's nomenclature of the day.  For the non-sailor, to whom the  terminology might as well be in Greek, his main point is plain.  There was  a chase on.  He was clearly using every trick in the book.  For the  knowledgeable sailor, it is sheer delight to read.<br /><br />In this story,  replete with London politics, intrigue and espionage, the heroic Captain  Jack Aubrey innocently runs afoul of the law thrrough an ill-advised  investment scheme, and is disgraced and humiliated by being punished on the  pillory.  The ensuing adventure gives O'Brian's brilliant characterization  and often beautiful prose full play.<br /><br />That Patrick O'Brian was prolific  in no way detracts from the quality of his work.  Each story is a  masterpiece.  He demonstrates a marvelous insight into human emotions, and  engages you with his characters, showing their weaknesses and strengths; in  short, making them come to life.<br /><br />I have never read any author who so  skillfully caught me and addicted me to his stories.

Perhaps the largest hurdle remains: getting the book published and out on the market where people may buy it.<br /><br />This book looks at those problems, and contains a great deal of very good advice.<br /><br />Even the biggest publishers take a loss, or just break even, on most of the titles they publish. They are supported by the handful that achieve the most attention, and become big sellers. Like the movie industry, only a few become stars. And, of course, the giant's share of their promotion budget goes to the books which show the most promise, leaving the ones who really need it out in the cold.<br /><br />It is a humbling experience for a would-be author to go into a large bookstore, see all of the shelves full of books, and realize that his book will just be one more of the hundreds of thousands of new titles that show up each year.<br /><br />So, this book fills a need. How about publishing? The primary functions of the traditional publisher are selecting books that will sell in the first place, editing, proofreading, design, production and--most important--marketing. In most cases, the new author is the primary marketing agent for his book, anyway. Why should he give up 90% of the sales price when he must shoulder the main responsibility of the publisher?<br /><br />The author, who created the book, must usually be satisfied with 10% royalties, with the publisher retaining 90% for their production and marketing efforts.<br /><br />So, more and more writers, faced with aloof publishers who will not even read their book, let alone buy it, are taking the self-publishing route. They need Dan Poynter's book. It tells them what they need to know.<br /><br />First, this manual contains some basic rules on how to write a marketable book. Then, the problems they will face in producing it, and finally--certainly not least--promoting it in a crowded marketplace.<br /><br />He does a very good job. I only noted one neglected area, and, unfortunately it was the very area in which I was most interested: Print-on-demand.<br /><br />Well, I must tell you that Dan Poynter has corrected that deficiency.  In this, the latest edition of the Self-Publishing Manual, released in April of 2000, the entire area of Print-on-Demand (POD), as well as Print-Quantity-Needed (PQN)is amply covered with the latest available information.  I have certainly learned things of which I was not formerly aware from the book.<br /><br />There is a new force in the marketplace, called print-on-demand. Some of the publishers who are utilizing it are simply vanity houses, but many others are not. The era of one-off book publishing is here (POD), along with printing only the quantity actually required (PQN). No more need to warehouse long press runs until they sell, or necessity to pay inventory taxes on warehoused books waiting to be sold. The POD printer will print a single volume, as needed, and mail it to the customer for you, and send the publisher a monthly check, less the cost of printing.  It is a force that is changing the face of the publishing industry.<br /><br />The new technology is particularly good news for those books that sell only a few copies a month, or a year.  No longer must they be dropped from the publisher's catalog and go out-of-print.  They can simply be digitally archived and printed as needed for the occasional sale.<br /><br />There are problems unique to the &quot;New Book Model,&quot; which Dan Poynter addresses in detail.  For the new author contemplating self-publishing, or the author whose work has gone out-of-print, but for which there is still a residual market, this book is one which you should read.  There is information here that you are not likely to find addressed anywhere else.<br /><br />I cannot recommend it too highly.<br /><br />Joseph Pierre.<br /> Author of THE ROAD TO DAMASCUS: Our Journey Through Eternitye is information here that you are not likely to find addressed anywhere else.<br /><br />I cannot recommend it too highly.<br /><br />Joseph Pierre. <BR> Author of THE ROAD TO DAMASCUS: Our Journey Through Eternity<br />	2000-06-15

Each wrote a fascinating series, and each  approached their subjects from a different viewpoint, of course.  It is,  after all, fiction.  John Steinbeck also wrote a book on the subject: The  'Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights,' deriving his material from one  of the earliest sources, Thomas Mallory.<br /><br />All are worthy and  entertaining.

As a former reviewer said, \\"If you have a Garand, this book is a must.\\"<br />Major General Julian S. Hatcher is not just another author writing about just another rifle. He is talking about the rifle designed by John C. Garand (pronounced with a hard 'g', as in 'go,' with the accent on the first syllable, to rhyme with parent.) The rifle's name, however, is usually pronounced 'guh-RAND' by the men who used it.<br />And General Hatcher was in on the development of the famous old (WWII and Korea) rifle from the beginning.<br /><br />This is the rifle to which General George S. Patton referred, when he said, \\"The greatest battle implement ever devised by man!\\"<br />During the Second World War, the United States Army and the U.S. Marines (except in the very beginning, in the Philippines) were equipped with this rifle, and thus were the only combatants on either side equipped with a semi-automatic main battle rifle. With it, they could fire eight rounds of .30-'06 ammunition as fast as they could pull the trigger. When the ammunition in the clip was exhausted, the clip popped clear with a 'tinny' sound, and they simply shoved another in, and kept firing.<br />For a time, their enemies though they were all equipped with machine guns. And, the rifle was accurate and rugged. It would take punishment, and keep right on shooting.<br />Everything you could conceivably need to know about the \\"U.S. Rifle, Caliber .30, M1\\" is in this book: the history of its development and trials, general description, the sights, the operation, care and cleaning, disassembly and assembly, malfunctions and stoppages, ammunition, its use in World War Two, its use as a match rifle, and detailed photographs and drawings of its component parts.<br />I own one.

Persephone was the daughter of Zeus and Styx, or, in the more usual tradition, the daughter of Zeus and Ceres (Demeter).  Pluto carried her off while she was in the midst of  gathering flowers and made her his wife, and she became the queen of the  under world.  She symbolizes the changes of the seasons, and particularly  the return of Spring.<br /><br />This book is about mushrooms, particularly  mind-altering mushrooms, which the author, R. Gordon Wasson, refers to as  &quot;entheogens,&quot; a word he himself coined, meaning substances which  chemically induce religious experiences.<br /><br />In 1926, Wasson married a  Russian physician, Valentina Pavlovna, in England.  He was himself a  journalist employed by the New York Herald Tribune at the time.  His wife  introduced him to mushrooms, which in those days were little used by  Americans who looked down on them as &quot;toadstools&quot;, but were  enthusiastically embraced as a food by Europeans, who were far more  knowledgeable about them.<br /><br />Somewhere along the line, the couple became  persuaded that entheogenic mushrooms, particularly the Amanita Muscaria,  known colloquially as the 'fly agaric', was the original 'Soma' of legend,  used by the Greek oracles and others in rituals.<br /><br />This book traces  Wasson's single-minded pursuit of  evidence to buttress his theory in his  travels throughout the world, in the Americas as well as Europe and even  Siberia.  It is a scholarly attempt to make the case that mind-altering  mushrooms may have been responsible for mankind's most primitive religious  feelings, leading to the very beginnings of religion as we know it  today.<br /><br />He traces their religious use in Mexico, Central and South  America, India (where they have fallen out of favor), China, Siberia,  Europe, and of course ancient Greece.<br /><br />This book is a scholarly work,  heavily footnoted (but without an index) and illustrated liberally with  photographs and artwork.  It is clear that Wasson was very single-minded in  his interest, to the point where some of his conclusions may be attributed  more to enthusiasm for his subject than objective science.<br /><br />He does not  dwell on the preparation of the Amanita Muscaria, which apparently can be  quite toxic if not prepared carefully and with  knowledge.<br /><br />Unfortunately, perhaps, the book has become something of a  &quot;cult book&quot; for some modern recreational drug users.  I have seen  some internet websites, in which contributors refer to Wasson as an  authority on &quot;'shrooms,&quot; and where the language used indicates  other than academic interest.<br /><br />Apparently the Fly Agaric mushroom is  the original source of the chemical psilocybin, the mind altering drug that  induces hallucinations on a par with those experienced under the influence  of d-Lysergic Acid Diethylamide-25 (LSD).<br /><br />Joseph Pierre,<br /> Author of  THE ROAD TO DAMASCUS: Our Journey Through Eternityberally with  photographs and artwork.

The first Luger was produced toward the end of the 19th century, when Georg Luger came up with it as an improvement on the Borchardt pistol.<br />This book is an extensive history of the Luger, from its inception (and before) to the present. It will be of great interest to Luger aficionados, as well as to firearms enthusiasts who are merely appreciative of its unusual design.<br />The Luger is unlike any other pistol in current production. Yes, it is still produced and available from Stoeger Firearms Company, an American company that has owned the Luger name since the 1920s. As a matter of fact, I have one that was manufactured in Houston, Texas, of stainless steel, with a six-inch barrel.<br />The Germans do not call the pistol the 'Luger,' but rather, 'Pistolen-08,' because it was adopted by the German Army in 1908. The Swiss adopted it first, in 7.65 mm in 1900, with the first pistols arriving for service in 1901.<br />The German Army adopted it in the 9mm 'Parabellum' (for war) caliber.<br />The Luger is easily identified in silhouette by the unusual toggle action, on the top rear of the receiver, and the raked grip, which makes the pistol a 'natural pointer.'<br />This book, in addition to a detailed text concerning the history and variations of the pistol, also contains many fine photographs of specimens, many in a special center section on coated paper. There are also several detail drawings of interest, and descriptions of many of the markings of the various versions offered.<br />This is a book that will be especially of interest to people who are attracted to famous firearms, and of course to Luger collectors.<br />Joseph Pierre,<br /> Author, Handguns and Freedom..their care and maintenance<br />and other booksbr /> Author, Handguns and Freedom..their care and maintenance<br />and other books	2000-06-08

He contributes to The Hook magazine, The Blue Press, and is a fellow member of the Association of Naval Aviation, Flying Beaver squadron.<br />This book is all about my favorite fighter aircraft of all time, Grumman's F6F \\"Hellcat.\\" Of all the Japanese aircraft shot down in air-to-air combat during the Second World War, this airplane and its pilots accounted for nearly 8 out of 10 of them.<br />Yet, it was a \\"generic\\" fighter, the big brother to the tubby, feisty little F4F \\"Wildcat\\" with which the U.S. Navy started the war, but which was outclassed by the A6M2 \\"Zero\\" of Mitsubishi, which could outclimb, outmaneuver and, worse--fly further on a tank of gas. So, they could strike our ships while they were still out of our range.<br />Leroy Grumman and his \\"Iron Works\\" at Bethpage, Long Island, came up with the antidote. The \\"Hellcat\\" went from drawing board to test flight in only a year, making her first flight on June 26, 1942, almost exactly a year after the Navy had first requested the aircraft to replace the obsolescent \\"Wildcat\\". The first flight of a production F6F-3 was on October 3rd.<br />The airplane had no bad habits. It was easy to fly, and had good visibility of the flight deck on final, unlike the long-nosed F4U Vought Sikorsky (later, Chance Vought) \\"Corsair,\\" which was dubbed the \\"Ensign Eliminator.\\"<br />Tillman, whose father was a naval aviator in the Second World War, has demonstrated a devotion to naval aviation, and has written a number of books about the aircraft of that war and the men who flew them.<br />His books bring back memories. You can almost hear the unmuffled roar of the Pratt & Whitney Twin Wasp R2800, all 2,000 horsepower belching flame from the exhaust stacks as the airplane strains against her brakes and chocks preparing for takeoff from the carrier deck.<br />No one writes it better than Barrett Tillman, and he is a fellow Oregonian, to boot!<br />Joseph Pierre,<br /> Author: Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenance<br />and other booksr: Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenance<BR>and other books	2000-06-06

I first met them in their book, 'Once is Enough,' wherein they  were pitchpoled, rolled over, dismasted and very nearly swamped by a  following rogue wave in the 'roaring  forties' between Australia and the  South American coast, to which they went on a jury rig for repairs.<br /><br />In  this book, the Smeeton's describe how they sailed to Japan to return the  Samurai sword of a Japanese officer from whom Smeeton had accepted  surrender during the Second World War.<br /><br />A Samurai sword is an object of  almost spiritual reverence to the Japanese, held for generations in a  family, and of inestimable value.  So, General Smeeton wanted to return  it--a matter of honor.<br /><br />Which he did, successfully, to an overwhelmed  and very grateful Japanese gentleman.<br /><br />The book describes their stay in  Japan, and especially a place called Mori, where they wintered their boat,  hauling her out, stripping her of her rigging, unstepping her masts, and  refinishing her bottom.<br /><br />The book is replete with details of Japan and  its people, the friendships that the Smeetons made, and some  misunderstandings resulting from cultural differences, some of which are  quite amusing.<br /><br />This is a book primarily of interest, perhaps, to other  cruising sailors, but I think it will also please those with an enduring  curiosity about other cultures and places.<br /><br />If you can get hold of a  copy, I think you will enjoy it.

William Rusher was a Wall Street lawyer who abandoned his legal career to become publisher of Bill Buckley's conservative 'National Review' magazine, a spot he no longer occupies.  He is well-known for his  appearances on the radio and television, his syndicated column, his  lectures, and his political activism.  He helped in Goldwater's campaign  for the presidency in 1964.<br /><br />In this book, he makes a persuasive case  that the national media elite are heavily biased in favor of the  politically liberal viewpoint.  He supports his view with case histories,  naming the people and outlets involved.<br /><br />So, what else is  new?<br /><br />Accuracy in Media has been doing the same thing for years, to no  avail.  Polls have been taken, demonstrating that the reporters, editors,  talking heads and other functionaries of network television news and the  great newspapers (NY Times, Washington Post, LA Times, USA Today) and the  AP are all, virtually unanimously, devoted to the liberal cause.<br /><br />The  Constitution provides for freedom of the press, which includes the freedom  to slant the news, if the practitioners choose to.  There is no law that  they be unbiased.<br /><br />It is not an original thought with Rusher.  This is  just another book, telling us what we already know.  Now, it is  out-of-print.<br /><br />Although it is well-written and persuasive, I think it  is not a major loss.  The sun rises in the morning; we have learned to live  with that.  We have also learned to live with a liberal press.  It's just  the nature of the beast.<br /><br />Joseph Pierre,<br /> Author of THE ROAD TO  DAMASCUS: Our Journey Through Eternity	2000-06-06

First copyrighted in 1947, this 53-year-old book is still a prize.  Oh, there are new building methods it doesn't cover: you won't find fiberglass moulding or layup discussed, for example, or ferro-cement, or  carbon fiber.<br /><br />But, you will find out how to steam-bend frames, lay  down lines, and you'll be reminded not to forget the forgotten limber  holes.<br /><br />This is &quot;old fashioned&quot; boatbuilding--how to build  wooden boats.  It tells you what wood to choose for each purpose, and what  fasteners to use, and best of all, it provides several excellent plans from  which you can build your dream boat.<br /><br />It takes a lot of patience to  build a boat right.  It can takes months, even years of dedication.  It is  a big investment, not only in money, but in time and labor.  But, it is  something you can learn to do, and in the end, you will sail the boat you,  yourself, built.  No other feeling I know of can match that pride.  I did  it.  I built the 'Wild Goose,' and sailed her on the ocean with my  family.<br /><br />I built one of Rabl's designs, also.<br /><br />I took his plans for  the Picaroon--the round bilged version--and built a model of her at one  inch to the foot scale.  I built every frame exactly the way I would have  in actual size, and I planked her one plank at a time, carvel planked.  I  built each detail, scaled down from the original.  I even made a keel  mould, in sand, melted some wheel weight lead, and poured the keel, which I  then fastened to her keelson with miniature keel bolts.<br /><br />Then, when the  hull was finished, I covered her in thin fiberglass (not called for in the  plans), which I then sanded and polished.  She is rigged with mast hoops  instead of a sail slide, and is a gaff-rigged sloop.<br /><br />I made a  pin-rail, and rigged her like the full-sized boat.  The hatches work.  There are two bunks inside the cabin, and--an oaken bucket for a  head.<br /><br />I have sailed her on a small, quiet lake.  She sails  beautifully.

The people who live in the St. Johns district of Portland,Oregon, (about 50 miles from here) would be surprised to know thatthey live in a place described as &quot;redneck, blue-collar, white trash. Low rent. Low class. Lowlife. Truckers, welders, meth dealers, pit bulls, rotted picket fences.  An old, faded-pea-soup-colored suspension bridge spans the Willamette River over to Forest Park's sinsemilla-green hills.&quot;<br /><br />A little harsh...<br />All of this is in the chapter titled &quot;White niggers have feelings, too&quot;, which is fairly typical of the book.<br /><br />The author is a self-proclaimed &quot;redneck&quot;; a veritable champion of rednecks. A hater of those who attack the working class with slurs like, &quot;gap-toothed, inbred, uncivilized, violent, and hopelessly DUMB.&quot;<br /><br />Now, who does that?<br /><br />...I am a self-proclaimed redneck--and yet, for humor, I run &quot;redneck jokes&quot; fairly regularly.  Jeff Foxworthy is notorious for the same thing, and apparently he has an intimate acquaintance with the people from whom he gets his material.<br /><br />I don't hate the working class.  I love them.  Apparently Mr. Good sees a vast injustice being done to the people with whom he identifies, while Foxworthy and I see humor.  The dust jacket proclaims that he has an &quot;unmatched ability for rubbing salt in cultural wounds.&quot;<br /><br />If you are angry, and feel victimized, and want to read a book that fans your anger and provides justification for your feelings, this may be your book.  It is well-written, and Jim Goad certainly has a viewpoint.<br /><br />If, on the other hand, you have learned to laugh at the incongruous frustrations that we all encounter while we make the best of the hand we have been dealt in life, maybe you'll be better off to take a pass on this one. It is the complaint of a very angry young man.<br /><br />Joseph Pierre	2000-06-06

He sailed as a ship's master, and worked as a cooper and  ship's chandler, but his all-consuming interest was in mathematics.  He  learned French, Spanish, German, Latin and Greek in order to absorb the  discoveries of others, and at the age of 16 was reading Newton's  'Principia,' translating it from Latin--and he found errors.  He later  published his own findings, and they were accepted.  He wrote his first  almanac at the age of 15.  He developed an new, simplified method of  determining lunar distance, and on his voyages began to find errors in John  Moore's 'The Practical Navigator,' the leading navigational text.

Their  impressions are based upon what others told them of him.  Paul met him for  the first time as an apparition, on the road to Damascus.  Luke, the  physician, came along long after his death.<br /><br />Cahill says, &quot;[N]one  of the disciples who gathered around Jesus and then formed the early  Church--considered Jesus to be God.  This would have been blasphemy to  them.  Their belief in Christ was, after all, a form of Judaism; and  Judaism was the world's only monotheism.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;By the end of the  first century, however, the Fourth Gospel, the one attributed to John, had  reached its final form;&quot;  (Note that Jesus had been dead for sixty or  seventy years by then) &quot;and here we find, for the first time, Jesus  acclaimed as God.&quot;<br /><br />John the Evangelist, says Cahill, whose Greek  is too good for him to have been the same John who authored the book of the  Revelation.<br /><br />There is much to be gained by reading this book, whether  you are a Christian or not.

It was apparently featured on FreshAir (whatever that is) and Rekha Basu, a newspaper columnist, recently featured  it in her column which is syndicated nationwide.  That kind of attention is  hard to get, for a new author.  What's next...Oprah?  That's the advantage  of having a big, powerful publisher.<br /><br />It is a good book.  I bought it  from Amazon as a result of Basu's column, which I rarely read because of  her antipodal political views, but my wife did, and she thought it sounded  interesting, so we ordered it.<br /><br />Nathaniel Lachenmeyer, upon his  father's death, and probably driven by guilt because of his own attempts to  distance himself from Charles, his father, during the final years of his  life when Charles was ravaged by disease, decides to retrace his father's  life.<br /><br />His father, Charles Lachenmeyer, was raised in an abusive family  (in particular, his mother, who kept him in a &quot;double-bind&quot;  (unwinnable situation).  As a consequence, he became a highly controlled  over-achiever, driven his own internal demons.<br /><br />As so many do, he,  subconsciously perhaps, correctly diagnosed his own affliction and thus  entered one the fields best suited to its study, sociology, with psychology  as a minor.  Only psychiatry would have suited his need better.  He  achieved a Ph.D., and the acclaim of his professors, while paying  particular attention to schizophrenia.<br /><br />Then, after achieving early  success, his mental health began to deteriorate.  He quickly progressed  from an eminent professor to a crazed, homeless, unkempt transient--all of  which was witnessed by his young son, who feared him in his final  role.<br /><br />So this is the biography of Charles, as far as Nathaniel has  been able ascertain his movements, and the autobiography of his son  Nathaniel.  It is a poignant story, and contains much information on  paranoid schizophrenia.<br />Nathaniel portrays his father's illness as  having strong environmental causes, downplaying the hereditary role,  perhaps, understandably, out of fear.  It is clear, though, that Charles'  mother was probably a borderline paranoid schizophrenic herself, and one  must wonder about the hereditary aspect.<br /><br />In any case, if you have an  interest in schizophrenia, this might be the book for you.  The claim is  made that one third of the &quot;street people&quot; in the United States  are victims of schizophrenia or bi-polarism (manic depression).

Muse Norcross Kotenev was in Tsingtao, China, at an intensely interesting time in history, and one that is sparsely documented.  She also spent time in Shanghai, of course, but  Tsingtao holds my interest because I was there when she was.<br /><br />I can  vouch for some of the details in her book.<br /><br />Muse was born of White  Russian parents (as opposed to &quot;Red&quot; Russians, or communists) who  fled Russia because her mother was not only of the upper merchant class,  but her father was a Czarist officer, and would certainly have been killed  had they stayed.<br /><br />He was a semi-invalid because of war wounds, who  found employment in China, to which they immigrated, as a court  interpreter.  There were many, many White Russians in China in the late  'forties.  I was acquainted with some of them.<br /><br />The book is all about  her life in China, where her parents lived reasonably well and where she  left them, finally, when she married a U.S. Navy captain.  She never saw  them again.<br /><br />It is a typical autobiography, and like all  autobiographies is no doubt selective in the memories recounted, as well,  probably, as indifferent in their accuracy.  I noticed, for example, that  she refers to ships of the merchant marine as U.S. (United States) instead  of S.S., and other niggling, unimportant inaccuracies which one might  expect of a female writer who is only an average observer of the details  around her and dismissive of things that do not impinge on her directly.  In other words: normal.<br /><br />All in all, though, the book is informative  about conditions in China at a time rarely written about, but nevertheless  when astonishingly important political events were taking place.<br /><br />Muse  actually met Mao Tse-Tung, for example, before he took over the country.  A  privilege not enjoyed by many Westerners.  He dined in her family home,  near Tsingtao (now referred to as Qingdao).<br /><br />Because I spent all of  1948 in China, the last year the country was ruled by Chiang Kai Shek and  his Kuomintang, I welcome every eyewitness report of the country during  that period.  This is a good book for its historical significance.  I hope  you will buy it and read it.<br /><br />Joseph Pierre,<br /> Author of THE ROAD TO  DAMASCUS: Our Journey Through Eternity>Because I spent all of  1948 in China, the last year the country was ruled by Chiang Kai Shek and  his Kuomintang, I welcome every eyewitness report of the country during  that period.

He notes the epistemic capture of his twins, without properly crediting Heraclitus for it.  He writes: &quot;[For them] there was no longer any such a thing as a ... person with a  recognizable identity.&quot; ( p. 21.)  Which is only to say that, in their  opinion,  Socrates' I  was transient.<br /><br />True we cannot step into the  same river twice, it being transient, but a lot of dazzling Greek  philosophizing happened after that of the Presocratics, Socrates' for  one.<br />  Is everything  in the world of common experience transient?<br />  &quot;No,&quot; says Socrates, confident of the  survival-after-death of his never-changing I.<br />  What rendered Darwin  and Freud  blind both to the reality of their unchanging I-dentity and to  its immunity to change and to death?  In my judgment their minds, already  befuddled by their daillance with atheism,  were further obtunded by their  jejune diet of  Heraclitean junk food,  having by-passed the solid  nourishment afforded by  Plato and Aristotle.<br />  What had atheism to do  with it?  Simply this: the condign punishment for denying the existence of  God (the Supreme I) is to evolve into one of Time's fools.  This is perhaps  the most ironic evolutionary event of all.  Of this syndrome, Nicolas  Berdyaev, the celebrated 20th century Russian philosopher wrote  illuminatingly as follows: &quot;That is the essence of the tragedy as it  affects the philosopher [the thinker].  On the one hand, he is incapable of  supporting, indeed, refuses to suffer the authority of religion; on the  other, he tends to lose all notion of Being, and the strength it imparts,  as soon as he becomes detached from religious [transcendent]  experience.&quot;<br /><br />One cannot but sympathize with D&amp;F for trying to  salvage whatever the transient world might offer.<br />  Of this, however, I  am sure: Socrates would not have settled  for the ephemeral beauty of a  Brazilian rain forest, or for the raptures of psychoanalytical procedures.<br />  More highly evolved than Mr. Phillips' two &quot;masterminds,&quot;  Socrates naturally selected for the real gold of I-existence over the  fool's gold of the transient ego.<br />  --John Cantwell Kiley, M.D.,  Ph.D. (philosophy)ocrates would not have settled  for the ephemeral beauty of a   Brazilian rain forest, or for the raptures of psychoanalytical procedures.  <br />   More highly evolved than Mr. Phillips' two &quot;masterminds,&quot;   Socrates naturally selected for the real gold of I-existence over the  fool's gold of the transient ego.<br />      --John Cantwell Kiley, M.D.,  Ph.D. (philosophy)	2000-05-31

Probably it has something to do with one's political predisposition.<br /><br />S. Fred Singer is a preeminent  authority on energy and environmental issues.  Among other things, he  designed the first satellite instrument for measuring atmospheric ozone and  was a principal developer of scientific and weather satellites.<br /><br />A  research fellow at the Independent Institute in Oakland, California, and  president of the Science and Environmental Policy Project, he is also  Professor Emeritus of Environmental Science and a member of the Energy  Policy Studies center at the University of Virginia.  His academic honors  and qualifications are too many to list here, but many of them are in the  About the Author section in the book<br /><br />To accuse him of intentionally  slanting his opinions because his work has been utilized by some energy  companies is scurrilous and denigrating.  His work has also been utilized  by government agencies, because he is an acknowledged expert in the  field.<br /><br />This book is replete with facts, figures, graphs, and a great  variety of evidence to back up his opinions.  There are eight pages of  closely typeset references of people who agree with his  conclusions.<br /><br />Singer, in the book, discusses the scientific case  against the Global Climate Treaty, and says that there is no detectable  anthropogenic (man caused) evidence of global warming, and further that the  consequences of modest global warming would be positive, rather than  negative.<br /><br />He discusses the so-called &quot;greenhouse effect,&quot;  and recommends prudency over panic.  He says that, contrary to the major  thrust of the Second Atmospheric Report of the IPCC (1996), studies by  Hansen, et al, conclude that anthropogenic aerosol gases are of lesser  importance, but that the ozone depletion of the last 20 years can cancel up  to 50 percent of the greenhouse gas climate effects.<br /><br />This book is a  very good source of information, from a scientist who taught us how to  measure these effects, and which will dispel many of the myths being  peddled by socialists who are today masquerading as environmental wackos in  order to attain their political ends.<br /><br />I recommend it to  you.<br /><br />Joseph Pierre,<br /> Author of THE ROAD TO DAMASCUS: Our Journey  Through Eternityof the greenhouse gas climate effects.<br /><br />This book is a  very good source of information, from a scientist who taught us how to  measure these effects, and which will dispel many of the myths being  peddled by socialists who are today masquerading as environmental wackos in  order to attain their political ends.<br /><br />I recommend it to  you.<br /><br />Joseph Pierre, <BR> Author of THE ROAD TO DAMASCUS: Our Journey  Through Eternity<br />	2000-05-29

He was born in 384 B.C., and died 62 years later.  His father,  Nicomachus, was the court physician and a friend of the king.  He studied  under Plato for twenty years, until the latter's death.  Although he  criticized Plato's doctrines in later years, he always spoke of his master  with greatest reverence.<br /><br />Many of his popular writings were written in  dialogue form, and were modeled in both subject matter and style, after  Plato's.  The writings which are traditionally attributed to him seem to  have come primarily from the works prepared and arranged by Andronicus of  Rhodes in about the first century.&lt;P.<br />He wrote The Treatises on Logic;  The Rhetoric and the Poetics; The Work on the first Philosophy (also called  The Metaphysics); The Works on Natural Science; and The Ethics and  Politics.<br /><br />Mortimer Adler, the author of this book, says that his sons,  Douglas and Philip, 13 and 12 respectively, read his manuscript  enthusiastically, and so you may assume that the book is easy to  assimilate.  Which it is.<br /><br />Why philosophy?  Adler says, I think  correctly, that philosophy is everyone's business, to help us understand  things we already know better than we now understand them.<br /><br />And, it is  humbling to know, when you finally think you understand something, to find  that someone--Aristotle, for example--understood it more than three hundred  years before the birth of Christ, and without the benefit of television  documentaries.<br /><br />This book should probably be in your  library.<br /><br />Joseph Pierre,<br /> Author of THE ROAD TO DAMASCUS: Our  Journey Through Eternity	2000-05-29

The scriptures containing the teachings of the Buddha.  Most of the major Sutras were originally written in Pali or Sanscrit, although some were  written in Tibetan or Chinese.  They are among the world's oldest  literature.<br /><br />These Sutras are called The Sutra of Innumerable Meanings;  The Sutra of the Lotus Flower of the Wonderful Law; and The Sutra of  Meditation on the Bodhisattva Universal Virtue.  Ananda, a cousin of  Sakyamuni and one of the Buddha's ten great disciples, famous for his  excellent memory, is supposed to have memorized the Buddha's sermons, which  were later recorded as Sutras.<br /><br />The word bodhi, used in Bodhisattva,  means 'wisdom,', or enlightenment, and pertains to buddhahood.  Boddhisattva, then, refers to a living being in the final stages of  achieving buddhahood, or becoming one who is enlightened.<br /><br />These are  among the most important of the Sutras.  At their heart are three major  concepts of Mahayana (the great path) Buddhism: First, all sentient beings  may attain perfect enlightenment, the main goal of Buddhism; Second, the  Buddha is eternal, having existed throughout the infinite past and  appearing in many forms throughout the ages, guiding and teaching the law;  and Third, the noblest form of Buddhist practice is the way of the  Boddhisattva, who devotes himself to enlightenment.<br /><br />The Threefold  Sutra records three of the sermons preached by the Buddha best-known to us  (Siddhartha, a prince of Gautama, of the Sakyamuni clan--sometimes referred  to simply as Sakyamuni) to a host of boddhisattvas, consisting of the  &quot;Opening Sutra,&quot; the &quot;Meditation on the Boddhisattva  Universal Virtue Sutra,&quot; and finally the &quot;Lotis  Sutra.&quot;<br /><br />For the serious student of Buddhism, this is a most  desirable book.<br /><br />Joseph Pierre,<br /> Author of THE ROAD TO DAMASCUS:  Our Journey Through Eternity	2000-05-28

The Holographic Universe, by Michael Talbot<br /> Harper Perennial, 1992<br /><br />This book was recommended to me by a good friend who had read my book ('The Road to Damascus', iUniverse, 1999).  I am grateful to her.  It  is a book I would not have wanted to miss.<br /><br />I had just finished 'The  Elegant Universe,' by Brian Greene, which is a remarkable exposition of the  so-called 'superstring theory, ' as well as the best, most easily  understandable explanation of relativity and quantum theory that I have yet  read.  'The Holographic Universe,' however, is in a different category  altogether.<br /><br />Talbot's formal educational accomplishments, background or  qualifications are not given in the book, save to say that he is the author  of 'Mysticism and the New Physics' and 'Beyond the Quantum.'  He lives in  New York City.<br /><br />He does, however, inform us that he has a personal  background that includes psychical abilities (the ability to perceive  auras, and a history of causing poltergeist phenomenon as a  child.)<br /><br />His basic thesis is that the universe is a hologram, composed  of interference patterns, and, basically, that mind and 'matter' are  interactive, and that essentially, the human mind can and does exercise  some control over the material world, including causing and healing illness  and psychokinetic effects.<br /><br />He names several scientists and others who  are in agreement with him, and in fact does not claim to be the originator  of the theory.<br /><br />As I understand holography, and I freely admit that my  understanding is rudimentary, a holographic image of an object is created  by the use of a laser beam which is bounced off the original object and  then split (by mirrors) into a reference beam and an interference beam  which come together again to form an image on film composed of an  unintelligible pattern of interference waves (like concentric circles on a  pond caused by dropping two or more rocks in the water at different  locations.)  The film image remains unintelligible until another laser beam  is passed through it (any part of it) which forms a three-dimensional image  of the original object, in mid-air.<br /><br />Thus, it is difficult for me to  correlate that understanding into a theory of the composition of the  universe.  I can understand that the universe might be composed of  interference waves, but where is the original 'object'?<br /><br />Michael Talbot  speaks of an 'implicate order' and an 'explicate order.'  If I understand  him, and I think I do, he is substituting the term 'implicate order' for  the original, causative source of everything.  The explicate order is the  'reality' in which we are entrapped.<br /><br />In my book, I simply use the  word 'God' for essentially the same radical root of reality (the implicate  order.)  Perhaps our versions of reality are for all intents and purposes  the same, except for terminology.  I rather suspect that is  true.<br /><br />Talbot speaks of, and quotes, many sources.  The only one whom I  have personally met is Dr. Stanislav Grof, who spoke at a seminar I  attended once at Asilimar in central California.  He was impressive.  Talbot describes 'miracles,' including healing, therapeutic touching and a  variety of strange and unusual happenings which require a suspension of  disbelief, but which, if you can subscribe to his theory are explainable  within that framework.<br /><br />He gives, names, cites his sources, and  provides a subject index.  The book appears to be a scholarly work, on  which he has spent considerable time and effort.  Whether the universe is  technically a hologram, or not, will be debatable for some time to come, no  doubt, as the scientific proof seems as difficult to obtain as proof of  string theory.<br /><br />  Do I recommend his book?  By all means!  And then, or  even before you buy it, I recommend my own book to you.  Mine is only 124  pages, and it is, I think, far easier to understand.  And, we seem to be  saying much the same thing.<br /><br />Regardless, Talbot's book is well worth  reading, and will hold your attention, I'm sure.  I rate it at an easy five  stars.<br /><br />Joseph Pierre,<br /> Author of THE ROAD TO DAMASCUS: Our Journey  Through Eternity.easier to understand.

One cannot put it down.  Yet, I don't trust his version  of events, and that distrust ruins it all for me.<br /><br />The book was a gift.  I would not have bought it, but I read it.<br /><br />His partisanship, though  usually disguised, is always present, and his opportunism and obsessive  ambition makes everything he says suspect.<br /><br />That said, if you can  credit him, this is a good book.  It is filled with details of the last  five presidents, beginning with Gerald Ford and ending with Bill Clinton.  Over half the book (593 pages, total) is about Clinton.  Ronald Reagan gets  a meager 79 pages.  Jimmy Carter only 45.<br /><br />One of the problems with the  book is Woodward's tendency to fictionalize.

He was born Joseph ben Mathias (Joseph the son of Mathias) in a family of Jewish priests.  He spent time in the Essene sect  (who are reputed to have hidden the Dead Sea scrolls), and then became a  Pharisee at the age of 19.<br /><br />He was well-educated, and was greatly  impressed by the seemingly undefeatable power of Rome.  He was against the  growing Jewish rebellion, and finally he adopted the family name of the  emperor Flavius.<br /><br />He was initially taken as a prisoner to Rome where  his life was spared when he predicted that Vespasian would become emperor.  His prediction was realized, he was released, granted citizenship  and  marched with Vespasian's son, Titus in A.D. 70.<br /><br />Drawing on his own  experience, which was extensive, as well as other historians of the time  whose writings are now lost to us, he has left us with an indispensable  library, almost infinite in detail, of the era around the beginnings of the  first century A.D. in the area of Palestine, its personalities and  happenings.<br /><br />The only (extremely brief) mention of Jesus in his history  is thought by most scholars to have been added, or at the very least  heavily edited by Constantine's scholars, who were dismayed at the lack of  comment by him on the life they considered should have been of paramount  importance to any writer of that era's history.<br /><br />His history provides  the best source of information on the customs, agriculture, geography,  politics, religion, social traditions and insights into outstanding  personalities of the day, such as Herod and Felix.<br /><br />Josephus' work is  indispensable to any serious scholar of that period.<br /><br />Joseph  Pierre,<br /> Author of THE ROAD TO DAMASCUS: Our Journey Through Eternity	2000-05-26

It is the story which led to the movie, &quot;The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas,&quot; a  great movie with Dolly Parton and Burt Reynolds.<br /><br />But, the book is  nothing like the movie!  It's even better.  This is the story of the oldest  continuously operating whorehouse in Texas.  It first opened for business  in 1844, in La Grange, Texas, where it became an institution which the  community not only tolerated, but looked at with a certain pride.<br /><br />It  was protected by a succession of sheriffs, who, supposedly, did so out of  the goodness of their hearts, and because the Chicken Ranch was a source of  invaluable intelligence into criminal activities in the county.<br /><br />The  author, Jan Hutson, seems to write from a knowledgeable--even  intimate--viewpoint.  She says in her Acknowledgements that she could not  have written it without her husband's &quot;enthusiasm in humoring my  eccentricities&quot; and her children's patience and pride.<br /><br />Hutson is  extremely hard on the TV personality, Marvin Zindler, whose efforts she  credits for shutting the famous old whorehouse down.<br /><br />She portrays him  as a toupee wearing, sensation-seeking &quot;jerk&quot; who went on a  vendetta against the Chicken Ranch, seeking personal aggrandizement by  making it a cause celebre.<br /><br />&quot;Busting sixteen obscure whores from  Houston was not going to grab any headlines.

He has been an  Indiana conservative Republican leader for decades, and for thirty years  was campaign manager for Republican presidential candidates.  He was the  1961 founder of Young Americans for Freedom.<br /><br />President George Bush  appointed him as the United States Chairman of the International Joint  Commission.

Buckley, Jr., says on the back cover, &quot;Whenever I hear Rush  Limbaugh I marvel on two counts, the first that his war on Political  Correctness is tolerated, the second, that it is enjoyed by liberals (the  Germans call that Schandenfreude, the wretchedly paradoxical joy that some  people take from enduring pain).  It's like a jolt of champagne for most of  us, reorienting the day, reassuring us that social disorders haven't  disturbed the essential movements of the planet.&quot;<br /><br />In this book,  he spells out his philosophy and his method; that he demonstrates absurdity  through the use of absurd statements, for example, and points out that his  success is not due to the outcome of elections.<br /><br />He talks about the  State of the Union; Abortion; the 'eighties'; AIDS; and what he calls 'the  Imperial Congress.'  Of course, the Congress to which he refers there was  one dominated by the Democrat party, an infirmity which he helped  cure.<br /><br />In the book, he also discusses Gorbachev, Anita Hill, Ronald  Reagan and other subjects that have lost their relevance in the year 2,000,  but this book nevertheless retains its relevance, because much of what he  says retains a timelessness: the more things change, the more they stay the  same.<br /><br />I suggest that you pick this one up.  If you are a political  conservative, it will be like champagne: you will find Rush verbalizing  things that you have always thought.  If, on the other hand, you are a  political liberal, well, as Buckley says, you might enjoy the  schandenfreude.<br /><br />Joseph Pierre,<br /> Author of THE ROAD TO DAMASCUS:  Our Journey Through Eternity	2000-05-24

From the back cover:<br /><br />&quot;Alongside Gary Becker's and Theodore Schultz's conception of human capital and Bob Putnam's conception of social capital, we should add Thomas Sowell's notion of cultural capital. In an  impressive use of materials drawn from around the world, Sowell describes  the enormous impact of cultural capital in employment, education,  migration, and politics. One finishes reading this book awed by Sowell's  capacity to bring together so much material in such a readable  fashion.&quot;<br /><br />--Myron Weiner, Professor of Political Science,  M.I.T.<br /><br />&quot;For nearly a generation, Thomas Sowell has defined the  terms of debate on affirmative action. His latest book expands the  discussion beyond America's preoccupation with white racism and black  disadvantage to examine how different groups fare in widely disparate  societies and what role race and culture play in the process. Sowell has no  match in his breadth of knowledge on these issues, but he is interested  more than simply analyzing data. Race and Culture is ultimately a  cautionary tale of American history with broad implications for current  public policies directed at racial and ethnic groups in the  U.S.&quot;<br /><br />--Linda Chavez, Manhattan Institute<br /><br />Dr. Thomas Sowell  is a black man, and a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford  University. His many books include 'Ethnic America,' and most recently  'Inside American Education.' He also writes a nationally syndicated  newspaper column and a bi-weekly column in Forbes magazine. His essays have  appeared in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Washington  Post, Newsweek, and Fortune. He has also published articles in scholarly  journals in the United States and other countries. And, he has sat in for  Rush Limbaugh, in his absence, on the EIB Radio Network.<br /><br />So, he is  well qualified to write on this subject, erudite, and much  respected.<br /><br />And, he does not support affirmative action, and his  reasons are cogent and many.<br /><br />This book held my attention from  beginning to end, and the heady praise of Weiner and Chavez in the back  cover blurbs, I found to be well deserved.

Lott, when he wrote this book, taught criminal deterrence and law and  economics at the University of Chicago, where he was the John M. Olin  Visiting Law and Economics Fellow.  He was the chief economist at the  United States Sentencing Commission during 1988 and 1989.  He has published  over seventy articles in academic journals.<br /><br />He is well qualified to  write such a book as this, since he is trained in statistics and the  accepted methodology in gathering and interpreting them.<br /><br />In this  volume, Lott studied the facts and figures gathered from all 3,054 counties  in the United States in the 15 year period from 1977 through 1992 (the book  was copyrighted in 1998).<br /><br />He says, in the introduction, &quot;American  culture is a gun culture--not merely in the sense that 75 to 86 million  people own a total of about 200 to 240 million guns, but in the broader  sense that guns pervade our debates on crime and are constantly present in  movies and the news.&quot;<br /><br />But, his question is: &quot;What do we  really know? How many times have most of us actually used a gun or seen a  gun being used?  How many of us have ever seen somebody in real life  threatening somebody else with a gun?&quot;<br /><br />In his Preface, he asks,  &quot;Does allowing people to own or carry guns deter violent crime?  Or  does it simply cause more citizens to harm each other?&quot;<br /><br />Important  questions.  John R. Lott develops the answers, not from the closed-mind  &quot;common sense&quot; that so many have relied on in the past, but from  the actual statistics.  And, not statistics that he himself has gathered,  which might be suspect to some, but by government statistics which any  citizen may check.<br /><br />Of course, his answers--the obvious answers that  the statistics themselves portray--are not what the political left,  including many in the liberal media, wanted to hear.  Consequently, Lott  has been attacked, as might be expected.<br /><br />Among other things, they have  attacked him as suspect because his fellowship patron was the Olin  Foundation (the Olin company was involved in manufacturing ammunition),  which is as nonsensical as saying that someone sponsored by the Ford  Foundation would be expected to champion Ford automobiles.  The Foundation  is absolutely independent of the company, as his critics who used the  scurrilous attack well knew.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is a valuable  book--indeed, a seminal book--by a well-qualified scholar.

And, the Vedas are the Hindu 'scripture.'<br /><br />Advaita is a school of  thought which was elucidated by a man named Shankara (usually spelled  Sankara with a dot over the initial 's') who was a renowned Hindu scholar.  Simply put, the philosophy states that there is only one 'soul' in  existence (&quot;One without a second&quot;) which plays all of the roles,  or 'parts' in the universe, past, present and future--you, me, a cow, an  ant, a tree...<br /><br />This book talks about the experiential dimension of the  philosophy of the Advaita:  What is normal experience?  The Advaitan  experience and its relationship to normal experience,and the reconciliation  of the two.<br /><br />The language the author uses is plain and easily  understandable, without a great deal of reliance upon Hindi terms (Hindi is  the main language of India.)<br /><br />For those with an ionterest in this  subject matter, I recommend this book.  I also recommend Elliot Deutsch's  book, &quot;The Advaita Vedanta: A Philosophical  Reconstruction.&quot;<br /><br />Joseph Pierre,<br /> Author of THE ROAD TO  DAMASCUS: Our Journey Through Eternity	2000-05-24

Steinbeck comes across as a flaming socialist--not too surprising,  considering &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; and some of his other  works.<br /><br />The friendship of these two men, despite the radical  differences in their philosophies, is intriguing.<br /><br />If you are a fan of  Steinbeck's fiction, this book will give you more insight into his  character and philosophy than any of his other books save, perhaps,  &quot;Travels With Charlie,&quot; which came much later.	2000-05-21

He describes the inhabitants, many of  whom were drawn from real people ('Doc' Ricketts, for example, whose lab on  the 'row' is still maintained as a kind of shrine) and his  characterizations are marvelous.<br /><br />He spins a great yarn.<br /><br />And the  places:  The Poppy restaurant is in a different place, now, on Alvarado  Street in downtown Monterey, but it still exists.<br /><br />Steinbeck writes  about a time that is no longer, and as everyone knows, you can't go back.  But, you can see it through his eyes, and in that way we can, sort of, stop  the relentless march of time and enjoy the past as it was.<br /><br />When I  sailed into Monterey for some respite from the sea, I didn't intend to stay  long.  Our boat was salt-crusted, and needed some repairs.  We stayed ten  years, and loved every day of it.  During that time, we watched sadly as  &quot;old Monterey&quot; was torn down and replaced with a Doubletree Inn  and a conference center.  Time marches on!<br /><br />When we got there, the  canneries were still there, on Cannery Row (which is between Monterey and  Pacific Grove, in 'New Monterey'); great, rusted sheet-metal hulks.  The  sardines had stopped running, but Steinbeck's books had a cult following,  and so the row changed into a tourist trap.  The canneries were torn down,  and bars, cafes and a huge aquarium replaced them.  Flora's whorehouse  became a pizza joint.  The place fourishes, today.<br /><br />It's all gone.  'Doc' Ricketts was killed when his car was hit at the crossing on the east  end of the row by a train.

As a youngster he was my favorite fiction writer and has remained so, although I have read a great many books in the interim, some by great writers.<br /><br />Ernest Hemingway has had many detractors, but his writing speaks for  itself.  He needs no other champion.<br /><br />Of all his stories, &quot;The Old  Man and the Sea&quot; is perhaps his best.  In it, an old Cuban fisherman,  Santiago, fishing by himself, catches a giant, magnificent marlin, after a  terrible struggle, and makes it fast to his small boat.  On the way home,  however, it is eaten by the sharks, leaving only a skeleton.<br /><br />The story  is, reputedly, autobiographical.  The story itself is the great marlin, and  the sharks are the critics, which have dogged Hemingway's declining career,  panning such efforts as &quot;Over the River and Into the Trees,&quot; and  disparaging him generally as an aging has-been.<br /><br />With &quot;The Old Man  and the Sea,&quot; Hemingway proved, to them and himself, that he could  still write magnificent prose.  For it he was awarded the Nobel Prize for  literature--a prize at which he had previously scoffed, saying that no one  who had ever received it had subsequently written anything  worthwhile.<br /><br />Hemingway's literary style--his clipped, unadorned  approach--has been often aped but never equaled.  He was a true original,  and most important; he was a sensitive observer of humanity and its  follies.  But, never an observer only; he was a participant.  &quot;The  Snows of Kilimanjaro,&quot; if not autobiographical at least was based upon  his own experience.  He knew the people of whom he wrote.  He had been a  combatant and a journalist and a fisherman and a hunter: a man's  man.<br /><br />Like all really notable writers of fiction, he had lived his  stories.  I suggest that you read his work for yourself, and disregard the  slurs of the effete intellectual snobs who slyly claim that he was a latent  homosexual, and contrive to belittle his genius.  They are like the sharks  he portrayed, who would destroy the great prize of his legacy.  Heed them  not.

From the Boardroom to the Bathroom, by Jason Brenner<br /> Writer's Showcase, Lincoln, NE, 2000<br /><br />This is a hilarious read. Jason Brenner is a &quot;typical 24-year-old male.&quot; He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in May of 1997 and currently works for a marketing company in Connecticut.<br />From the back cover:<br /><br />&quot;From discussing the lump he found on his left testicle to talking about his high school reunion to describing the proper way to use a corporate men's room, Brenner pulls no punches as he explains what goes through the mind of a typical 24-year-old male. No topic is left untouched: his relationship with his girlfriend, his feelings about his visiting parents, even his thoughts about his toilet (As you can tell, this Brenner guy is strictly a class act.)&quot;<br />Of course, Brenner himself wrote the foregoing blurb, which is indicative of the kind of fevered mind that wrote the book.<br /><br />Although his book purports (tongue-in-cheek) to be devoted to the project of passing on his hard-gained wisdom to those younger than himself, because the things discussed are not taught to them in the institutions of higher learning from which they are soon to graduate, it is patently obvious that young males in their late teens and early twenties will not be his primary audience.  They will be drinking beer and partying, not reading books of humorously paternalistic advice from those two or three years older than themselves.<br /><br />No, this book is destined to be read by the author's seniors, who will look back fondly at those years of exuberance, youthful hubris, overconfidence and enduring stamina, when their own perspective promised eternal youth, and those over thirty were considered to be &quot;over the hump&quot; and even the thought of ever reaching such an advanced age as sixty or seventy seemed utterly preposterous, or at the very least an eternity away.<br /><br />It is a funny book.  In fact, it is hilarious, if not always in exactly the places where the author intended it to be.  Rather, it is the author's own attitude and outlook that provides the best laughs, for his extreme youth shines throughout the book, and offers a constant supply of smiles.<br /><br />I heartily recommend this book to all those who would look back and remember their youth--their callow youth--when the world was their oyster and all things were possible; look back, and smile, and sigh thankfully.  Thankful that those frantic, uncertain times are finally behind them, sink back on the couch comfortably and enjoy the sunset.<br /><br />Try it!

I am not critical of Zukav because of any personal  belief system that clashes with his, nor is there any inherent animosity  for the ideas that he proposes.  My disappointment results from his  pedantic, declarative style, in which he presents his proposals without  providing reasoning or sources to support his statements, nor any attempt  at persuasion.

Brian Greene is a high-energy physicist of the first rank, and he does an excellent job of explaining the history and background of theoretical science, which led to the latest superstring theory.  Beginning with Newtonian physics he leads  the reader through relativity and quantum mechanics with clear, logical,  everyday illustrations, although his explanation of quantum mechanics did  get a little rarefied-understandable for sub-atomic behavior that is often  described as &quot;weird.&quot;<br /><br />He explains the incompatibility of  general relativity and quantum mechanics, and the resulting need for a  unifying theory, which gave rise to the string theory, which seems to have  the potential to become a Theory of Everything (T.O.E.):<br /><br />&quot;The  moment you encounter string theory and realize that almost all of the major  developments in physics over the last hundred years emerge--and emerge with  such elegance-from such a simple starting point, you realize that this  incredibly compelling theory is in a class of its own&quot; --Michael  Green, formerly of Queen Mary College --one of the pioneers of string  theory<br /><br />What is string theory?  Simply put, it proposes that the basic,  radical building block of all sub-atomic particles, energy and matter is  not a point particle, but rather a one-dimensional string-loop about a  hundred billion billion times smaller (the so-called Planck length) than an  atomic nucleus  which vibrates at an undetermined, but potentially infinite  number of wavelengths, amplitudes and tensions, comparable to a violin  string  The various wavelengths and amplitudes give the  &quot;particles&quot; their characteristic properties.<br /><br />Our present-day  experiments are unable to resolve the microscopic stringy nature of matter:  Greene says we would need an accelerator to slam matter together with  energies some million billion times more powerful than any previously  constructed accelerator in order to reveal directly that a string is not a  point-particle, so discoveries in the foreseeable future depend upon  mathematical formulae and the resulting deductions.<br /><br />String theory so  far claims that such strings are nature's most fundamental ingredient and  that if the presumed point-particles composing electrons, quarks, protons,  neutrons, positrons, photons, etc., could be examined with a precision  significantly beyond our present capacity, each would be seen to be made of  a single, tiny, oscillating loop of string.  In physics, oscillation is to  vary regularly between maximum and minimum values, as an electric  current.<br /><br />Brian Green has done a masterful job of explaining in  layman's terms some of the most abstruse theoretical science currently  being discussed and studied by some of the foremost high-energy physicists  on the planet.<br /><br />Joseph Pierre<br /> author of THE ROAD TO DAMASCUS: Our  Journey Through Eternityiously  constructed accelerator in order to reveal directly that a string is not a  point-particle, so discoveries in the foreseeable future depend upon  mathematical formulae and the resulting deductions.<br /><br />String theory so  far claims that such strings are nature's most fundamental ingredient and  that if the presumed point-particles composing electrons, quarks, protons,  neutrons, positrons, photons, etc., could be examined with a precision  significantly beyond our present capacity, each would be seen to be made of  a single, tiny, oscillating loop of string.

He postulates near collisions between Earth and Venus  and other bodies.<br /><br />Velikovsky, a Russian-born Jewish psychiatrist, uses  his theory to justify a literal reading of the Exodus.  The miraculous  events (the parting of the Red Sea, manna from Heaven, etc.) he ascribes to  natural causes.<br /><br />He was quite a salesman.  Although his formal  education, gained throughout Europe, was in medicine, obviously his great  interest was astronomy, cosmology, geology and the architectonics of the  universe.  And his writing has had an impact on those who pursue knowledge  in those areas.  The late Buckminster Fuller, inventor of the geodesic  dome, said of the book, &quot;...an extraordinarily important book,  beautifully researched and devastatingly true.&quot;  Or, so he is quoted  on the dust jacket.  The late Carl Sagan, on the other hand, calls his  approach &quot;shoddy, ignorant and doctrinaire,&quot; and strongly implies  that his scientific understanding is sadly lacking (Broca's Brain, Random  House, N.Y., 1974.)<br /><br />So, Velikovsky's theories, to put it mildly, are  not universally embraced by his peers.  Nevertheless, this is a good book.  He has a good vocabulary and he uses it enchantingly and persuasively to  sell his great idea.  It is a book for the literate person who relishes new  ideas and fresh approaches to old ones.<br /><br />Joseph Pierre,<br /> Author of  THE ROAD TO DAMASCUS: Our Journey Through EternityHE ROAD TO DAMASCUS: Our Journey Through Eternity<br />	2000-05-08

Richard Alpert (Ram Dass) is a 'finder'.<br /><br />He was a self-described bi-sexual college professor, and a colleague of Timothy Leary, when he got caught up in the drug scene (esp. LSD), which gave him a look at chemically induced 'enlightenment.'  Just enough to whet his curiosity.  The trouble was, he always &quot;came  down.&quot;  so he went to India. He wanted something more  permanent.<br /><br />While he was there on his spiritual quest, he was led to a  little Indian 'Guru,' who showed him the way--demonstrating powers that  blew Alpert away! For one thing, he took a dose of LSD that would have  stunned an elephant, and never batted an eye. He had something  stronger--the real thing.<br /><br />I met Alpert when he returned to the United  States, intent upon spreading the good word. By then he had changed his  name to Ram Dass ('servant of God'). I heard him speak in Santa Cruz, as  well as in Monterey. He has charisma, and he has a message in which he  truly believes.<br /><br />This is one of his best books (he has written  several.) I recommend it as a primer for any seeker who is interested in  the Eastern philosophies; especially Hinduism, which is the original source  of Ram Dass' message, and specifically the Vedanta (the culmination of the  Hindu scriptures, the earliest forms of which date back perhaps 3,000  years.)<br /><br />Joseph Pierre,<br /> author of THE ROAD TO DAMASCUS: Our Journey  Through Eternity	2000-04-28

She could, and did, and told me that it was a good book.  She was right.<br /><br />(Chaim starts out like chutzpah and rhymes with lime.)<br /><br />Potok also wrote &quot;The  Chosen,&quot; &quot;The Promise,&quot; &quot;In the Beginning,&quot; and  &quot;My Name is Asher Levm&quot; among others.  He was trained and  ordained as a rabbi and served as a chaplain with the U.S. Army in  Korea.<br /><br />&quot;The Book of Lights&quot; is a novel about an introverted,  indecisive Jewish orphan boy who is raised by an aunt and uncle and  educated in New York's parochial schools.  He is a mediocre scholar,  physically unprepossessing, and has an inferiority complex; the kind of  hero it is easy to identify with.  His name is Gershon Loran.<br /><br />Somehow,  Gershon manages to accidentally stumble into seminary.  (He thinks his  friend is going, but the friend backs out at the last minute.)  There he  rooms with a boy whose father was a co-inventor of the atom bomb, and takes  a course in Jewish mysticism from a professor not noted for his kindliness.  Just what Gershon needed; he has no place to go but up, and he  does.<br /><br />The roommates both wind up as chaplains in post-war Korea, and  together they make a pilgrimage to Hiroshima, via Hongkong, Macao and  Kyoto.  Finally the guilt-ridden roommate is killed in an airplane  crash.<br /><br />Potok's writing style is choppy and allusive, a little  reminiscent of Ernest Hemingway.  Often he gives only one side of the  dialogue, leaving the other side to the reader's imagination.  There is no  suspense in &quot;The Book of Lights,&quot; and very little action.  The  story is about self-discovery and the hero's religious feelings.  It sounds  deadly, and probably it will be for many readers.  Personally, I liked it  and it held me to the end.  It is true that it is slow moving and a great  many of the Jewish references are unfamiliar and confusing, but Potok's  characters live and breathe and elicit concern.

From The Bell Curve:<br /><br />&quot;This book is about differences in intellectual capacity among people and groups, and what those differences mean for America's future. The relationships we will be discussing are  among the most sensitive in contemporary America--so sensitive that hardly  anyone writes or talks about them in public. It is not for lack of  information, as you will see.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;To try to come to grips with  the nation's problems without understanding the role of intelligence is to  see through a glass darkly indeed, to grope with symptoms instead of  causes, to stumble into supposed remedies that have no chance of  working.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;We are not indifferent to the ways which this  book, wrongly construed, might do harm. We have worried about them from the  day we set to work. But there can be no real progress in solving America's  social problems when they are as misperceived as they are today. What good  can come of understanding the relationship of intelligence to social  structure and public policy? Little good can come without  it.&quot;<br /><br />This is a courageous effort. And, of course, the authors  were correct about the misperceptions of their work. The book had hardly  hit the street when the jackals attacked with their screams of  &quot;racism&quot; and their ad hominem attacks.<br /><br />But, the science  behind the book is impeccable, and the facts irrefutable, and the tests  replicable. The conclusions? Well, if the arguments of the  &quot;politically correct&quot; antagonists which were directed at this  book and its implications, were applied to the animal world, they would be  arguing that a dachshund is perfectly capable of running with the  greyhounds, and that a rottweiler is as gentle as a spaniel, or that a  thoroughbred is as capable of pulling a plow as is a percheron, and there  is no reason that a clydesdale should not be allowed to enter the Kentucky  Derby.

Where others have failed  miserably in trying to unite these seemingly different world views, Capra,  a high-energy theorist, has succeeded admirably...I strongly recommend the  book to both layman and scientist.&quot;<br />  --V.N. Mansfield, Physics  Today<br /><br />Truly a worthwhile book. The man who wrote the Foreword to my  own book, THE ROAD TO DAMASCUS, John Cantwell Kiley, M.D., Ph.D., attempted  a similar feat in his doctoral dissertation, which did not have the popular  circulation of Capra's book, of course, and was far more  abstruse.<br /><br />Kiley's book, EINSTEIN AND AQUINAS: A RAPPROCHEMENT, is an  attempt to compare Albert Einstein, the theoretical physicist, with Saint  Thomas Aquinas, although they would seem to have little in common. Kiley  studied at Princeton when Einstein was there, and so had a close up view of  him, and he knew Aquinas from his studies of the Saint. He found the  rapprochement he sought in their respective epistemologies.<br /><br />Kiley says  he is seeking to bring his book back into print, but it is a harder read  than Capra's. I recommend Capra's book.<br /><br />Joseph Pierre,<br /> author of  THE ROAD TO DAMASCUS	2000-04-19

This is a worthwhile effort.  Chopra has examined his subject carefully, and come to many of the same conclusions as other leading teachers in this area.  For example, Alan Watts would have been comfortable with his  conclusion.<br /><br />Of course, Alan Watts, in my opinion, was indubitably an  enlightened man.<br /><br />Dr. Chopra tends to categorize by the numbers,  pigeonholing every &quot;step&quot; in the spiritual quest, as if your  progress can be delineated into neat little boxes, carefully labeled.  He  begins with a &quot;sandwich,&quot; with God separated from the mundane,  material world by a &quot;transition zone.&quot;  Then he leads you step by  srep through seven neatly ordered stages, beginning with &quot;normal&quot;  (Fight-or-flight) consciousness as the first category, and ending with  category seven, where one finds unity with God.<br /><br />All of which sounds  logical, and neat, and well-reasoned.  The trouble is, it is not so neat  and logical as he leads you to believe in reality.  He is very persuasive,  as he is in person as well.<br /><br />And, his conclusion is correct.  He ends  up with the seeker attaining unity with God.  What he fails to say, is that  you end up precisely where you started, for unity with God is your natural  state.  In my book, &quot;The Road to Damascus&quot; (also available from  Amazon.com), John Cantwell Kiley, M.D., Ph.D.,  says in his Foreword that I  discovered that &quot;he and you and I are God.&quot;<br /><br />That is very  close.  The fact is not that we are God so much as that God is playing at  being us.  We are, individually, roles that he is playing.  So, there need  be no quest.  There is nothing to gain, and nothing to lose if you fail to  attain &quot;enlightenment.&quot;<br /><br />Nothing could be more personal than  that.<br /><br />Therein lies the unity of which Dr. Chopra speaks.  And he is  correct that some people do become wrapped in &quot;level seven,&quot; but  it is not necessary for your &quot;salvation.&quot;  That is already taken  care of.<br /><br />This is a difficult subject to speak of frankly, because so  many people already have their minds made up.  It is difficult to guide  people who, although they have no experience in the territory, think that  they know the way better than the guide.  And, they may be right.<br /><br />Dr.  Chopra's book is perhaps more palatable than mine, or Alan Watt's several  volumes.  And you cannot go amiss reading it, for he will lead you to  reality, which some refer to as &quot;the truth.&quot;<br /><br />You should read  it, and keep an open mind.  He will not lead you away from Christianity, if  you are a Christian, or Judaism, if you are Jewish, or Islam, if you are a  follower of Mohammed.  He does not violate any of the precepts of any of  those religions.  They are all &quot;book religions.&quot;  He will simply  address an approach which does not depend upon books, or priests.<br /><br />And,  while you are at it, think about buying the late Alan Watt's book,  &quot;The Book: On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are&quot;; or even my  little book, &quot;The Road to Damascus: Our Journey Through  Eternity&quot;.for your &quot;salvation.&quot;  That is already taken  care of.<br /><br />This is a difficult subject to speak of frankly, because so  many people already have their minds made up.

Remember the little guy in the comic strip Li'l Abner who always had a dark raincloud over his head as he walked around mumbling to himself?<br /><br />Well, Rudy Baylor, the protagonist in this story, had about the same outlook.  It isn't just that he was paranoid--they really were  after him!<br /><br />Rudy was in his final year of law school in Memphis,  Tennessee, a town overrun with lawyers, when the law firm that he intends  to join is swallowed up, and he loses out.  Not only that, but he is forced  into bankruptcy, he loses his girlfriend and his apartment is  burglarized.<br /><br />Is that all?  No way!  He digs up a promising insurance  case, and so another slick law firm takes him on, tries to grab his case  and dumps him.  Then, his third employer, an underworld character, gets run  out of town by the feds and he is again out of work.<br /><br />Then Rudy falls  in love with a married woman whose husband likes to beat her up with a  baseball bat and he rents an apartment from an old bat who wants him to  work a 40 hour week on her yard, in addition to his other jobs.<br /><br />This  guy has more hard luck than the guy who asked God, &quot;Why me, God?&quot;  and the voice came down from heaven and said, &quot;I dunno, Smith, you  just ( ) me off!&quot;<br /><br />Grisham has written a doozy of a book, here.  It is pure entertainment.  Because Grisham is himself a lawyer, of course,  you get the real lowdown on what a trial lawyer thinks of his colleagues  and his profession--and also, as icing on the cake, what he thinks of  insurance companies, with which he has had vast experience in real  life.<br /><br />As might be expected, his opinion on both subjects is probably  shared by the bulk of Americans, which accounts for all the lawyer jokes  and crooked insurance company stories.<br /><br />You should enjoy this one.

An interesting book, well-written, and the story line moved along well., but...<br /><br />The introduction of so many unusual words and terms, necessitating constant reference to the glossary in the back of the book, was a trifle distracting.  Words like &quot;rede,&quot; which simply meant  counsel, or wise speech.  After a couple of chapters, familiarity with the  special terms increases and makes it easier, though.  And, whether the  terms are etymologically accurate remains a question.  That would at least  tend to justify their use, at the expense of the impatience it causes the  reader.<br /><br />The story presents a different interpretation of Attila than  is common, and also serves to clarify and tends to explain, if not  exonerate, some of the historically harsh practices of the Huns, Goths and  their ilk, if Grundy has done his research well.<br />The author is a good writer, who has  apparently done much research in the period.<br /><br />Joseph Pierre<br /> author  of The Road to Damascus	2000-04-02

Written by a veteran firearms instructor, my best friend, the late George Lane Tooley, this book addresses the profound need for basic instruction in safe firearms use by the beginner-the new firearms owner, as well as the  police cadet or correctional officer trainee in the academy-in dire need of  instruction in how to safely handle and care for their new weapons; and not  only to use them safely, but effectively, accurately and with good judgment  and skill. With 45 years of experience, much of it in training others to  use firearms, no one was better equipped for writing this book than George.  His down-to-earth insistence on addressing the basics, his continual  attention to safety, and his detailed explanations of the inner workings of  firearms make this book unique in its field.<br /><br />George Tooley was killed  in a traffic accident in 1995, and he left this book behind, finished  except for the drawings and photos, which I completed. All proceeds from  the book will go to his widow, Darleen.<br /><br />But, don't think of your  purchase of the book is an act of charity. Far from it! This is, without a  doubt, the best book of its type that I have ever seen. I've used firearms  all my life, shooting everything from BB guns to machine guns, and I've  read about everything there is on the subject. This is the best.<br /><br />The  rest of them can blow about how to quick-draw, and talk about all the bad  guys they've shot, and how it felt. George gives you tips on how to shoot  accurately. He tells you what to do, and what not to do with  firearms.<br /><br />For $8.95, it's the bargain of the century. Don't pass it  up.<br /><br />Joe Pierre	2000-03-03

She came west on a covered wagon, as part of a wagon train of 48 wagons which started in St. Joseph, Missouri. Her family and friends joined it in May Day, Kansas, near the  Nebraska border.<br /><br />But, there's more to the story than the wagon train  trip and their brushes with Indians and horsethieves, and the winter in  Eastern Oregon, and the vivid description of the Oregon Trail. As they say  in advertising, there's much, much more!<br /><br />There is the story of her  childhood in Tumwater, Washington, in the latter part of the 19th century,  and her marriage in 1888 (when she was only 16-years-old.) Then, there is  the story of how she and her husband, Dave Pier, lived and loved and fought  for survival in the early 20th century, and how she gave birth to eight  children, and raised them and educated them in a time when there was no  aid-to-dependent children, or unemployment compensation--or income  tax.<br /><br />This is a good story, because it is hard and true and real, and  was written by a woman who saw the world transformed from the time when  black powder weapons were the state of the art, to the atom bomb and  astronauts in space. Daisy Belle was a great little gal. I knew her very  well. She died in 1965, in Molalla, Oregon, near where I lived, when I had  five children of my own.<br /><br />You will enjoy this book, I promise you.	2000-02-29

This book is the culmination of a lifetime of study, research and writing in the metaphysical genre for John Cantwell Kiley, Ph.D., M.D.<br /><br />Kiley has written several other books, including Self Rescue, Equilibrium, and  Einstein and Aquinas: A Rapprochement. This, however, is his first serious  attempt at fiction. It is a &quot;novel autobiography&quot; of the next  Pope of the Roman Catholic Church, and it is highly  imaginative.<br /><br />Kiley, in the book, has Jesus Christ emerge to assist the  Pope and give him guidance &quot;in the flesh,&quot; so to speak. There is  much moving about of planets, tripping through time with abandon,  &quot;talking in tongues&quot; and other hi-jinks going on, as well as the  thread of a love-story in the midst of it all.<br /><br />But, the story line  aside, the thing that will make this book valuable to a certain coterie of  readers, the numbers of whom are unknown, is the author's metaphysics. For  John Kiley is, first and foremost, a metaphysician.<br /><br />People who simply  read fiction for entertainment will likely be bored by some of the long  dissertations. But those dissertations are the very things that will make  the book attractive to others.<br /><br />The book will likely anger many  Catholics, who will be incensed at the attempt by a group of feminazis to  castrate the Pope, early in the book. And some, Like Kiley's dear friend  William F. Buckley, Jr., in their ignorance, will no doubt accuse him of  being a pantheist (not for the first time.) But, John Kiley is not a  pantheist. He is that rarity, a religionist who knows what he is talking  about. I know this, for I was witness to his enlightenment.<br /><br />Some will  like this book, some will not. It is hard to guess how it will fare in the  marketplace. It has many of the qualities that make a &quot;cult  book,&quot; like, in the political arena, Atlas Shrugged, by Ayn Rand, but  Kiley is a better writer and it is about religion, not politics.<br /><br />I  call them as I see them.

It requires  of you that you use all of your intelligence, and then perhaps decide after  struggling with the concept that you will go on and see what else he has to  say, without fully grasping what he has just said.<br />The author is a very  bright gentleman, that much is obvious. And, as far as I could follow him,  I found his reasoning to be impeccable. And his results, his conclusions, I  found to be exciting.<br />I hope he is right.<br />He questions Einstein, and  uses Einstein's own theory to prove him in error, and he does it without  depending upon arcane mathematical formulae. He uses plain language and  diagrams that any bright layman, who reads carefully, can follow. But, I  warn you, the territory into which you will be drawn is not for  sissies.<br />He is saying that the Big Bang theory of the origin of the  universe is nonsense.<br />He is saying that the speed of light is not the  fastest thing around: That gravity makes it look like a slowpoke. That  lightspeed is not the limiting speed.<br />He is saying that the universe is  both infinitely old, and infinite in size. There is no end to it in space,  and it had no beginning in time. It is neither expanding, nor is it due to  collapse. Space and time are infinite, and there are only five dimensions  with which we may measure: Three of space, one of time, and one of  scale.<br />He is saying that there was once a planet, &quot;Planet X,&quot;  between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, which exploded and is now the  source of the asteroid belt and of the comets that, from time to time,  invade our solar system.<br />He is saying that space is filled, not only with  a light carrying medium (shades of Ether!) but also with a smaller, faster,  universal gravity medium (C-gravitons) which push the planets and their  moons and stars together by bombarding them, rather than their being drawn  together by some mysterious force, and he demonstrates it with deductive  reasoning which is, to say the least, very persuasive.<br />If you have any  curiosity about these things, this is the book for you. You will find it  exciting and challenging. If, on the other hand, you are content to leave  such esoteric matters up to those who are smarter and better qualified, and  would rather play computer games with your spare time, join the multitude!expanding, nor is it due to  collapse.

If you tend to be what is charitably called &quot;politically correct,&quot; these days, or are squeamish about facing facts, and prefer to accept the liberal doctrine espoused by academia and the liberal press  and the Clinton administration,  you will probably avoid this book.<br />  Jared Taylor is probably best known as the author of the bombshell book,  &quot;Paved With Good Intentions,&quot; 1992, which I have also reviewed.  His thoughtful exposition of the facts in that book was violently attacked  in the press by the liberal apologists who refuse to look at the facts  without their rose-colored glasses on, and they will no doubt attack this  volume with equal virulence.<br />  But, whether they face it or not, race  is a problem in the United States. Although diversity is hailed as a great  boon to society by the liberal bed-wetters, why is it that race remains  such a divisive force, and such a great problem, ranking even above AIDS,  crime, welfare abuse, and teen pregnancy? And why is it that blacks are at  the top of the list in all of the above problem areas?<br />  It is well  established that blacks and Hispanics have higher rates of crime,  illegitimacy, poverty, and even death rates from many diseases than whites.  Why is that taken as decisive proof that America is racist?<br />  Why are  Asian ghettos seen by their inhabitants and others as places of refuge from  crime and violence, while black ghettos are seen as breeding places for  epidemics of those same societal blights? Why is it that, worldwide, in  study after study, East Asians are tested as having higher IQs than whites,  while African blacks on average test 30 points lower? (Those of mixed race,  which account for most in the United States, test, as might be expected,  only 15 points lower.) If the societal benefits of diversity so enhance our  culture, why do white Americans universally flee from all its great  benefits, and leave all the cultural enrichment available in East St.  Louis, South Central Los Angeles, Detroit, Monterey Park, Washington, D.C.,  and all the other environments where the greatest diversity abounds? It is  often proposed that our &quot;racist&quot; society teaches blacks, in  particular, to &quot;hate themselves.&quot; In actual fact, the continual  hammering by the liberal press is teaching blacks to hate whites. a natural  reaction to the constant barrage from television news and the press that  their problems are caused by racist white people, and the not-so-subtle  suggestion that our police, courts and prisons are all racist, imprisoning  them unjustly for murder, rape, assault and other crimes.<br />  This book  looks at the facts, the physiological, mental, emotional, sexual and  cultural differences. It is not about &quot;white supremacy.&quot; In fact,  if anything, it demonstrates Asian superiority, with the white race  somewhere in the middle.<br />  If you wonder what will happen if the  present immigration and affirmative action trends continue; if you think  that the great moral battle for racial equality in all things is justified,  and the &quot;civil rights&quot; battles of the 'sixties were a great boon  to the United States, perhaps this is a book you should read.<br />  On the  other hand, if you are terrified of being labeled a &quot;racist,&quot; or  a &quot;white supremacist,&quot; I wouldn't leave it laying  around  where your liberal friends will see it.<br />  In fact, it is a thoughtful  book, written by scientists, who have refused to be cowed by the attacks on  them, which are a story in themself.in East St.  Louis, South Central Los Angeles, Detroit, Monterey Park, Washington, D.C.,  and all the other environments where the greatest diversity abounds?

Wilson,1998,  Alfred A. Knopf, New York, Hardcover, 336 pp., $18.20 U.S. (from Amazon.com)<br />&quot;Still, scientific theories are a product of imagination--informed imagination.  They reach beyond their grasp to predict the existence of previously unsuspected phenomena.  They generate hypotheses, disciplined guesses about unexplored topics whose parameters  the theories help to define.  The best theories generate the most fruitful hypotheses, which translate cleanly into questions that can be answered by observation and experiment.  Theories and their progeny hypotheses compete for the available data, which comprise the limiting resource in the ecology of scientific knowledge.  The survivors in this tumultous environment are the Darwinian victors, welcomed into the canon, settling in our minds, guiding us to further exploration  of physical reality, more surprises.  And yes, more poetry.&quot;<br />If you have the vocabulary to easily grasp the author's message in that paragraph, you will probably enjoy this book.<br />Consilience, the title word (not in the average dictionary), means, according to one review, a  &quot;jumping together,&quot; but in my old 1913 dictionary is defined as &quot;the coming into agreement of generalizations from widely differing inductions&quot; and thus the  author's theme is that it is time for the various scientific disciplines to share with each other in those areas of mutual interest.  And he points out that many of the most momentous disciplines have a great many areas of overlapping interest.<br />Edward O. Wilson was born in a good year, 1929, which is also the year of my birth.  He was born in Birmingham, Alabama, and received his B.S. and M.S. from the University of Alabama, and in 1955, his Ph.D. in biology from Harvard, where he has since taught.<br />He is the author of two Pulitzer prize-winning books, &quot;On Human Nature,&quot; 1978, and &quot;The Ants,&quot; 1990.  His specialty, throughout his career as a scientist, has been ants, on ! which he is probably the world's foremost expert.<br />But, as this book shows, he has not neglected other areas of human knowledge.  Indeed, he might well be classed as a &quot;generalist,&quot; for his wide range of interest and accumulated knowledge.  Indeed, two chapters, &quot;The Mind,&quot; and &quot;Ethics and Religion,&quot; held me enthralled, although I am still trying to decide how to disagree with him.<br />He makes a seemingly air-tight case for the mind's being simply a result,  mechanical necessity, if you will, of the brain's electro-chemical processes. All of which is carefully documented and researched, labeled and identified.<br />My problem with that is the phenomenon of awareness: self-knowledge.  I know that I exist.  If awareness is only a by-product of chemistry, electricity and physics, then the creation is surely greater than its creator.  The brick overshadows the bricklayer.<br />I have similar problems with his thoughts on religion, specifically: God.<br />Wilson is a nominal Baptist, and calls himself a Deist, rather than a Theist.  An empiricist, rather than a transcendentalist.  And, he admits that he might be wrong.<br />But, the purpose of this review is not to argue with him.  In the first place, his formal educational credentials far exceed mine, and in the second place, I would not wish to detract from his book.  It is the kind of book that you find once or twice in a decade: one that holds your interest with reasoned argument, and in which the author is worthy of your complete respect.  His arguments are cogent, well-reasoned and careful, and the result of a long lifetime of careful observation.<br />And that, alone, is refreshing in this age when every half-educated, semi-literate ignoramus eagerly exercises his right to loudly proclaim an opinion on any and every subject that crosses his mind, no matter how transiently, in seemingly inverse proportion to the amount of data he hason the subject.<br />Those who are blessed with a decent vocabulary and an inquiring mind will enjoy this book,!  whether you find yourself in total agreement with the author, or not. Those described in the last paragraph would be better off to save their money.has on the subject.<br />Those who are blessed with a decent vocabulary and an inquiring mind will enjoy this book,!  whether you find yourself in total agreement with the author, or not.

Flight of Eagles, by Jack Higgins,1998, Putnam Pub, New York,Hardcover, 336 pp., $17.47 U.S. (from Amazon.com)<br />  \\"In the early days of World War II, brothers Max and Harry Kelso--born in the  U.S. shortly after the first world war to a German war nurse mother and an  American fighter ace father--find themselves on opposite sides of the conflict. For it  seems that forces much greater than they have set into motion an intrigue so devious,  so filled with peril, that it will require that they question everything they know, all that  they hold most dear. A new thriller by the author of The President's Daughter.\\"<br />Jack Higgins, who also writes under his real name, Harry Patterson, is a real yarn spinner. Among others, he gave us the 1975 best seller, The Eagle Has Landed. He reminds me of another author whom I knew personally, named R. Wright \\"Bobby\\" Campbell, who wrote The Spy Who Sat and Waited.<br />Both men were high school dropouts, with interesting backgrounds. Higgins' background includes the military, circus roustabout, laborer, and truck driver before he went to college and became a teacher and author.<br />Bobby Campbell, who lived in Carmel, California when I knew him, would sit across a restaurant table from you and spin a story. He was a natural-born story-teller, and seemingly couldn't help himself.<br />Another fiction writer of the same ilk was the late Louis L'Amour. He also had a background as a roustabout, truck driver, merchant seaman, prize-fighter and other such jobs, which enabled him to know about life close up and personal.<br />After all, before you can write convincingly, you need some life experience, and the best of them seem to spend years participating in life before they begin to write about it. But I remember asking Bobby Campbell once how much time he had spent in the Orkneys (the islands North of Scotland) in order to write with such authority about the people and their customs, whom he described so well in The Spy Who Sat and Waited.!  He laughed, and said he got everything he needed in the way of research from the encyclopedia.<br />That will only work, though, for someone who has lived a lot, and observed people closely in their griefs, sorrows, joys, loves and hates. Fiction is an art form, unlike report writing or editorial writing. Not everyone can do it, and of those who can, not all are equal. Jack Higgins is truly one of the master story-tellers.<br />His protagonists are convincingly drawn, and his plots seem believable even when they are far-fetched. In this one, the Nazis want to assassinate Eisenhower. In The Eagle Has Landed, it was Churchill they were after.<br />This is good fiction. He works in real people, like Bubi Hartmann, the top-scoring German fighter ace of World War II, and Adolph Galland, who was their highest scoring ace in the Battle of Britain, and who eventually became their chief of fighters. The last I heard, both were still alive.<br />Higgins weaves a good tale, and you should enjoy this one.<br />(...)l in The Spy Who Sat and Waited.!
