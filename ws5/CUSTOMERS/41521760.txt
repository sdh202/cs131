Excellent	At first glance this would seem to be a fairly standard plot......massacre by quantrills raiders and a daughter, Torey, who vows revenge. The only one who can help her because hs is after the same evil men is Noah Killian, an ex war hero who was court martialled. At this point the writer takes us into the depth of their emotions.....fear, despair, anger....all of it. The 'delayed\\" fulfillment refers to Torey and Noah's actuib ib their sexual attraction. But I don't see that as delayed because this story is about so many emotional issues that sex should be the last to be addressed. It is a wonderful book and the revenge for rape certainly keeps the sexual stuff out there it is NOT a book on sex....A real keeper............enjoy.	2005-08-29

Our eastern Pamela was left in charge of the arizona dessert spread until he returned. And sitting on that powder keg was pretty unsettling even for this strong lady because she hated guns and violence. A dusty,disreputable stranger 'walks' in from the dessert in need of help. Pamela and Slade feel an immediate attraction but they are day and night. He clearly has a history with guns andis no man for a lady. He accepts the needed refuge and realizes that there is an undercurrent of danger going on and pamela is in the middle. Slade stays around to help her out.....The book is wonderful. It is clearly a question of can love survive when the personalities are alien to each other.

Recently I read judd and christabelle's story and \\"tippy and cash\\" were in it. I hated tippy, an attention seeking flirt, and knew I'd never want to read that story. Lo and behold, I found myself reading it. I was totally surprised that it was incredible. I kept reading it at red lights. Diana Palmer took these 2 very difficult personalities and delved into them deeply. And the real people underneath are wonderful. It was a very emotional and heartwarming story about 2 people with horrific/traumatic pasts who have coped the only way they knew how and then helped each other heal. It gives real hope to people who are in that situation and wonder if they will ever be able to change their lives around and find happines.You not only feel so badly for tippy and cash,  you truly rejoice for them. I will read this again and I am soooo glad that I fell into this time. Reading Judd's story actually helped some but it isn't paramount to this book. Give it a chance.

The beautiful white actress, adept at costuming and makeup changes, was asked to spy for the union. Her father and brother had been killed and her youngest brother Matt was missing while fighting for the union. Lucinda became a black maid to countess arabella, a sadistic, amoral woman who would resort to murder and torture to help the south. 'Sukey''s assignment is to identify the confederate agent known and the silver fox. Cole Sinclair, a childhood friend, doesn't recognize Lucinda as 'sukey' while he spys for the south and has an intimate relationship with the evil bella. Sukey is forced to shoot Cole to save his life and of course he comes to hate her. The best part of this book (5) is the excellent research of the historical data. The story (3)  <br />itself is good but lacks a little clarity and depth. Lucy has adored Cole all her life, but we don't really know why. Her role as a spy is good and she is tenacious, \\"A smart Scarlet\\" but she does require a lot of saving from time to time. Written in 1980, this 400 page novel has much to recommend it esp for 25 yrs ago when information was so difficult to obtain.	2005-07-31

I reluctantly trudge through it but was already thinking about tossing it. Well, I am glad that I did. It may start out a bit slow but by chapter 3, you can NOT put this down. The characters are so real, issues, warts and all. Our heroine starts out as emotionally and physically beaten and terrified.She's been forced into an evil plot to save her children by a sadistic, psychotic man. Our groom has demons that torment him and is also forced to wed against his will. This sounds same old-same old.......and to that point it probably is. BUT the rest of the story takes it in different directions. You will never regret reading this story. Accolades to Ms. McCall.The epilogue is also first person by our heroine but by then she is a strong, confident woman and it is perfectly done. The notes by the author explain several cultural aspects of the time and are informative and helpful. Wow..how far we've come as woman and as a society.

Since I felt that this one was the 'least inspired'of the series I had to rate it only a 4......I mentally gave 6's to some of the others. This continuation brings all the players back into view and thier continued growth and interdependence on each other's friendship is wonderful They remain so strong as individual characters that <br />you just have to love each of them.

Jenny, a southerner, does whatever she feels she must to save her cousins and thier home. The union soldiers take advantage of her, burn her home, and she is adrift so she \\"rides\\" with her brothers gang and gets caught during a bank robbery. Abandoned by her brother, jenny is sentenced to hang. Micah Peterman was a union soldier imprisoned in andersonville. He returned home at deaths door. His wife and son dead, his soul dead and his skeletal body was barely hanging on. Beraru reflects his disease as anorexia, starvation that for Micah is a subconscious death wish. But Micah loves his ranch and his 4 hands are good friends to him. They've saved the ranch for him during the war and Micah feels he must make the effort to hold on to it. He needs a cook and housekeeper but doesn't have money. In the midst of his search, he sees Jenny 'defending' herself in the courtroom and is impressed by her tenacity. He finds a law that grants her parole if she marries him, a 7 yr indenture status and, with nothing to lose, she takes the offer. The rest of the book deals with Jenny's attempt to help him regain not only his physical life but his soul and will to live. To do it she has to peel the emotional layers, the nightmares, and the hurts one at a time. Of course then he must save Jenny from her scars and from a hangmans noose. <br />Beraru's writing has depth that I haven't seen in a long time. The reader is drawn to her characters and ends up pulling for them. (and hoping a sequel is planned for the ranch hands). This is an exploration of how much a person can take and how much he can come back from the lowest point of his life. It is difficult to find so is expensive even on the used market but perhaps a library would have it. If you run across, it's a wonderful read. <br />I don't think its worth the exorbitant sums I've seen it listed for but I did pay $20. for it and don't regret it. It's your call.	2005-05-21

Charity has just about given up trying to carry on her life in kansas but in her despair, she still finds the compassion to help this stranger. She thinks he may be the ans to her prayers <br />and the reader certainly thinks the lord led him to charity. The story evolves with few surprises....The depth of emotion is wonderful in the characters. The only thing I didn't like about the book is that within minutes of rescuing Beau, Charity decides she will get him to marry her to help her physically save the land grant on her property. It's a bit brazen and a bit precipitous since all she needs is a man to help her with the ranch,any hired hand not really a husband. That small piece annoyed me.Overall it was a good read......and did my heart good. It's never a bad thing to remember how faith touches our lives every day in many ways..Would like more about brothers cole and cass. perhaps there is a prequel or sequel for them.	2005-05-16

So let's do bad stuff-good stuff. This is a contemporary texas ranger 'mystery' set in cyber america. The 'hero' is a rodeo/fast draw legend who also has a ranch on the side. He is brought in to investigate a murder case and the investigator assigned to him is an ex-girlfriend. However, in their past 'relationship' he has treated her badly and in fact ruined her life.She has gone thru hell because of it but is still drawn to him. (Unfortunately that happens all the time where women are drawn to guys who don't treat them well.) Well here they are trying to collaborate professionally. She's bright, he's bright and putting their heads tog they do some policework. Unfortunatley the book soon goes into redunancy....he's sorry he hurt her and tried to get her in bed......For heavens sake! He has the sensitivity of a llama! The girl was raped at 15. The guy gets off because Mr. texas ranger testifies for the guy implying that she is lying. at 28, they meet again. Despite her  'rape victim' history he seduces her deliberatly and practically rapes her a 2nd time...until he realizes she's a virgin and he's been wrong about her. And then in his 'shock' he resorts to verbal abuse.The girl spends her life ostracized. Her parents die broken hearted because of all the scandal. Now 2 yrs later Mr. \\"I'm sorry\\" is trying to seduce her again. OK...so to further test the reality factor, he says he hasn't slept with any woman since her...a 2 yr abstinance...yeah right. And of course, with little adieu, our heroine takes him back. <br /> <br />The good stuff....well, I love a man in uniform...and the visual of a texas ranger, hat, boots, star, etc....is pretty sexy. And our heroine starts out naive but shows us what survival and dignity is all about. The dialogue is witty. The surrounding characters are great. And I like the reference to the \\"lawless\\" ranger and christa that I had previously read. Of course I had already read part of thesequel about cash grier too.

They are multi dimensional and you truly know them inside out. The plot is very different and the twist in the end is very unexpected. Thus far I would rate it a 5........but I really hate books written in the outback, and aboriginies, etc....And that took a great deal of the enjoyment out of it for me. Of course this entire book only WORKS in that setting so it must be. If u like australia, you'll probably like this book. I did a lot of skimming......	2005-04-29

She has many wonderful books to her credit. This is a story that tugs at your heart strings. Clare, abandoned and swindled by her adulterous husband, takes her beautiful 3 yr old daughter sophie on a wagon train to montana to start over. Her good friends, Reverand Michael, carolyn and their little girl are her constant companions. The train is led by diehard ex army man dawson clements. He has led a tortured life since he was young and has lost his faith completely. He has not purpose in life and heads west to look for a new beginning himself. The trials and travails of those pioneer wagon trains provides the adventure. The dialogue between clare and dawson provides the evolution of their disheartened souls. And the book is enmeshed in love..family, friends, children and finally clare and dawson. There is a great deal of religious dialogue and definitely no torrid love scenes.Except for a kiss or two, no love scenes at all. While I really appreciated the story and liked the book a lot, I think it could have been less wordy on religion, which got a bit redundant, and notched up a tad on the love relationship between clare and dawson.Love relationships don't have to be tawdry and full of sex but even grade school kids have a hotter romance than this one. At any rate, You have to rejoice in the ending.	2005-04-28

Cal is a hero to die for and Melora is the pampered belle of the county. Which wyatt holden will Melora marry??.....the one she is engaged to or the one who kidnaps her and drags her across the black hills! There's plenty of action and adventure, betrayal and greed, compassion and caring and a surprising addition of family responsibilities taken to heart. The 5 sibling urchins are caught in the middle of this tale and tug at your heartstrings especially when they lock Melora and Cal in the barn at a matchmaking effort that sort of works! A one night read that was quite enjoyable and defenitely re-readable.	2005-04-26

Jake, once nearly trapped into marriage, distrusts women (and incessently talks about it) while emma, theproduct of an abusive father, is afraid she's losing her mind (and incessently goes on about that.) I am halfway thru this book and find absolutely no reason to continue.

As I read these reviews I wondered if people were reading the same book! It seems you either loved it or hated it.I just finished reading it for the second time. The first time I read it 6-8 yrs ago, I didn't like it at all but I accidentally started reading it again and got caught up in it. I really enjoyed it this time around. The characters were great. The plot was certainly different from the usual western stuff. And while some of you put the ending together before I did, it was still unique. This is not a pulitzer prize winner, but it gets the job done for an enjoyable historical western romance. I think the clue is that as we grow and evolve, our reading tastes also change. And different reading is enjoyed at different times in our life. It has helped me greatly to understand why any book can have so varied a response from readers and critics.	2005-04-10

I was thrilled to have this sequel and expected awesome reading but was terribly disappointed. John Leaf is an ex-con having murdered 3 teenagers. Living with the guilt consumes him and in his hell, he finds religion. His childhood was horrible and he believes that he has 'bad' genetic blood so doesn't want children. He ministers in 'midas' and the finds friends and respect in this small town. Living a repentant life is complicated when he gets a telegram from his 'daughter' (whom he didn't know existed) who wants to meet her murderer father. And when her mother arrives in Midas looking for the runaway dtr, susanna, things become quite embroiling. The storyline is excellent. There is plenty of angst to go around. John is a hunk, (a tormented hunk). Abigail was forced into an abusive marriage to keep her out of wedlock baby and is now a widow trying to keep custody of her children. She has scars, physically and emotionally as bad as John's.  Abbie is a battered woman in the truest sense and you hurt for both of these characters. There were a lot of flashback scenes and dream sequences and I always find that distracting. And of course a lot of personal lamenting, which was fairly repetitve with both characters. And there is never the 'heart to heart' that one waits for between father and daughter susanna. There's much talk about a letter john wrote to the dead boys father....but he never mailed it......and we never get to read it. One assumes it is filled with tears from his heart. Rev. Leaf is at his best in the bedroom as he tries to help abigail overcome her panic attacks and fear of intimate contact. He is alo incredibly perceptive when dealing with the children. I am so conflicted. I wanted this book to be a 5....and I love the characters....but something was missing. It just didn't live up to its potential.In spite of everything I still recommend it. Perhaps you will see thisin a different light. It deserves a look-see.	2005-04-07

Although Jackie Peterson is shown as a self centered, my way or the highway mother, Ms Bird has not in any way done a hatchet job on ANYONE. She is still conflicted and obviously cares about all of her family.This comes across as a book of honesty and integrity. I am glad I read it. It is so poignant that you find yourself feeling sorry for EVERYONE involved in this entire tragedy, even Scott Peterson. He is guilty of ruining so many lives with his <br />monstrous murder of laci and connor but he is truly pathetic and will probably never comprehend fully what he has done.

I read 3/4 of the books before I asked myself why. It is a huge reach, and a disservice to cops everywhere, to have a professional gambler fill the role on a few days of information. Of course she happens to be a black belt anyway.....And the case unfolds too easily. It's not a bad book, it just doesn't pass the plausible test. Michaels is a fine writer.

It also gives a post traumatic stress perspective of that post civil war era. How incredibly simply she defines that war: a civil war that was anything but civil.

I liked the idea of the Bodine brother trilogy and thoroughly enjoyed \\"Rafe's story\\". Rafe an ex texas ranger kills the murderers of his wife and unborn child and the story ends with his being arrested by 3rd brother Ethan. So, Defiant, the story where baby brother Travis, a lawyer, gets to defend Rafe and prove himself was to be the perfect wrap up. The books' strength is its strong women. They stay feminine while still being bright and an integral part of their relationships. Hannah Louise, Travis ex fiancee is no exception. He broke their engagement when she wanted to have a career and now 5 yrs later she is a successful criminal lawyer whose help he needs to defend his brother. The plot is different, the trilogy is great (the characters stay in your life a lot longer with 3 books........)BUT...Guess I expected more focus on the trial. Perhaps a Hepburn-Tracey or Winger-Redford approach. But there was nothing interesting in that area. The book was mostly about family things and the re-uniting of ex lovers with superficial interest in the courtroom. Hannah doesn't even cross examine one witness!! Anyhow, its cute, a quick read but I wouldn't search for it or keep it...... (P>S> brother Ethan is an arrogant, macho, chauvinist so I didn't bother to read his story but RAFE........ah, that was worth it.	2005-03-07

She doesn't want her wonderful wilderness to be brutalized by civilization so she's not too happy with this stranger.Naturally sparks fly when her sex is discovered. The underlying story is that being a woman doesn't have to prevent one from being independent and strong as both our hero and heroine find out. Kincaid wants Reb to be domesticated......his first wife died because she was too independent....and Reb won't be tied down....Sparks fly. The only reason this isn't a 5, is that I think the author carried Reb's boy impersonization a bit too far having her wear rank, smelly buckskins day after day after day......As far as I can tell reb had 3 wardrobe changes during the whole book: Buckskins, a crimson gown, and an indian dress!	2005-02-11

It's an easy read but it's also just your average regency. The plot is fairly standard.The innocence/naivite of our heroine gets old pretty fast. Hard to believe that a doctor's daughter,teacher at a girls school doesn't know how babies are made!!!That was tiresome. The duke however is adorable and likeable.	2005-02-03

Certainly a different read for me but because I love civil war stuff, I enjoyed the historical overload. It was a bit difficult to keep the names and places straight and our \\"heroine\\" was more annoying than likeable. Her sister, Kathryn, was much more likeable and a romance between her and the good doctor would not have hurt the book any. One part I found disingenuous was when our spy bronwyn tells her sister info she should not tell her and then makes her promise to keep everything a secret since it would endanger bronwyns life.....and then a few minutes later, Kathryn blurts out everything.......duh...........	2005-02-03

This book had several \\"main\\"characters and the plot went back and forth, forth and back. It was actually tedious reading and after awhile I got pretty annoyed with our 'hero' and heroine. <br />Northern tycoon Marcus Farrar is used to having his own way and manipulating everyone to suit his purposes. So he arranges a marriage for daughter, Serena, to Brant Parnell, a sea captain who can help him recoup his financial losses. Serena opposes as she wants to become a newspaper woman and hates her father manipulating her. Various things happen and she eventually winds up married to Brant to save her reputation. Rejected by his bride, Brant returns to the sea and Serena goes about establishing her paper. However it's in the south and the war's brewing. A yankee woman in confederate territory writing about the war easily was a target for harm. The story has great civil war info. as the characters link the southern relatives with the northern relatives and have kinfolk fighting on both sides. Serena's cousin abigail, a very level headed woman, finds herself married to a confederate and running a hospital for all soldiers. Racial lines are drawn as sister Cecelia marries a half black man. And of course there are the maniacal Stanbroke brothers who are evil whereever they are and for some reason they enjoy tormenting abigail and serena. Unweaving the characters and the plot became tedious but most of all serena became downright annoying as she went from saucy and independent to downright argumentative and nasty. Never was sure what Brant saw in her. Brant was the 'Rhett\\" of the piece..and fitted the role nicely but a tad short on communicating! If u run across it, give it a read, but if you have to search for it, don't bother.	2005-01-28

It has a unique plot, it's written so that it is easy reading, and the dialogue between our hero and heroine is witty and fun.  Emory, out hero was drop dead gorgeous and fortunately annaleigh really was his match. At one point Emory is injured and annaleigh wants to tend to the wound and of course he won't let her. So she says \\"\\"oh, do shut up and sit down before I pinch some sense into myself and let you bleed to death!\\" I laughed outloud. Basically SA has it all. I thought it bogged down a little in the 3rd quarter but it was short lived and didn't detract from the overall rating of the book.	2005-01-21

The story plot itself is well reviewed and I must admit the plot was unique and fresh. In that sense I would rate this a 5. But in other ways, I found the book lacking.Over and over we heard how ugly Elizabeth was and how beautiful Joanna was. Enough already. We understood that point by chapter 2. It put undue emphasis on physical beauty and in doing so made the reader wonder why a hunk like 'brother peter' would possibly fall in love with her. He never stated the reasons either, just that he did love her.(and this was the last page, I think.) On the other hand Joanna and 'brother Adrian'as a pair wasn't very realistic. <br />Joanna was a leman, a courtesan......and never was there any discussion as to why Adrian fell in love with her or how he overcame his feelings about her past,if indeed it bothered him at all that she'd slept around......a lot.....On those 2 premises I would rate this area a 2..As for wicked Prince William, well that was a tad confusing. The entire story is based on the fact that he \\"debauched\\" and abused women. But near the end of the book we learn that his \\"manhood\\" was destroyed in a fire 7 yrs before so exactly what he is doing to women is questionable. There's also references made to his attentions to men, but that is never really clear. If his manhood was destroyed, what exactly is he doing to them? This whole scenario was a big 0 for me. Last and best was the writing. The book had  witty, delightful dialogue and overall was well written.  I'm glad I read it but I wouldn't knock myself out trying to find it again.  Averages out to a 3 in my journal. It's your call.	2005-01-09

I obviously differ in the overall quality of the book. If you are new to regency romance, this will be enjoyable. If you're an \\"old\\" reader of regency, this will be redundant, same old stuff. The twins sons of Lady Cat (Destiny's lady series is absolutely awesome!!!) have been apart for 18 yrs. One, staid Trelane, stayed home and became a 'staid\\" barrister while the other, Eric fought for peoples rights in mercenary style. Eric arrives home, unannounced, the night Trelane is nearly murdered. Typical twin plot, Erie assumes Trelane's identity to find the bad guys.....and plays footsies with Trelane's fiancee, Belle. <br />No surprises in this book. The writing is a bit boring, actually <br />although the characters are well defined.Since I have read much better by Susan Grace, I expected much better in this book and was disappointed. Strangely enough another thing that annoyed me was the cover. I've reviewed every book I've read during the past 5 years and I admit to one idiosyncrisy. Covers. I hate it when the cover shows a blue eyed blonde and the heroine is a redhead......or the hero is tall, dark and handsome on the cover but short, fat and bald inside the book!! (LOL) The man on this cover is a good looking, impressive noble but he sure doesn't reflect the tough mercenary twin in the book. I would have rather had some \\"twin\\" cover reflecting eric and lane's personalities or mirror image differences.....Small point, but part of my rating since I think the cover is an important part of any book...........It's your call.	2005-01-06

This is the first book about the McClellan clan and is set in Virginia just prior to the revolution. I had read the series years ago and ran across it again recently and just had to re read it. The McClellans are 4 brothers and 2 sisters, all fiesty and quite different and yet they are quick to be there for each other. I liked this story about Salem who inadvertendly ends up in Newgate when he goes to England to buy a \\"filly\\" with a L shaped brand on her chest. Unbeknowst to him, the filly is abused Ashley Lynne, the evil Duke of Linfield's ward. Salem and Ashley rescue each other and fight their battles together as the book introduces the whole clan and geo washington and his sons of liberty. It really was enjoyable. The sequels to this were also enjoyable...the fiesty sister Rae is book 2 and Noah the brother who was supposed to be a sea captain but has a major problem with being seasick!! so is the family lawyer. The dialogue is refreshingly witty in all of Jo Goodman's books and she is always a joy to read........	2005-01-03

The history is excellent, the reality of the battles and the strategy planning, etc. is incredible. The hero's Ian Nortin, the union commodore and his half brother Robert, confederate cavalry are so different and yet each is the star of this book! <br />They are the stuff hero's are made of and that makes this book a page turner. Our heroine is Countess Sophia who is a spy, murderess, adulterer and brazen . Why 2 men of such integrity and honor would fall hopelessly in love with her still leaves me confused. And for that reason I would rate this a 4-.....such a shame really because it is excellent in all other respects. The 'romance' part is also unreal because sophia and robert meet once and are hopelessly in love for the rest of the book...Kind of like the author thought there should be a love interest and threw it in. He even has her young daughter condoning her adulterous affair......The more I think of this, I'm only rating it a 3......sorry.	2005-01-03

I've enjoyed many of her books. This was a nice read......not bad, not a keeper, just an ok read. The characters are well written and the story evolves well. Like most books it has 'issues'. The 'abuse' critics are outraged by the once the hero backhands his wife (and we know that in our day we would get him into temper management counselling before that episode happened) BUT there wasn't any outrage when \\"Blanche\\" the soiled dove butchers the bad guy! Kind of interesting since that is ultimate \\"abuse\\". Part of the value of reading is that it hopefully brings a person to thinking about the issues, whatever they are, in the story. I was not pleased that our hero wasn't dealt with harshly because he hit his wife BUT he truly was repentent and promised never to do it again.........And while we can see that and accept that, in our century we know that is the statement all abusers make until it happens again. So I don't condone the scene nor the murder but if it brings all of us to awareness of today's sociol issues of battered women and violence in general, it also served a purpose beyond a 'nice read'.	2004-11-19

She is so charismatic and really terrific. Slane Donavon, our honorable knight, is under an oath of allegience to find Taylor and bring her back to marry his brother, thus aligning 2 castles. The rest of the story is based on Slane's efforts to get her back safely, since others want her dead. Lots of dueling with this robust pair with each other and against their enemies.

She gets into her characters souls and displays their emotions with enormous depth. You, the reader, feel the gut wrenching hurt and the joy as the story evolves. And it is a wonderful story. With very little swearing and no porn or really explicit sex, her story is still a page turner. And you hate to see it end. I, too hope there is a sequel with the rev.john leaf.

In a nutshell that is what this book is.A little variation: our heroines Laura and Tucker are  orphans and Laura is blind; The scoutmaster (like Robt Taylor) is a hunk, his scout is a halfbreed, the bad guys want the women..it was a cute western movie in the 50's but very predictable book. The other thing it lacked is depth. It made a big deal of Lucas possession of a tintype which resembled Tucker but never tied it in at all, and though all of the characters were interesting, we never got to really know them well. Too bad.	2004-10-28

However the angst driven army scout marries red headed, fiesty Flame to give the child a name. The rest of the story is fighting the indians. A lot of hot sex ensues in this supposed marriage of convenience. The story's saving grace is that the characters are wonderful and very real as are the secondary characters. The dialogue is also enjoyable. Although a neat read it's not a keeper. Trilogy includes books on sister Raven (black haired), and sister Angel (blonde)	2004-10-26

Still in love with her, Tony trades her brothers gambling vowels for her services as his mistress. Methinks Bella doth protest too much. Soon after their re-acqaintance  someone tries to kill Bella. Since Tony's first 2 wives died mysteriously this attempt on Bella raises alarms and the story evolves into an intersting mystery. The characters were all excellent. Tony was quite the stud-muffin and his best friend Patrick,also a hunk, got his own story in a sequel.

The 3rd sequel is about Cat's daughter Diana, enemies of the heart, and I'm diving into that one next. This isn't a typical standard swashbuckler. There's enough espionage and adventure and comic dialogue to go around. <br />Note Regarding an earlier reviewers comment: <br />I would never sanction or enjoy a book with a brutal rape scene anymore than I would enjoy grisly murder scenes for the sake of violence. There is a rape scene in this book but it was written in a way that I did not find it offensive and it was in keeping with the story.  grace.	2004-10-18

While 'Forever and Beyond' is a story separate and independent of that, the author spends the first several pages catching the reader up on the background. Frankly, I highly suggest reading them in order as there is so much rich, deep, intertwining of characters and events. 'Forever' is a continuation of catherine and miles story and has enough adventure, love, espionage and action to keep you glued to the end. Just as Destinys lady did. Now I am happy to have found the 3rd of this triology about their daughter Diana. <br />These are not stereotype stories.

Obsessed with medieval jousts and the manly arts, he conducts a medievil tournament and the winner of the tournament will be deemed appropriate to sire his heir off his wife, katrine. Katrine, of course, is unwilling. Rowan deBlanc is unaware of the plan but joins the games to find out how and why his brother terrance was murdered. Rowan, of course, wins the tourney and receives giles 'proposal'. At this point the book takes a huge dive into unreality and tediousness with talk of sex and sex scenes filling the next many chapters. Since both katrine and rowan are against giles plans, he locks them, fairly naked, in a tower, assuming the close proximity will lead to sex and thus a heir.......If you read on, hoping for something wonderful to 'restart' the story, as I did, you will be disappointed. Eventually the last 2 chapters get into the mystery of who is trying to kill katrine and rowan, and who did kill terrance........This book was a waste of time and money unless you just want to read about sex, which frankly I thought got boring.	2004-10-07

By then our heroine had lost her brothers (gettysburg), her father (mauraders), her mother and her fiance (buried alive), been gang raped, and was hit several times by men, even her 'love interest'. This book smacks not only of violence (which civil war or any war books have to some degree) but particular violence against women. And the writer doesn't understand the womans view. After being gang raped , she falls into bed without qualms with someone else a few days later. It is so disturbing that I found myself searching for info on the author. 'Felicia Andrews' may be a man since the copywright info is in the name of charles grant. That made me feel better because at least a woman did not write so callously about another woman. Scratched this writer, whether it is a man or woman, off my buy list.	2004-10-02

I liked the 'story line' synopsis so unearthed this book with high expectations. The plot was creative and held real promise. The good guys, yankee and rebs, were brave, handsome, courageous and likeable hunks. The book begins with a yankee gal bemoaning the fact that her fiance hasn't had time to fit their wedding into his life, although as a yankee officer he's off fighting a war! (a tad shallow!)To boost morale, Robert's commanding officer, brings Amanda to the 'field' so the wedding can take place in front of the troops. No great love is shown between this bride and groom and as the ceremony commences, the little church is attacked...an obvious trap set by a spy known as the spider....and many die including Robert! Our reb col fredericks takes Amanda and robert's sister, rebecca prisoners.( we find out later that it is because one of them was also a primary target of the spider). And Col Fredericks mission is to catch the spider (so he is an undercover spy called the shadow). Amanda and Rebecca must stay with the soldiers and manage to get into war zones and difficult situations. Eventually they also begin to help Daniel find food and medicines for his men. Although amanda manages to cause more problems ,she eventually matures enough to be likeable. My problem with the book is that it seems to leaves things unanswered. It weaves a thought or thread and then that all disappears and reemerges later on as if its something the readers should already know. The publishers also omitted a page and there are grammatical errors which made me crazy...not ruining the story but a distraction. Gen. Ulysse Grant emerges in the books and amanda, who has married to get daniel released from prison, takes on a spy mission of her own.  <br />However you never really know why the bad guy extorted her into the marriage. Threads were left hanging.....even the ending left threads hanging...and parts didn't make sense. Daniel says he knew who the 'spider' was much earlier in the story but if he did why didn't he tell someone?? It was his job to find the spy. duh...I hope that someday the author rewrites this story and is more thorough with it. It could be a keeper with a good re write. <br />	2004-09-27

Although Landis is not a favorite author of mine I favor civil war era stories so gave this one a chance. The plot was very unique. Frankly I never gave a thought to what the returning soldiers would find at home....especially given the years it took some of them to regain their health, freedom and get home. This surely put that in perspective. The characters were very realistic and quite wonderful. Landis makes her meaningful points very subtly throughout the book with the various relationships and issues that arise. I rated this less than a 5 only because our heroine is a backwoods gal, much like 'Tammy\\" in the old movies and the author put too much emphasis on the 'voodoo charm witches brew' medicine of that backwoods culture. Although it didn't take much away from the story itself, I just found it distracting. Sarah herself was everything a heroine should be with a great deal of perseverence, heart and courage. Although our hero, Dru, eventually comes to care for her little daughter, lissybeth, it is barely noticeable to the reader. You have to look for it and I think that precious little girl deserved more than a token  <br />acceptance. A better than average book for sure.........not one I would read a 2nd time so not for my keeper shelf but it may be for yours.	2004-09-21

Potter has proven time and again that she is an excellent writer and an expert on human behaviour. This book is wonderful. Set in pre-civil war south,  Meredith Seaton was raised by her cold, callous father...and she dearly loved her black half sister! Her plantation owner father sold Lissa to avoid scandal and Meredith was devastated. She withdrew into herself determined that she would find her sister one day....Years later she emerges as this eccentric, southern belle ninny......corkscrew curls, makeup, layers of frilly, unbecoming dresses and a giggle that breaks glass. In this guise she is not only searching for Lissa but helping free slaves for the underground railroad. The dialogue and situations she devises for her \\"character\\" are a sketch.  However in her travels she meets Capt Quinn Devereaux, a paddle boat owner who clearly 'mistreats' his slave, Cam. Quinn can't understand why he is drawn to this air headed girl and with secrets of his own he tries very hard not to be. A gambler, rogue and intimidating man, he has scars to prove the hell he has lived through and he distances himself from people to survive. He also hides a gentler self that even he doesn't know exists anymore. When meredith sticks her nose in secret business, quinn is forced to kidnap her to save the lives of his friends. Meredith jumps overboard to escape him and he believes she is dead and quinn is beyond distraught. Don't want to give the plot away but this book has many facets and never a dull moment.

Orwig has written a civil war era trilogy about the O'Brien brothers : New orleans ( pre war) was the first and my least favorite. Memphis (during the war) is about Caleb, a handsome reb and sophia and it is really awesome. And Atlanta, the post war/reconstruction era story is about missing brother Fortune O'Brien, naturally he is a yankee! Each book is different and stands alone but it's great how the brothers intertwine in the stories. Memphis starts with Sophia posing as a yankee private in a yank camp to get a story for her family's newspaper. Her dad and brothers are off fighting and she's determined to help the 'cause\\" and keep the paper running. However she gets caught in a surprise confederate raid against the camp and ultimately struggles to get 2 reb officers home and saves their lives. Sophia was raised prim and proper and priggish and of course Cal is a fun loving rogue.They clash quite thoroughly. The dialogue is great and the story line is believable. How they get involved in various 'missions' and how determined they are to keep the other from harm is delightful. Cal starts raiding with mosby's raiders and is about to get himself hung. Sophia saves him but also winds out with a price on her head. This is a page turner with wonderful characters. Brother Fortune, missing for years, shows up as a yankee major and helps his reb brother escape so the conflict of interest is always a factor. The cutest part is when sophia dresses 6' caleb up as a crotchety old woman to escape libby prison....This book is rich with history and shows how the railroad links got developed against tough odds. Of course sophia has to help save caleb from bad guys that don't want his railroad to survive either. Come to think of it they do tend to save each other fairly often!!......I particular like sequels because you get to see the characters develop with their individual stories and of course a good book never ends if it has a sequel!!You'll enjoy this.	2004-09-14

Mostly the incredible research that the author has done which lends itself to obvious authenticity. This starts as a 300 page 'harlequin' that usually, to me, means little depth. But I love civil war era stuff so I read it anyway. We have the typical injured yankee and <br /> devoted reb belle.....and the belle trying to get out of an arranged marriage which leads to a prank where she meets our embittered hero. Pretty standard stuff. There aren't any hot love scenes, just tender words and emotions conveyed through sharkespeares sonnets and a few embraces. The 'hero' volunteers to get arrested so he can lead a bunch of officers out of libby prison...and the reality of the nightmare of that prison are fairly vivid.

(I'd love a sequel on him). He's our hero's best friend with a history of womanizing but from the first time he meets Claire he hits on her. At first it looks like he's teasing and trying to make fortune jealous which is fine.

I love animals, especially dogs and horses so I was able to persevere with this book although it fell short of plot and depth. Our hero is a stiff necked, inflexible, elite soldier, aristocrat who is given a temporary assignment to sneak a gold shipment to wellington via a circus troupe. The owner died leaving his 22 yr old widowed daughter and her younger brothers in charge. The hero joins the troupe as the new \\"husband\\" of gabrielle. The characters are typical of circus people, close knit and very family like with family squabbles, etc.. Gabrielle is gorgeous as well as talented but her compassion for people and her love of her animals is the standout part of this story. <br />She's a gal you'd love to be friends with. Our hero does improve with contact with these caring people but...there are just parts that aren't believable. Leo, the hero, sleeps with gabrielle to make people believe they are married. And after comments of how grieving she was when she lost her young husband, leo kisses her, asks her to sleep with him and she says she'll take care of birth control.! duh....and they have an affair. With the exception of the verbal climaxes the bedroom scenes are kind of \\"bing,boom, bam, thank you ma'am.\\" However, Leo does start getting very protective of her and its obvious that he cares about her. Another \\"unreality\\"......various problems arise with the circus and our astute business lady never seems to fully realize that leo is \\"buying\\" her problems away..another duh.... <br />although there appears to be need for concern that they are found smuggling the gold south, there is never any big \\"spy scare\\" scene just a few searches which are ultimately dropped and a very smoothe transfer of gold to the good guys that takes perhaps one page. In the middle of the book you can figure out the ending......so its difficult to keep reading but it was a nice little story so I stuck it out. Gabrielle's stardom was almost usurped by her greyhound collette who sure got a lotof loving attention......and that was no doubt genuine.......... the book repeatedly refers to the special training for these arabians and lippanzers but it never discusses what any of that training technique is which I would have welcomed.	2004-08-31

Love civil war era books and to the extent that this includes little known facts about it, such as the cotton wagon trains to shore up funds for the south, and the actual historical accuracies of texas ranches, it is enjoyable. However as a novel, historical romance, I found it extremely lacking on character depth. Our southern belle spends the entire book trying to not-too-subtly get the overseer's son to bed her and wed her. I found her bold and brassy in her efforts. The love interest, bowie beckett, spends the book avoiding her obvious attempts to seduce him because he's \\"not good enough for her\\". A real creative story line. It was also short of realism. When has a band of \\"banditos\\" attacking a train of 10 wagons been scared off by one woman toting and shooting a gun while riding her mare! <br />And then our belle shoots the spy/bad guy while sitting a horse with her hands tied. Sorry I just can't buy all this....This was an easy toss.	2004-08-22

It's post civil war with the male lead and his sister trying to find the confed. raiders who killed j.w.'s wife and raped tess. The kansas massacre is well documented, tragic event of the civil war. The characters were wonderful. Louisa was the epitome of poor little, tough girl trying to save herself and her baby from first a nasty husband and then an evil man.J.W. is systematically finding the raiders with his sister &#34;diamond&#34;s help. The story has a different approach to a basic premise. While I enjoyed the book, I only rated it a 3 or 3+ because I felt the characters weren't delved into early enough. We're halfway into the book before we find out that tess was raped. We never find out the hero's family background in any depth as he doesn't want to talk about it. The other critique I have is that the &#34;spouses&#34; that were grieved over become flawed. Tess's yankee husband becomes a fun loving, irresponsible person until he faces the ravages of war. Lou's husband was nice for 1 day and then turns into a nasty, drunk outlaw. J&#62;W&#62;'s wife who he adores enough to get revenge for becomes a bit self absorbed and not very maternal to their sickly baby.  Now they each find this perfect love...and one wonders how they made such bad choices to begin with. It just doesn't quite pass the believability test. But I think this is henderson's first book......and she sure shows a lot of promise. I'll be checking her next book out. As I said, this was enjoyable but not a keeper in my book.	2004-08-21

It's always difficult to understand a bad review on something you really enjoyed, be it a book, movie, etc.. I am NOT a big scots fan...accent, history or any of the above. BUT Potter is an incredible author and her stories are nearly always worth reading. I read this not even knowin it was part of a trilogy. The characters are wonderful with depth, issues, angst and all the things that good characters have. The children and the animals always add a delightful dimension and often insight.They have a way of pulling the characters out of their emotional dungeon and into the world. And people are often at their best with them.I never understood why Ian had such a young sister. He was intent on searching for \\"katy\\" but the age thing was a bit puzzling.  Knowing the bad guy wasn't a problem because he was powerful and you never knew how Ian was going to help Fancy get out of his grasp. Francy's pain at not being able to read...when we take it so for granted...was an interesting twist. I highly recommend this book. I am currently reading the star sequel which is the little boy Noel's story. While it is also very good it doesn't have the multifacets that this one does. yet they're both keepers..............p.s. yes, hannah, you are the only one who didn't like this book! :) <br /> <br />	2004-08-14

The estrangement between Laura's father and his family left the family spread to a bitter lavitia while the laura's father was 'disinherited&quot;. Laura finds her aunt to be bitter, cold and calculating. Laura meets the neighboring ex boyhood friend of her dad and his son, zach houston. Latitia holds the note on their spread the double H and eventually uses her power to bankrupt them. Laura and Zach fall in love and defy lavitia by meeting secretly and planning to be wed. Zach takes a job to earn some money for them to marry but Zach is soon reported dead. A grieving, pregnant Laura is forced into a loveless marriage to luis esposito, a florida plantation owner and an evil, sadistic man. 7 yrs later, a seminole uprising in fla requires the intervention of the cavalry....and zach is the lieutenant in charge. At this point the story veers off into 3 chapters of seminole indian/cavalry history and massacres and the book sinks from an average western 3 to about a 1. But I determined to finish the book, which I did and wish I hadn't bothered. Other characters and subplots muddy the mess. Luis is living with laura (and hates her child) but his mistress pilar and her son by Luis also live in the same house. Theresa, is almost raped by Luis and within 8 pages is the happy &quot;squaw&quot; of the outlaw seminole leader. etc..The only redeeming value of the last chapters was the relationship between zach and his son peter, who of course Zach couldn't figure out was his own son until the last chapter. duh.

It is not the run of the mill western because it deals with horrific, freqeunt betrayal and the relentless search by Rafe to clear his name. Watching him evolve from this driven man whose only emotion is hate and revenge into a man who learns that revenge isn't all he thought it would be is excellent. The fact that he is helped in this soul changing experience by the love of his enemy's daughter is also excellent. Shea also must choose between the man she loves and the father she never knew she had. <br />Add to that great characters and incredibly dedicated male friendships that stand by Rafe throughout his ordeal and sacrifice their lives to help him and you have a really wonderful book. It's so much more than a romance. The male bonding in itself is very unique and heartrending. Pat Potter's books are rarely disappointing and this one wasn't either.	2004-08-03

Olivia loved Sharla but her new husband James was a philander with an eye for his wife's ward. Olivia's death leaves Sharla vulnerable so she plans to leave the house until she's 21 and inherits but James thwarts her plans. They quarrel pubicly and the next day James is found murdered. Hattie, Sharla's nanny, conspires with the local madam, maxine, to protect Sharla from the warrant for her arrest! To do so they dress her as a prostitute and under an assumed name hire a gunslinger, lance slade, to take her to texas. Lance has his own mission. He is a bounty hunter who is looking for the men that murdered his family 5 yrs before and escorting the &quot;hooker&quot; is right on his way anyhow. The premise of the story is how to prove sharla is innocent and how to catch the real killer. But in trying to do that Maxine (who is really sharla's mother) is also murdered. Lance eventually finds out who the lady under all the make up is and swears to prove her innocent as he continually saves her from the reaches of other bounty hunters.<BR>There are lots of bad guys...and at least one evil gal...and plenty of good guys. Certainly finding peace with their pasts and hope for their future is a goal both lance and sharla share.<BR>Rochelle Wayne is a talented author whose books I've enjoyed in the past. &quot;Destiny&quot; written in 1982 may have been one of her earlier works for it doesn't live up to the quality I've come to expect from this writer. The plot is excellent, told well and weaves together nicely. However, for whatever reason, there wasn't much depth to the characters. And with so many great characters in the plot that was too bad. If you run across this, read it for enjoyment. But it's hard to find and I wouldn't search it out (as I did) unless you just like westerns.	2004-07-18

So glad I did!	&quot;Never love a cowboy&quot; sounds like a fairly standard western so it didn't &quot;grab me&quot;. But I have read Heath's other books and she is an excellent author. My attention kept coming back to this one and the idea of the British cowboy sounded cute and different so I did buy it for a &quot;quick, easy read&quot;. Wow. The title certainly does not do this book justice. It is so much more than a typical western. The plot is very different but the characters are living, touchable people. You feel their joy and pain. The dialogue is incredible. You laugh and you cry. Jessye is one of the most delightful heroines I've ever read. She is so full of ......and vinegar. She tickles your funny bone or at least mine!<BR> After one of Harry's pouty 3 day silences, he says to Jess..&quot;I've been thinking...&quot; To which she says..&quot;That why you've been so quiet. You can't think and talk at the same time!&quot;<BR>..Harry asks why Jess has been quiet and she says &quot;haven't been in the company of anyone I thought was worth talking to!!&quot;. Now anyway who has ever had a relationship wishes she had said those things to her guy!!...The early part of this book is just plain fun. The second part is serious business with emotional angst.

( The new frasier series promises to also be great). MacKenzie's Zach is 3rd generation and he is a hunk(as they all are). The strength of this \\"basic texas ranger western\\" is the dialogue. Ana Leigh brings her characters to life and the stuff that comes out of their mouths is sometimes laugh out loud funny although a tad risque. I don't think Zach's story is as good as some of the others (ironically I didn't prefer the one about his father, Flint, either) perhaps because the plot was fairly standard but it was fun to read. And his redheaded, feisty flame, rose, is pretty unforgettable for her sassy speech. Cute, cute, cute. A feel-good historical romance, more on the romance(not explicit sex) and less on the historical side.	2004-07-02

The story as outlined above is accurate and the detail of the perils facing those heading west is excellent. There can never be too much said about the courage of those early pioneers, men and women. Having said that, &quot;The Scout&quot; is a quick read, with a superficial story and superficial characters! (It always amazes me when people diss a book I've truly enjoyed but now I understand how it happens.)<BR>Constance and her sister Nettie are travelling to Oregon on a wagon train run by an incompetent wagonmaster. Although that is always possible, everything I've ever read speaks to the incredible experience and expertise of wagon masters of that era.<BR>But... Nettie is a spoiled brat, not only does she not help but she whines incessantly about everything. Constance (who journals throughout the book to keep us posted) facilitates Nettie's behaviour but gripes about it and Nettie constantly in her journal! Enter Major John and Billy. The major is assigned to protect the wagon train through indian territory with his sidekick, &quot;old &quot; Billy who is about 40, talks constantly and speaks poorly. (His diction is constantly corrected by perfect Nettie who is 17 by the way) Major John is hurting from an experience that we don't have a clue about and is distant and fairly antisocial but dedicated to his duty. So he does his job with skill. Having met the major twice Constance decides she is in love with him. And one huggy/feely encounter convinces john that he is a &quot;man&quot; again and cares about Constance even if she is not the &quot;pretty one&quot;. Several comments are made about her lack of beauty which is a turn off. Well, Nettie decides she wants (and needs to be married) to the Major and tells his superior that he got her pregnant!!..(Constance hasn't noticed the signs of the 3 month pregnant girl). John has to marry nettie or be courtmartialed even though he tells his superior (who has been his boss and friends for years) that he hasn't touched her. He honors his betrothal to Nettie by sleeping &quot;one time for memories&quot; with Constance. We eventually find out John has lost his wife tragically and he was determined not to love again. And that Constance would not ruin her sisters happiness, etc...so they all meet at the altar. Where with this and that, Nettie winds up married to Billy ( her senior by 20+ yrs) and Constance winds up married to john......In between this stuff there is an excellent scene about Constance getting injured and John doctoring her to save her life. But I never understood why he shot his rifle at the indian's feet instead of killing the indian before he attacked constance. That didn't figure. A lot about this book didn&quot;t figure. If you can get around my totally biased account of this story, you'll probably enjoy it. I sure didn't. A waste of time and money.	2004-07-01

(If anything the ending was a bit too abrupt...there wasn't time to savor it). Rachel Kearney (Mrs. Elias Johnson)is a Vicksberg gal whose family lost everything in the civil war. Now her father has returned from that conflict a emotionally changed man, unable to take care of his family or make any decisions. There is also a price on his head. Rachel decides that she will take her adored father and sister and brother west for a new start. They've missed the wagon train so try to make that journey alone and of course are beseiged by bad men. Dan Overton, a pinkerton agent and ex-yankee spy, is on the trail of a killer and saves Rachel and her family more than once from ruthless men. Dan is immediately attracted to the green eyed redhead with the spitfire temper, incredible courage and leather pants! But she is married and he is on a mission. I don't want to give away the story but could it be that the man he's chasing is Rachel's father? Well this book is full of great dialogue, story line<BR>with twists, and delightful romance.

Perhaps that is why this book is such a disappointment. It is VERY slow getting to the cruxt of the story. The storyline is excellent and the characters have depth. The writing, ala RW, is also good. But I got so tired of listening to how &quot;plain, unpretty, etc.&quot; Jude Amos is. Dalton Mackenzie injures his eyes in a stagecoach robbery and Jude takes him in and nurses him back to health. Of course he &quot;visualizes&quot; his nurse who in his mind's eye is beautiful beyond compare. In one scene where he regains his sight and &quot;sees&quot; her his disappointment at her lack of physical beauty is explicit. How horrible. And how shallow. You would think poor Jude had a huge wart on her nose. He eventually comes to love her for all her wonderful qualities and she becomes attractive to him because of those traits. But in this world of superficial beauty being applauded at every turn, it really is upsetting to have to read a good book that makes the leading lady feel like a lesser person because she's just plain. I think this was in poor taste, RW.  Our heroine could easily have been an average looking gal who was loved for her other traits without hurting her feelings about it repeatedly. To further emphasize the focus on looks, the cover girl certainly isn't &quot;plain&quot;.	2004-06-17

Jessie's unpleasant and greedy stepfather defrauds her out of her inheritance but makes a proposition. If she marries the manager of their plantation he will sign it over to her so that she can be independent and regain some of her rightful land. Jessie agrees and marries Mr. Twill by proxy. With many doubts<BR>she travels to the carolina's to meet her husband. However Mr. Twill is at deaths door and pretty sleazy in the bargain. The plantation is in a state of ruin. Although grossed out, she takes it in stride and attempts to help her &quot;husband&quot; recover.She is aided by her maid, a lazy useless servant named Josie and a handsome bond servant from the neighboring Fortune plantation. She needs her &quot;husband&quot; when her stepfather arrives to sign over the deeds. Mr. Twill dies and Jessie is in a predicament. Attracted to the bond servant, Sean, but aware that they are of different classes, she nonetheless asks him to pose as her husband until the papers are signed. Sean agrees. He was attracted to Jessie from the first but has other reasons for staying near her and helping her. It seems that the plantations in the area, especially Mr. Fortune's, are being burglarized by pirates and he is trying to catch them. He has isolated the burglars to Jessie's place and doesn't know whether Jessie is one of them. And, no surprise, he turns out to be more than a bondservant. The identity of the pirates is a surprise also. This isn't a unique plot but it is written with some different twists to it. The writing is well done. The love scenes are tasteful and the characters are likeable (or dislikeable as the case may be.) I enjoyed it. And I'd read something by this new author again.	2004-06-14

It is frontier-civil war era time period which I love.But it centers on the role of the indian nations in that conflict. That author herself notes that &quot;the general public is unaware that Indian territory became a bloody battleground as the union foces in Kansas and the conferate forces in Texas met in the middle to fight over    it.&quot; This historical romance is actually 2 individual stories in one. The first is set in early 1861 is about a Creek warrior, Yellow Jacket. His brother and niece are killed by whites so he is biased against all whites. But the Indians are starving and ill so he must accept the help of a southern white woman who he comes to admire...and kidnap. The indians decide to cross rebel lines and get to union safety in Kansas because President Lincoln has promised his support to them. The story itself is big on history (which is fascinating throughout the book) and short on romance. Yellow Jacket is macho and Twilight Dumont is missish. I could never come to care about either of them frankly. BUT in this story Yellow Jacket's life is saved by a confederate cherokee indian friend, jim eagle. and the second story in the book is about him. Towards the end of the civil war, Lt. Jim Eagle captures a union supply boat and finds that one of the young solders is a stunning cherokee woman...and a spy.Actually April doesn't care much who wins the war (she's caught in a blue uniform but carrying a new gray one), she took the job to make enough money to go east to live as a white woman and to forget that she is half cherokee. By finding out who is selling secret information she will achieve that goal. Jim Eagle is torn between his duty, his friendships, his brothers and this courageous beauty. This story is excellent. There's less history, more romance AND the characters are likeable, believable and enjoyable. The relationships are charged and everything is so real. I can not believe how much I learned about the civil war from this book. The author ends the book with a wonderful informational narrative that reflects her earnest research and love of the subject. In truth I would only read the yellow jacket story because it sets the stage for the second part, which can stand alone if you prefer. Georgina Gentry's books seem to be about the american indian which is not a genre that truly interests me but I am very pleased with this particular work.	2004-05-21

There are so many very complete story reviews that I will only speak to overall status. Monk usually does a wonderful job but for some reason this was lacking. The storyline itself had great potential but it swerved hither and yon. At one point she called the bad guy (vincent) Victor. That type of error really annoys me. The heartwarming part of the story was the children and Haydon and Genevieves devotion to their welfare. That's very unique in a plot. The book is unclear on the origins of most of the characters. Monk shows incredible sensitivity in her description of Genevieve's paintings and the meaning  of those renderings. Truly insightful. The book spends most of 340 pages attending to the trouble hayden is in but in the end resolves everything in about 20 pages . Just a tad like it may have been book deadline time. And thought the ending is cutesey it really IS cute! Who reads historical romance for hard realism anyway.<BR>Woud I go out and buy it, probably not but I'd ck it out of a library for a quick read just for the &quot;kids&quot; dialogue....<BR> p.s. there is supposed to be a &quot;jack&quot; sequel.......	2004-05-17

Wild Desire is not the best book I've ever read but it certainly was a multifaceted story with great characters. Jonathon, our strong, virile hero is not only tormented by his experience in the civil war but also the untimely death of his wife and son. He decides to go to california to start anew on his incredible horse \\"Red Warrior\\". But his 6th sense tells him to stop at Trinity Ranch to see his confederate war buddy, lawrence. Jonathon had saved Lawrence's life during the war (as his friend's brother Lamar turned coward and ran) but never explained the circumstances to Lawrence. Trinity Ranch was held by Lawrence and Lamar, so going there for a visit was going to be difficult. Jon found his friend in poor health and depressed but also found his niece Eliza Kate incredibly tempting. (The title of wild desire doesn't fit this book at all for while there is romance and lovemaking it isn't graphic. Anyone looking for great sexual scenes will be disappointed.)The story line deals with Jon's concern for his friend, his interest in Eliza, his dislike for Lamar, Lamar's shame and dislike at seeing Jon again and the entire family dynamic. Eliza is engaged to a jerk and slowly realizes that she loves jon and must get out of her engagement but of course that will be difficult. And then there is Red Warrior's race and win against eliza's fiance....and bets, debts and attempted murder. The various elements interweave quite well and you really grow fond of the characters. Although the book is not at all depressing, it is very difficult for jon to risk loving again and it is difficult for these post war individuals to leave that trauma behind too.<BR>All in all a wonderful book. You'll probably love red warrior as much as we love our hero jonathon when you're done.	2004-05-13

They are too beautiful by far ...and the reader certainly tires of hearing over and over how beautiful they are...and are steering clear of the marriage trap. Suddenly they are involved in protecting their father from an assassin and everyone joins together to this goal. The story line is weak and for some reason the characters never really come alive. They're \\"nice guys\\" and a nice family but the characters never grab you. The writing is very stiff and what little romance is in this isn't very inspiring.

French has done an incredible job with this 390 page multifaced book. The Revolution is in full bloom and its hard to tell who is a patriot and who is a Tory and people get killed if they are wrong. Sarah Turner is a young wife with a little boy trying to survive by keeping &quot;kings Landing Inn&quot; open. Sarah's husband, Obediah is a beast who beat her and abused her and forced her into marriage but he is thankfully off fighting the war. His brother Issac, who is even more evil and vile, &quot;checks&quot; on Sarah from time to time waiting to get his hands on her, the inn and her son (and any supplies she may have). Actually Isacc is the leader of a band of renegade cutthroats who kill for the fun of it. In addition to the inn, she ferries people across the river and is desparately in need of physical help when Abe Forrest shows up and saves her from marauders. Despite his straggling red hair, unkempt beard, eyepatch and low born speech, Sarah hires him on. Soon she and her son care about this mountain man. However Forrest is having trouble. He is a Patriot spy sent to spy on this inn and this woman who is a strong loyalist. They survive many bad situations and have to run for their lives, find the bad guys, help win the war, etc....And somehow Sarah has to explain to Forrest that her husband is buried in her yard!!and she is being blackmailed. Very strong characters, hunky guy with or without his eyepatch, incredibly brave woman with a sense of humor, terrific writing ...this is a real treat.<BR>I never tire of reading about our nations struggles for liberty.	2004-04-20

In 1863, 13 yr old Tess Montgomery, saves 2 confederate soldiers hiding in her barn unbeknownst to her domineering mother who hates &quot;rebels&quot;. Jed, an older man, becomes like an uncle to Tess and stays in touch with during the war. Zachary McClain, the young southern charmer, not only doesn't stay in touch with her but believes she betrayed their hiding place and is responsible for the years he spent in a union prison. Years later, when Tess is about 20, Jed leaves his worldly possessions, a broken down ranch and a silver mine,  jointly to Tess and Zachary. They have to come to terms with Jed's will, Jed's murder, and their love-hate relationship. Tess is such a loyal, sweet young woman that Zach finds it difficult to keep his hate for her alive but there is no other answer to his betrayal.And why was Jed killed? There are lots of bad guys, lots of angst and a very likeable hero and heroine. It very nicely makes the point that what we sometimes think is a failure can in fact be a real act of courage. A cute story. Not a keeper but a an enjoyable read.	2004-04-19

Can't believe how disappointed I was in this story line. Ryan turns out to be a sleep with anyone, shallow person until the last 2 chapters and it gets repetitive listening to it. However the book talks about his womanizing and fortunately doesn't take through all his adventures&gt;  &quot;Kitty&quot; is a naive, from the wrong side of the tracks girl, who never quite catches my heart.

This is a civil war -post civil war era book without any significant inclusion of the war itself. Brand was a Reb with a wonderful home who fought and was imprisoned by the yankees. The book makes the excellent point that he is older than his 30 birth years because of this horrendous experience. And this is so true that it makes the romance between him and the 36 yr old mother of the debutante that he is supposed to marry plausible. Our deb, lorilee, starts out as a fluffy and immature, almost to the point of annoyance, but it is good to see her as she matures rapidly thankfully. Our Rebel Baron is incredible. A hunk of the first order who has lost everything in America to find himself titled and penniless also in england. But he is rich in his friendship with his horse trainor. Miranda, our mother who wants to find a husband for her daughter, is a complex character........admirable in her business acumen and annoying in her &quot;oldness&quot;. The dialogue between her and Brand is truly enjoyable. It is fun watching them have fun. When Lori decides to hook them up, it is too cute. Reba his ex-fiancee who abandoned him for a better match is nasty but the role fits into the story well. Brand has too much integrity to marry for money and seeing him find a way to work out his problems differently is great. The  book falls short for me by ending too soon. Brand is trying to set up his &quot;thoroughbred stables&quot; throughout the book and that aspect is left high and dry at the end. We're sure he's successful but would like to hear about it. Midnight Reiver is such a beautiful horse that a few ending paragraphs wouldn't be remiss. All in all good job, shirl. You do have a wonderful talent and I really enjoy your books. Will watch for lorilee's story.	2004-04-09

The writing is wonderful, the story unique and the characters so real they jump out at you.<BR>Guy Bellemare, (...) who was disowned by his father, entered the seminary. He soon found this was not his place in life and became a mercentary knight for King William the Conqueror. The king ordered Guy to resume his \\"friar\\" image and disguised as priest to lure Gabrielle Aumont, a nun, and her brother from an abbey where they had sought refuge. In return, Guy would be rewarded with his own lands and title, that which he wanted most in life. Gabrielle's uncle, the villanous, <BR>Quennell, had requested the king's involvement in the arranged marriage of his niece and the return of his nephew so he could ultimately take their inheritence and titles from them and of course harm them. (as he killed their parents.) As the story goes, Gabrielle believes \\"the good friar\\" and goes with him willingly to \\"safety\\" in Scotland, the land of her mother. But Guy's plan is to deliver her to England. Quenell not trusting the end result, sends evil men to abduct and/or kill both Gabby and her brother Louis. Thus they encounter treachery on their travels and Gabby saves Guy's life. (They continue to save each others lives throughout the story.)The \\"friar\\" becomes good friends with Gabby and Louis and is forced through circumstance to bring her to her uncle in Scotland and await his chance to do the king's bidding. They are beset by betrayal at every turn. At one point Gabby is even tried for witchcraft! Eventually, the Scots uncle decides to marry Gabby to a clansman to keep her safe and holds a physical prowess contest of suitors. The best man will wed Gabby. Well, since Guy can't let this happen, he \\"leaves the priesthood\\" and vies for Gabby himself and wins her. The story continues with loads of swashbuckling stuff, tender scenes , wonderful relationships and so much more that I can't put into words. Guy's problem is whether he can defy the king and live with his beloved and this major problem seems impossible to overcome. And he is overwrought by his lies to Gabby. Of course Guy's brother, Royce, joins in the fray (from Hearts Victorios the prequel) and Guy's wrongfully shamed mother Ambra insists on propriety. His father Lance finds out that he was deceived and Guy and Royce are really his sons and not bastards so he wants to mend the rift but they don't want him. King William gets involved and even in the last pages, a pregnant Gabriel is abducted again. It's a fight to the finish. There's more than a smattering of love and faith in this book. The prayer is Gabby's hope to find a man she loves and the promise is Guy's promise to the king...to return the Aumont children and his promise to Gabby to love her and protect her with his life. The dialogue is full of wit and teasing and sincerity. I don't remember the last book I liked this much...and I'm not a medievil/castle reader. You won't regret finding this out of print book. I believe this was much better than the prequel and only hope there is eventually a sequl about any of the wonderful men in this story, preferably Louis, the Aumont heir. Great job, ME. Thanks.	2004-04-05

The above reviewer outlined the story well so my comments will only be a critique. The story starts out wonderfully with the spirited, spoiled miss and the forbiden &quot;stablehand&quot; taking their lifelong friendship toward perhaps adult affection. It gets side tracked by the forced marriage. Our heroines efforts to become a functioning colonial wife are adorable and our hero is of course outstanding. The middle of the book seemed to go on forever with the patriot and loyalist chess moves. I like historic stuff but this was written in a confusing manner. It was difficult to figure the good people from the bad and/or whose side who was on. Perhaps that was meant to be part of the &quot;suspense&quot; but for me, it just took a potentially wonderful book and forced me to wade through the middle. It pulls together in the last chapters. Wiggs is an excellent author and I highly recommend other works of hers which I've also reviewed. This is a story worth reading and finishing because of the characters and the insight into the pain of the american revolutionary period but I wouldn't read it a second time. And that's how I rate my books.	2004-04-03

Joan Johnston is a wonderful author and I've rated many of her books as keepers...but this one misses the mark. It starts out fine. A man wants a dynasty and plans for 3 sons but, alas, he has 3 daughters so he just raises them as sons. They are each unique, beautiful women living their lives as they've been taught by the father they love and admire. Naturally things happen and they each learn that they are more vulnerable than they knew and that everyone needs love...and that being a woman doesn't mean giving up their independent thoughts and lives.<BR>While the youngest was &quot;the brat in buckskins&quot; she didn't know any different and I loved her fiesty nature. It was a hoot. Sister Bay was the gentle gal, and Sloan the heir apparent so Cricket could be as outrageous as she chose, except that her father now decided she should marry..whoops. The middle of the book drags and though the writing is good, having Cricket &quot;made into a lady&quot; gets a bid tedious and demeaning.

Reviewer: A reader from rochester new york<BR>I enjoyed every moment of this book. The characters, even the children, have personality, depth and believability. There's laugh out loud fun and tears. &quot;Chastity&quot; is a tad too naive but the hero is all hero and quite makes up for it. This isn't your standard regency story . In fact I found the title very misleading. I read this in spite of the &quot;usual&quot; title and am glad that I did.	2004-03-26

I only rate the first 2 books of this set 3's as they were standard regency fare....Teach the rogues good manners and fallin love with them. But in the second book I fell in love with &quot;Bit&quot;, Roert Carroway, the tormented war wounded brother. He was so withdrawn and so pathetic and so tortured that I wanted desparately to look into his future. And then came &quot;England's Perfect Hero&quot;. It is wonderful. Bit is a man driven beyond despair by the horrors of war and he finds the strength slowly to pull himself out of the depths of his nightmares. It reflects one man's strengths and it reflects the support system of family, the beauty of friendship and the miracle of being loved. It was much more than a &quot;regency&quot;. I loved it. ONce I started it, I couldn't put it down until I finished it. Great characters, witty dialogue and good story.	2004-03-24

If you've never read KC, start with The Raider, The Raider's Daughter and go down the line. They are really great and quite different from each other. When I started this book I wasn't sure I was going to like it. It's set in the post Culloden period and that's not my favorite era. But as you get into it, it grows on you. The characters are life like and likeable and their dedication to their cause is inspiring. One reviewer mentioned the lack of complexity in the development of the characters but I totally disagree. They had depth and multifaceted issues and longing. It was worth reading and now I'm on to the sequel about Gavin's brother Adam.

The book is set in pre-american revolution days when Viscount Ian Montjoy is sent to the colonies by the King to spy on the american &quot;patriots&quot; resisting his rule. Our hero, Ian, is both honorable and is soon able to understand this wonderful new country and the need for liberty. This is helped by his delightful encounters with a red haired, spirited colonial miss who is incredibly resourceful as she deters the suiters who pursue her in vain!.Their relationship of course is complicated by their diverse loyalties until Ian decides to fight for the patriot cause and spy for the americans. He is caught and about to hang when a &quot;pregnant&quot; Mercy and her friends rescue him and he and Mercy marry in haste and then escape. There's a great deal of rich history in the story as Ian fights in the revolution and everyone tries to survive. But the book centers on Ian and Mercy's love, their love of their horses and country and the love of liberty. Ian gets badly injured in the war and Mercy struggles for Ian's survival both physically and emotionally as he sinks into depression. But they must still face the english pillagers and Ian finds purpose, at least temporarily, in defending Mercy's home and people from the cruelties of war. I won't tell the ending but it was worth the wait. At one point I thought the hero was too much into self pity but if you're a virile hunk and suddenly you're blind, crippled and impotent I guess anyone would deserve a self pity session! The dialogue is absolutely wonderful, laugh out loud fun. The characters certainly are the books strength. I've never read KK before but I'll be checking her books out again. She shows much talent.	2004-03-10

This book could easily be developed into a 3 night miniseries (like the north and south series.) Only this is about the people<BR>who came to the western frontier, broken financially and so down there's only one way up..and they have the perseverence to make it. Despite horrific odds and challenges that lesser people would fail. This book is an easy read the characters just grab at you until you \\"own\\" them but it is a story of  many people,not just the original characters and I desparately wish that the \\"tie-ing the strings together with all these characters\\" in the last chapters was longer and more in depth.<BR>Genevieve , our main character,is the (england) tavern owners daughter who works hard and is treated badly. He \\"bets\\"  her in a card game and he loses her to a proxy marriage to a colonial. <BR>She's relatively unschooled but while working at the tavern has become friends with a nanny named Prudence sho teaches gennie to read and write.  Prudence confides in gennie...she loves the master of the house and is pregnant with his child. They confront him and his wife. Angela, the nasty hateful wife, instead of throwing Pru out of the house arranges a marriage for her with a distant, penniless man, our hero Roark, who desparately wants to go to the colonies. He needs the money Angela gives him for marriage to Pru. (He doesn't know she's pregnant). So the 3 of them coincidentally embark on this voyage to america. Rorak and Gennie fall in love but behave honorably<BR>until Prudence dies in childbirth and then they get together.<BR>The rest of the book is dedicated to their wonderful relationship and the incredible experience of their children.<BR>It has warmth, love, history, hardship, sadness, and joy. <BR> It slows down in the middle while characters are bedeviled with problems but it surely is worth that brief period for the remainder is excellent. I wish it had not ended as soon as it <BR>did. <BR>This is a love story but tastefully done with minimal graphic sex. Frankly, this story doesn't need the addition of that to be a successful novel or to reflect incredible love and passion.	2004-03-08

It dealt with so many difficult sociol issues as well as human frailty issues. The editor outlined the bk well so I won't do that. The story uses the angst of abandoned children (Jackson<BR>and Carrie), the verbally abused and neglected child (Leah) and one gets to wondering which is worse. We have the effect of non-parenting on children, the orphanage abuses that were rampant in that era (and probably more than we know in more recent times) and the desparate need to make onself feel needed and worthwhile which drives our hero and heroine.Then we run into the bias against women doctors, the realization of how far we've come in treating illnesses and trying to fit into a culture that keeps women in the kitchen. Less this all sound despressing, it isn't. It's wonderful to see the characters cope with what life has dealt them and evolve into happy adults with a wonderful life companion. It has witty dialogue and is easy to relate to the feelings. And of course our hero Jackson who is the &quot;bad guy&quot; who always seems to be saving someone. It's a wonderful love story but when it's done the reader feels richer for the experience.	2004-03-05

My comments are geared more to the enjoyment of the book. Will Trevaron is actually exiled from england and his family by his grandfather who believes Will abused his fiancee. Will won't defend himself as he thinks his grandfather should have faith in him without need for explanation. Since he broke the engagement he feels Lily can use whatever story she wants and so he keeps silent.<br />That, among family, is a bit far fetched and starchy but pride is an encumbering emotion. Will goes to America, and is rescued and cared for by a young woman who loses her job over her conviction to help him. He remains friends with her over the next 5 years even &quot;helping&quot; her to marry an injured, grieved widower with 3 adorable children. When her &quot;husband&quot;dies she is left in poverty and unable to provide for herself or the children. Will has received a dictate to return to england to his &quot;rightful heritage&quot; out of necessity not forgiveness. But he has little trust for women in general and no wish to fall into his grandfather's control so he solves Maggie's problem and his. They marry. Before this can happen 2 more &quot;accidents&quot; occur and Maggie once again saves Will's life medically. Will is very slow in thinking that these accidents aren't accidents!!! when it's pretty obvious to the rest of us. Eventually Maggie and Will and the 3 precocious but adorable kids set sail for england in a 2 room cabin. The dialogue in this story is delightful. The children hit &quot;trigger points&quot; as children do and the adults, both of whom have 'issues' try to be honest with each other. Both have had traumatic pasts that need to be faced but are deeply held secret. The writing is excellent and when Maggie faces the duke and other pretentious english elite with her forthright manner of speaking, it is too funny. She is a strong woman and incrediblyvulnerable as is Will but she doesn't let anyone interfere with those she loves, no matter what. When she finally comes to realize why Will won't defend himself she confronts his family. Of course the bad guy is found after perilous moments and the ending is as it should be. The &quot;honor&quot; issue is a bit overdone and its a stretch that after being abused by an employer and married for several years, maggie still goes to Will as a virgin...and he never comments on it! It surprised me. Although this isn't my first pick to re-read as it's pretty standard fare, I still plan to keep it as it is an enjoyable light read..	2004-02-27

She writes with such clarity and compassion. I truly enjoy her books. This one is an easy read. Colter, our physically and emotionally scarred hero, has spent years tracking down the confederate soldiers who (post war) brutalized his wife and child...and left him to die. Unable to locate the last of them, he heads west to start his life over, such as it is. Kenjin is a young widow with precocious twin boys and a little girl who is trying to save her ranch and they enter into a marriage of mutual need and benefit.<BR>As he teaches her how to run her ranch, he also becomes, against his desire, a surrogate father to these children. The dialogue is so believable and touching that u feel like you are there.<BR>Naturally there are bad guys who try to take over the ranch, kill Colter, etc....and the love that kinjin brings to heal colters heart. This is a simple story with very real emotions and a book that is not very complex to enjoy.	2004-02-24

She writes so wonderfully and her characters are very human. Although the storyline was intense I didn't find it &quot;dark&quot; at all. Reading is meant to be entertaining and or educational. This was both because the early days in the west WERE not easy. There was some violence and a certain ruthlessness in order to survive.That was the reality of that era just as arranged marriages to acquire property were. Jake and Ben (Sarratt) watched their parents build their &quot;ranching kingdom&quot; and then saw them slaughtered for it. They did whatever they had to to survive and get their land back and revenge against the murderers. The &quot;heros&quot; are filled with anger and hate. Should we expect them to behave like choir boys. I don't think so. Some of their behaviour was totally unacceptable. They sure needed counselling in anger management. But all these was back then to change lives and influence behaviour was understand,love and forgiveness. Fortunately Linda's heroines, who don't have an easy time of it, have those qualities in abundance. So the story works. If you don't like realism you won't like this book. It's not fluffy but it is excellent. I only rated this a 4 because I would have liked the ending to have been a little fuller with the redemption of our heros although LH makes it clear they are on the right path.	2004-02-08

It's very difficult to be concise about the plot because it deals with 2 major historical tragedies....the irish rebellion in the 1840's and the american civil war in the 1860's. Our hero, connor, is a product of Ireland and suffers deeply from the trauma of that conflict still going on to some extent in northern ireland at the time this book was written. Olivia, is dealing with post civil war<BR>life and the evil of carpetbaggers laid on top of the trauma of the war itself. These are 2 very deep and emotional eras. While Connor is doing the boxing circuit in america trying to outrun his nightmares, olivia has adopted her best friends 3 orphaned daughters and is trying to save her run down plantation without money and without any help. Enter Connor who having won a fight that he was told to lose is beat up and left to die on the road to olivia's peachtree plantation. She finds him and nurses him back to health against her better judgment....dealing with his nightmares, his swearing and his tormented soul. The 3 girls are absolute joys. They add so much to the story as only life seen through the eyes of children can do. How their innocence wraps around connor's heart is so real you can feel it.I would not say this book is about saving peachtree plantation. This book is about that special something in people that makes them get up and keep trying when life is unbearable. And about how 2 very different people can help each other heal. It is the evolution from hatred and misery to finding hope, love and peace. I didn't rate this book a 5, although for the research alone guhrke should get a 6* rating because I don't like books that use flashbacks. I find it too distracting. It works in this story but it just isn't my thing. Incredible job, LG. Looking forward to other books by you.	2004-02-06

I try to review every book I read because I find reviews so helpful when I'm contemplating buying a book.  I love civil war era books and read &quot;An honorable man&quot; several months ago. It was well done and certainly enjoyable but there is no way I would compare it to GWTW! There is only one scarlet and one rhett!! I rated &quot;honorable man&quot; a reluctant 4 * and it is one I would reread again (which is my 4 rating.) That book ends in the early war years so the middle years are missed (unless there's a bk we all overlooked after cam and jackson marry) and this bk starts when he returns from the civil war. Actually it starts out really cute, their reunion is romantic and spicy. But the rest of the book drags. It's a book that you want to finish BUT you want to finish it soon. Jackson is the quintessimal stud/hero/man to die for. He is patriotic to his country and so takes on one last mission. Cameron is still the southern belle spoiled brat. I don't know why jackson puts up with her nasty moods. In fact cam's hot tempered and high maintainence personality even tired me out. The better part of the book was the relationship between Taye (Cam's biracial sister), her fiance (who's not all she thinks he is) and Falcon, Jackson's partner in spying. Falcon, a &quot;halfbreed&quot; understands Taye's life as it is and truly loves her. A  sequel about their relationship<BR>would be wonderful. Taye actually has more depth to her than the illustrious camerson. There are wonderful love scenes which compensate for story flaws.	2004-02-03

This was a wonderful story as noted by other reviewers. It's part of a 12 books Hawk's Way Series and I really enjoy the character overflow.

The 2nd bk of this contemporary western series is &quot;the Texan&quot; and while it stands alone, I think it should be a pre-requisite for this book. The series is wonderful with twists and feuds and love and deception. &quot;Bad Billy&quot; has paid a terrible price because of the treacherous Eve Blackthorn. You keep rooting for him to finally get a break and find some happiness and recognition. Enter Summer Blackthorn, a forbidden best friend.<br />Together they try to weave through the web of lies that have affected their lives. Summer initially is a weak, spoiled little rich  girl trying to win her mother's love and her fathers respect. But she evolves and defies them by cancelling her engagement to geoffrey and eloping with Billy Creed. Her father does everything to undermine billy and summers relationship and his family is none too pleasant either! Summer takes the flack and learns to exist in a poor man's world. And she learns to sacrifice for Billy and his son. Although I loved the story line, the author had to repeat so much of the previous history (obviously for those who hadn't read &quot;texan&quot;) that I found that redundant and annoying. Author Joan Johnston is definitely worth watching! She has a wonderful way with words and her characters are realistic, fiesty and the dialogue is witty. A great wrap up.	2004-01-21

The Bitter Creek trilogy begins with the cowboy (which I haven't read), the Texan, and finally the Loner. The Texan stands alone very well although I would advise reading it before going on to the final book, the loner. The book is so filled with plots that is certainly holds your interest. In fact I've found myself looking ahead several times to see what happens to a character.<BR>The other reviews explain the story well, as does the synopsis.  Although I don't like contempory stories, the mix of the FBI, Texas Rangers, nerve gas plot with the cattle ranches and horses, etc. and dynasty issues was very enjoyable. The characters were. great. Owen and Clay Blackthorne are twins, both in law enforcement and they are independently working on the same case. But one wonders if Clay is a bad guy at times. Bayleigh Creed is the local vet, trying to protect her angry young brother from harm. The creeds and blackthornes are the &quot;old time McCoy&quot; western enemies but they're crossing the hated line often in this plot. There's mystery, betrayal, multi generational love and deception, sadness, inventiveness, bravery, honor and witty dialogue. My one complaint is that the author felt the need to repeat so frequently the Creed-Blackthorne animosity which is clearly evident throughout the book through the characters.   This author is excellent. You might want to also try her &quot;Bodyguard/Bridegroom&quot; series.	2004-01-20

I have read the previous reviews and was delighted to have the authors comments. What a treat. I had not read either of the preceding books in this trilogy. I had read another JJ book and liked her writing style, so picked this up. It stands very independent of the others and is wonderful in and of itself. The characters are wonderful and humanly flawed. I enjoyed the plot. There was a reason for the paths the book went so it was NOT just another &quot;amnesia&quot; story. The duke certainly evolved during the story and I loved it when he noted things about himself &quot;I wish I had a monogrammed handkerchief&quot;, little things that reflected his previous luxurious life. JJ did a great job of letting u glimpse his memories recover. It wasn't just &quot;he has amnesia, he doesn't have amnesia anymore&quot;. The ending was a bit abrupt. The final scene happens too quickly and I would have liked more. It couldn't ruin what was a wonderful book and I have looking forward to the sequel.

The slaves in the area are being helped to escape north by the compassionate mysterious &quot;Frenchman&quot; who is part of the underground railroad.<BR>The south of course opposes this interference with their &quot;property&quot; and lifestyle and chases both the slaves and the railroad &quot;conductors&quot;. Charlotte, the eldest sister, touched by the plight of the slaves helps the mysterious &quot;Frenchman&quot; and jeopordizes her own safety. The other characters involved are Vanessa, the flirty daughter of Aunt Clara who dislikes any attention her cousins may take from her; Devlin, the hunky writer who rents a bungalow on clara's property and is researching southern culture, including slavery, for his book. The plantation &quot;manager&quot; Cord, is the stereotypical whip cracking, mean dispositioned, lecher. Charlotte, attempting to earn money for their keep, works For Devlin, transcribing his manuscript. She and Dev are drawn to each other but know little about each other as each of them are hiding secrets. The storyline is fairly typical and I didn't find the writing to be particularly unique either. This is the only book I've ever read by this author so I don't have any other insight into her books.	2004-01-13

However, having said that, I am glad I read it. It is not a keeper for me but it was so totally different from anything I have ever read, I almost gave it a 4 *.........The book mostly takes place in a north carolina farming community of german immigrants during the american civil war. They are a people who do not express or communicate their feelings well causing all kinds of missteps. However their loyalty to family and pledge is everything. The best part of the book are Lise and Mary Louise the 2 and 4 yr old daughters of our main character, Frederich. They are precious, precocious and delightful.Their mother, Ann, died giving birth to her 3rd child and her husband shows no compassion at her passing to her sister carolines distress. (We later find out that the baby was not his). Caroline is a blunt, un-biddable woman who loves her nieces dearly bit isn't overly fond of her \\"german\\" neighbors. Fredrick \\"offers' for Caroline for his motherless children and marries her although sheis pregnant by someone else who she will not name.Of course Frederick thinks she is a \\"ho\\" like her sister Ann. Enter Frederick's sister Beata. The original witch on a broom. She makes life so hard for Caroline and for everyone with her gossip and lies. As Caroline and Fredrick are trying to cope with this loveless, sexless marriage, they become bonded through several events. But the civil war intervenes and more hardships effect them all. Frederick finally admits, to himself, that he cares for Caroline and goes home to tell her..(and they have their wedding night)...but he is captured as a \\"deserter\\" and leaves after more angry words and sarcasm. Fredrick's biggest problem throughout the story is that he didn't shoot his sister Beata!!!! Caroline goes to Richmond to find her injured/dead husband and vows to bring him home in any condition...The fault of the book lies in its lack of expressed \\"emotion\\" but although I missed that too, it actually was in keeping with the story of this culture. The emotion was there but it was for the reader to discern between the lines. It also taught me so much about the traditions of the german culture for courting, death, etc......Very interesting actually. And while I had heard of \\"conscription\\"....the draft of men for the war, I never knew it could be, as it was here, at gunpoint. That gives new meaning to the word draft. The war references were tasteful and poignant. I have such mixed emotions about this book.

Adding to the excellent review above, one of the delightful facets of this book is the &quot;jones&quot; family itself. Bennie (Elizabeth) is the only girl with 6 &quot;Hoss&quot;-type protective brothers. They are a really close family with wonderful individual personalities. Bennie never thought she'd marry because she was &quot;different&quot; than the other girls. Taller, tougher and in her mind less pretty. But she has this incredibly awesome gift for music and playing the violin. Her music truly touches Jon's soul. Jon is incredible as the bumbling oaf with a tender heart and when little glimpses of the real man shine through its sometimes heartrending.He has given so much of himself for his country even though he was raised in endland. And complicating the matter for him is finding a traitor, which he believes is one of bennie's brothers.  Of course the setting is the American Revolution and I always find that interesting. It was a wonderful book and definitely not your typical read. I loved it. I believe you will too.	2004-01-05

Cody Carter, an ex-scout for the frontier cavalry during the civil war is summoned home to the Rocking C ranch for the reading of his father's will. Being a bastard son of a cheyanne woman, Cody has been estranged from his father for yrs. His father clearly preferred his legimate heir Wayne over Cody anyway. Enroute home Cody visits a brothel where he sees a glimpse of a beautiful blonde woman and finds out her name is Cassie. Ironically, Cassie also received a letter to attend the will reading at the Rocking C Ranch. She was a young child when her mother married Cody's father. This background is the basis for 400+ pages of excellent reading. Cody, known as a tough, hard riding, gun shooting halfbreed somehow manages to rescue 2 small children on his way home. There story is another plot line that mason weaves into the book. They are adorable, precocious and tenacious and take a liking to Cody, embarrassing him by calling him papa and leading people to believe he has abandoned \\"his children\\". Cody also resuces a dog, and then rescues a one armed ex reb soldier. He is perplexed as to why he keeps \\"picking up strays\\" when he's such an tough character. Naturally Cassie is on the same train. He immediately recognizes her as the \\"whore\\" and she immediately disliked him for the way he tries to get rid of his \\"children\\". Well they all land on the rocking C and of course Cassie and Cody get joint ownership of the ranch. Step brother Wayne is outraged and sets about trying to kill Cody and get Cassie. At the same time someone's trying to harm the children, who turn out to be wealthy orphans,  and kidnaps them. There are some wonderfully erotic love scenes before the whole mess unravels. The characters are excellent. Cody is too good to be bad; Cassie is loving but spunky, the kids are adorable and the side characters stand independently.<BR>This has a little bit of everything and I certainly enjoyed it. It isn't her best work but it is delightful.	2004-01-01

Of course there's Faith's &quot;husband&quot; George, a man worthy of our hate........and there's Gertie, a ranch wrangler who's never learned she was a female til she saves &quot;Doc&quot; from himself......All around good stuff including the precious kids.........precocious Alex and frail Becca.

Morgan is raised by her mother in the East, abandoned (so she thinks) by her father in New Mexico as a child. Her mother is a puritanical man hating snob and raises morgan to believe that they are worthless, hurtful...and to make matters worse that she is homely and no man would want her anyway. The book begins with Morgans need to find a husband to save her inheritance from her father! She proposes $25,000 to a stranger, seth colter, if he will marry her and live in new mexico with her for one yr and then get an annulment. Seth agrees. Their relationship has problems but eventually starts to flourish. However Seth is a very hot headed, jealous man. He finds Joanquin, a rancher neighbor, kissing Morgan and leaves her alone at a party. Joanquin, a not nice man, kidnaps Morgan on the way home. Her forces her to write a note to Seth saying she has run away with her \\"lover\\". When Seth finds her, Joaquin \\"kills\\" him and sells Morgan to a white slaver. All the nastiness of that situation ends in Morgan being sold to a brothel and being put into a private auction. However, Seth recovers from his nearly mortal head wound and winds up in california and finds morgan. He makes loves to her, calls her a whore and leaves her devestated. (Unbeknownst to Seth, Morgan has escaped any sexual encounters with the bad guys.) Morgan becomes pregnant from her night with Seth and returns to new mexico to have her child. Seth pans for gold for 2 yrs until he finds out the truth about Morgan and  returns home looking for her. Morgan has had a wonderful little boy and is happy living with her cousin Gordon, who is falling in love with her. Seth pretends to be Dave Blake and takes on a foreman job for Gordon to be near Morgan and his new found son. Seth and Morgan are on the verge on reconciling when little <BR>Adam gets deathly ill and nearly dies. Together they fight for his life. Morgan gets so obsessed with little Adam that she shuts out life around her so seth \\"kidnaps\\" her to bring herinto a healthier existence. And they do finally reconcile. This bk has many likeable characters, certainly several storylines and is quite entertaining. On the downside Morgan never quite captured me. I thought she was immature and bratty quite often. The bk referred to her need for a strong man to tell her what to do....duh...!! apparently because she had been so dominated by her mother as a child. The other thing I didn't like is the finale kidnap scene. After what she'd been through with bad guys, kidnapping her and scaring her half to death wasn't the loving way to get her attention. Overall, it was a different plotline and good read.	2003-12-29

It always amazes me how we (reviewers) read the same book and come up with different insights. I thought the book's premise was great and,having read Barbieri books before, looked forward to a great read but was disappointed. The initial chapter was wonderful. You had to fall in love with Wade even as he said good bye in Thea's arms at the altar. Going away to her aunt's to recover also made sense. Yet the relationship between Thea and her aunt Veronica never jelled. And then there's Quinn...who looks and talks like Wade, seems to say the same things to Thea that Wade did, but instead of a lawman is a stage robber. Is this man Wade? Thea chews this over for most of the book, which gets a bit boring. Of course the reader finds out that Quinn is an undercover lawman...hence another similarity to Wade. Sheffield, a fiesty female federal agent, and Perry enter the chase...and then there's aunt veronica's friendship with Larry. Everything is in place for some wonderful things but at this point I thought the book kind of died. The relationships of the secondary couples were superficially written about and came to conclusions very quickly. Thea and Quinn did the is he or not thing til the end of the book. The ending is different but I'm not sure what to make of it. I guess its open to interpretation. I read constantly. I don't understand the 5* ratings on this as I barely finished the book and gave it away. Just didn't think EB did her storyline and characters justice this time.	2003-12-25

There's a lengthy review which refers to the books focus on opium addiction and prostitution in 1880's england. The story line is rather stupid and not believable that the &quot;midnight angel&quot; is a female in disguise venturing to the slums in the middle of the night. I don't know why I bought this book but...I tossed it by the end of the 2nd chapter. Even the writing is stilted and formal and the main characters aren't warm and likeable. Can't find a good thing to say about it except that I dumped it.	2003-12-23

Aimee is card dealer on the &quot;Dixie Belle&quot; when she loses to macho nick drummond. Her pride stung, she accepts his double or nothing offer, a draw that of course she loses. The &quot;payment&quot; is a night in Nick's bed... He leaves in the morning without waking her. Aimee of course is furious to awake alone and more angry to become pregnant from this first time experience. She disappears<BR>from society. Nick of course is oblivious to both (her virginity and then subsequent pregnancy) but does try to find her, unbeknownst to her. Aimee's anger at all of this causes her hatred for nick to continue throughout the rest of the book (although she enjoys their lovemaking). After 400 pages of her saying &quot;I hate you&quot; you want to tell her to &quot;get a grip&quot;. This is the only exception I have to an otherwise excellent storyline. Of course Nick saves her and &quot;pleasures her&quot; over and over, and I wanted to tell him to forget it after awhile.!! <BR>I love civil war based stories and connie mason does that better than anyone else. This book is no exception. My only problem was that Aimee was such a brat and she couldn't &quot;move on&quot;......The love scenes are frequent and graphic. Nick strikes me as the best lover of any book I've ever read but then again it didn't take much with Aimee!	2003-12-22

He and his wonderful (hope there's a sequel for him) Tony are dedicated to the patriot cause while unbeknown to them, Emily is spying for the english. It's a web you think they can't get out of. Add little Miss Lucy. She is 8 going on 80 and precocious is too mild a word to describe her. Her character is perhaps the mot heart wrenching in the book. She certainly pushes adults to the end of their rope and beyond which is very amusing.Bringing this child back from her life of torment is perhaps better than the original plot. It's totally a great book. I enjoyed it and hope u will too.	2003-12-16

It was a bit of a slow read and I found myself considering not finishing it but I must admit there were areas of the story line that I wanted to find out about sooooo I had to keep at it. And it did get better.<BR>Actually I loved John Brodie. He was full of fun (p.. and vinegar as mom would say) but I didn't much like the heroine of the piece. She started out so stuffy and boring. She needed someone like John to lighten her up. As one reviewer mentioned John was romantically aggressive BUT I didn't find it offensive because he truly cared about Anna and showed it in many tender ways. If the plot appeals to you than this will be a good read for you.	2003-12-14

Blue was the perfect navy SEAL......and a wonderfully sexy,<BR>handsome vulnerable \\"hero\\". Lucy was a caring, upfront gal who had a crush on Blue in high school and now finds she actually loves him. However Blue is accused of murdering his brother and Lucy is the cop assigned to investigate the case. The dialogue is great, the love scenes are \\"hot\\"....so why did I give it a 3?? Getting into the book was a bit slow, much too much languishing over high school memories by both parties. But I found it terribly unrealistic that a female rookie cop of 6 months working as the token female in an all male, hostile police force would be assigned the biggest case to hit this small town. Eventually you can work it around so that the \\"bad\\" guys wanted to frame Blue and didn't want anyone to \\"solve\\" the real case and so assigned the least likely investigator. But that assumption is mine and was never hinted at in the book. Even Lucy knew she was out of her depth. I also would have loved more cameos from the rest of the alpha team who virtually had only a brief part. The book had some wonderful moments and the bonds between these two were palpable from the beginning.....I'm glad I read it but not sure I'll keep it.	2003-12-10

I have read all of the other review and they have really captured this book well. I had to add my 2 cents only because this is perhaps the best book I have ever read. (Well, tied for best anyway). The writing is superb. The story line is compelling and twists and turns. The characters are tormented, selfish and then courageous and self sacrificing. The emotions run the gamut. I do find some of the French Rev. graphics disturbing but those were in fact true. It is unbelievable that such atrocities occurred in our wonderful world at any time of our history. The characters were fully developed and I loved the addition of Phillipe to the story. If you read one book this month, let it be this one. It's remarkable. Great job KM.<BR>( &quot;The rebel and the redcoat&quot; is an amer rev story by this author which was also excellent. &quot;The Prisoner&quot; was also enjoyable.)	2003-12-09

Lilah was so &quot;tough&quot; she took in every stray and didn't even want the cows killed. Other characters in the book were also easy to relate to. However the story, such as it is, was well written and there was some cute, witty dialogue. It's a &quot;read fast so you can get on to another book&quot; type.

However I see it as much more of a civil war story than a love story. While it is true that our heroine is caught between the playboy type reb and the true blue yank, the love dialogue and scenes are minimal. It is much more about the horror of war and the conflicting emotions everyone suffered during this terrible time.<br />This is very graphic and not for the feint of heart. As for our heroine, I thought she was committed, compassionate but romantically very cold. I never could warm up to her. And there was very little interplay between her and the toddler rebecca that was sam's child that she took care of.Amanda was to be admired for her refusal to take sides. She smuggled drugs and medical supplies for the wounded.......whether they were rebs or yanks didn't matter to her. She hated the pain and death and losses of this war and tried to help the wounded of both sides. A most interesting characters was \\"soldier Tucker\\"......that could have been a story in itself. If you've read a lot of civil war era material you can't help but be touched by the fact that much of this is war scenario and pathos is true.Soldiers shooting each other and then helping each other up.Friends facing each other on a battlefield and killing each other or being killed. It was a very interesting book historically. As a romance, it fell way short of the mark.	2003-12-02

Certainly different.......but	In 1862, Cordelia struggled to take care of her young sister Emily and mentally unstable granny, Vivien, after their plantation Belle Oaks (Georgia) was burned down during the civil war.But Emily got pregnant and her &quot;nobleman&quot; lover abandoned her.In disgrace, Emily was desparate to find him, so Cordelia agreed to chaperon a rich young girl,nicknamed &quot;Precious&quot; (yuk) to England. &quot;Precious&quot; however escapes from the ship leaving Cordelia to have to impersonate her for them to continue their plans to find Emily's cad lover. However Cordelia is a 25 yr old spinster and &quot;Precious&quot; is a bratty 15 yr. old so some amusing situations arise. Before leaving war torn Georgia Cordelia is asked to deliver &quot;envelopes/messages&quot; to contacts in england who can influence our civil war. She undertakes her role reluctantly and in her role as a teen ager it becomes more difficult to get the task done. Enter England's Anthony Burke, the Viscount Deering, and his irrepresible, delightful friend Preston. Both are involved in the diplomatic corp/agency. Burke receives a letter from alan pinkerton of the &quot;federal states&quot; warning that a female confederate agent is enroute to england and of course burke is assigned to uncover the &quot;spy&quot;.He thinks that Emily, the &quot;older&quot; and flirtatious sister, is the likely candidate but he is drawn to the very YOUNG &quot;Precious&quot;...which makes him very uncomfortable for he is the proper and honorable nobleman. Some of the cutest moments are when granny has her &quot;spells&quot; and becomes romeo's Juliet or cleopatra, etc. She always returns to reality as a wise and loving granny. The man in england who they are deceiving is Granny vivian's paramour from her youth......he is also the uncle to the real &quot;Precious&quot; whom he had never met...As I said at the outset, the plot is certainly different and it has elements of adventure, comedy, love and espionage. I  don't know why I didn't enjoy this book more. I think some events were too big a stretch. And for some reason I never really bonded with any of the characters. (Except Burke's rake friend, Preston, who was a charmer but had a small role.) As books go, this was an ok read, but definitely not a keeper for me.	2003-11-29

It takes awhile to gel.<BR>    Tara/s parents die leaving her penniless so she joins a wagon train heading to her cavalry brother's unit.

He has had a lifetime of being a &quot;halfbreed&quot; and being ostracized. But his worth lays in the exceptional scouting talent he has and the rich understanfing of both worlds he tries to live in.The frontier is new to Tara so she is naive about the dangers and problems that exist. But she sure toughens up. And she supports Zach in ways that make u want to stand up and cheer for her.<BR>(And becomes worthy of the name &quot;autumn dove&quot; )Zach walks a line of finding the bad guys...both white and indian.....and staying loyal to his beloved indian family and albeit few white friends. The officer in charge of the fort of course is an indian hater......and makes zach's job even more difficult. There are many wonderful characters in this book.

It is a keeper for many reasons. First enter the sassy northern girl who breaks rules and manages to get herself into awkward situations. Enter The Southern gentleman who has come to concord, mass for unknown reasons and happens to be there to pull lucinda out of a watery death. He nurses her to health but because of propriety (being alone with a man for 2 days and a southerner at that, mercy) they must remain public &quot;strangers&quot;&gt; Heath is in love at first sight with this northern spitfire (having been badly burnt by a simpering southern belle) but Lucy is engaged to an arrogant anti southern cold fish yankee. Of course Heath always causes a stir when he tries to mix in this society. There are so many threads to this story. Heath is a hunk who ultimately is attempting to imprvoe the situation bet the north and south during the 10 yrears of reconstruction. He fought for the south but is anti slavery. He sees the good and bad on both sides but mostly just sees the horror of the war and the loss of life. &quot;cin&quot; and heath have to work out the problems of their different worlds, society and history itself. There is not a boring moment in this page turner. Especially when the simpering belle turns up, and when cin is ostracized into marrying heath, and treated badly by her jerk financee.......The love scenes were wonderful and the issues were real..I loved this book. It's hard to find but its worth the bother. good job lisa k. thanks.	2003-11-24

The title led me to believe that this was a warm fuzzy book appropriate for the holidays. However the reviews set me straight and i decided to read it. I had not read the prequels to this so the characters were all new. The story line is aptly told in other reviews. This is an excellent story, certainly with a different plot, that is about friendship, love, and forgiveness. The hero......jack/will/wesley is a hunk by any name. His emotions bare his soul to us. Olivia is a &quot;spinster&quot; with an enormous amount of love to offer once she opens herself up to those possibilities. I wish ms miller would have made olivia a bit less spinsterish and perhaps not referred to her so often as being a prickly spinster.You could see the evolution happening but unfortunately the book ended too quickly. I am very glad I picked this one up and would read it again.......even in the summer.	2003-11-22

I enjoyed the &quot;luke&quot; story so went on to this one but was disappointed. Although some of the dialogue was cute, the story was sadly lacking.

This is a story of beautiful swan's watch, a family held plantation for 200 years. The children left to continue this heritage are Travis, lacy and mariette. Travis alternately loves the place and hates it. The only certainty is that he beds a slave (who he doesn't want to love) b.<BR>Mariette, the youngest, is  selfish, manipulative who I am happy to say eventually gets what she deserves. Lacy is our scarlett o'hara. She loves the land and is devoted to it and the people on it. A likeable, love character. Enter Travis, a man from the east, who is hard not to love. A strong, tender character. They fall in love but amid the many problems threatening the existence of the plantation, lacy has to choose between travis and swans watch...........and he loses. Eventually Travis returns to SW which he comes to love and they are happily together. Travis runs north to marry and live with his slave which in pre-civil war south was unheard of. Thisis pretty much a one night read. I can't rightly explain why I disliked it so much.....or why, waiting for it to get better, I even finished the book. As I said someone gave it a good review on another web site so it's 50-50 that you'll like it. Thisis my first book by this author so I don't have any further insight.	2003-11-18

If you read a lot as I do, you are always looking for a different approach. Henke does a great job here setting this story during the american revolution with 2 heros and 2 heroines and connecting it all masterfully. The Blackthorne cousins are Quinton and Devon. Quinton is the heir of a father who despises him, abuses him and taunts him. The father is loyal to the king and arranges a marriage for Quinton.(Quinton of course spies for the rebels partly to defy his father). Quinton has been taught to distrust women and this &quot;issue&quot; rules his life so he takes a bride reluctantly, believing that madelyn will be a seen and nor heard wife. Madelyn is a throw away child herself and desparately wants a home, family and love and turns out to be a  bit too spunky.....and honest..for quinton. (He doesn't treat her very well as he fights his attraction to her.) And she can hold her own with her dictatorial father in law.........Devon is like a brother to Quint but he is a half breed from his fathers second and unaccepted marriage with a muskogee woman. (There is the pre reqisite older brother and heir.) Devon was raised largely with his mothers relatives. Interesting how the line of succession in this tribe goes via the mother's side instead of the father. Devon is a charmer and a delight. He fights with the English because he feels his indian family will fare better under english rule. He is devastated when he learns that his cousin Quint is a traitor. Devon falls in love with a spoiled, noble brat who was sent to the colonies as punishement......her mother doesn't like her either!!! (There weren't any outstanding parents in this book!) Devon, of course, is totally persona non grata in her family. The stories of Quint and Madelyn and Devon and Lady Barabara intertwine throughtout the book. And the ladies become best friends and cohorts to save their men. There is no graphic war stuff and a little too much descriptive info on the indians for me BUT there's more than enough story to make this enjoyable.Theres also a lot of action, scheming women and villains to make it a page turner. I would read it again so it got a 5*.....Hope this is helpful.	2003-11-17

This is an incredibly real saga of a troubled young man, injured in the civl war and dis-owned by his &quot;father&quot; who heads west to prove himself. He meets an unwed mother traumatized by a rape that resulted in her beautiful son. On this short wagon train ride they fall in love. The book continues from then until years later when they are grandparents. It includes all the trials and tribulations of their relationship, their hardships, the children and the pioneering people in the west. This would be a better movie than &quot;giant&quot; (the liz taylor/james dean/rock hudson movie of this ilk). You have to fall in love with the whole family....and<BR>while there is sadness and angst  there is also enormous joy, humor, love and delightfulness. If u read one book this month, make it this one........Lettie's love of her family and faith will stay in your heart for a long time.	2003-11-12

The plot, as noted in other reviews, is the typical rich girl runaway and marriage of convenience scenario. What makes this book different is Caleb's history as a child and vulnerability, his devotion to these adorable children, the heart stealing 6 children and Elthia who is klutzy and inept beyond belief but has a heart of gold.

The book, as outlined above, started well. Then it got bogged down in detail and description and I wished it would end. BUT...the characters were good and likeable enough that I couldn't abandon the book as I wanted to know what the outcome was. And towards the end it picked up again. It is a very different plot with lots of twists and plenty of western action...more information about running a ranch than I needed. <BR>I didn't think the &quot;romance&quot; was in any way sensual physically but emotionally there was attachment. I think this book will appeal to some and be a disappointment to others. Or, as with me, some of both.	2003-11-06

This was a wonderful story and I'm pleased that I found it.<BR>His bride was a wonderful mate for him and his friend &quot;Cheyanne&quot; worthy of his own story. I didn't give it a 5 because when &quot;kora&quot; is kidnapped twice in 24 hrs it is a bit of a stretch.

Her Cynster series was incredible. She seems to breathe the era without deviation. This book however is both good and disappointing. The plot has been noted in other reviews. It's a good story line and its always wonderful to see her \\"men\\" group together for a cause such as finding this treasonous killer. The problem with the book is SEX! The scenes are well written and every woman would kill for a lover like Tony who is more concerned for \\"her\\" pleasure than his own.(This could be a how to manual for men). But of this 440 pages, I bet 200 of them are graphic descriptions of foreplay. After a couple weeks of that he escalates the foreplay to \\"fulfilling\\" Alicia......and still goes home unsated himself.This takes fiction to fantasy. When they finally settle into a mutually fulfilling liason, the love scenes are very sensual. Frankly by then I didn't like Tony very much. He was this arrogant noble who seemed to think he knew what was best for everyone and he was very controlling in the bedroom areas. It's one of those books that I'll keep but probably won't read again. It was getting ho-hum by the middle.<BR>And the ending didn't come soon enough for me.	2003-10-27

The characters of Jack Sloan and Suzanne Beannet were enjoyable. thier dialogue lively but the story itself was not. I kept reading, hoping it would get better, but it never did. Couldn't wait for it to end. Fortunately it did.<BR>I especially disliked the Ling Yi character and saw no purpose in that whole ling yi-matt relationship.

Although my first preference isn't western stories Jodi Thomas and Bobbi Smith are converting me quickly. What incredible writers!!I don't agree that the main theme in this book is about perseverence and overcoming obstacles. I think it is much more than that. It's about the joy of friendship and love and the devastation when you lose someone you love. It's about the importance of family and the virtues of honesty and integrity.It's also about being true to ourselves and fighting for what we want. It's about forcing yourself to go on when you've lost everything. It's about risking everything for another person who needs you. It seems like such a &quot;simple&quot; little frontier story but don't be fooled. This is excellent. The characters have such a rich depth that they become friends.I hated to see the book end. I also love the sense of humor that's interspersed. Life would be unbearable if we couldn't laugh at ourselves and or with others. One of my favorite scenes is when Kara and Jonathon have a heated quarrel. He finds her crying (and hugged ) by a girl who only speaks apache. Since he also speaks apache, Dawn gives him a dressing down in apache. Poor hunky Jonathon mumbles : &quot;You don't even understand a word she's saying and you're still on her side!!&quot;.

The stories were \\"cute\\", as when I was 15 reading the little 1\\" thick harlequin romances. The characters themselves were likeable. (Trace w/Bridget was a really nice, sexy guy) but the stories fell short in many ways. There was no depth of either the story or the characters and that was a real shame.

But....	each of them has some merit from my perspective. First, the plot itself was unique. It wasn't the same old regency stories we've read so often. The characters are wonderful. Dree was deceived by his snobby mother who thought Joanna was beneath his heritage and set out to break up the marraige, which she did. The whole book you hope Dree will not only catch on but &quot;reward&quot; his mother as she so richly deserves. That wasn't ever done in a way that vindicated Joanna or punished the dowager for the heartache she'd caused so many people. (a minus in my mind).<BR>But the author dealt wonderfully with the emotions of everyone<BR>involved and gave each character great depth. Jo and Dree's great love for each other permeates the story even if there is only one brief love scene. The children added a dimension that really made this special. I would have rated this a 5 except that the ending was too quick. I felt there should have at least been an epilogue....unless of course the author planned a sequel which I have never heard of. What became of the boys?  Were they ever told the truth? How did they react? Who inherited what? Did Johnny and charlotte marry? How did the evil mother in law get her come uppance in society ( I hope)......etc........There was enough left unanswered for an epilogue. I read Bittersweet by this author and it was wonderful so I know she is capable of a better ending.I don't understand the reviewer who said it left her feeling &quot;dismal&quot;...There were sad parts in the book and a lot of angst but I never found any of it dismal. In fact it had an enormous amount of affection, concern and humor in it also. <BR>But the reviews on this book as written above reflect how our individuality makes the world go round....(I fell asleep at phantom of the opera in toronto!!)	2003-10-20

Mason, our outlaw, had possibilities but not soon enough to keep me into the book. HOWEVER, discarding this book, let me go on to the &quot;lawman&quot;. This was absolutely delightful.

I read this book in one evening (stifling giggles at 5 a.m. so I wouldn't wake my sleeping hubby). It was funnier than all get out with a different plot, likeable characters and great dialogue. A pinkerton agent (gabriel winter) heads to a stage station in arizona to arrest a thief. Instead he encounters the alleged thief's high spirited, devoted, full of hell daughter who not only does not believe her papa's guilty but does everything she can contrive to prevent gabe from finding and arresting him. Gabriel is a &quot;facts&quot; and &quot;by the book&quot; lawman who doesn't &quot;believe&quot; in people so megan's loyalty is perplexing to him. Especially since her papa had stolen her hard saved nest egg<BR>and gone off to gamble it away already. Megan, at 28, is a tough on the outside, vulnerable on the inside gal who no one has ever loved....except her papa. And she will do anything to help him.<BR>The story is  simple and cute (although both characters eventually share their very traumatizing youth which gives you pause)but the predicaments Megan gets herself into and the craziness gabe goes through to undo her many plots is truly funny. I absolutely enjoyed every minute. I had started by reading lisa plumley's &quot;the outlaw&quot; and never finished it because I didn't care for it, but am so glad I gave this author a second chance. The lawman is plain fun. (oh, the one thing I hated.....which the authors have no say in, is that the guy on the cover doesn't look like gabe...don't you hate it when the publishers don't take an extra minute to at least match hair color with the characters!!!!) Perhaps if we mention it enough, some one will catch on...	2003-10-18

The fact that you see her vulnerability the entire time you are awed by her strength, perserverence and fortitude makes it an incredible experience for the reader.

At first glance, this might appear to be just &quot;another&quot; good book.But if you have the patience, this story unfolds into an incredible work of fiction. The hero, Zack, is &quot;the best spy the union has&quot; partially because as a former actor he can slip into disguises at a whim, literally losing himself in his many characterizations. Although recruited by Lincoln, Zack's tour of duty is in the midwest......where  you get a huge mix of civil war, western saga and indian folklore.  (More indian &quot;spirit&quot; and &quot;hidden&quot; lore than I cared for but the book was worth that side trip.) The heroine,&quot;cameo&quot; is incredibly strong and incredibly vulnerable. Just as you applaud her sassy strength,you feel so badly for the loneliness in her life. The scene where she gets drunk is a riot. Extremely well written.<BR>There is depth to the characters and real meaning to the written word. The secondary characters are very real and I could hope for a squel on &quot;cloud&quot; especially. But this is not a one day quickie read if you want to absorb all of that richness.<BR>Glad I read it and will probably read it again...I've never read this author before and understand she also writes as eve byron in case you want to check out her other books. Enjoy.	2003-09-28

This is a wonderful story about twins, separated at birth, who meet very accidentally. One is the ranger out to catch the outlaw! While that is formula, the rest of the story isn't. The<BR>emotions run high between nick and morgan, but the secondary characters,from spunky lori (to caroline, the pig,) are also full of life and add new dimensions. This book really has every emotion you can think of. And of course the characters grow and evolve. Potter is one of my favorite authors. This book is unique.	2003-09-25

Her steadfast heart/reckless heart triology is absolutely the best  of the best. Perhaps I expected too much. At any rate this wasn't vintage Goodman. The characters<BR>of &quot;mary&quot; and &quot;ryder&quot; are likeable enough as are the surrounding characters but the story line is dull and way over the top in descriptiveness. There's no reason for Ryder's behaviour (keeping mary in a cave/ marrying her, etc.......). I think it was just a quick attempt to finish the series off. The writer herself says she hadn't planned on a story about this sister. Hope you enjoy it more than I did.......	2003-09-22

The storyline is great and the characters are rich, likeable and<BR>enjoyable. But this book separates itself from other &quot;westerns&quot;<BR>with the humor. The twins Becky and Jenny(and their dolls bibbie and bonnie) are a riot. The stuff they do to their governesses is histerical yet believable.You want to reach out and hug them. Maybe being a grandma makes it more real for me but I just loved them. They fit well into the story. In fact the storyline works around them. Jared's growth from the sour, self centered soldier to the tender doting daddy and the evolution of his romance with kitty warms the heart. And Kitty is the spunkiest heroine you'll see. A real MacKenzie gal......This book was much more enjoyable than I expected.	2003-09-15

Probably the best book I've ever read (at least in the top 10) is outlaw hearts. It was wonderful. Love's Bounty is not only a disappointment but a travesty. A powerful, rich, highly educated harvard)32 yr old man finds his wife and daughter murdered so goes west and becomes a bounty hunter. His name is \\"Christian Mercy\\". Duh. He meets an 18yr old,hick talking, uneducated, poor , small town girl who hires him to find the men who murdered and raped her mother. On their travels they fall in love. Even the sex scenes do not exemply bittner's level of writing and tenderness. \\"The first time you have sex you hurt like hell but you keep having sex and it gets better\\". Having a baby \\"is like the first time u have sex....it hurts like hell\\"......What kind of dialogue is this? What a waste. This was definitely a \\"tosser\\" not a keeper.	2003-09-15

Bittner is the western-civil war-frontier diva. No one does it better. Her characters are so real. They are filled with all of the emotions the human soul can have. This 500 pages held me in constant thrall. The uniqueness is the depth of the characters, especially jake. He is tormented and his despair leads him into a horrible and unhappy life. Enter Miranda, who is almost too good to be true. Although this is not about religion, the depth of her belief in Jake and her belief that God will indeed help him is inspiring. It's a story that brings real hope and an awareness that we are each responsibile for what we make of our lives. That we can bring about change and that forgiveness and love are the most important gifts we can be given..And that unless we intervene, mistakes will repeat themselves. If you only read one book a year.......make it this one........thank you Roseanne . You are a gifted, compassionate writer.	2003-09-10

The plot is reviewed thoroughly and very well above. It's a book where you find yourself smiling a lot......not much angst, but enough hardship to make it interesting. I only gave it a 4 because the love scenes between luke and Honey are not only few but over quickly. Getting together has taken such emotional thoughts, etc.. I thought their time together should be more tender and meaningful. Also there were a few things that I thought weren't quite believable. I loved the interaction with little Josh and the dog and the &quot;family&quot; stuff, and Dr. Doug should have a book of his own. Anyhow, read it, you'll enjoy it. AB	2003-09-06

I read \\"Embers of the Heart\\" first being drawn to it because no one writes books in the civil war genre like Rosanne Bittner! As I expected, it was outstanding. (see my review at that site.) I wasn't interested in this \\"sequel\\" \\"Montana Woman\\" for the obvious illusion the title gives of this \\"macho\\" woman, or \\"mountain woman\\" For whatever reason I decided to read it anyway and although it was totally different from EOfTheH story in both characters and plot, it was excellent. I wish I had read this one first because the Embers book fits better after it although they do stand independently. Our heroine, Jo Masters, is a fiesty female, emotionally and physically very strong yet  attractive and appealing. The vision of this petite gal \\"pushing oxen\\" along is a riot but it works. The respect and friendships she develops with the people esp the men in the book is wonderful. No object of hanky panky or stay in the kitchen stuff here. The hero is tormented and he actually needs her healing friendship more than anything. A minimum of [physical] scenes but a maximum of friendships, affection, bonding, human behavior and relationships.. We've always known the pioneers in our country must have been strong and this reflects that. This book even puts things into perspective about the indian/ white man relationships. I usually skip descriptive stuff..A sky can only be so blue, a tree only so green, etc...but Bittner's writing is so incredible that in this book you \\"see\\" and feel the beauty of the west as the trek cross country reflects the changing landscape and the inherent problems. You rejoice in Jo's love of animals and her pain of parting with them to survive. If you want a fast, enjoyable love story with warm fuzzies for a rainy afternoon this isn't it. But if you want a really good book that shows people at their worst and their best,and gives you new insights in the process,  this is awesome..I can't recommend it highly enough. And then go for \\"Embers\\", it has angst too but the love story has more warm fuzzies. Enjoy.	2003-09-04

This story has a great plot (kind of a southern post civil war robin hood) so had enormous potential. Unfortunately the writing doesn't live up to the story line. It's very slow moving and sometimes confusing ( as noted in the above review.) The Thorn and Ransom are the same person and we are supposed to know it but it takes awhile to figure that out. That is an important part to this story. Lettie goes south to avenge her union brother's death supposedly by the &quot;thorn&quot;. She gets an entirely new perspective on the south and this is one great thing about this book. It shows that not everyone sat on the porch getting fanned drinking mint juleps in the south's glory days!!! It also reflects southern hospitality even in the face of defeat. The Thorn is trying to correct injustices to help his fellow southerners survive the reconstruction era. The beauracracy, as portrayed in this book, was evidently grave cause for the miscarriage of justice in the defeated south. It becomes clear in this story that the enitre war bet the states was a huge power struggle by greedy men in the north and the south. This &quot;potentially great story&quot; was too slow paced and bogged down by unclear writing to do it justice. Ironically, another miscarriage of justice for we, the readers. Sorry JB. By the way the JB book Tender Betrayal rates at least 6*. You may want to try that one instead.	2003-08-30

Westerns aren't my favorite read but Bobbi Smith has me nearly<BR>converted. This book opens with the undercover pinkerton man trying to round up a vicious gang. While playing the role he tries to keep harm from befalling &quot;citizens&quot; but in one instance he's unable to. The man is killed. Our hero is subsequently charged with his murder and is in a quandry. Does he give up his cover and forgo his mission or hang! Well he decides to trust the sheriff who doesn't believe him anyway. The judge happens to be the dead man's daughter and she has met our &quot;outlaw&quot; once before and been attracted to him. Of course she fights between the integrity of her job, the justice due her father and this outlaw she is coming to love. The sheriff is a wonderful. The Pinkerton &quot;boss&quot; comes to town to save his partner and he's a hunk. The entire book is filled with action, great characters, angst and a believable story line.

Alyssa and Slade are meant for each other but the side characters in this story leave me with the feeling that there should be at least 2 sequels......Slade's friend Ken and the sheriff Rob both deserve stories of thier own.

Then we get into will he recover, who will find out what, is her marriage bigamous, etc....It is an epic of the tragedy of the civil war, and the hatred and viciousness that went on for years afterwards, and what that did to the men and women of that era...This is an excellent book. (If it has any flaw, I think the noble, virtuos Anna belabors the fact that she must be romantically loyal to darryl even after she knows he's become evil.)But that's easily overlooked in a book that is otherwise excellent. enjoy.	2003-08-16

I have never read anything like this series. It's &quot;steel magnolias&quot; for men, an incredibly rich series about tough, hunky men and their friendship. It deals with their emotions and vulnerability and of course the tough veneer we have to always get through. &quot;Reese&quot; the first book was definitely about the guys relationship. It is undoubtedly the best of the series and if read first sets the stage for all the guys. You will love each of them. I then read &quot;Nate&quot; who is the lost soul. Tormented by the memories of the civil war, he is surviving amidst this male circle and is &quot;saved&quot; by a fiesty female who won't let him give up. Alot of angst in this one. It's excellent. &quot;Sullivan&quot; is the &quot;uncivilized&quot; halfbreed. The strong, silent type who doesn't belong in either world or so he thinks. This book is pure delight. Very different from the other two books. Very little reference to the war with some focus on the tight friendships but much more a love story. Eden is perfect for &quot;Sin&quot;. And you can watch her melt the other tough guys down while she's at it. I also read &quot;Cash&quot; which tied the series up well. He's the coldblooded gunslinger. I liked the book but couldn't warm up to him as much as the others.

Gabrielle and Celeste St. Claire are spoiled southern (louisiana) belles.The older sister Celeste is jealous of the  adored and naive Gabrielle. The story starts with Gabrielle sneaking a &quot;love letter&quot; to Celeste's not so loyal to the south boyfriend Rubin. Gabrielle eventually gets caught as a &quot;spy&quot; and is taken to Texas in exile by her uncle's close friend and reb colleague, cade montana. There are many twists in this plot starting with trying to prove Gabrielle is innocent of the charges; the terrible treatment she gets from southerners who believe the charges; the war itself; the attraction between the earthy Cade Montana and the new orleans brat;nd the evolution of an incredible life changing love. The loves scenes are wonderful but I wouldn't call this a simple love story at all. It's much more complex. At time Gabrielle is a whiny brat and you want to shake her but you have to love Cade from the very beginning. He's the Rhett Butler with his hand on the bannister looking at this apparition, ruggedly protecting her and forcing her to face life.

The story line is well defined by the other reviews. The 3 brother in this saga are each so very different and likeable in their own right but the delightful and unusual aspect that comes thru loud and clear with each of them is there love and loyalty to each other and the integrity with which they serve their beliefs. The heroines are also very unique in personality but somehow they each find the right Gentry brother. I rated (the books) Rafe 3, Jess 4 and Sam a 5-6 easily.The last chapter when they each reunite is so beautifully written you can feel the emotion. It &quot;tied&quot; up the stories perfectly.

The &quot;Outlaw&quot; trilogy is wonderful from several perspectives. First, the relationship between the brothers surpasses love and incorporates integrity and loyalty to each other and to the people they care about. Each of the brothers is unique as are the heroines, who somehow find the &quot;right&quot; Gentry brother. The love scenes are excellent and tasteful. Of the 3 books<BR>.Rafe-Jess and Sam.. I think Sam is the utmost, unquestionable best. In fact I rate Rafe as 3, Jess as 4 and Sam as 5-6*. Of course Sam has the reunion chapter, brief though it is and that is totally unique. But this review is about Jess. Jess is the nicest guy in the world.  A hunk, a healer, a vulnerable man and just too sweet to be an outlaw even by mistake! Meg, his bounty hunter counterpart, is much more dangerous and could easily be on a wanted poster!! She's a hellion but really likeable. This is a good read and enjoyable but please read Sam when you're done with this one!!!!!!!Great job, connie.	2003-08-08

Planning to be married unfortunately does not coincide with Roxy's father. So, he leads Tanner to believe that Roxy is &quot;playing&quot; him...and like an 18 yr old hothead, hurt beyond belief, he leaves his ranch to a friend and joins the civil war's Sherman. This is all the intro chapter and you then join the characters 7 yrs later when Tanner, still angry with Roxy, returns home to find her the mother of a (surprise) 7 yr old boy, and unwed. The entire middle of the book deals with Roxy and Tanner tiptoe-ing around each other, even falling into bed together, yet neither of them courageous enough to address the past. It is this middle part that gets bogged down and tedious. You want to shake them to grow up and TALK... Can't Tanner add 7 yr old to 7 yr absence and figure it out? Apparently not. There also are other potentially interesting characters that could have been explored more. Michelle wouldn't give &quot;Ace&quot; the time of day and a few pages later they've hit the sack and are planning a wedding. Christy and her hub are without children, and fear being left childless, then suddenly are pregnant and thats the last you hear of them.........Then there's the villin's selfish daughter, who it is strongly implied &quot;doesn't like men&quot; and runs off to join her girlfriend......but what's the scoop? Why did she feel forced to trap tanner when she couldn't stand his touch? And the list goes on of characters who started to come to life but didn't get their day in the sun. The &quot;ending&quot; when Tanner learns about his son Jory is a one page cut-to-the chase ending. It leaves you wanting more emotional reaction to the whole thing.<BR>This book has enough in it to have been excellent and to have provided a basis for sequels. I am so sorry Norah Hess missed the boat. (At least I've learned about steers being sterile thanks to the writer above....)	2003-07-22

The Rock Creek 6 is an innovative literary undertaking. It's about 6 soldiers in a special civil war unit, all of whom have emotional scars that they must heal. Lori Handeland wrote 3 books incl.the Nate and Reese stories; Linda Devlin wrote 3 incl the finale hero, Daniel Cash. I liked the story line LD chose for Cash, but I never quite got to like Cash himself. He was less authentic and less reachable than the other rock creek heros. In fairness to Cash, I prefer LH's writing style over LD's which could be part of my problem with the book. At any rate it is wonderful to see these 6 tougher than tough men governed by loving wives and babies all around them. Truly heartwarming.	2003-07-16

Like others I waited patiently for \\"Temple's\\" story to arrive. I am 3/4th of the way through this book and It is one of the worse books I've ever read. The story line is ridiculous. A beautiful heiress sits idly by for 10 yrs waiting for a man who kissed her once to realize he loves her. In the meantime she plots to force him to come to her aid by dating 3 \\"loser\\" candidates for her hand. The hero is an English spy superhero, incognito of course, but can't see through her plots and isn't bright enough to manage his own life!! He's also unable to control any of her staged outragious. Pure drivel.  My biggest regret is that I kept reading this book, waiting for it to get better. That was a lost cause. It seemed that Temple's story would be an awesome one.

In 1997 when VT wrote this book, it was on the cutting edge of an important problem in society called \\"date rape\\". To write about it so poignantly and insightfully yet incorporate that within the context of the civil war era took great talent and research. The story is very good, the characters well defined, and the problems of that era very apt..I only gave this a 3 because I save 4*-5* for books I would re read..Although I am glad to have read this and it certainly held my interest I probably wouldn't read it over.The one thing that <BR>I disliked about it was that Lori, the heroine who was raped by the hero's (Adam) vindictive/sadisitic brother(Eric)is described often as poor white trash, \\"beneath\\" the hero's sociol strata. The fact that the hero has been interested in Lori all of his life does soften the characterization somewhat. In reality, Eric would have raped any woman that his brother was interested in out of spite whether she was rich or poor so that rape had nothing to do with economic issues anyway.Ther hero was a good man, very patient and likeable...and perplexed as to how to help Lori heal from this trauma. Good job, VH. Thanks for giving us all insight into the emotions of a rape victim with the context of a love story.	2003-07-05

In his search for them, he runs into the widow of a man whose life he saved and who needs his help but refuses to accept his help.

I hadn't read Jo Goodman until I recently read \\"Tempting Torment\\". I loved Noah's story and finding it was the last of a trilogy about 3 brothers eagerly hit the net to find the first 2 books. (When you hate to see a good book end, it's great to find it is a series!!) So I found Steadfast Heart and curled up. It didn't take me long to find out that SH was the first of a trilogy of 3 other Goodman brothers....whoops.....but I fell in love with Colin, the hero, on the first page and never put the book down.(And am now starting sequel Reckless Heart). Jo Goodman has outdone herself with this one and Colin's story is not only a keeper but is spectacular. It's not a boy meets girl kiss kiss book. There's a real story with multiple factions that are all relevent and could be stories of their own. It's about the hearbreak of being orphaned and torn from his baby brothers, of commitment in trying to find them, of compassion in trying to help Mercedes and her family, and of the evolution of dealing with all those human emotion. A love story, murder mystery, emotional journey that will bring tears and giggles......Don't miss this one. It's a book that I read fast to find out what was going to happen and yet dreaded getting to the end. I'm sure a re-read is in its future for me, but first I have to \\"find\\" Decker and Greydon....Jo, you have my admiration for your talent and a new follower.Thanks.	2003-04-12

I keep extra copies around just to loan out. And I keep waiting for another good book from her and have been disappointed. But I keep hoping, so I eagerly bought this hardcopy hot off the press. I've read 100 pages and still don't know what its about. A real waste of money. Thanks for Shanna BUT Sayonara, Kathleen.	2003-03-25

Linda Ladd writes a wonderful story line with great detail and handsome heroes. Of the triology (white lily, white rose, white orchid) I enjoyed this one the best. It was good enough that I went in search of the first (lily) and the final one (orchid). Surprising the 3 books have the same characters interwoven but the story line is quite different. I think her strength is her endings as the story line gets stronger as it goes along. Anyhow I recommend this one if you want a great civil war era read.	2002-08-28
1426629:US	41521760	RSHLEX5EG2T9	0451403630	602068916	White Lily	Books	3	0	0	N	N	This first book of the white flower triology was the weakest	but it may be because I read &quot;white Rose&quot; first and really enjoyed it. It's a hard act to follow. The white lily story line is about a heroine who is clairvoyant and although it is set in the civil war era and her &quot;gift&quot; is used to help the war effort, I don't esp enjoy clairvoyance as a storyline. The hero was wonderful and the writing as always was excellent and in all fairness, the story line got stronger as it went along.. You may enjoy it more than I did but if not, search out &quot;white Rose&quot;. .	2002-08-28

Great characters, wonderful civil war history and a romance between delightfully enjoyable characters. Really enjoyed it.

Stobie Piel followed up her wonderful saga of confederate Jerod Knox and Pippa, with this incredibly written story of yankee cousin Garrett and &quot;watkins&quot;. Great romance, great action, great history and characters with a sense of humor. I've just finished it and know I'll re read it again soon. I am into &quot;civil war&quot; historicals and to that end have ordered and read a hundred to date and this is one of my all time favorites. (Jarod's story is also a good read and a keeper.) enjoy....and thanks Stobie. Great job.	2002-07-18
