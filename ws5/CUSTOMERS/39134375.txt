Williams-Sonoma's `Kitchen Companion' is at least as good or better than books I have seen from similar commercial enterprises such as Home Depot and Smith and Hawken. The stated object of the book is to make up for the fact that fewer and fewer people learn how to cook at their mother's (or grandmother's) apron strings.<br /><br />While the subtitle, `The A to Z Guide to Everyday Cooking Equipment & Ingredients' gives the impression of a dictionary approach, the straight alphabetical organization is compromised by a second objective to make the book interesting to pick up and read in your armchair instead of simply being a reference when you want to noodle your way through an unfamiliar recipe, tool, or ingredient. Thus, the book is organized much more like an encyclopedia with big articles on group subjects. Thus, instead of thirty (30) articles on individual herbs, there is one article on `Herbs' covering all common varieties.<br /><br />I have mixed feelings about this organization, so it is important enough to point this out for your consideration.<br /><br />As far as the quality of the material in the articles, I believe it is very high, although just a bit conventional now and then. For example, the article on microwave ovens says everything you would expect it to say, including the warning that when you double the volume of food, cooking time will also double. What it does not say is how inconvenient it is to use a microwave oven for certain tasks and how careful you have to be with your timing. Similarly, the article on how to make an omelet covers all the basics and firmly distinguishes the omelet from scrambled eggs or any other egg dish, and provides reasonably good diagrams, albeit a bit small and hard on the eyes. On the other hand, the article on the omelet covers much less than many good treatments I have seen.<br /><br />In considering whether to buy this book, you must ask `For what information would I go to this book before going to `Larousse Gastronomique', `The Joy of Cooking', or Shirley Corriher's `Cookwise'? Of course, if you have none of these books, you will go to what you have. And, as a standin for these other books, this one is pretty good, especially for the relatively low list price.<br /><br />If you have no other general cooking references and you are new to cooking, this may be one of the two or three best books to get. If you already own twenty cookbooks and have been cooking for at least a few years, you may want to pass on this, as I would if I were not reviewing it.<br /><br />The book has a decent bibliography, but I think it would have been far, far better to have put references to other books at the end of each individual article. Then, this book would have been a uniquely valuable encyclopedia, extending our horizons far beyond its covers.tronomique', `The Joy of Cooking', or Shirley Corriher's `Cookwise'?

Not gospel thought	`The Cook's Bible' by `Cook's Illustrated' founder and editor in chief, Christopher Kimball is a terrific culinary read, based on the unusual collection of subjects and opinions on a truly wide range of culinary topics. In many ways, the book reads very much like any one of a dozen `Cooks Illustrated' cookbooks, assembled from related articles from their magazine. The main difference is that the focus here is much more on equipment and techniques than on specific recipes.<br /><br />One has to wonder what entitles the author to call this a `Bible'. What comes to mind is that this is a complete source of informantion and it's advice is simply beyond question. Unfortunately, the charm and interest one has in this book has nothing to do with either completeness or authoritativeness. While it is accurate on many, many things, it's word is not `gospel'!<br /><br />The interest in reading this book comes mostly from the charm, wit, and good humor of the author's writing. I get the sense of reading a culinary Garrison Keillor in very much the same way I get that sense when I read James Peterson's books or even Julia Child's early books. You don't get the same bald humor that you see in Alton Brown's books, but the details of the culinary advice is as good or better than Alton Brown's recipes; however, Kimball's advice on cooking equipment is not as good as in Alton Brown's `Gear for Your Kitchen'. This is not because Brown's insights are deeper, it's because he focuses on laying out what it is you should do to evaluate what works best for you in the world of kitchen gear, and deals in general principles rather than on a magazine staff's notions of whats good and what's not. For example, while Kimball recommends Wustoff knives over all other makes, a recent `Consumer's Report' article rates Henkels knives above all others, including Wustoff. Now I am certain `Cook's Illustrated' has a better handle on what makes a good chef's knive, but this shows how different people see things differently. Another weakness of Kimball's equipment evaluations is that there is always the risk that one or more models on his evaluations will be discontinued.<br /><br />One reason I enjoy reading Kimball so much, both in this book and in his `Cooks Illustrated' editorial pages is that it is such great fun to disagree with him on some points. For example, his very first sentence in the introduction states that there is little in common between gourmet cooking and home cooking (and Kimball's aim is to talk about home cooking). I argue that there is less difference between my cooking and that of Tom Colicchio and Alfred Portale than there is between the average weekend golfer and Tiger Woods. I use the same techniques, the same equipment, and very nearly the same quality of ingredients. Acting on Kimball's premise can lead to major mistakes, such as what I saw in the new Culinary Institute of America book on `Breakfasts and Brunches' where scrambled eggs and omelets are pictured as being only small variations on the same technique. Kimball, on the other hand, correctly treats omelets and scrambled eggs as two different techniques, even thought they start with virtually identical ingredients.<br /><br />Like James Peterson, Kimball has a very commonsensical approach to things, which means he is much more inclined to see things for what they are. My favorite example is his take on the microwave. While it is certainly fast for certain jobs, this speed is actually a liability when it comes to many other jobs, as it means the margin between good results and a disaster is that much smaller. And, it is a technique which is highly variable by the amount of food put into the box. When one potato can take 8 minutes, two potatoes can take 15. This would not be true in a conventional oven or in boiling water. Another problem with the microwave is that checking on things and adding ingredients is a real nuisance, especially when the cooking vessel gets very hot. This down to earth approach will also reveal, now and then, some very counterintuitive facts about cooking methods. I know it is very hard to believe this, but Kimball explains, with practically no Alton Brown style handwaving, how and why a braised piece of meat (cooked for a long time half covered with liquid), will actually come out dryer than with some other methods if the cooking is done at too high a temperature.<br /><br />Next to the extremely commonsensical approach to things, I really like Kimball's diagrams on how to do certain tasks. They are a model of how to effectively picture a procedure so the reader will understand what it is you are telling them.<br /><br />Looking at the Table of Contents for this book reveals a really unusual collection of subjects. While there are recipes aplenty, the real focus is on general techniques and how to put them to best use. Several chapters really put a lie to the `home cooking' versus `gourmet cooking' difference, if one equates `gourmet' cooking with the kind of cooking done at Caf&eacute; Boulud Mario Batali's Babbo. These chapters show you how to improvise things such as soups, salads, dried beans, boning and butchering, and stuffing. My experience is that most home cooking is done with one eye on the open book, magazine, newspaper, or internet download with the recipe for your dish. Professional cooking, on the other hand, is often done by what's available that day (See Tom Colicchio's `How to Think Like a Chef').<br /><br />This book is a great read and a great culinary education, even if you never make any recipes from it.

Like those before it on `Cooking at Home', `Book of Soups', and `Gourmet Meals in Minutes', but unlike their more professional volumes such as `Baking and Pastry', this volume is very good for the home cook, but it has a few lapses here and there which make it less than perfect as a manual for teaching the very best cooking technique.<br /><br />The first thing which surprises me about the book is the subtitle which proclaims that the volume contains `Over 175 New Recipes...'. If I am to buy just one book on cooking breakfast dishes, I don't want novelty; I want the very best standard recipes and techniques. On looking at the specific recipes, I find that there is novelty, but the book does cover the expected bases of breakfast cookery. I can only find one breakfast dish missing, and this is scrapple, which is pretty specialized to the Pennsylvania Dutch / Southeastern Pennsylvania / Greater Philadelphia area.<br /><br />The primary chapters are:<br /><br />Breakfast & Brunch Mise en Place - I find this chapter just a bit unnecessary or incomplete. It is unnecessary in that much of its contents are repeated in more detail in later chapters on various dishes. It is incomplete in that it gives pantry shelf-lives of a large variety of foodstuffs, but in a narrative form. It would have been much better to focus this chapter on neat, tabular information, and leave all the narrative to the detailed recipes. I also think the term `mise en place' is misused here. `Pantry Stocking' would have been a better name.<br /><br />Breakfast & Brunch Drinks - Very nice collection of recipes and advice on making coffee, tea, chai, eggnog, cocktails and smoothies.<br /><br />Muffins, Quick Breads & Coffee Cakes - Six muffin recipes, eight breakfast cake recipes, eight quickbreads (biscuits, scones, soda bread), plus funnel cake, lemon curd, and cornbread.<br /><br />Sweet and Savory Breads & Pastries - The sticky stuff and recipes with yeast. A very nice variety of recipes which tend to be more complicated than the quickbreads, and the authors tell you when the recipe may be difficult.<br /><br />Pancakes, Waffles, & Crepes. Of course, you expect this chapter. It includes several different flavors of pancakes; including blinis and many different fruit fillings for crepes. I am surprised that there is but one recipe for French toast, as this is a dish with many variations. I'm also surprised there is not more exposition on tips for making waffles.<br /><br />Eggs. Another obvious category with all the usual suspects, such as fried eggs, scrambled eggs, egg and sausage sandwiches, omelets, frittatas, poached eggs, quiches, egg salads, and soft boiled eggs.<br /><br />Grains & Legumes. Grits, polenta, and cold cereals, oh my! The usual characters include oatmeal, cream of wheat, kasha, rice, couscous, muesli, granola, bean salads and spreads.<br /><br />Meats, Fish & Potatoes. This may seem like an odd combination with potatoes in the same chapter as meats, but both types of dishes often play second banana to the eggs, pancakes, and cereals. Ham, sausage, and breakfast steaks are here, with several chicken dishes, hash browns, O'Brien Potatoes, Potato pancakes, Lyonnaise Potatoes, Rosti potatoes, and corned beef hash.<br /><br />Soups, Salads, & Small Bites. These items are more appropriate for brunch than for breakfast, especially as they are mostly cold soups and salads, plus `tea sandwiches' great for brunch buffets.<br /><br />The appeal of this book depends a lot on how big your cookbook library is now. If you are just starting out, filling your shelves exclusively with CIA books would not be a bad idea, just as you could accomplish the same result by concentrating exclusively on `Martha Stewart Living', `Cooks Illustrated', or `Better Homes and Gardens' books. And, a CIA collection is likely tobe more focused than what you get from magazine collections.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you already have one or more `comprehensive' cookbooks such as the `Joy of Cooking' or `James Beard's American Cookery', and you are not into collecting cookbooks, this volume may be less useful. This is certainly less valuable if you have a breakfast cookbook such as Marian Cunningham's `The Breakfast Book' or `Mollie Katzen's Sunlight Caf&eacute;' or even a good bread or biscuit book such as James Villas' `Biscuit Bliss'.<br /><br />I would recommend this book even if you already owned all these titles IF this book were more highly focused on breakfast dishes, with more variety within egg and cereal dishes and less attention to soups, sandwiches, and drinks. I also found some odd lapses in this book. The most unusual is their treatment of scrambled eggs and omelets. To a person, every authority I read on the subject says these are two different dishes, yet this book from an authoritative source simply says that an omelet is scrambled eggs left to solidify in a circle rather than smushed up into mounds of eggy goodness. I also find sections on several other central recipes such as granola and French toast to be much too simple. Nothing is said about the details of how long one should soak the bread in the batter for French toast. Nothing is also said about baking your granola mix. On the other hand, the biscuit recipe is half again more complicated than you need for simple buttermilk biscuits. My favorite Nick Malgieri biscuit can be done in half the time.<br /><br />This is a good book which has lots of useful recipes, but you may not need it unless you happen to do a lot of breakfast and brunch entertaining, and don't have a good source for basic recipes. Contrary to the CIA source, it is NOT an authoritative text on how to do important breakfast dishes.collection is likely to be more focused than what you get from magazine collections.  <br /> <br />On the other hand, if you already have one or more `comprehensive' cookbooks such as the `Joy of Cooking' or `James Beard's American Cookery', and you are not into collecting cookbooks, this volume may be less useful.

Buy It!	`English Bread and Yeast Cookery' by Elizabeth David hides, behind its very unassuming title, one of the very best books on bread baking I have seen and possibly Elizabeth David's very best work, in a body of work which includes some of the great classics in culinary writing from the last 60 years.<br /><br />For starters, the book is much more than a collection of English bread baking recipes. In the 592 pages in this edition, bread recipes don't even start until page 255. The first half of the book deals with just about everything you ever wanted to know about how residents of the British Isles, beginning with the pre-Roman Celts ground wheat into flour, what kind of ovens they used to bake bread, and how all this evolved through the Roman occupation, the Saxons, the Normans, and the modern English, especially how things changed with the industrial revolution.<br /><br />The first part, nearly half the book covers `History and Background' with chapters on:<br /><br />Grains, Wheat, Rye, Barley, Oats, and Pease<br /><br />Milling<br /><br />Flours and Meals<br /><br />Yeast<br /><br />Salt<br /><br />Liquids and Fats<br /><br />Eggs, Dried Fruit, Sugar, Spices and Flavorings<br /><br />Malt Extracts<br /><br />Bread Ovens<br /><br />The Bread Factories<br /><br />Shapes and Names of English Loaves<br /><br />Moulds and Tins for Bread<br /><br />Storage of Meal and Flour<br /><br />Storage of Bread<br /><br />Weights of Loaves and the Assize of Bread<br /><br />Weights, Measures and Temperatures<br /><br />Weighing and Measuring Equipment<br /><br />The Cost of Baking Your Own Bread<br /><br />It should be evident from this list of chapters that the material in this book goes far beyond bread baking on a largish island in the North Atlantic. The analysis in the last of these chapters alone may be worth the price of admission. What is doubly surprising is that these chapters include material which seems more at home in a book like Rachael Carson's `Silent Spring' than a book on bread recipes. This is a bit less surprising when we realize the book was written in the 1970s, not too far removed from food rationing left over from World War II and before the widespread popular concern in England with the nutritious value of food.<br /><br />The second half of the book, the recipes, clearly also goes beyond what you would expect from the average English tea room. The chapters here are:<br /><br />Bread<br /><br />Baps and Rolls<br /><br />Manchets and Mayn and Payndemayn<br /><br />Crumpets and Muffins<br /><br />Notes on French Bread<br /><br />The Pizza and the Pissaladiere<br /><br />Quiches with Yeast Dough<br /><br />Sausage in Brioche Crust<br /><br />Yeast Leavened Pancakes and Oatcakes<br /><br />Dumplings and Doughnuts<br /><br />Regional and Festival Cakes and Fruit Breads<br /><br />Yeast Buns and Small Tea Cakes<br /><br />French Yeast Cakes<br /><br />Soda Breads<br /><br />Bakestone Cakes or Breads<br /><br />Toast<br /><br />Since there is a chapter on Soda Breads, it is evident that the book covers more than just yeast breads. The yeasted pancakes also highlights the fact that our modern baking powder leavened hotcakes are a relatively new invention, as baking powder was not commercially available until the middle of the 19th century. Yeast, on the other hand, has been around and used in beer making since prehistoric times. And, with just a little technique, it was free for the asking from ambient spores in the air.<br /><br />In case you are curious, a bap is the breakfast roll of Scotland and manchets and mayn and payndemayn are old English names (found in the `Canterbury Tales' and other old documents) for enriched white breads baked for and eaten by wealthier classes.<br /><br />If you are a serious foodie, a serious amateur or professional bread baker, or simply seriously, or even frivolously interested in bread, you must get a copy of this book. Even if you don't read it from cover to cover, it's a great reference on the history, science and technique of breadbaking. It's only weakness may be that it is not as up to date on modern American bread ingredients as you may find in a King Arthur cookbook or `bible' from Rose Levy Beranbaum. But then, there are hundreds of pages of material you will find here and virtually nowhere else in an in print book.<br /><br />Very highly recommended!!!dients as you may find in a King Arthur cookbook or `bible' from Rose Levy Beranbaum.

Bsisu, a native of Kuwait, the wife of a Palestinian (and resident of Lebanon for several years) and current resident of Cincinnati is a personal account of Arab cooking, based less on scholarship than on her experiences and experiences of her family and close friends. That is, the title is just a bit misleading if it gives the impression that it is a systematic study of Arab cuisine. It is much more like Suzanne Dunaway's `Rome at Home' or Mario Batali's `Recipes from My Two Villages' than it is a study such as Paula Wolfert's books or Claudia Roden's `The New Book of Middle Eastern Food'<br /><br />One minor caveat I may mention is that Ms. Bsisu is remarkably candid about the amount of help she got in putting this book together. One gets the feeling that the only thing she wrote herself is the recipe headnotes and an outline of the recipes. Credit for almost everything else is given to co-authors, copy editors, and recipe testers. That means that I will be cautious before buying any other titles by Ms. Bsisu, as her work is much more the work of a committee than a single person.<br /><br />I am really happy to see a book on this subject being published by a major American house, as just about any information on the Arab culture leaking out to the American hinterland will repair the damage done by recent terrorists. I do feel the author is just a bit too focused on her ethnic good points when she praises Arab hospitality, suggesting that maybe other ethnic groups are just a bit less friendly. One can read very similar comments about the Italians, the Greeks, the Mexicans, the Spanish, and the Amish, just to name a few.<br /><br />One thing which immediately strikes me about many of these recipes is how similar they are to Greek cooking. Yoghurt, olive oil, lemons, flatbreads, lamb, spinach, eggs, eggplant, kebabs, and chickpeas are all straight out of the Greek cuisine. The Greek, Turkish, and Arab cuisines even share the same Mezes traditions, although the Arabs would generally take their snacks with coffee rather than with wine. One thing that this similarity helps is the fact that Greek raw materials are so easy to find in the United States, at least in major metropolitan centers. One can easily convert conventional yoghurt into `Mediterranean style' yoghurt. One only needs to find a source for sumac, a pepper-like spice with a lemony taste that is unique to Middle-eastern cooking.<br /><br />The one application for which this book is really superb is as a cookbook for an Arab family living in the United States or other English speaking country, and who does not have a strong Arab culinary tradition of their own on which to fall back. The Arabic name is given for every dish, and most of those names are unfamiliar to me except for the obvious such as Taboulleh.<br /><br />My Mediterranean culinary scholarship may not be as good as it should be, but I have some suspicion that some dishes in this book are not truly Arab, even if they have Arab names. My greatest suspicion falls on those dishes from Morocco. Even though Morocco has been an Islamic culture for close to 1300 years, I think the natives of the Madgreb are more Berber than Arab. Otherwise, most of the dishes seem to come from Kuwait, Lebanon, and Palestine. There is some Egyptian influence from the Sinai, but this isn't Arab either.<br /><br />One thing that makes this an excellent book for the amateur, especially the amateur with an Arab background is that there is a very nice balance of easy and complicated recipes, including several very good recipes for Arab flatbreads. And, the recipes are well written, giving a substantial amount of detail, probably more than you may find in more scholarly books or books from large area surveys as you may find from, for example, Elizabeth David.<br /><br />Highly recommended as a source for Arab home cooking.s traditions, although the Arabs would generally take their snacks with coffee rather than with wine.

Could be better.	`The Perfect Basket' crafting / cookbook by Diane Phillips is an inexpensive little book which offers a wide variety of imaginative giftgiving ideas which require very little crafting ability. You can be all thumbs with the glue gun and still be a winner with many of the projects in this book. It is almost overstating it to say these are `projects', as the hardest thing about many of the suggestions if finding some of the components.<br /><br />While a basket is the container you always picture when you imagine gift collections (except me, whose all time greatest gift collection came in a plain cardboard box, giftwrapped, at Christmas when I was five years old) one of this book's major suggestions is in how to use a lot of different kinds of containers. My favorites are a `Radio Flyer' little red wagon and a slow cooker.<br /><br />These two examples point up one important fact that along with the `easy to do' aspect of these collections goes the `not exactly cheap' caution. The author does us a great favor of giving us up to three different price levels, adding more and more expensive items to fit a more generous presentation. But, even the least expensive collections will rarely run less than 25 dollars and some of the high end collections can easily run to over 100 dollars.<br /><br />And, the price level may vary widely if you are not careful or willing to choose less expensive, and therefore less impressive items. For example, the `Festival Italiano' $25 basket includes extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The problem is that a good `everyday' (Bertolli, Berio, Colavita) brand and size (1 Liter) of extra virgin olive oil can run to $15 and a good `everyday' brand of balsamic vinegar brand and size ((500 ml) can also run to over $10. Premium brands of both products can run to $50 a bottle, and if your recipient has high standards, a below-average brand will create a below-average impression. But this gets into knowing your recipient. My only point is that some of Ms. Phillips' collections can be expensive and they can be a lot more expensive than her suggested price. One place where the author specifically underquotes prices is in some of the containers. That little Radio Flyer wagon may only be available in pricy speciality stores and I am certain that a backpack `basket' from The North Face company will run to $50.<br /><br />Another virtue of this book is the variety of occasions for which the author offers suggestions. And, almost all the collections are general enough so that tweaking them a bit one way or another will turn a `Picnic Basket' into a housewarming basket or a Memorial Day or Labor Day or 4th of July gathering basket.<br /><br />The book is divided into a larger section of `Special Occasion Baskets' which involve no cookery and `Food Baskets' where the centerpiece is one or more homemade mixes for baking or assembling cookies, breads, muffins, chili, tea, lemonade, scones, salads, salsas, pancakes, popovers, or you name it! Recipes for these goodies actually require practically no cooking skills. The most important skill is the sense to buy a really good set of measuring tools (and know how to use them) and secure glass containers in which to put the goods. The recipes all have two parts. The first part, which is generally very simple matter of measuring and mixing either all wet or all dry ingredients, is for the gift giver. The second part, presented on pictures of little index cards, is for the recipient, and it is up to the gift giver to transfer this recipe to a card and place it in the basket with the ingredients. I think the author really missed some good opportunities here. The very easiest way to transfer these `end user' recipes to the basket would be to scan them into a computer and print them on card stock, but the author gives no clue to how this can be done. I am not expecting a cooking specialist to also be an expert Kinkos operative, but a mention of this technique and some guidance would have gone a long way. Another suggestion would have been for the author to offer all these recipe cards on images on an internet site which could be downloaded and printed.<br /><br />On perishables in general, the author offers excellent warnings to the gift giver to on what to tell the recipient about the shelf life of the mixtures.<br /><br />The book opens with a nice section of general tips on assembling baskets. This includes the tip which always rubs me the wrong way, about being sure to pack the basket with raffia, shredded paper, or plastic to bulk up the appearance of the goodies. It seems to me that a superior method is to provide candy, hand towels, or shop towels as filler. That is, bulk up with something which is useful.<br /><br />I'm sure there was some issue with publisher Harvard Common Press on keeping the book down to an easily marketable price, but I think a picture of each and every basket would have been a good thing here. I rarely feel the need for pictures for food recipes, but here, the presentation is the whole game. I don't know what the legal issues are here, but it would have been a very clever way to present recommended brands without mentioning them in the text. The quality of the pictures which are given give a small taste of what could have been done with a picture for every basket.<br /><br />While I have not reviewed any other books on doing gift baskets, I sense that this volume is excellent for the price, but it could have been a bit better.

No matter how pretty they look, this adulterating of food simply rubbed me the wrong way, and while I have seen edible glues used, of course, on `Iron Chef America', there is no mention of such a product or option in this writing. Staying with this same project, one of the `supplies' is `Ornate silver candlestick holders'. My guess from the photograph of the finished product is that this little item can easily run to several dollars per unit, and the photograph suggests one per table setting.<br /><br />This brings to mind the kind of project you can find in `Martha Stewart Living' and not `Better Homes and Gardens'. But my experience with `...Living' is that their instructions for projects are generally much more complete and their photographic spreads are better done.<br /><br />The second craft project involves several very specialized materials, tools, and skills and since I am not an experienced craft person, I found the explanation of the techniques required to be just a bit sparse. They were akin to a cooking recipe's telling you to turn your mixture into quenelles. While I have never done this, I know I can run to my Jacques Pepin `Complete Techniques' to get the correct procedure. On the other hand, I have never used a sewing machine and the need for one will damp my spirits for this project.<br /><br />A third objection I found with the craft projects is exemplified in the third project for `tussie-mussies' that create Christmas tree ornaments out of live `dainty fresh flowers'. My first concern is that while my Christmas tree is usually up for about six weeks, these decorations have practically no chance of lasting a week. And, the cost of such flowers in December at the average florist is likely to be pretty dear.<br /><br />Since I know a lot more about cooking and baking than I do about craft projects, the baking recipes, mostly cookies were a lot less mysterious, but I had at least three objections to them. First, the book presents a few very ambitious projects for gingerbread constructions, yet the instructions for these are pretty thin. I know one could do a lot better with these since Rose Levy Beranbaum has done just that in her excellent book, `Rose's Christmas Cookies'. Another great source for Christmas cookie recipes is Dede Wilson's `A Baker's Field Guide to Christmas Cookies'.<br /><br />My second objection to the recipes is that I know some of the recipes are not `best in breed'. For example, the snickerdoodle recipe here uses shortening, while my very best recipe uses butter plus a bit of corn syrup.<br /><br />My third objection to the recipes is that some instructions do not follow genuine cooking practice. For example, one recipe calls for using a ¼ cup ice cream scoop, yet ice cream scoops are not rated by cup, but by what fraction of an ounce they scoop.<br /><br />While there are many good things in this book, there are also many things that are half-baked, too expensive, or impractical. In place of this book, get one of the two cookie books I suggest, plus a good book on only Christmas crafts.tmas tree is usually up for about six weeks, these decorations have practically no chance of lasting a week.

29074:US	39134375	R3V9N8KU2TTEMQ	0802714471	585623524	A History Of The World In Six Glasses	Books	5	7	9	N	Y	Great Read. Fine Historical Connections. Small lapses.	`A History of the World in 6 Glasses' by Tom Standage is an addition to a great genre of popular non-fiction on some important, but often ignored subject in the same vein as `Robbing the Bees' by Holley Bishop, Mark Kurlansky's works, `Cod' and `Salt' and `New Yorker' writer, Susan Orlean's `The Orchid Thief'. In fact, like Kurlansky, Master Standage has done at least two other books in this genre to date, `The Victorian Internet' and `The Turk'.<br /><br />This volume presents a part of the history of six of the world's most important beverages, beer, wine, distilled spirits, coffee, tea, and Coca-Cola, or, more accurately American cola drinks. Each of the six essays does not cover the whole history of each beverage. It only covers the time and place in which each beverage became popular. There are many dissimilarities between the six, but there are also important similarities. The author points out that all six contain an important psychoactive ingredient. The first three contain alcohol and the second three contain caffeine. What the author notes in each essay is that each beverage was also considered or was actually an aid to health or an improvement to water as a safe beverage in that either the alcohol or the heating in the preparation of the drink, or some chemicals in the source material helped kill any bacteria in the water used to make the beverages.<br /><br />One of the most enjoyable aspects of this book are the connections made by the author between his primary subject and other major social and economic facts of the times in which the beverage became popular. One of the more interesting `sidebars' are the relative fates of wine and coffee in Christian and Muslim cultures, where Christians embraced wine while Muslims, especially Arabs used coffee as a healthy substitute with almost exactly opposite effects from wine. A second interesting sidebar (and, I believe, the subject of his earlier book `The Victorian Internet' is the influence of coffeehouses on 17th and 18th century commerce, art, and politics in London. A third interesting note is the rundown on the wines and other potables of ancient Rome. Filling in what I know about Italian drinking, I can recognize the origins, for example of grappa, made from the dregs of the wine making process.<br /><br />While one may have no argument with the importance of all six beverages, I can't help wondering why the author picked Coca-Cola over hot chocolate. Part of the reason may be that the stories of chocolate and coffee are just too similar to make an interesting contrast. Also, the arrival of coffee, tea, and chocolate all happened at about the same time, so the historical contexts are very similar. I was also surprised that his story on Coca-Cola did not include the time and circumstances surrounding the removal of coca from the drink.<br /><br />Unlike some works on the history or husbandry of culinary subjects, there is virtually nothing in this book on `how to'. There is not one word on the chemistry of fermentation as it relates to beer, wine, or tea. There is virtually no mention of different varieties of grape and just a few statements on grape varieties and grape culture outside of ancient Greece and Rome. There is much more said about the economics of wine making and trade, just as there is much on the economics of rum, slaves and molasses, forming the three sides of the famous New England to Africa to Caribbean trading triangle active up to the Civil War.<br /><br />Mr. Standage has very credible credentials as a writer and editor on technical matters, but I found just a few little questions in his presentation of historical facts. The first statement which tickled my skeptical bone was the reference to the `Fertile Crescent' as the arc from the mouth of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers to the uplands of the Nile in ancient Egypt. In my freshman history of the western world class, the `Fertile Crescent' was described as the arc from the Persian Gulf to theLevant, basically following the course of the Tigris and Euphrates. I quickly checked my Times Atlas of Archeology that confirmed my memory from many years ago. The Nile and the growth of the Egyptian civilizations, while parallel to those that began with Akkad and Sumer were done on independent lines, with the yearly Nile flooding providing a significantly different agricultural environment than the non-flooding rivers of Mesopotamia.<br /><br />A second and more subtle scholarly indiscretion is in the author's treatment of the theory of humors created by the great Greek and Roman medical thinkers such as Hippocrates and Galen. This theory posits four humors, blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile and an imbalance between the four being the explanation for various diseases. The author rather intemperately describes this theory, held by thousands of medical practitioners for 2000 years as `utter nonsense', and revealed to be so by 19th century medical research.<br /><br />My first thought is that the practice of bleeding with leaches was explained and justified by this theory, and I have seen recent articles stating that bleeding with leeches retains some good medical effects. This leads me to the belief that there were probably other empirically successful practices that were explained by the humors theory. It was certainly not far fetched, as at least three out of the four fluids can be seen, smelled, tasted, and acted upon within the body. I suggest the author reread his Thomas Kuhn (`The Structure of Scientific Revolutions') to see how this weak and, by today's standards, poorly supported theory served its purpose as the best they had at the time.<br /><br />In spite of these hiccups, this is a great read, even if it strays from its primary subjects now and again. And, it is properly documented with references so that if any statement strikes a chord of interest, you have the means of tracking down the author's sources.lf to the Levant, basically following the course of the Tigris and Euphrates.

Buy It.	`Julie & Julia' by Julie Powell is a new and welcome addition to a very select class of culinary writing, the `Personal Memoir'. The only other work I know in this entertaining genre is Amanda Hesser's `Cooking for Mr. Latte'.<br /><br />The most important thing both books have in common is that neither offers you serious culinary advice. While Ms. Hesser's book has a goodly number of recipes, she presents them more as a look inside her personal favorites than as a major culinary reference. Ms. Powell's book has no recipes, as all the recipes in question come from Julia Child's first and most famous book, `Mastering the Art of French Cooking'. Both share that exquisite charm in revealing cooking disasters. Ms. Hesser's revelations are a bit more satisfying, as she is a culinary professional at the time of her writing the book.<br /><br />Ms. Powell embarked upon the quest leading to this volume while she was a temporary secretary at an unnamed federal agency dealing with the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City. She was living with her husband in a smallish and cantankerous apartment in Long Island City (Queens) and was finding herself in need of a direction in life. Since she also felt the need to learn how to cook better, she hit upon the project of cooking every single recipe from Julia Child et al's masterpiece, generally referred to as `MtAoFC'. There is an odd parallel with Child's life here in that Julia Child took up cooking after World War II and shortly after marrying Paul Child and moving to Paris, where Child was posted with the U.S. Embassy. This left Julia at loose ends, especially after having filled an important and satisfying role in the OSS (Office of Special Services, forerunner of the CIA) during the war, in Ceylon, where she met her future husband.<br /><br />To make this project even more interesting to our current author, she decided to announce the project to the world on an Internet blog and on it record her progress, with the ambition to complete all 524 recipes in one year (365 days). Thus, the lion's share of this book is anecdotes on the preparation of selected recipes or groups of recipes from `MtAoFC'. Note that Ms. Powell's `MtAoFC' is really just Volume I and not both volumes.<br /><br />If nothing else, this book is a confirmation of just how huge a cultural, or at least culinary icon is this cookbook by J. Child, S. Beck, and L. Bertholle. Ms. Powell's book would not be half as interesting if it were done on the basis of virtually any other cookbook which comes to mind.<br /><br />I have enormous respect for Ms. Powell's integrity in working through all the recipes in the manner she did, as the author resorted to very few shortcuts, at least on the first or second time with each technique. The fact that the author and her cohorts took the trouble to track down marrow bones and calves hooves made for a doubly interesting story, even if one suspects that the culinary results may not have suffered one wit if the author had relied on Knox unflavored gelatin rather than taking the effort to render gelatin from an authentic animal source. What may be a little surprising is the difficulty Ms. Powell and company had in finding some of the ingredients in New York City, but then, none of them were culinary professionals familiar with insiders' knowledge of Gotham's provisioners.<br /><br />Unlike Ms. Hesser, Julie Powell had no direct contact with her subject, Julia Child. The only documented contact was a short note from Ms. Child to Ms. Powell wishing here well and expressing gratitude that Ms. Child's work had a positive effect on Ms. Powell. Since Ms. Powell's culinary Labors of Hercules were finished in August 2003; this event roughly coincided with the death of Julia Child. It is understandable that this event had less emotional effect on the author than it did on some of the author's family.<br /><br />In writing this book, Ms. Powell got access to letters between Paul Child and his future bride and wife, Julia McWilliams / Julia Child and publishes a selection of these letters from 1944 in Ceylon to 1949 in Paris. While I am familiar with much of the general information in these letters from reading Julia Child's biography, `An Appetite for Life', some of the details of the salty language used between the lovers is almost worth the price of admission.<br /><br />Some of you who have little taste for culinary memoirs may react to the notion of book with indifference, but I do suggest you consider it if you have any thoughts of embarking upon making any recipes from `MtAoFC'. I should also warn you that Ms. Powell's chapters often deal with some of the most difficult recipes in `MtAoFC', as it is the problems arising out of these which make the best reading. My own experience with Ms. Child's book is that most of the recipes are, indeed, relatively simple. But, as Ms. Powell clearly states, echoing an important precis by Richard Olney in `Simple French Food', `simple' is NOT the same as easy, and nothing worth doing is likely to come easy to the inexperienced.<br /><br />Ms. Powell (and her copy editing handlers at publisher, Little Brown seem to be much more experienced at writing than they are at cooking, as Ms. Powell's exploits make good, if not necessarily scintillating reading. Like the candid comments from Paul Child's letters, Ms. Powell seems to have held little back, except for those confidences connected with her government job and the identity of her friends.<br /><br />Ms. Powell is not quite the expert writer like M.F.K. Fisher, Ruth Reichl, or Amanda Hesser for that matter, but her stuff is engaging. I was just surprised Ms. Powell did not give us the URL for her blog or the page references in `MtAoFC' for her recipes used in each chapter.to letters between Paul Child and his future bride and wife, Julia McWilliams / Julia Child and publishes a selection of these letters from 1944 in Ceylon to 1949 in Paris.

44466:US	39134375	R2C9QOECVI2HXR	1573442143	643228573	Best Bondage Erotica 2	Books	5	26	31	N	Y	Very Good Writing, Needs a bit more liberating imagination.	`Best Bondage Erotica 2' edited by Alison Tyler follows very closely in the footsteps of the first volume with this title. In fact, as I looked back at my review of `Best Bondage Erotica 1', I found almost exactly the same thoughts which came to mind upon reading the new collection.<br /><br />To restate my original impressions in a slightly different way, I find that the one thing these collections are lacking is the kind of imagination dedicated to Domination / Submission scenarios and lifestyles as I find in some conventional fiction. The outstanding examples I can cite are some of Edgar Allen Poe's short stories such as `The Pit and the Pendulum' and `The Cast of Amontillado'; some of Stephen King's novels such as `Misery' and `Gerald's Game'; at least two episodes from each of the television shows `CSI' and `CSI:NY'. It seems as if all the very talented writers represented in this collection either do not realize the psychic / erotic power of some of these images, or they prefer playing it safe. What I am almost certain they are missing is the great liberating power of fiction, an insight which goes all the way back to Aristotle (`Poetics').<br /><br />Instead, almost all of our authors rely on virtually the same tired scenario of good but slightly naughty girl finds herself with a dangerous but handsome and strong man who immobilizes her with (rope, chains, handcuffs, sofa, scarves, neckties .. you pick one) and commits some less than bourgeois form of foreplay with (hand, dildo, whip, scarf, clamps, ... you pick one) followed by cataclysmic climax and revelation that she and Mr. Tall and Handsome are really (good friends, lovers, former lovers, office mates,... you pick one). You get the idea. The variety in which this same simple scenario is played out is quite welcome. Especially welcome is the lack of cutsie Victorian dialogue of girlish squeals and testosterone fuelled snarling.<br /><br />What all authors seem to have fallen into is the rut of recounting things that are feasible and, in most states, legal in the real world. The problem is that the imagination often wants more. How can you possibly explain the interest in things as diverse, and as improbable, as `Lord of the Rings', `Sin City', and the `Mad Max' movies if it were not to satisfy the itch to participate in an experience which is much, much, much larger than life.<br /><br />The editor and the authors may benefit from the fact that they are the only game in town. Quentin Tarantino only buries a victim in every fifth movie and we have at least another few months before Peter Jackson reprises Fay Wray's first encounter with her very tall, dark stranger, and heaven knows where Stephen King is going these days.<br /><br />So, there is simply no interest in truly imaginative fantasy evocations of the abyss of emotion connected with the terror / abandonment / release of being in some great circumstance, the greatest of which is death. You almost have to go back to some of the stories of the early saints to experience the liberating power of putting your trust, body, and soul in the hands of some other power.<br /><br />But these are still the best modern stories we've got, so read them with pleasure and keep looking. Oh, and by the way, the cover is again one of the better aspects of this volume.things that are feasible and, in most states, legal in the real world.

47440:US	39134375	R25JUD700JXNWH	0789471442	593526671	AHS Great Plant Guide	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Good, but not Great. Nice picture guide to perennials.	`Great Plants Guide' by the American Horticultural Society is a slightly overweight `pocket sized' guide to buying and raising outdoor garden plants. Regardless of the subject, I am always just a bit suspicious of `pocket guides' to very broad subjects. And, as this book brags about covering 3000 recommended plants, this is pretty broad.<br /><br />I looked up each flowering plant I have in my garden and was just a bit disturbed to see that three major perennials popular in the northeastern United States are missing from this book! I could find no articles on pansies, petunias, or marigolds, although my other favorites, dahlias, chrysanthemums, and day lillies (hemerocallis). The great families of tulips, daffodills, and hyacinths are also well represented.<br /><br />What was even more annoying is that in the lists of types of plants by use in the back of the book, petunias are mentioned favorably as a good species for hanging baskets. While one gets the sense that the book is weighted heavily towards perennials, we do find a smallish section devoted to Impatiens.<br /><br />As this book is published by DK (Dorling Kindersley) which has several other larger format titles in conjunction with the American Horticultural Society, I strongly suggest that this book was digested from a larger book to give the appearance of working as a fielf guide.<br /><br />What seems odd, however, is the presence in this volume of material specifically meant to be read in March in the comfort of your easy chair, as you look over plant catalogues and plan you award winning flower beds for the coming spring. That is, it is material on techniques which have no role in you strolls down the aisles of your favorite nursery, as you look for a perennial to fill in that hole at the northeastern corner of your house.<br /><br />Were I to consider buying this book again, I would probably take a pass in favor of a good book on perennials plus a good book on annuals, except that it seems few books deal with the lowly pansy and petunia, let alone the cliched marigold.<br /><br />This volume may be good if you don't to actually read big, atlas sized hulking books on 7245 different garden species, but I do suggest you check out the field before laying out any loot for this little guide.<br /><br />I am happy that other reviewers have had good luck with this book, but I repeat my suggestion to shop around before laying out any money for this book.few books deal with the lowly pansy and petunia, let alone the cliched marigold. <br /> <br />This volume may be good if you don't to actually read big, atlas sized hulking books on 7245 different garden species, but I do suggest you check out the field before laying out any loot for this little guide. <br /> <br />I am happy that other reviewers have had good luck with this book, but I repeat my suggestion to shop around before laying out any money for this book.	2005-09-18

'Italian Classics' is a 'Cooks Illustrated' treatment of well known Italian recipes. I have reviewed a number of similar 'Cooks Illustrated' books and a fabulous number of Italian cookbooks, and I believe that this volume is both better than the average 'Cooks Illustrated' volume AND better than the average Italian cookbook.<br /><br />Part of the value of this book is not due to the efforts of the 'Cooks Illustrated' staff, it is due to their applying their usual approach to a body of recipes which are well established and about which there is a great body of writing already available in English.<br /><br />That means that when they evaluate a pasta Puttanesca recipe, there is little chance they will be going wrong, as they have the writings of Marcella Hazan, Lydia Bastianich, Mario Batalli, Giuliano Bugialli, and Michelle Scicolone to proof their researches against.<br /><br />This is not to say that they sometimes go off the deep end of fussiness, as when they suggest parboiling the garlic in the pan before adding the oil and other ingredients so as to not burn the garlic when starting out on their Puttanesca.<br /><br />Still, I am always guaranteed of seeing a highly reliable recipe for the Italian standards in this volume and while I have multiple volumes written by all those other authors, I still refer to this book first every time I want to do meatballs or lasagna or gnocchi or osso bucco.<br /><br />Recommended for people who like to cook Italian.	2005-09-17
49048:US	39134375	R28TNHQ665YPBK	0375759921	92271437	Endless Feasts: Sixty Years of Writing from Gourmet (Modern Library Food)	Books	4	13	14	N	Y	Very Good Sampler for idle moments.	`Endless Feasts' is a collection of writings about food, drink, travel, biography, and fiction from the pages of `Gourmet' magazine from the magazine's founding in the late 1930s to the present. The selections were made by the magazine's current editor, Ruth Reichl, who has, in many ways taken over the throne of leading American culinary editor long left vacant after the passing of Craig Claiborne.<br /><br />My first reaction, as someone who very much likes to read about food, cooking, and culinary personalities, is that this collection shows the ephemeral nature of a lot of magazine writing, especially some pieces written under less talented editors than Ms. Reichl. In a nutshell, I found this book difficult to read from front to back. In this day of the Food Network, the Discovery Channel, and the Travel channel, pieces written about Umbria or Mexico, or Tibet or Shanghai seem just a bit lifeless on the page. When they were written, most pieces were not intended to be memoirs, but the passage of time has turned them from travelogues of today into faded snapshots of a world which is no longer there.<br /><br />That is not to say there are no good pieces here. There are selections written by M.F.K. Fisher, Madhur Jaffrey, Pat Conroy, Ray Bradbury, Anita Loos, James Villas, Paul Theroux, Elizabeth David, George Plimpton, and James Beard. Part of the problem is that pieces by these writers are in the minority. It is also true that in some cases, as with Madhur Jaffrey, for example, her travel memoir takes her out of her primary area of expertise, so I found her piece on India to be just a bit on the dry side. Many of the pieces by the less well-known writers are good, but maybe not great. Part of the interest of a piece by Elizabeth David is that her great reputation for being a superior culinary writer will mean that when you read her piece, if you encounter a questionable statement, you are wise to question your own judgment on the matter rather than question the author. For most other authors, if you encounter a questionable statement, you may feel a bit up in the air unless you have an unimpeachable authority for your opinion.<br /><br />While I consider this a forest of trees with a wide variety in their value, one may also raise the issue of the value of the forest. How does an interest in Epicurean pleasures fit into a complete life? Is it possible that `Gourmet' interests by their nature influence a life to wander into a less than productive fields? One piece of evidence is Jim Villas' piece on the life of Lucius Beebe, who was a wealthy epicure who turned himself into a journalist with a disdain for the ordinary which makes H. L. Menchen's poor opinion of the boobiesee (sic) look like a mild tic. Since Beebe embraced a style that required the support of significant wealth, are we of normal means to admire or disdain this sybaritic aesthete. Is not a life made good on average means much more interesting to study?<br /><br />In a sense, I'm just thinking out loud here. There is definite value in knowing about the lifestyle of Lucius Beebe, just as it is interesting to know of the dinosaurs that took evolution in a direction that could not adapt to a cataclysmic change in their environment. Beebe's preferences for value and competence are commendable. They are also taken in the wrong direction by reliance on great wealth.<br /><br />One problem with this book for the dedicated reader of culinary writing is that we are likely to have encountered many of these pieces, or many of the same material in other sources. Does one really want to know what James Beard has to say about pasta when we have read everything that Marcella Hazan has written on the subject?<br /><br />Ultimately, I think this is not the kind of book you read from cover to cover. It is the book you take with you to doctors' waiting rooms when you are between novels or your interest in that latest Rose Levy Beranbaum `bible' is flagging.<br /><br />Thus, I recommend this book with a caution. A great book to buy at a discount. A not so great book at full list price. For great culinary writing, be sure to complete your reading of M.F.K. Fisher or Elizabeth David or James Villas or even Ruth Reichl herself before spending money here.r />Thus, I recommend this book with a caution. A great book to buy at a discount.

It is one of the very few reference books I actually own and quite possibly the reference I open even more often than my Merriam Webster 3rd Unabridged.<br /><br />There is not a single episode of fiction based on Greek or Roman or Egyptian or ancient Chinese or Indian lore which does not prompt me to open this volume.<br /><br />One of its most obvious virtues is the size of its pages. My other historical atlas is published by Anchor Paperbacks and making any sense of it at all prompts me to break out the magnifying glass. It's standard paperback sized pages cover a great swatch of history and it does it well, but it is no pleasure to read the fine print.<br /><br />This volume, like most contemporary Atlases is not just about maps. It devotes many pages to the archeological methods which were used to unearth the information used to construct these maps. It also covers much more than political boundaries, with much material on cultural, economic, and military interest.<br /><br />The book begins in prehistory and ends at the industrial revolution. Note that there is not a lot here on military history once we leave the Roman Empire. For that, there are many other good histories and atlases.<br /><br />This book is mostly about the findings or archeological research, inchuding archeology into Paul Revere's dustbin.<br /><br />Very highly recommended.	2005-09-17

A few minor blemishes.	`The Candlemaker's Companion' by Betty Oppenheimer is a the very first book I have read on home candlemaking, and I got it primarily as a source for techniques for decorating commercially made candles, but I am happy to report that it lives up to its subtitle of `A Complete Guide to Rolling, Pouring, Dipping, and Decorating Your Own Candles'<br /><br />The author states and I agree wholeheartedly that there are a lot of similarities between candlemaking and cooking, as long as you don't push the analogy too hard. Both skills use chemistry, heat, and measuring in roughly the same amounts, somewhere between a teaspoon (5 ml) and five pounds. And, if Ms. Oppenheimer's book were to be compared to a cookbook, it would not be to the Betty Crocker / Better Homes and Gardens / `Joy of Cooking' genre of lots of recipes with little why and wherefores or to the `Gourmet Magazine' / Martha Steward school of emphasis on elegance and entertaining or to the Eric Rippert / Thomas Keller / Daniel Boulud school of cuisine as high art. It can be most closely compared to Alton Brown of `Good Eats' and Shirley Corriher of `Cookwise' where the why of things is given just as much importance as the how and how much.<br /><br />As someone totally new to the candlemaking craft, I am really impressed by how many variables go into making a successful candle. A matter so humble as the wick requires a whole chapter, and the first long chapter to boot. Dismiss any notions that any length of cotton string can serve as a wick. After reading this book, I am convinced that your conventional kitchen twine will fail miserably as a wick, regardless of the thickness of the candle or any other variable entering the picture. The best wicks are braided from many, many strands of cotton in such a way that as they burn, they bend so their tip reaches out to the outer layer of flame and becomes oxidized (turned to ash) without smoking as a result of partial burning.<br /><br />As a former chemist, the varieties of waxes are a bit more familiar to me, but the variety and techniques of additives to the wax involves a second major section, albeit not even as long as the chapter on wicks. Heating wax is one place where the parallels to cooking are significant, as the range of temperatures are similar to deep frying, and safety measures are similar.<br /><br />The variety of techniques for making candles is also familiar; as I have dealt with all sorts of candles, including poured, dipped, rolled, and sculpted. What is unfamiliar is the amount of care one needs in the selection of the best combination of wicks and waxes for each technique. Buying your 11 pound block of paraffin and some coloring at your local craft store, throwing it all into a heating pot, and pouring the result into a mold with wick will probably lead to a less than perfect result.<br /><br />This brings up the fact that like baking and unlike savory cooking, candlemaking measurements must really be pretty precise, which, among other things, means you really do need a pretty accurate scale for measuring weight. The author makes no suggestions, but I will chime in and say that the type which are best for cooking, the digital, dual unit electronic models are really the best. And, largely agreeing with the author, I will say that this is the ONLY tool that you can share between your kitchen and your candlemaking bench. The author, from long experience, I am sure, says that any tool you use for candlemaking will acquire traces of wax that you will invariably be unable to clean from the tool. This includes all other types of measuring devices.<br /><br />This brings me to the fact that the author has some serious weaknesses in her discussion of measurements. At the top of the list is her mistaking a gallon for 3.76 milliliters (ml) rather than 3.76 Liters. This means she is off by a factor of 1000! While this may not cause any problems for anyone ignoring the metric measurements, it can cause serious headscratching for someone not thoroughly familiar with the metric system, is valiantly trying to work with it for all its obvious examples. My more general issue with Ms. Oppenheimer's measurements is that she interchangeably uses volumes, weights, and relative size (parts). My suggestion would be to stick primarily to metric weights and do conversions to volume only when really necessary, as when you are figuring out how much wax you need to fill a particular vessel to a particular level.<br /><br />My only other major issue I could find with the book is in the fact that Ms. Oppenheimer makes a reference to the color wheel as if this device typically taught in the seventh grade were a working part of all her reader's everyday knowledge. While I have a vague notion of what the color wheel looks like and how its used, I have no certainty that I know where to find one which will work with pigments (one of the things I do remember is that there are different color wheels for combining pigments and beams of light.)<br /><br />Regarding my original purpose for buying this book, I can state that it gives many sound looking techniques for decorating the outside of commercially purchased candles, although I did find a few slips in lists of materials which I would consider a major flaw in a cooking recipe.<br /><br />I recommend this book for the `sophisticated' beginner who is willing, as the author wisely suggests, to do a little experimentation in pursuit of the hobby. If you just want to knock off a few votive candles, buy a ready-made kit for the purpose.<br /><br />Recommended, with warning to keep your brain fully engaged as your read.headscratching for someone not thoroughly familiar with the metric system, is valiantly trying to work with it for all its obvious examples.

Every recipe is a combination of a specific shape and variety (dried or fresh) of pasta, a specific cooking method (baked or top of the stove), and a specific `finishing touch' of cheese, parsley, basal, or what have you. The best evidence that this book deals with dishes and not sauces is the concluding chapter which includes two different recipes for that ultimate pasta dish, the timballo or macaroni pie.<br /><br />The book does not select its top 100 from a study of other cookbooks, the author has selected these recipes from her own experiences with cooks throughout Italy from her base in Rome. That does not mean her selection of recipes is a lot different from what you get by polling 20 cookbooks of Italian recipes. Every recipe you may expect to find here is really here, even if a bit it may take a bit of looking to locate some favorites. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that the book has NO INDEX! If this were not such an otherwise so thoroughly delightful book, I would certainly consider this as grounds to demote it by at least one star.<br /><br />But with some perserverence, you will find Pasta Puttanesca, Spaghetti Carbonara, Ragu Bolognaise, Rigatoni with four cheeses (mac and cheese), Pasta Primavera, Pasta with Pesto, Pasta and meatballs, and the aforementioned timballi recipes. The only `famous' pasta recipes I could not find were fettucini Alfredo, a Vodka sauce, or any gnocchi recipes, althought there were several cream based sauces and also many which were made with either wine or brandy. I must note that the `mac and cheese' recipe given here is unlike any recipe you will find in a book aimed specifically at American audiences, as it is made without either a custard or a bechamel sauce. I am really pleased to find this recipe, as I saw a similar one in another pasta book and thought it was something of a mistake. Turns out the mistake was mine, in not fully appreciating the import of some instructions.<br /><br />I am certain the author did not base her selection of sauces entirely on popularity because the book covers just about every different type of sauce you can imagine, including the whole spectrum of ingredients from green vegetables to beans and lentils to mushrooms to seafood to pork and beef and lamb to olives to squash and pumpkin to nuts to lemon. And, the book is very nicely organized by these principle ingredients, except for the last chapter of special celebratory dishes which either include many different ingredients or include relatively expensive ingredients. This wide variety makes the book a perfect source if you happen to need a recipe with which to use up some frozen peas. Luckily, the table of contents is quite good at pointing to the right page for such a need, especially as this silly book HAS NO INDEX!!!<br /><br />It is quite appropriate that the illustrator receive front page credit for this book, as the excellent color drawings, probably done with colored pencil or crayon, make this book a joy to browse.<br /><br />Aside from the lack of an index, the book is also just a bit lax in referring from one recipe to another within the book. All such references are easily misunderstood, as when we are instructed to find something in the `third' recipe, where it is not said whether it means the third recipe in the chapter or the third recipe in the book (they meant the third recipe in the chapter, not my first guess).<br /><br />I am very fond of the fact that almost all measurements are in both English and metric units. On the other hand, I have the feeling that the cooking procedures are aimed at someone with just a bit more a beginner's kitchen skills. Several of the typical little hints given in Italian recipes such as warnings not to cook the garlic too hard or to cut the basil at the last minute are missing.<br /><br />While the book covers much more than just sauces, it is not a book on pasta, as there is not a single pasta recipe anywhere to be found. That is probably why there are no gnocchi recipes, as gnocchi is one form of pasta which is almost invariably made at home.<br /><br />If you have no Italian cookbooks and like pasta (and you have no interest in creating a library of Italian cookbooks), then I think this should be the very next cookbook you buy. If you simply like attractive cookbooks, then you certainly cannot miss this one, as it is relatively inexpensive and will take up little room on your shelf.

53967:US	39134375	RGGI9ERINQJ0R	0877017883	129179199	Griffin & Sabine:  An Extraordinary Correspondence	Books	4	1	3	N	N	Great Gift. Unique Work, probably Bantock's best written work.	`Griffin & Sabine', `Sabine's Notebook', and `The Golden Mean' by illustrator, writer, and artist, Nick Bantock form a trilogy of  unusual chapters in an interactive graphic novella, similar to the genre well-known to children from `pop-up' books. In fact, in Mr. Bantock's biographical sketch on the rear flyleaf, he is credited as the author of popup books.<br /><br />The story, spread across the three volumes, neatly packaged in a very attractive slipcase with artwork from the cover of the first volume, is composed of a correspondence between a naturalist's artist and postage stamp illustrator, Sabine Strohem, and the owner of a one man postcard design studio, Griffin Moss.<br /><br />As depicted in the flyleaf of the first volume, Ms. Strohem lives on a very small and, I believe, fictional chain of islands in the South Pacific, somewhere near the Solomon Islands. Mr. Moss lives in the middle of London. The basis of the ingeniously crafted correspondence between the two is based on the fact that both are talented and imaginative graphic artists who also happen to work in `the postal medium'. In fact, one might venture a subtitle of the series as `A Novella in Postage'.<br /><br />The whole story is set off when Sabine begins, as a teenager, to have visions of illustrations in the act of their being created. Her visions see only the illustration and not the artist or even the artist's hand. After several years, she identifies the artist by spotting his work in a book of postcard illustrations. Over the course of a long correspondence on both postcards and two page letters, the two appear to fall in love. The first volume, `Griffin & Sabine' ends with the disappearance of Griffin on the event of Sabine's stating that she is coming to see him in London.<br /><br />I recall seeing the single first volume in bookstores when it was first published and it is possible the author did not originally intend this to be a trilogy. While the end of the first volume is mysterious, it doesn't leave a lot of room for an obvious start of a second installment in a series. It leaves us with the possible conclusion that Sabine was totally a creation of Griffin's very depressed personality and that Griffin alone created the whole correspondence. This conclusion is supported by the last statement in the book that says that all pieces of both sides of the correspondence were found pinned to the ceiling of Griffin Moss' studio.<br /><br />The second volume, `Sabine's Notebook' brings Sabine to Griffin's London apartment while Griffin has embarked upon an around the world journey which takes him to the Solomons, a short hop from Sabine's home, but circumstances keep him from visiting the small island chain itself, contributing to the idea that this location is fictional even within the context of the story. The second volume ends with the two principle characters missing one another by a hair again, as Griffin returns to London upon Sabine's returning to the islands, leaving no trace of her visit.<br /><br />The third volume introduces the only other `speaking character' into the mix. This European journalist / scholar Victor Frolatti arrives on Sabine's island and begins making inquiries into the psychic ability demonstrated by Sabine. He quickly becomes an irritation and something of a distraction that also tends to upset the neat symmetry of the correspondence up to this time. The story also does not entirely resolve this character that seems to be introduced simply to create a reason for the joint disappearance of both Griffin and Sabine.<br /><br />I will not relay the facts or my interpretation of the facts in this concluding volume, `The Golden Mean', as the facts are so vague that I can easily misinterpret what I am reading, and I would not want to risk spoiling your pleasure at reading it yourself.<br /><br />To my mind, there are three components to this work. First, there is the story, about as long as a modest novella. I can read the wholething in about 90 minutes. Not even as long as, for example, the famous novellas `Death in Venice' or `Heart of Darkness'. The literary quality of the writing is fair. It is certainly at a much higher level than your average comic graphic novel, but it is not quite on the same level as Thomas Mann or Joseph Conrad. If the text were to appear without the art, I doubt if the work would generate much comment in serious reviews.<br /><br />Second, there is the graphic art. To a great extent, the circumstances of the principle characters are set up specifically to provide the framework for some very interesting art that walks that thin line between commercial illustration and fine art. The artwork is closest to the collage genre, transmuted onto the printed page by the influence of the pop-up book. I am less well equipped to evaluate graphic art than I am to evaluate the written word, but I believe the graphic art is superior to the writing.<br /><br />Third, there is the synergy between the writing and the graphics which draws in the reader, especially with the device of the full page letters, artfully presented in envelopes within the book which one must open and read as if one were opening a genuine post. This third aspect of the book may be the best. While I am pleasantly surprised at the modest cost of each individual volume, I am almost sorry that the author and publisher could not have gone one more step and produced an edition with real stamps and real postcards in addition to the real envelopes. Using a variety of different paper textures would have enhanced the whole experience, but I am sure this would have also tripled the price of the books.<br /><br />For the same price, I think three good DVDS of movies may be more value for the money, but if you really like graphic art, you don't want to miss these works.n read the whole thing in about 90 minutes.

Buy It!	`Classical Music' by Phil G. Goulding is the kind of book on a major artistic genre one wishes would be written about all genres from ballet to sculpture. At the simplest level, it ranks the top fifty all time greatest composers and gives us a listing of their most important works. The author cuts through mountains of musicological mumblings and technical terms to give the non-professional listener what they really need to seek out the most interesting works to buy and listen to. This book has been my guide to buying classical music from the moment I bought it and it has not once left me down.<br /><br />One of the most satisfying things about the book is how the author gives us the same tabular information in so many different ways, to reveal some plain truths about `classical music'. The two most interesting is how heavily weighted is the list with German and Austrian composers and how many of all composers came from the nineteenth century.<br /><br />I am not a musicologist, although I have listened to works by each and every one of these fifty composers even before buying this book and I at least find the author's rankings to be about as good as any one person can do. I totally agree, for example with the top five, Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Wagner, and Hayden. I may get some urge to switch Brahms and Shubert at six and seven, but that's nitpicking. Once you get out of the top ten, things are probably a bit more contentious, but every comparison I can think of where you take two names which are 10 ranks apart, such as Hector Berlioz at 21 and Edvard Grieg at 31, and I can find nothing on which to base an argument to reverse those rankings.<br /><br />What is truly remarkable is the absence of  composers born in the 20th century. The leading composer working in the 20th century is Stravinsky ranked at 15.<br /><br />The author is a political journalist and I sense that he took up the task of writing this book as a retiremet project. So, he has the benefit of compiling opinions about composers like a political polster who is innocent of their own agenda which may cloud his judgment.<br /><br />Aside from the rankings, the single greatest value of the book will be found in the list of compositions. If nothing else, this validates the value in purchasing multiple copies of certain works which have been considered the very best of their type. For example, I own at least three recorded versions of Bach's Mass in B Minor. And, I agree with the opinion quoted by the author that this may very well be the very best choral work ever written. I can also rest easy with my four copies of Mozart's requiem Mass (the famous unfinished Mass familiar to people who have seen the movie `Amadeus'). The level to which both works elevate my spirit is unmatched by virtually all lesser works. And, what this does is validate my personal reactions to this music. It verifies for me the fact that many others, all with greater musical credentials than I have felt the same about these works.<br /><br />And, not only does the author recommend specific works, he also cites specific available recordings for many of the works. Unfortunately, as this book was first published 13 years ago, it can become quickly out of date for some of the major works. I suspect, for example, that a new recording of these two choral works by Bach and Mozart are issued each year, so I recommend you use an independent source to verify which are the best performances.<br /><br />The last chapter on `The Orchestra' is great for people who know nothing about musical instruments of of classical orchestras, but I suspect it may be a bit light for those who played in the high school band or orchestra.<br /><br />My only real regret is that the author supplies no bibliography, although I suspect that many of his sources are probably pretty obscure from specialized journals and not too available. But, I believe the author has done a masterful job of distilling so much artistic opinion downto really useable stuff.<br /><br />Now, if someone could just do the same for novels and stage plays, we would be in business.tic opinion down to really useable stuff. <br /> <br />Now, if someone could just do the same for novels and stage plays, we would be in business. <br />	2005-09-14

In fact, in Mr. Bantock's biographical sketch on the rear flyleaf, he is credited as the author of popup books.<br /><br />The story, spread across the three volumes, neatly packaged in a very attractive slipcase with artwork from the cover of the first volume, is composed of a correspondence between a naturalist's artist and postage stamp illustrator, Sabine Strohem, and the owner of a one man postcard design studio, Griffin Moss.<br /><br />As depicted in the flyleaf of the first volume, Ms. Strohem lives on a very small and, I believe, fictional chain of islands in the South Pacific, somewhere near the Solomon Islands. Mr. Moss lives in the middle of London. The basis of the ingeniously crafted correspondence between the two is based on the fact that both are talented and imaginative graphic artists who also happen to work in `the postal medium'. In fact, one might venture a subtitle of the series as `A Novella in Postage'.<br /><br />The whole story is set off when Sabine begins, as a teenager, to have visions of illustrations in the act of their being created. Her visions see only the illustration and not the artist or even the artist's hand. After several years, she identifies the artist by spotting his work in a book of postcard illustrations. Over the course of a long correspondence on both postcards and two page letters, the two appear to fall in love. The first volume, `Griffin & Sabine' ends with the disappearance of Griffin on the event of Sabine's stating that she is coming to see him in London.<br /><br />I recall seeing the single first volume in bookstores when it was first published and it is possible the author did not originally intend this to be a trilogy. While the end of the first volume is mysterious, it doesn't leave a lot of room for an obvious start of a second installment in a series. It leaves us with the possible conclusion that Sabine was totally a creation of Griffin's very depressed personality and that Griffin alone created the whole correspondence. This conclusion is supported by the last statement in the book that says that all pieces of both sides of the correspondence were found pinned to the ceiling of Griffin Moss' studio.<br /><br />The second volume, `Sabine's Notebook' brings Sabine to Griffin's London apartment while Griffin has embarked upon an around the world journey which takes him to the Solomons, a short hop from Sabine's home, but circumstances keep him from visiting the small island chain itself, contributing to the idea that this location is fictional even within the context of the story. The second volume ends with the two principle characters missing one another by a hair again, as Griffin returns to London upon Sabine's returning to the islands, leaving no trace of her visit.<br /><br />The third volume introduces the only other `speaking character' into the mix. This European journalist / scholar Victor Frolatti arrives on Sabine's island and begins making inquiries into the psychic ability demonstrated by Sabine. He quickly becomes an irritation and something of a distraction that also tends to upset the neat symmetry of the correspondence up to this time. The story also does not entirely resolve this character that seems to be introduced simply to create a reason for the joint disappearance of both Griffin and Sabine.<br /><br />I will not relay the facts or my interpretation of the facts in this concluding volume, `The Golden Mean', as the facts are so vague that I can easily misinterpret what I am reading, and I would not want to risk spoiling your pleasure at reading it yourself.<br /><br />To my mind, there are three components to this work. First, there is the story, about as long as a modest novella. I can read the wholething in about 90 minutes. Not even as long as, for example, the famous novellas `Death in Venice' or `Heart of Darkness'. The literary quality of the writing is fair. It is certainly at a much higher level than your average comic graphic novel, but it is not quite on the same level as Thomas Mann or Joseph Conrad. If the text were to appear without the art, I doubt if the work would generate much comment in serious reviews.<br /><br />Second, there is the graphic art. To a great extent, the circumstances of the principle characters are set up specifically to provide the framework for some very interesting art that walks that thin line between commercial illustration and fine art. The artwork is closest to the collage genre, transmuted onto the printed page by the influence of the pop-up book. I am less well equipped to evaluate graphic art than I am to evaluate the written word, but I believe the graphic art is superior to the writing.<br /><br />Third, there is the synergy between the writing and the graphics which draws in the reader, especially with the device of the full page letters, artfully presented in envelopes within the book which one must open and read as if one were opening a genuine post. This third aspect of the book may be the best. While I am pleasantly surprised at the modest cost of each individual volume, I am almost sorry that the author and publisher could not have gone one more step and produced an edition with real stamps and real postcards in addition to the real envelopes. Using a variety of different paper textures would have enhanced the whole experience, but I am sure this would have also tripled the price of the books.<br /><br />For the same price, I think three good DVDS of movies may be more value for the money, but if you really like graphic art, you don't want to miss these works.n read the whole thing in about 90 minutes.

Buy It.	`Rice, The Amazing Grain' by Marie Simmons and `Risotto' by Judith Barrett and Norma Wasserman are two older books (14 and 18 years respectively) on a most interesting culinary subject. In fact, to most of the Asian cultures, rice is THE culinary subject, dwarfing all talk of wheat and its principle derivatives, bread and pasta so dear to the western European culinary palate. (The other side of the coin may be that Italian and French cuisines can claim some level of primacy over Asian cuisines in that both have an important role for rice, while Asia ignores wheat and its vassals.)<br /><br />While the first book deals with rice as a whole, including, per its subtitle, `Great Rice Dishes for Every Day', the second book deals only with the classic rice dish of northern Italy. On the face of it, therefore, one may think that the first book is more valuable than the second, but, for serious cookbook collectors, I think that is not the case.<br /><br />For starters, the author claims that `Rice, The Amazing Grain' started out as a book on the grain alone but, like an unruly child, it grew into a cookbook. From that introduction, I expected a major treatise on rice, its cultivation, varieties, and nutrition. Instead, we get something which is far inferior to what I found in the recent book, `The Ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook' by bread baking Guru Beth Hensperger and culinary colleague, Julie Kaufmann. This book on a very specific rice cooking technique actually has more useful information on varieties of rice than this book devoted to the whole grain.<br /><br />So, it took me some time to warm up to `Rice, The Amazing Grain', especially as Ms. Simmons did nothing to really show me how amazing the grain was. I grew to like the book a bit more when I discovered a clear explanation of the differences between a pilaf and a risotto, aside from the fact that one was born in Milan and the other in the Levant. (The difference is in the variety of rice used and the fact that all liquid is added at once to a pilaf at the outset of cooking). I was also very glad to find a good chapter on rice salad dishes. Most good salad books contain few if any recipes for rice in salad, much fewer, for example, than for rice in desserts.<br /><br />So, my final word on `Rice, The Amazing Story' is that it is only worth your while if you are exceptionally fond of rice as an ingredient. If you are a foodie and your interest is not specifically centered on rice, you are much better served by getting `The Ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook' and `Risotto'. I recommend you get both, since, while risotto can be made in a rice cooker, it is, by its nature, something that is done with lid off and with constant serving. So, what a rice cooker gives you is ersatz risotto, with the same ingredients and flavors, but maybe not the same great creaminess. You can imagine the difficulties by visualizing cooking Risotto in a microwave!<br /><br />On the other hand, if you really like rice and Italian cooking, `Risotto' is probably a book you should really own. It is only slightly dated as when it says that risotto ingredients and recipes are rare. Today, you can't go a week on the Food Network without someone making a risotto. And, arborio, one of the rices of choice for making risotto is on the shelf of every single supermarket I visit these days. What is really good about this book is that it deconstructs the risotto cooking process so that you can very easily see the similarities and differences between each recipe. All recipe ingredients lists and procedures are broken down into up to four different elements, the Riso (rice), brodo (broth or stock and wine), soffrito (oil and aromatics), and the condimenti (veggies, meats, poultry, or fish).<br /><br />The varieties of risotto are pretty much what you would expect, with classic, cheese, vegetable, seafood, meat and poultry, and dessert (liquor and fruit) risottos. It is also not surprising to find a chapter devoted to leftover risotto, as many varieties of rice have a habit of stiffening up as starches are reabsorbed into the grains. The Chinese have created whole families of dishes of fried rice for dealing with leftover rice. Also not surprising in the western cuisines that the leftover of choice for rice is in fritters and pancakes.<br /><br />As someone who has successfully made risotto on more than one occasion, I will vouch for the statement that risotto is NOT a difficult technique. It is you main dish, it can even fit into the favorite 30 minute limit for fast cooking. The only tricks to risotto are, like stir frying, prepare EVERYTHING in advance and stay with it. It needs you constant attention for up to 20 minutes. In fact one service this book does over the usual Batali / Bastianich / Hazan / Scicolone etc recipe is cut a few minutes off the time usually specified for good risotto making. This may not be much, but it helps us get under that mystical half-hour limit.<br /><br />I suggest you go to the Encyclopedia Britannica for your scoop of rice background and get the two books on specific rice techniques. `Rice, The Amazing Grain' is a good choice if you really like rice, but don't want to store a lot of books on the subject.ed to leftover risotto, as many varieties of rice have a habit of stiffening up as starches are reabsorbed into the grains.

Imperative if you own a rice cooker.	`The Ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook' by bread baking guru Beth Hensperger and culinary colleague, Julie Kaufmann is exactly the book I imagined may be possible the moment I was exposed to a rice cooker when I became part of a Filipino household which, like virtually all Asian-American households, bought rice by the multiple 25 pound sack at a time and made rice for every evening meal in the week. The whole rice cooking culture, with its large rice dispenser holding up to 50 pounds of rice at a time and the handy little levers at the bottom which dispensed either one, two, or three portions of rice into the aluminum rice cooker chamber was a culinary revelation to my western experience.<br /><br />Being familiar with the slow cooker, which could be used for many different kinds of dishes, I was certain, upon seeing this clever little simple gadget which made perfect cooked rice by turning itself off when all the water had evaporated, that it could do much more than simply cook rice. Well, this book is the perfect realization of my expectations. As luck would have it, I have owned a copy of this book for years, as I bought it in fond remembrance of that lost household, but as my mother has no taste for rice, it went on my shelf along with the small rice cooker I bought upon moving back to the Pennsylvania Dutch culinary world. I rediscovered this book upon my reviewing Hensperger and Kaufmann's superb new book, `Not Your Mother's Slow Cooker Cookbook'. Upon looking at the authors' previous works, it was perfectly obvious to me that this team had already done a book on the rice cooker, and I was embarrassed to realize that I had this little gem collecting dust on my shelves.<br /><br />Well, I am here to tell you that this book is every bit as good as the later `Not Your Mother's Slow Cooker Cookbook'. Not only does it thoroughly cover the whole world of cooking rice, it has many chapters on my expected recipes for cooking non-rice dishes such as beans, puddings, porridges, polenta, plus lots of unexpected rice applications such as pilafs and risottos.<br /><br />One of the most important things to learn about rice cookers from this book is that the world of modern appliances is divided into the simple on / off machines I know and the more advanced electronic machines. The former type are about as simple as it gets, just one step removed from a slow cooker with a temperature sensor which turns off the heat when it senses the temperature going above the boiling point of water. The two enhancements to this very simple design are a `keep warm' feature and a steaming basket. These appliances are so simple that you literally have to unplug them to turn them off. The latter machines are much more complicated, with digital readout controls and a sensor that works on the weight of the contents of the cooking vessel rather than the temperature. There are two drawbacks of these advanced `fuzzy logic' machines. One is that many of them cannot be set up to steam. The other is that some of the best may only be available in the Orient. One of the many nice things about this book is that it covers recipes for all different sizes of cooker, which seem to range from one or two person size to big, commercial machines capable of making 12 to 16 cups at a time.<br /><br />One unusual thing about cooking in a rice cooker is that unlike almost all other savory forms of cooking, one must play close attention to measuring both the rice and the liquid to achieve good results with any model of rice cooking. This fact is emphasized by the fact that there is a special measure for rice that is different than any conventional metric or English measure and you get one of these measures with every rice cooker. Oddly, one widely used and exceptionally easy and reliable measurement for rice cookery is the measurement of water over the rice. One puts enough water in to cover the rice by the depth of the first joint on your index finger. Mysteriously, this seems towork regardless of the length of your fingers.<br /><br />As with many books on popular appliances such as the food processor, the blender, the slow cooker, and the pressure cooker, the book includes several chapters which deal with recipes for precursors to rice cookery such as stocks and recipes for using rice cookery leftovers, such as fried rice. Neither of these chapters uses the rice cooker to make these dishes, but they are all used in conjunction with the rice cooker.<br /><br />One of the very best aspects of this book is its discussion of the star main ingredient, rice. Like tea, virtually all varieties of rice are part of the same species. The only notable `rice' which is not `Oryza sativa' is `wild rice' which is a totally different grain native to the New World. Asian rice comes in two main varieties, `indica' and `japonica' which, while both being varieties of the same species, are about as similar as a dachshund and a whippet. Within these two main varieties are numerous little variations with properties which make cooking rice a lot more complicated than cooking beans which, in spite of their being many different species, generally can be cooked in basically the same way.<br /><br />Speaking of beans, the authors succeed in giving us information about beans that I did not even find in a book on beans. Among other things, it states that the lighter the bean, the longer it will need to cook.<br /><br />My only warning is that also like books on other appliances, some recipe adaptations are done more to show you can do this with a rice cooker than is the very best method for doing the recipe.<br /><br />This is an excellent book for any foodie or rice-cooking lover.eems to work regardless of the length of your fingers. <br /> <br />As with many books on popular appliances such as the food processor, the blender, the slow cooker, and the pressure cooker, the book includes several chapters which deal with recipes for precursors to rice cookery such as stocks and recipes for using rice cookery leftovers, such as fried rice.

While this book makes many, many good points, especially to an old style `Whole Earth Catalogue' hippie like myself, it starts of on the wrong foot with me with some exaggerations about the history of bread and milling grains at home.<br /><br />Two early statements give a misleading notion of the history of bread and home milling, where the author gives us the sense that early agricultural households were baking baguettes in 3000 BC and that the majority of households were grinding their own flour up to the early 19th century when the industrial revolution took milling under its wing. On no less an authority than Elizabeth David in `English Bread and Yeast Cookery' and various authorities writing on French and Italian bread baking, I am sure that both grain milling and bread baking became very early specialities in development of civilization. In the ancient Roman world, especially, I know that both milling and bread baking were specialized crafts since home milling produced a product very inferior to what could be done with the great water driven mills and very few homes could afford to have an oven.<br /><br />Fortunately, the value of this book is not in its historical perspective as it is in its two major agendas concerning the superior nutritional value of home ground wheat meal and the contribution to self sufficiency made by the use of a good home grain mill. I need to emphasize here that what home grain mills produce from wheat berries is NOT white all-purpose flour. This point needs to be made clearly to be sure you do not anticipate being able to buy this book to find an alternative source to your handy blue and white bag of King Arthur unbleached bread flour. In fact, one of the two points of the book is that wheat meal is nutritionally far superior to King Arthur's finest white or whole-wheat flour. The author goes to great lengths to be clear on the point that a modern mechanical process that simply cannot be reproduced by a home machine produces white flour. One result of this situation is that your beautiful, freshly milled wheat meal may simply not work in your favorite Peter Reinhart or Rose Levy Beranbaum or Peter Ortiz recipes. They will certainly not produce the classic Italian and French loaves from Parisian batards to Foccacia, let alone egg breads or holiday specialities like brioche, paska, or panettone.<br /><br />This book is assuming that you are reading it for material for a fairly basic lifestyle change. It is not for nothing that the author is recommending you consider a home mill which can be operated both manually and with electricity. It is also no accident that the author tells us of ways to buy and store up to a year's supply of grain for milling. Ms. Basey is every bit the reincarnation of the hippies we see in the second reel of the movie `Easy Rider' who embrace a lifestyle where they grow their own grain and presumably have the means of milling it themselves, which, if it is corn, is not too far fetched as the Indians in their southwestern terroir still hand mill their corn. But that doesn't work if you live in Saddle Brook, NJ or even Lancaster, Pennsylvania, which brings to mind the question of why there are no references to the Amish in this book, but that is an entirely incidental issue. My last word on the survivalist aspect of this book is that a hand cranked mill may not be much good if you install the gizmo in your basement and the power goes out. A more likely scenario is that you will have a gas powered generator to run your hand mill and provide power for your laptop computer and the oven needed to bake your bread.<br /><br />The two most important issues in the book are the major nutritional advantages of  wheat meal and the selection of the best home mill to meet your needs, which may go far beyond the simple ability to turn wheat berries into flour. A devicethat can grind hard foodstuffs into a powder or paste has immense utility in processing the whole range of food grains including corn, barley, dried beans, nuts, and seeds. The problem here is that not every device sold as a home wheat mill will handle oily nuts and seeds and do a credible job of producing nut butters.<br /><br />Getting back to bread, part of Ms. Basey's case is based on the ease with which bread can be made in modern bread machines. Unfortunately, I can't offer an opinion on this aspect, as I am have never used a bread machine and suspect that even the best bread machines are incapable of reproducing truly good artisinal or speciality breads, so I'll stick with my KitchenAid and Kenmore oven. She also does not address the situation about what to do with your bread machine when the power goes out.<br /><br />All in all, this book is a lot of fun to read and to fantasize about what the neoprimitive life would be like with your basement stocked with bags of wheat, rice, oats, and corn, bunkering your bench on which your grain mill sits in anticipation of that long anticipated weekend when you really get down to grind some flour. It's biggest problem is that while it gives us everything we need to evaluate mills ourselves, it doesn't stick its neck out to evaluate and recommend the models made by the manufacturers we can access by phone, mail, or internet.<br /><br />Like good books on pickling, cheese making, and tofu making, this is a fun book to read, even if you have no intentions of ever buying one of these gizmos. It may even succeed in talking you out of doing it.device that can grind hard foodstuffs into a powder or paste has immense utility in processing the whole range of food grains including corn, barley, dried beans, nuts, and seeds.

Buy it to read!!!	`Glorious French Food' by leading culinary educator, James Peterson may be a true lost classic, in the cookbook world similar to `The Thirteenth Warrior' in the movies or the novels of Thomas Berger, including `Little Big Man'. I noticed a copy on the bargain stacks a few days ago and immediately felt regret for not having done a review of it to help, in some very small way to raise the reputation of this excellent culinary pedagogical text.<br /><br />I have a very `love / hate' relationship with James Peterson's books. Peterson has a very well deserved reputation as the author of the classic reference, `Sauces', now in a second edition (rare for cookbooks) and his Jacques Pepin homage, `Essentials of Cooking' (for those of you who need your culinary show and tell in full color). He has also done several excellent texts on special subjects such as Vegetables, Salmon, Duck, and Soups. I have reviewed each and every one of these books favorably, yet my experience when doing specific Peterson recipes (except those in `Sauces') is mixed. I am not entirely surprised at this, as I sometimes find his individual recipe descriptions just a bit mixed up, as if his copy editor was taking a coffee break as they were editing that recipe.<br /><br />Peterson may in this book offer a great explanation for this paradox. He says that his greatest ambition would be to write a cookbook with no recipes. This is not as easy as it sounds, since I reviewed Pam Anderson's book `How to Cook Without a Book' and I found it wanting in several regards. Peterson also says that his greatest compliment is when a reader says they made one of his recipes, but changed it a bit, and it came out very well. All this means is that Peterson is a relatively unconventional cookbook author who is best approached differently than you may approach `The Joy of Cooking' or `Mastering the Art of French Cooking'.<br /><br />This book, even for its great size (almost 750 pages) is, like Madeleine Kamman's `The New Making of a Cook', a book meant to be read from front to back in an easy chair with no electronic distractions nearby. The first and most important reason for reading this book like a novel is its novel organization. Instead of chapters on Salads, Soups and Stocks, Meat, Poultry, Starches, Vegetables, and Desserts, there are a very neat 50 chapters on fifty of the most famous dishes from the French culinary canon. As you may guess from the size of the book, there is a lot more here than 50 recipes which, with a typical treatment, may take not much more than 100 pages to dispatch. Rather, most of the chapters are really about a family of dishes.<br /><br />The very first chapter takes twelve (12) pages to cover `Assorted Vegetable Salads', all falling under the rubric of the French word, `Crudites' which, roughly translated, means raw vegetables. In this chapter are nine (9) dish recipes for Celeriac Remoulade, Grated Carrots, Red Cabbage Salad, Cold Cucumbers, Marinated Mushrooms, Baby Artichokes with Walnuts, Shaved Fennel Salad, Tomato Salad, and Parisian-Style Potato Salad. There are also two `pantry' recipes for Basic Mayonnaise and Cr&egrave;me Fraiche. Like the very liberal Chris Schlesinger (`The Thrill of the Grill', `How to Cook Meat', etc) and unlike the very traditional Madeleine Kamman, Peterson is extremely liberating with his advice. He tells us how to improvise cr&egrave;me fraiche and he tells us all the reasons why some substitutes, such as American sour cream, will just not work as well in some recipes. He does not tell us not to improvise. He also follows the party line on the right potato for the right dish, but he also says that you can probably get away with using any kind of potato for any kind of dish, which fits my experience in using a russet for both mashed potatoes (with a good potato ricer) and potato salad, two recipes for which russets are supposed to be inferior to waxy or `all purpose' varieties.<br /><br />Part of what makes many great cookbooks such a pleasure to read is the extent to which the author introduces their own informed opinion into the writing. Both `Mastering the Art of French Cooking' and `The New Making of a Cook' would be great cookbooks without the lively opinions of Julia Child and Madeleine Kamman, but they are much better at getting their subject across than a dry presentation of quantities and procedures. If you think this is unimportant, take a quick look at a few recipes in `The Joy of Cooking' and you will see an ample amount of humor in even this encyclopedic collection of recipes.<br /><br />One thing I especially enjoyed in this book was the affirmation of the doctrine in Ms. Kamman's book that in spite of all the butter, pork fat, goose fat, or olive oil in popular recipes, French cooking is NOT about high fat content. Peterson is especially good on fats in general and butter in particular, as he hits all the right notes about cooking with butter. For one thing, he discounts the common practice so popular with TV culinary personalities of mixing butter and oil to raise the burn point of butter solids. He says it simply does not keep the butter solids from going black. He also clearly differentiates plain clarified butter from the Indian staple, ghee, where the butterfat is taken to a darker brown than is done by simple clarification.<br /><br />I even found something new on my favorite cookbook subject, omelets. Peterson gives two different techniques and clearly differentiates both the method and the cultural differences in French cooking between the omelet and scrambled eggs.<br /><br />The bad news is that if this book may be in danger of loosing its market, and it may go out of print. The good news is that you should be able to get a copy from our beloved Amazon.com for cheap.cookbooks such a pleasure to read is the extent to which the author introduces their own informed opinion into the writing.

Buy It!	`The New Making of a Cook' by Madeleine Kamman is hands down the very best first cookbook for everyone from rank beginners to experienced amateurs who learned cooking at their mother's knee. If you do not own a copy of this book and are serious about cooking, stop reading this review now, go to the top of the page, and click on the button to add this to your shopping cart.<br /><br />No cookbook can do everything, but at over 1200 pages, this volume comes about as close as you can expect a good cookbook to cover every major important subject, including a healthy dose of material on nutrition, sanitation, ingredients, cooking with wine, cooking equipment, references, and the `why' of cooking. And, Ms. Kamman gives us expert opinions on each and every subject. On every topic with which I typically evaluate a cookbook, this one gets between an A- and an A+, and it covers each and every one of those points.<br /><br />The weakest part of this book may be its title. Were you to browse cookbook titles without noticing the heft of this volume, you may mistake it for a memoir, such as Ms. Kamman's excellent `When French Women Cook' which is a memoir with great recipes from all around France. In fact, it is a superb course in cooking, and it is, in fact, used as the textbook for many cooking schools. The books to which this volume should be compared are the Culinary Institute of America's `The New Professional Chef', Wayne Gisslen's `The Chef's Art' and Anne Willan's `The Good Cook'. The first two of these are very reliable, but just a bit too much oriented to the professional. The last is excellent on technique, but leaves out just about every other subject covered by Kamman.<br /><br />While the material in this book is heavily based on modern and classical French cuisine and technique, it is not another book on French cooking. That is, it does not compete directly with rival Julia Child's `Mastering the Art of French Cooking', which remains, in spite of Kamman's book, still the best source of training in French cuisine and recipes. The book also does not compete with that other great manual of French technique, Jacque Pepin's `Complete Techniques', although these two books side by side virtually cover the entire range of good culinary instruction. One would need to go far to improve on a collection with these two books plus the `Larousse Gastronomique'.<br /><br />Possibly the only weakness I found in this volume was the fact that the brief chapter on cooking with wine seemed to deal entirely with wines from France and California, plus the fortified wines of the Iberian peninsula (port and sherry). While I cannot fault the author too much for this short chapter in such a wide-ranging book, I did feel an important chance was missed.<br /><br />However, the author more than made it up to me in her truly remarkable and comprehensive bibliography. For the serious student of cookery, this feature alone was worth the price of admission. Kamman missed virtually no major author available to modern American customers of Amazon.com. Child, David, Olney, Hazan, Kennedy, Bayless, Beranbaum, Reinhart, Ducasse, Pepin, Claiborne and many others are all here. The only notable absence was Alan Davidson's three-volume reference on fish of the Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Southeast Asia. One cannot even complain about the number of titles in French and Italian, as there are plenty of English language sources.<br /><br />This is virtually the only cookbook I can think of where it may pay you to start at the front and moving through the book, prepare as many different dishes as your finances and market will allow. It is that close to, for example, studying an excellent book on Chess, where each chapter covers an important part of the game, with gradually more difficult exercises.<br /><br />One of the things about the book which most appealed to my neo-primitive `Whole Earth Catalogue' attitude was the fact that the book gave such good recipes for so many commonly available commercial products such as soft whipped butter and quick stocks.<br /><br />And, on the `hard stuff', Mme. Kamman is uncompromising in her insistence on quality, as when she gives general rules for dealing with stocks. And yet, while she gives us the professional's take on stock making, she is quite well aware of the fact that the amateur will simply not make stock that often, and tells us how to handle things when we make stock two or three times a year.<br /><br />The very best perspective I gained from this book is the fact that French cooking, at least French cooking of the last 50 years is simply not about high fat content. Just the contrary is true. In fact, Ms. Kamman seems to have figured out the story of French women and fat long before the recent popular book on the subject came out earlier this year.<br /><br />Just one more comparison to place this book. While it has many hundreds of recipes, it is not like `The Joy of Cooking' or any other `1000 Recipe' collections. It gives great detailed treatises on all major culinary techniques important to the cooking of Western Europe, but it does not, for example, give us 15 different recipes for an omelet. It just gives us one of the very best essays on how to make a good omelet with a few pointers which even escaped Elizabeth David's excellent little treatise on the subject.<br /><br />If you can only afford a single cookbook, but you really need one, this should be the one. If you are embarking on cooking as a hobby, this should be your first!ipes for so many commonly available commercial products such as soft whipped butter and quick stocks. <br /> <br />And, on the `hard stuff', Mme.

Purdy is my `go to' book for pie recipes, even after reviewing at least a half dozen very good pastry and dessert books by the likes of Wayne Harley Brachman, Nick Malgieri, Rose Levy Beranbaum, Judith Fertig, Flo Braker, Gayle Ortiz, and the very French Christine Ferber. In fact, I recently went to Wayne Harley Brachman's `American Desserts' for a peach pie recipe and felt just a bit disappointed with the prospects of his recipe. While I think his book is an excellent tutorial on American recipes, I was just a bit apprehensive about his very simple pastry recipe, after having made Ms. Purdy's basic crust for everything from apple pies to tomato tarts to corn pies. I was even a bit apprehensive of Brachman's technique for blanching peaches for peeling, as it called for cutting the fruit in half before blanching. I was really afraid that this would either rob the fruit of some of its juices or make them damper than they naturally were, especially as I was dealing with very ripe fruit, just on that fine edge between ripe and rotten.<br /><br />So, I rush back to my aging copy of this book and use my old favorite for both the crust and the filling. I have tended to discount Ms. Purdy, as she did not seem to have the cachet of writers such as Nick Malgieri or Rose Levy Beranbaum or Flo Braker, who are routinely cited by other authors as their favorite authority on pastry making. It is true that Ms. Purdy may not spend 10 pages discoursing on the nature of flours or another 10 pages on all the different influences on making pastry dough. But in looking back at the front of her book, I see that this material has not been overlooked. I see that since I started using her book years ago, before I started picking through cookbook texts with a finely toothed comb to review the material, I had gone straight to her superb `Basic All Purpose Flaky Pastry Recipe' and have been using it successfully ever since. I have even used this as the benchmark against which I judged all other `pate brisee' recipes.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I never sat down to read this volume as carefully as I would later pastry texts, so I never came to appreciate how good a pie reference this is. And yet, I keep coming back to it for my seasonal apple, pumpkin, mincemeat, and corn pie recipes. Upon doing that, I discover really great discussions of all sorts of pie and pastry crusts, including the ephemeral strudel and puff pastries. And, not only are the diagrams on the techniques better than average, the `facts and figures' on making variations in the recipes are up to a professional level, without the professional patois of proportions found in books for bakers.<br /><br />The very best things about this book is that it is an excellent source of recipes for all the standard crusts and fillings, with methods for hand, food processor, and stand mixer approaches. The primary warning about this book is that good pie crust making is not that easy. I make pies only once in a while, and often forget the practical lessons from the last time I make a standard butter pie crust, which depends a lot on ambient temperature, humidity, and flour properties. Thus, in spite of reading all the experts, my Susan Purdy crust for my most recent pie, made on the very latest Silpat silicone pastry mat, was less than ideal, as I probably added too much water or started working it when the dough got too warm out of the fridge. I also suspect Ms. Purdy's basic pie crust recipe may have too many options and that one should really work on making a successful crust with nothing more than flour, water, and fats. Adding the egg and the vinegar or lemon gives one the sense that you have insurance against the failings of poor technique. They are added to cut down on gluten formation and do nothing for the perils of too much moisture or too much heat when manipulating the dough.<br /><br />All in all, as I have been using this book successfullyfor years, I highly recommend it for anyone who wishes to occasionally bake an apple pie or other holiday favorite.essfully for years, I highly recommend it for anyone who wishes to occasionally bake an apple pie or other holiday favorite. <br />	2005-09-06

Thus, Ms. Lee's book is not a `Mastering the Art of Korean Cooking' as done by the likes of Julia Child for France, Diane Kochilas for Greece, Penelope Casas for Spain, Marcella Hazan for Italy, and Diana Kennedy for Mexico. This is a `home cooking' memoir as done, for example, by Suzanne Dunaway for Roman homes, Vincent Schiavelli for Sicilian homes, Susan Hermann Loomis for Norman cooking, and Eleanora Russo Scarpetta for New Jersey Italian-American home cooking.<br /><br />Thus, this is very different from the three glossy, Golden Book styled Korean cookbooks by Noh Chin-hwa and Copyreader Shirley A. Dorow entitled `Healthful Korean Cooking, Meats & Poultry', `Low-Fat Korean Cooking Fish, shellfish & Vegetables', and `Traditional Korean Cooking, Snacks and Basic Side Dishes'. And, for the average amateur cook who happens to want to know what all the excitement is about Kinchee, this is actually much better than the glossy Hoh Chin-hwa books.<br /><br />There is really an eerie parallel between this book and the usual personal Italian cookbook. For the ten different recipes for spaghetti, we have ten or more different recipes for rice dishes. For the seven different recipes for artichokes or spinach, we have seven different recipes for Kimchee. And, very few of these recipes are difficult. One may have the impression that since Kimchee is a fermented dish, not unlike sauerkraut, that it is difficult to make. Some of the Kimchee recipes do take a bit of time, but several do not. The really complicated recipes are reserved for the mixed rice bowl, which may be the Korean equivalent of the French cassoulet or pot-au-feu or bouillabaise, a dish which is not complicated, but which requires lots of intermediate steps which are certainly beyond the '30 minute meal' crowd.<br /><br />The book has a very personal approach to its recipes since, like every good story about Italian recipes, the author claims every Korean mother has her own way of making classic dishes, and believes her way is the best. But, there is enough material on the influences of geography and climate on regional Korean cuisine that the inbred foodie will get their fix of information on how mountains and temperature affect kimchee recipes just as Italian climate and geography affect the distribution of hard and soft pastas in Italy. Like all good books on non-English cuisines, this book also gives Korean names, in English script, of all the various dishes and ingredients. And, to the non-Korean eye, the names give the sense of being straight out of an Ikea Scandinavian furniture store catalogue. In editing the book, the author and her copy editor may have been just a bit too loose in using Korean names in the text, forcing the English reader to often jump to the Korean recipe index for explanations of these words.<br /><br />The personal stories and photographs give us a better than average touch to the book. There are Italian-Americans, both amateur and professional, who give us the expected run of stories about life in Tuscany that simply does not have the warmth of personal experience about it. The stories in this book are about as genuine as they get, radiating genuine warmth from the author for her very, very large extended family and most especially for her parents, siblings, and husband.<br /><br />Additional material for the student of world cuisines comes from the affinities of some Korean dishes with those of both China and Japan. While the author does not use the word sushi to describe any of her dishes, there are clear affinities between this Japanese speciality and Korean seaweed rolled rice and raw fish dishes. One thing I am happy to see is that there is no mention of any Korean `barbecue' as the technique of grilling at the table is clearly not `barbecue' as done in North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, or Kansas City. The list of Korean cooking implements doesn't even mention the little tabletop grill or even the wok. Instead, the most distinctive cooking implement is the stone pot for making hot pot dishes.<br /><br />While I never felt the strong need for photographs of dishes in a cookbook, I am annoyed that this book gives a single very poorly taken photograph of the technique for dicing green onion. I was also surprised that the book did not spend more time up front to describe the type of rice used in local Korean cuisine. Unless one goes to the very back of the book to look up rice in the list of ingredients, one may be tempted to plop a cup of Uncle Ben's into these rice recipes instead of finding a good Asian short grain rice.<br /><br />The author does an excellent job of providing a list of suppliers of Korean foods and cooking utensils by state, but does less well in suggesting substitutions. There is no word about whether the very common Italian arborio rice or Thai rice would work in Korean recipes, or which of the hundreds of Mexican chiles would substitute well for the Korean chilis used to make Kimchee.<br /><br />I recommend this book over the lavishly photographed books from Noh Chin-hwa for virtually every reader except for those who may wish to strictly reproduce `classic' Korean dishes and do Korean `barbecue'. I especially like the many recipes for both rice and kimchee, as this gives me a sense of everyday cuisine much better than the more complicated dishes.<br /><br />Highly recommended.this Japanese speciality and Korean seaweed rolled rice and raw fish dishes.

If you do not own a copy of this book and are serious about cooking, stop reading this review now, go to the top of the page, and click on the button to add this to your shopping cart. <br /> <br />No cookbook can do everything, but at over 1200 pages, this volume comes about as close as you can expect a good cookbook to cover every major important subject, including a healthy dose of material on nutrition, sanitation, ingredients, cooking with wine, cooking equipment, references, and the `why' of cooking. And, Ms. Kamman gives us expert opinions on each and every subject. On every topic with which I typically evaluate a cookbook, this one gets between an A- and an A+, and it covers each and every one of those points. <br /> <br />The weakest part of this book may be its title. Were you to browse cookbook titles without noticing the heft of this volume, you may mistake it for a memoir, such as Ms. Kamman's excellent `When French Women Cook' which is a memoir with great recipes from all around France. In fact, it is a superb course in cooking, and it is, in fact, used as the textbook for many cooking schools. The books to which this volume should be compared are the Culinary Institute of America's `The New Professional Chef', Wayne Gisslen's `The Chef's Art' and Anne Willan's `The Good Cook'. The first two of these are very reliable, but just a bit too much oriented to the professional. The last is excellent on technique, but leaves out just about every other subject covered by Kamman. <br /> <br />While the material in this book is heavily based on modern and classical French cuisine and technique, it is not another book on French cooking. That is, it does not compete directly with rival Julia Child's `Mastering the Art of French Cooking', which remains, in spite of Kamman's book, still the best source of training in French cuisine and recipes. The book also does not compete with that other great manual of French technique, Jacque Pepin's `Complete Techniques', although these two books side by side virtually cover the entire range of good culinary instruction. One would need to go far to improve on a collection with these two books plus the `Larousse Gastronomique'. <br /> <br />Possibly the only weakness I found in this volume was the fact that the brief chapter on cooking with wine seemed to deal entirely with wines from France and California, plus the fortified wines of the Iberian peninsula (port and sherry). While I cannot fault the author too much for this short chapter in such a wide-ranging book, I did feel an important chance was missed. <br /> <br />However, the author more than made it up to me in her truly remarkable and comprehensive bibliography. For the serious student of cookery, this feature alone was worth the price of admission. Kamman missed virtually no major author available to modern American customers of Amazon.com. Child, David, Olney, Hazan, Kennedy, Bayless, Beranbaum, Reinhart, Ducasse, Pepin, Claiborne and many others are all here. The only notable absence was Alan Davidson's three-volume reference on fish of the Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Southeast Asia. One cannot even complain about the number of titles in French and Italian, as there are plenty of English language sources. <br /> <br />This is virtually the only cookbook I can think of where it may pay you to start at the front and moving through the book, prepare as many different dishes as your finances and market will allow. It is that close to, for example, studying an excellent book on Chess, where each chapter covers an important part of the game, with gradually more difficult exercises. <br /> <br />One of the things about the book which most appealed to my neo-primitive `Whole Earth Catalogue' attitude was the fact that the book gave such good recipes for so many commonly available commercial products such as soft whipped butter and quick stocks. <br /> <br />And, on the `hard stuff', Mme. Kamman is uncompromising in her insistence on quality, as when she gives general rules for dealing with stocks. And yet, while she gives us the professional's take on stock making, she is quite well aware of the fact that the amateur will simply not make stock that often, and tells us how to handle things when we make stock two or three times a year. <br /> <br />The very best perspective I gained from this book is the fact that French cooking, at least French cooking of the last 50 years is simply not about high fat content. Just the contrary is true. In fact, Ms. Kamman seems to have figured out the story of French women and fat long before the recent popular book on the subject came out earlier this year. <br /> <br />Just one more comparison to place this book. While it has many hundreds of recipes, it is not like `The Joy of Cooking' or any other `1000 Recipe' collections. It gives great detailed treatises on all major culinary techniques important to the cooking of Western Europe, but it does not, for example, give us 15 different recipes for an omelet. It just gives us one of the very best essays on how to make a good omelet with a few pointers which even escaped Elizabeth David's excellent little treatise on the subject. <br /> <br />If you can only afford a single cookbook, but you really need one, this should be the one. If you are embarking on cooking as a hobby, this should be your first! <br />	2005-09-05

While my original reaction on rereading these stories after their laying fallow on my shelves for many years is that they are very much in the Gothic tradition of Edgar Alan Poe's stories, but I think that may be just a bit too strong. While, to my less than scholarly familiarity with Gothic short stories, I think Carter is able to conjure up the same dark sense of Poe's stories, I think Carter is just a bit less original than Poe. Carter, I am certain makes no apologies about the fact that she is giving us reworkings of old stories. Old wine in new bottles, as it were.<br /><br />The new bottle includes just a bit more tittilation than we get from the originals, and certainly much more lush and inventive language.<br /><br />As an old hand at reviewing cookbooks, I am especially fond of her many uses of culinary allusions, as when she speaks of her heroine's being peeled like an artichoke, down to the heart.<br /><br />The first reason I did not give this book five stars is because these are reworkings of old stories, and, as talented as her writing is, she is not Shakespeare. The second reason is that some of her endings are just a bit contrived. In the first, title story, our heroine escapes from her punishment for opening her Pandora's box by a pure 'deux ex machina', a rescue from out of the blue, with little preparation to make it more plausible.<br /><br />Still, this is darn good reading, and I am happy to know of Ms. Carter's work.	2005-08-31

I acquired my copy when I was a junior in high school, on the advice of a buddy who was even more bookish than I, and we used it to hone our penny ante games with a bet limit of a nickel.<br /><br />I have not spent a lot of time with any other books on poker, as I never felt the need for any better advice on the game than what I got from this book.<br /><br />While the author, who went on to become a major American cryptanalyst (code breaker), has put a lifetime of statistical experience into his suggestions in this book, most of the recommendations can be summarized in a few simple sentences.<br /><br />And, using these principles for all the basic games such as five card draw, seven card stud, five card stud, and low ball, I have almost always won. These suggestions work so well that I required no convincing to believe that unlike virtually all other casino games, playing poker is NOT gambling, if you know what you are doing.<br /><br />On top of all that, the book is entertaining to read. And, in addition to guidance on the statistics of the game, the author gives sound advice on how and when to bluff. This advice is not deep, but for the average game, it is more than enough.<br /><br />While there are probably now hundreds of fair to good books on playing poker, I strongly suggest this to any newcomer to the game, as it served me very well when I knew nothing about poker or probablility.<br /><br />The only reservation one may have about the book is that it really only deals in depth with the most familiar older games. While a clear thinker should have no problem translating the author's suggestions to games such as Texas hold-um, I cannot guarantee all the advice will transpose effectively.<br /><br />But, I am certain you can get a copy of this little gem very cheaply. And, it is worth every penny.very cheaply. And, it is worth every penny.	2005-08-30

Buy It!	`When French Women Cook' by Madeleine Kamman is one of the very best in a genre which may be called culinary anthropology, a genre closely related to the memoir and the survey of local cuisines, but still a bit different. It is more than a memoir in that it provides many useful recipes serving a much greater purpose than simply illustrations of an event or a point, as you find in, for example, Ruth Reichl's excellent memoirs. They are also a bit less than a full survey of a culinary terroir, as you may find in Paula Wolfert's excellent books, in that they tend to deal with the recipes of a specific group of people. The three other leading examples of this little genre are Patience Gray's `Honey from a Stone', Richard Olney's `Lulu's Provencal Kitchen', and Amanda Hesser's `The Gardner and the Cook'.<br /><br />Madeleine Kamman is an odd duck in the pantheon of English language writers on French cuisine. She is really a cookbook author of the first order, especially with her excellent text `The New Making of a Cook', but she has always been a bit in the shadow of Julia Child, Elizabeth David, and Richard Olney. According to Child's biographer, there was even a substantial amount of rancor towards Child on Kamman's part, after the success of Child's book and TV shows and before Kamman achieved recognition with her original `The Making of a Cook'.<br /><br />Like the other three notable books in this genre, this is a cookbook which is meant to be read from cover to cover. It's culinary content and its anecdotal introductions to each of the chapters are all great reading. The book tells the story of eight French women cooks, all of whom Mme. Kamman, who is herself, of French birth, knew before she left France for the United States in 1960 (coincidentally about the same time as Jacques Pepin, another major French culinary import to the US). As Shirley Corriher points out in her new Foreword, by some happy chance, the eight women came from a very diverse collection of French culinary centers. And, this diversity is easily one of the most useful and enjoyable aspects of the book. One sees clearly the difference between the cuisine of Normandy, laden with its apples and butter, and the cuisine of Alsace, for example, with its sauerkraut and sausages, so similar to its German neighbor's cuisine. So, this book becomes a major dissertation on examples of terroir, the French doctrine that is conveniently paraphrased as `What grows together, goes together'.<br /><br />Ms. Kamman confirms the role of this book by insisting that there are many ingredients to many of these recipes that simply cannot be had in the United States. A major issue, for example is her claim that it is senseless for us to create `cr&egrave;me fraiche' in our kitchens, as there is simply no way we can reproduce the flavor and result obtained from the true French product. How idiosyncratic this position is can be seen from the fact that many cookbooks I have seen which presented French cuisine gives a recipe for `cr&egrave;me fraiche'. Interestingly enough, however, is the fact that Julia Child, in `Mastering the Art of French Cooking' allows that American cream typically doesn't match the butterfat content of the French product, but does allow that one can approximate the product by mixing in a little buttermilk and letting the mix stand for a bit. In Ms. Kamman's favor, she simply tells us to use heavy cream when the recipe calls for `cr&egrave;me fraiche'.<br /><br />But getting back to the recipes, I find virtually all of them delightful to read and delicious in anticipating my trying them and tasting the results. Since the book's chapters and recipes are organized by person and by region in France, the recipes are not organized for easy location for a good dish for chicken or veal or artichokes. Gratins, my favorite type of dish, for example, appear among the recipes for each of the eight chapters. This being so, it is almost a shame that Mme. Kamman took such great pains to give us a measure of the cost and the difficulty of the recipes, as one will generally not use this book to find quick or cheap recipes. For that, we go to Rachael Ray.<br /><br />Nevertheless, these recipes are really top drawer in both selection and in the detail with which the author describes the procedures. One thing I really like about the text which may be a little intimidating to some readers is that while Ms. Kamman is very careful in describing things, she does expect a modicum of knowledge about French cooking. Not every French culinary term is translated and you may have to consult her textbook for her preferences on what to put in the `bouquet garni', or even to find out what a `bouquet garni' is.<br /><br />One of the surest tests of whether or not I like a cookbook is whether I anticipate the recipe for a dish and actually find a recipe for that very dish in the book. This happened as I ran across a gratin recipe for mushrooms and potatoes. This seemed to be such a natural dish that I thought it was inevitable that there should be such a recipe, and there was.<br /><br />This book is highly recommended for anyone who likes to read about cooking in general.difficulty of the recipes, as one will generally not use this book to find quick or cheap recipes.

90198:US	39134375	R1TGAQ4CHKLY79	1558322450	233808903	Not Your Mother's Slow Cooker Cookbook (NYM Series)	Books	5	470	513	N	Y	Excellent Encyclopedia on Useful Technique. Buy It!	`Not Your Mother's Slow Cooker Cookbook' by expert bread cookbook author Beth Hensperger and Julie Kaufmann is hands down the very best book on its subject you are likely to find. It is easily twice the size of my former slow cooker favorite, Judith Finlayson's `The 150 best Slow Cooker recipes' and easily more than twice as good, although this former favorite does have some virtues not in the current subject, such as both English and metric units of measure for all ingredients.<br /><br />This is a cookery subject on which you do not expect to find a serious treatment by a major cookbook author. Like blender recipes and toaster oven recipes and grill pan recipes and pressure cooker recipes, you usually find books which are little more than one step removed from a manufacturer's booklet, published by the likes of Sunset Press or other speciality publisher, not by the Harvard Commons Press. But, like Jean Anderson's book, `Process This' on food processor cookery, this is a first rate addition to any good cookbook library. In fact, not only is it better than Finlayson's book, it is a lot better than Anderson's book on the food processor.<br /><br />The quality of the book should be no surprise, given the track record of the principle author, Beth Hensperger. While she is not the leading currently active writer of books on bread (that honor would probably go to Peter Reinhart), she is easily one of the top three or four on the subject and has the James Beard awards to prove it. Co-author Kaufmann is less distinguished, but in reading her biographical sketch, it is clear this is a natural book for this pair, as they have already done a volume on rice cookers, and there are probably no two closer electrical cooking gadgets quite so close to one another as the rice cooker and the slow cooker. It probably also explains why there is relatively little in this book which tells one how to use a slow cooker as a rice cooker, since they already did a book on the subject AND, in spite of the strong similarities, there are enough differences to keep one from easily substituting one for the other.<br /><br />Aside from the rice cooker stand-in role, this book has simply everything I expected it to have. Every single recipe and every single type of recipe you might expect is here. One thing I hoped for and found, in spades, was a group of recipes for stocks and broths. This is something I have found in no other slow cooker book, as obvious as it is to include it.<br /><br />In spite of the fact that this is an excellent book which I would recommend to anyone wishing to cook with a slow cooker, I must insert the caveat here that while the slow cooker can be a modern version of time honored traditional cooking methods such as the braise, the daub, the tagine, and the Dutch oven techniques, many other recipes in this book are adaptations of techniques which may really be better done by other means. That is, the time saving gained by using the slow cooker may, in some cases, be gained by losing some culinary virtue. The best example I know is with the recipes for barbecued pork ribs. Adapting barbecue to the slow cooker is a natural, as both are low heat long cooking methods. But, you are approximating true barbecue and not producing a real barbecued result, as there is no smoke involved in the cooking. I will give one more plug to Ms. Finlayson's book on her pork rib barbecue recipe which I have done several times and I find it superior to the recipe for the same dish by Hensperger and Kaufmann. So, if you have Finlayson, Hensperger may not be a major advantage. But, if you have no slow cooker book and you want one, Ms. Hensperger and Ms. Kaufmann have given us the best one I have seen.<br /><br />It is quite possible that the single most valuable section in this book is in the chapter `From the Porridge Pot'. This gives several different recipes for breakfast dishes with oats, granola, and other varieties of porridge. I saw Alton Brown do this on his `Good Eats' show on oats and I really wished I could find someone with some more details on the technique. Well, here it is. Everything you always wanted to know about making hot breakfast meals with oats, millet, wheat, rice, barley and corn set up the night before and ready for you in the morning.<br /><br />The next best thing are all the general tips on slow cooking, including suggestions on how to adapt conventional braise, stew, and soup recipes to the slow cooker. One warning from this book which I will repeat here is that while the book includes recipes for several seafood dishes, almost all of them involve adding the seafood near the end of the long cooking period, so there are a fair number of recipes which require some mid-course or landing procedure intervention. But, the authors cover this point again and again.<br /><br />I am happy to see that the authors avoid endorsing any one slow cooker manufacturer, although they do give some tips on evaluating and selecting a slow cooker and the size of slow cooker best suited to various requirements.<br /><br />If you like to use the slow cooker or think it will fit into your lifestyle or just enjoy having a good book on every different cooking subject, then this is a book for you.<br /><br />Highly recommended.do this on his `Good Eats' show on oats and I really wished I could find someone with some more details on the technique.

Buy it!!!	`Lulu's Provencal Table' by renowned culinary writer and editor, Richard Olney is one of the best works in the very select genre of what might be called `culinary anthropology'. The works I know in this field are few in number but very high in quality and in the rewards for interested readers.<br /><br />The leading work in this field is certainly `Honey from a Weed' by Patience Gray. Other notable titles are `The Cook and the Gardener' by Amanda Hesser and `The Tuscan Year' by Elizabeth Romer. Befitting Olney's influence, almost all of John Thorne's essays also belong to this tribe of writing. Also befitting this influence, it is Thorne who writes the new introduction to this very substantial work. In this piece, Thorne cites Madeleine Kamman's `When French Women Cook' as another member of this select tribe. I cite this in deference to Thorne's expertise in the area and I hope to review it very soon.<br /><br />Like my reviewing of `Honey from a Weed', I owned the book for almost a year before I opened it up and I deeply regret my delay, as this is a vicarious culinary pleasure of the first order. The subject / cook / interviewee of the book is Lucie Tempier Peyraud, known to all as `Lulu', the wife of the important French vintner, Lucian Peyraud and co-owner of Domaine Tempier, a vineyard and dwelling `nestled in the hillsides outside the neighboring fishing ports of Bandol and Sanary, some ten miles from Toulon and thirty miles from Marseilles.' Author Olney became friends with the Peyrauds shortly after purchasing a very run-down cottage near Domaine Tempier, before he was the renowned culinary writer he was to become with his books on French cuisine and his editorship of the Time-Life series of books on world cuisines.<br /><br />Olney was talked into doing this book by another Peyraud friend, Alice Waters, whose Chez Panisse has been a buyer of Peyraud wines for many years. The inspiration for the book is Lulu's great cooking experienced by Olney for decades, and experienced by Waters during frequent trips to Provence on wine testing and purchasing expeditions. In fact, according to Thorne, it was Waters who initiated the project and talked Olney into carrying it to publication.<br /><br />On the surface, the book may appear to be just another Provencal cookbook, similar to several titles from the likes of Patricia Wells and Lydie Marshall. And, it can be used in this way, but it is much, much more.<br /><br />The book was built out of interviews by Olney of Lulu as she prepared her various dishes. As Lulu was the consummately instinctive cook, she rarely knew on a conscious level exactly how much of a particular ingredient she uses for most recipes. As one reads Olney's asides on this archeological aspect of the interviews, one senses they are reading the captured essences of an ephemeral form of cooking which arises out of a great love of the art and the ingredients to the cooking.<br /><br />This is also what makes this such a great `reading' cookbook, yet it is not a culinary memoir with recipes added in here and there, which always play second fiddle to the narrative. Every other recipe offers important hints on general cooking technique such as the suggestion to leave the outer membrane on squid to add to the flavor and to search out the leafy bible tripe from the cow's third stomach, a very delicate addition to the traditional honeycombed tripe from the second stomach. While this is a relatively simple form of cooking, it is not primitive, as many recipes especially the famous French daubes take many hours to prepare, even with the addition of major modern kitchen equipment such as the blender and the food processor, which Lulu and Olney use frequently.<br /><br />Waters describes Lulu's cuisine as `la cuisine de bonne femme', which may be loosely translated into what Emeril Lagasse labels as `a food of love thing'. This is part of the reason this is both simple, but requiring a great amount of attention. This style of cooking will fail if it gets only half your attention, the other half being spent with Opra, the Knicks and Lakers basketball game, or an errant adolescent not quite old enough to be counted on to stay out of trouble on its own. This means that this book jumps to the top of the list of books I recommend to people who like to read cookbooks. It also jumps to the top of my list as a source for Provencal cooking. Since both author and subject are true to the terroir of coastal Provence, there may be a few recipes, such as the classic nine page long recipe for Bouillabaisse which you will not be able to duplicate as you may simply not be able to get whole rascasses, wrasses, combers, and John Dory's. Scribe Olney is true to his mission of describing how Lulu actually cooks, but he does transpose an aside here and there for us New World suburbanites so we may approximate the classic dishes.<br /><br />I heartily agree with Thorne when he says that the first sixty pages of the book can easily be left to a later time, as it is largely a `pro forma' recitation of the history of Lulu, Lucian, and their Bandol vineyard. The real action starts on page 61 with `Lulu's Kitchen: Recipes'. This recipe by recipe table of contents demonstrates that this is a really serious cookbook that just happens to be a great culinary read as well. The recipes cover all standard courses and food ingredients, with each and every recipe being a part of Lulu's real cuisine. There are no fillers here, so you will find no bread baking recipes, as it is apparent that Lulu did not bake her own bread.<br /><br />This is an important culinary book, a superb mix of cookbook and memoir of the Provencal terroir and style.

Dorow form a rather oddly titled collection of pretty good recipes covering the width and breadth of Korean cuisine. One really wishes these three volumes had been published as a single volume, especially as there is no index spanning the three volumes. These books are entitled `Healthful Korean Cooking, Meats & Poultry', `Low-Fat Korean Cooking Fish, shellfish & Vegetables', and `Traditional Korean Cooking, Snacks and Basic Side Dishes'.<br /><br />Aside from the very non-European way of organizing these topics, the most difficult thing may be the mislabelling of various Korean techniques. Classic Korean barbecue is really a high heat fast cooking method, much more like grilling than smoke-based slow cooking barbecue. It's most distinguishing feature is that it is done on the tabletop on a grill very similar to the Japanese Hibachi. In other places, the name `broiling' is given to what is essentially another instance of grilling.<br /><br />While I have eaten several meals at a Korean restaurant, I have never reviewed other books on Korean cuisine, so I can only judge this as if I were judging a book on French or Italian or Southern American cuisine.<br /><br />One very dramatic feature of all three volumes is the fact that each and every recipe is accompanied with a series of very good color pictures illustrating the main steps in the procedure. This is in addition to a larger picture of the completed dish. Another very good aspect of the photographs in these books is that all the dishes are plated on similarly colored and shaped plates, so the essential difference from photo to photo is in the food and not in the crockery.<br /><br />The photographer really gets a chance to do his stuff with the double page pics of typical table settings.<br /><br />While it does me little good, I liked the fact that each dish is clearly named with an English name, a Korean name in English script, and the Korean name in Korean pictographs. For Korean speaking readers, I suspect this is a good thing.<br /><br />The one thing I found most annoying about the way the recipes were written is in the fact that the list of ingredients is not in tabular form. That is, the amount and name of the first ingredient begins at the beginning of the first line, followed immediately by the amount and name of the second ingredient without a line break, if there is room remaining on the first line.<br /><br />Ultimately, the most annoying thing about this collection is that the division of dishes between the volumes makes little sense to a Western cook, there is no combined index, and so much material in the introductions, glossaries, and table setting pics is duplicated in all three books.<br /><br />And yet, until I review any more Korean cookbooks, these volumes' strengths outweigh its weaknesses if you are an amateur cook and really want to reproduce dishes from your local Korean eatery.

104779:US	39134375	R1H3A38QHCAJEF	1573441686	132566034	Safe Word: An Erotic S/M Novel	Books	5	24	31	N	Y	Excellent Writing, but not the very best in show!	`Safe Word' by Molly Weatherfield is the sequel to `Carrie's Story'. When I reviewed the latter title, it was obvious that a sequel was in the works, as the story seems to so obviously stop in the middle of things. This novel is not quite so obviously designed to support a sequel, as it seems to give Carrie, the principle character, a clean break with all her paramours and dominants from these two novels. The opening for a third is simply made by leaving Carrie at the start of what may be a normal romantic relation with a new partner.<br /><br />Like the first novel, this work is head and shoulders above practically all other novels in it's genre, as it successfully creates a backdrop to Carrie's submissive relations and uses this framework to create bridges between the more graphic events. In fact, it is no accident that the author quotes items and scenes from the famous novel `The Story of O' by Pauline Reage, as this is certainly the work against which this needs to be measured.<br /><br />While both my visceral and intellectual response to this novel was positive, I could not help but find some weaknesses. The largest by far is the implausibility of the hidden culture of wealthy masters and permanent submissives who together travel around from one party and event to the next, and spend the time in between training the submissives to be better imitations of domestic animals. One of the great virtues of `The Story of O' is the plausibility of the backstory. While it did posit two households dedicated to training and housing submissives, these households were relatively small, and easily hidden in remote French country houses and chateau. Reage's story also has her heroine maintain her `day job' in between erotic incidents and vacations.<br /><br />In truth, I may be just a bit too demanding, as this genre has its conventions just as science fiction or fantasy posits either impossible laws of physics or magic and spells out what things would be like if we make these assumptions. And, is this not really a fantasy. My only complaint is that the easier it is to suspend disbelief, as well as a character here and there, the more enjoyable is the story. I am surprised that, to my knowledge, no fiction writer in this genre has used the writers, actors, director, and crew engaged in making a bondage film as the scene for a novel. This is a legitimate venue for all sorts of variations and a strong plot element could be built out of putting something on the screen that is not so made up as one may think.<br /><br />Even if I successfully suspended disbelief for the purpose of this story, I still missed a good representation of the psychology of submission that Reage does so well. I note one paragraph on page 31 which enters Carrie's mind and describes her reaction to some aspects of her submission, but by in large, this is all just a matter of fact recitation of events by Carrie to Jonathan or Jonathan to Carrie. Once we get the general picture of this world, most of which was explained in the first book, things run pretty much on autopilot. This visceral reaction means that the level of excitement created by the graphic scenes was not very high. At no point did it seem that the author created the kind of anticipation or realization that really turned on the juice for the reader. To compare this to scenes in the great fantasy novel, `Lord of the Rings', there was never any confrontation with the Balrog in Moria or tension at the funeral pyre of Denethor or drama at the killing of the Nazgul king on the Pellanor fields. I may be asking too much, but I do believe there was no good evocation of the great numenal mysticism on can find when one looses oneself to submission.<br /><br />My final problem with this plot is that the device of the title is not introduced until the last few pages. I would have thought the `Safe Word' notion would have been explained in the beginning of the story to create a tension based on whether or not Carrie will reach a point where she will invoke it. Instead, it's introduced at the end, becoming a deux ex machina to get us out of the story.<br /><br />I will buy and read Ms. Weatherfield's next book as soon as I hear of it's being published, but I will hope she adds a bit more spice to the psychology and a bit less implausibly to the backstory. I would also welcome a bit more color from Ms. Weatherfield's obvious interest in food and restaurants.t Carrie will reach a point where she will invoke it.

The Original Smoothie Book, Vol. 1	Books	4	45	52	N	Y	Some Unique stuff, but certainly not the best smoothie book	`Smoothies, The Original Smoothie Book' by Dan Titus is the sixth book on smoothies I am reviewing. These six fall into three different categories. The first, with titles such as  `The Smoothies Bible' by Pat Crocker and `The Ultimate Smoothies Book' by Cherie Calbom claim to be `everything you wanted to know about smoothies. In this category, the first is far superior to the second. The next category, with titles such as `Ultimate Smoothies' by Donna Pliner Rodnitsky and `The Best 50 Smoothies' by Joanna White are quick references, presumably with a selection of the best recipes. Again, the first of these two titles is the better in this class.<br /><br />Mr. Titus' book may seem to belong to the first category, but I think it really belongs in a third with `Smoothies for Life' by Daniella Chace and Maureen B. Keane, where these books claim to offer things which may not be in other books, without pretending to be a `complete' reference on the subject.<br /><br />Dan Titus' angle is that his book includes recipes from six major smoothies and juice bar chains, with the claim that this means you can make them at home just the way they are made at these chains in your local mall. This `feature' has some serious shortcomings, as I describe below. Mr. Titus does give us something unusual in a little history of the smoothie and the leading smoothie franchise chains. He also gives us some rather nice tips on smoothie technique, including an explanation of the phenomenon of cavitation, so well known and loved by fans of the movie and novel `The Hunt for Red October'. While cavitation makes it easy to detect submarines by sonar, it spoils the action of a blender rotor, which, on close inspection, looks suspiciously like a submarine screw, hence, the common effect.<br /><br />All this material in the early part of the book gives the reader a good feeling that this is a worthwhile book. Especially interesting is Mr. Titus' scheme for rating smoothie recipes based on the freshness of ingredients and the extent to which they are prepared at the time one places an order.<br /><br />Many of these recipes rely on juiced vegetables. This is a good thing, since vegetables contain some nutrients not found in most fruits, but I don't rank it too highly, as it means some of the recipes require a juicer, which narrows the suitable audience for the book.<br /><br />I was pleased to see nutritional information on many of the recipes, but this effort is not as valuable as it could have been if the nutritional analysis was done for ALL the recipes, and, like Ms. Rodnitzky in `Ultimate Smoothies', put all the nutritional analyses at the same place on the page, so you could easily buzz through the pages to find a high potassium or low calorie recipe to fit your needs or whim of the moment.<br /><br />Mr. Titus includes other worthy nutritional information, especially a no nonsense description of various important ingredients. The Appendix contains some good recipes for milk substitutes from rice and nuts. This is useful since I just discovered that soymilk is not as unalloyed a good thing as some make it out to be. This appendix also gives some quick guidelines on which smoothie ingredients are good to aid in treating which ailments. This is nice, but not nearly as good as Ms. Crocker's index of smoothie recipes by ailment in `The Smoothies Bible'.<br /><br />Mr. Titus presents recipes by type, consistency, and by commercial originator. These recipes are missing my most important criteria for smoothie recipes, which are both English and metric units. I also give demerits for not including the nutritional analysis for many of the recipes and for not applying his very clever rating system for smoothies to these recipes. I also find some of the recipes to be almost worthless for the average reader as they include proprietary nutritional supplement ingredients marketed by some of the featured franchise operations. There are instructions for ordering these products but if you are put off by having to find a local GNC for protein powder, you will have no interest in spicing up your smoothies by something you need to order from the Internet.<br /><br />This isn't a bad book. It just does not deserve five stars because there are several other books in the same price range, which are better. My overall favorite is `Ultimate Smoothies'. The most complete is `The Smoothies Bible'.ering these products but if you are put off by having to find a local GNC for protein powder, you will have no interest in spicing up your smoothies by something you need to order from the Internet. <br /> <br />This isn't a bad book.

They just profess to be little books on `the best' recipes.<br /><br />It is painfully obvious from the outset that the second of these two, `The Best 50 Smoothies' does not live up to its title. The first reason is that there is not a single recipe in the book with a vegetable ingredient. For those, in detail, you want to go to `The Smoothies Bible' or `The Ultimate Smoothies Book', especially the latter if you have a juicer and like to use it. The second reason is that this book contains no smoothies with any alcoholic ingredients. Even the smoothies with names copied from famous alcoholic drinks such as the Mint Julep contains no alcohol. I strongly believe that among the true top 50 smoothies are at least five containing alcohol and at least five with at least one vegetable ingredient such as either tomato or carrot juice. Thus, I dismiss this book from further consideration.<br /><br />The `Ultimate Smoothies' is a different story altogether. While it contains no vegetable ingredients, I will forgive it, as it makes no claim to being a collection of all the best recipes. It is only claiming to have 125 from among the best recipes for smoothies, freezes, and blasts. And, the book gets extra credit for including a very nice selection of recipes that include alcohol in some form or another. Even `The Smoothies Bible', the best general book on the subject has no `adult' recipes.

This feature justifies the otherwise annoying slim Jim book format where pages are more than twice as long as they are wide.<br /><br />A not inconsiderable virtue of this book is the fun names given to all the recipes, divided up into five chapters concentrating on:<br /><br />Back to Basics: Classic recipes<br /><br />Smoooothies: Recipes heavy on dairy.<br /><br />Rx Smoothies: Recipes focusing on especially healthy combinations.<br /><br />Outrageously Decadent: Lots of chocolate and sweets.<br /><br />Black Tie Only: An adult swim with rum, cordials, and other ethanolic pleasures.<br /><br />A second feature of this book not found in any of the bigger volumes is a chapter on garnishes. And, this is not a five-page throwaway. There are 29 recipes including the same nutritional analysis as we get for the smoothie recipe. This is a not inconsiderable virtue as some garnishes can easily double the calories of the serving, although many, such as the fruit chips are very low in calories.<br /><br />If you want only one book on smoothies, especially if you plan to use them with entertaining, this is clearly the best of the crop.

Nutritional info may be dated	`The Smoothies Bible' by Pat Crocker and `The Ultimate Smoothies Book' by Cherie Calbom both profess to be a complete guide to making all sorts of smoothies. In many ways, both are better than the book, `Smoothies for Life' by Daniella Chace and Maureen B. Keane which I reviewed recently. All three focus on making smoothies for good health, but `Smoothies for Life' does little else and depends heavily on ingredients available only in some health food stores.<br /><br />Of the two subjects of this review, the first, `The Smoothies Bible' is clearly the better book. In fact, it is also clearly superior to a similar book by the same publisher, `The Blender Bible' which has many fine attributes, but which simply does not stack up to the `Bible' title.<br /><br />`The Smoothies Bible' includes everything that makes it deserve its honorific title. The most important aspect of the book's organization is that it looks at all sides of smoothie making and even gives us a lot more information on blender use than `The Blender Bible'.<br /><br />The book begins with an excellent two page `Guidelines to Good Health' with a brief on what one should eat and especially what we should avoid such as white sugar and flour, red meat, shellfish, excess salt, coffee and strong tea, and excess alcohol. I simply do not agree with the bans on flour, shellfish, red meat, coffee and strong tea.<br /><br />I believe unbleached flour is simply too important an ingredient, in reasonable amounts, as a source of gluten in yeast breads to ban entirely. The stricture against shellfish is not based on the animal but on contaminants it may pick up. This is something that may not be true of all shellfish and it may improve as time goes on. I suspect the benefits of carefully selected shellfish outweigh the dangers. I feel one or two four ounce portions of red meat a week, especially for women (source of iron), is a good thing (I am especially wary of soy as a substitute for meat on seeing some warnings on soy products for some eaters in Ms. Calbom's book.

I single these out because most are directly or indirectly related to our gastrointestinal or circulatory systems, which can be quickly influenced by what we eat. Each of these 63 sections contains a brief description of the problem, general food recommendations for the problem, general suggestions on how much to eat and drink of selected items, and one or more, usually several, smoothie recipes for relieving the condition or its symptoms. From what I can see, the book is pretty careful about recommending that one rely heavily on a doctor's advice for most of the conditions.<br /><br />The next section is `Ingredient Profiles' which I find interesting, but just a bit more doctrinaire than the rest of the book. Of the 76 herbs, I commonly stock or use 24, and I have no interest whatsoever in tracking down sources for the other 52 to put into my smoothies. I also disagree with a few of the health claims for some ingredients, such as when the author states that carob is healthier than chocolate, which is another of those things whose nutritional reputation is on the rise.<br /><br />I really like the smoothie recipes in this book, as they are simple and contain both English and Metric units.

The third suspicious content was the fact that potassium and some other nutrients was given as a major benefit for practically every other ingredient.

114924:US	39134375	R3BTFJNPL4TF3R	1880284782	59165969	Out of the Kitchen: Adventures of a Food Writer	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Very Good memoir writing. Good but not excellent foodie stuff	`Out of the Kitchen', subtitled `Adventures of a Food Writer' by Jeannette Ferrary is very similar in subject and style to the two more famous memoirs, `Tender at the Bone' and `Comfort Me With Apples' by prominent food journalist Ruth Reichl. While Ms. Ferrary is quite probably almost as good a writer as Ms. Reichl, it seems she has had a much less interesting life. To the good, like all very good writers, Ms. Ferrary has given us an excellent treatment of her material.<br /><br />As I analyze pieces of good writing either whether in essays or music, I am amazed by how much a talented writer can make of a small event. Ms. Ferrary, for example opens with a description two episodes from her very early years, aged two and three years old respectively. The first deals with baby Jeannette's thwarting the wiles of her parents' efforts for her to take a pill by camouflaging it in a gumdrop. The second is a vignette regarding little Jeannette's becoming lost almost literally in front of her house in Brooklyn when she takes her first foray out onto the sidewalk with mother on the watch from the second floor window.<br /><br />Before I get to mired in niggling little complaints and details, let me say that I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It was at least as satisfying to me as other recent memoirs from the likes of Mimi Sheraton and Alan Richman, even if it is not quite up to the level of Reichl and one of Ms. Ferrary's favorite subjects, M.F.K. Fisher.<br /><br />The greatest thing I take from this book is an affirmation of how generous and justifiably revered is the person and memory of Ms. Julia Child. This was shown clearly in an event promoting the sale of Ms. Child's video cooking classes at a West Coast Macy's store where Ms. Ferrary played the role of interviewer. Macy's had promised a plug of Ms. Ferrary's new book during the event. At the last minute, a Macy's PR functionary told Jeannette it couldn't be done, as it would take attention away from Julia Child's appearance. When Julia got wind of the problem, she glanced through the book, made some very kind comments about it to the author, and promptly got up to the microphone and praised the book to the gathered throng in Macy's, much to the chagrin of the PR hack standing nearby.<br /><br />Practically no other culinary luminary gets away without some little catty comment. Even a briefly snide quote from M.F.K. Fisher about Julia Child backfires with a poor reflection on Ms. Fisher's fairness about her contemporary culinary stars.<br /><br />One concern is that the synopsis of the book on the back cover is a bit misleading in that it says it `contains portraits of America's most famous food-world celebrities - Julia Child, Alice Waters, Craig Claiborne, Jacques Pepin, Marcella Hazan and Robert Mondavi, to name a few'. It does indeed contain material of substance on the first three of these six people, but the second three get literally no more than a sentence, with Pepin getting a sentence and a snapshot with the author. The same synopsis touts the two dozen recipes found at the end of some of the essays. Unlike many essays from the likes of John Thorne and James Villas, where the subject is a particular recipe such as panzanella or Brunswick stew (respectively) recipes in books of memoirs should be taken merely as part of the memory and not as a sound culinary source. The only exceptions I can think of to this rule is the Danny Kaye recipe for lemon pasta in Reichl's `Comfort Me With Apples' and the recipes in `Cooking for Mr. Latte' by Amanda Hesser.<br /><br />Speaking of the great Danny Kaye, I am amazed that his name didn't make it to the list of names on the back cover, as his mention as a guest at a major party given by Craig Claiborne was at least as long as the sentences devoted to some other figures.<br /><br />The quality of the writing is welcome, as it makes up for the fact that only the last fifty of the 230 pages really deals with professional culinarywriting. One of the themes of the first three-fourths of the book is the fact that the author had no inkling that her fate was to be a food expert and writer. The first quarter of the book contains essays on the author's childhood where the most important food topics were penny candy, ice cream, and her Spanish grandmother's wiles with squid in a black ink sauce. The second of the four sections presents essays on the author's adolescence and high school years. The third of the four sections deals with college, marriage, first husband's graduate school years and first job, and divorce.<br /><br />In the last of the four sections, we experience Ms. Ferrary's admission into the culinary elite when she travels to Provence to be a student (with fellow poet, Frances Mayes) in Simone Weil's cooking school. As luck would have it, Ms. Weil, who is a co-author with Julia Child of `Mastering the Art of French Cooking', also happened to live across the street from Ms. Child's Provence cottage, and Ms. Child happened to be in residence when Ms. Ferrary was in class. So, Jeannette, very early in her career, got to meet the most influential American culinary writer and was able to build important events in her career on that acquaintance.<br /><br />If you really like culinary memoirs, this is as good or better than some, but not as good as the best. The best aspect of the book is in the quality of the writing.<br /><br />Recommended.onal culinary writing.

115264:US	39134375	R39KCMJJ51A3P7	0778801098	313675472	The Blender Bible	Books	4	42	50	N	Y	Good reference for blender intensive recipes.	`The Blender Bible' by Andrew Chase and Nicole Young came to me as a big surprise when I opened the volume to its table of contents. Every culinary book with the word `Bible' in its title invariably comes with dozens of pages on general techniques. This book has but one page on generalities. It does not even have a section on how to evaluate blenders and the range of products you can expect at your local `Bed, Bath and Beyond' and on the interactive pages of Amazon.com. This may partly be due to the fact that the authors credit the Cuisinart Company with supplying them with machines for their recipe testing.<br /><br />I do have to recant part of this rant to recognize the fact that late in the book there is a nice, three-page introduction to making baby food. Ms. Young happens to be an expert teacher on the subject of making baby foods, so I will assume that this section carries a lot more weight than your run of the mill chapter on the subject published by a blender manufacturer. This means, of course, that if baby food is one of your more important blender applications, then this book is definitely for you. Unlike all the other recipes, the baby food recipes include a nutritional breakdown, giving amounts for calories, carbohydrates, fiber, fat, protein, and iron.<br /><br />I am mollified somewhat by the fact that the blender is really a very simple appliance. And, I heartily agree with the authors when they bemoan the eclipse of the blender in favor of the food processor. I firmly believe that there are tasks which the blender can handle far better than the food processor, and which cannot be done effectively by hand. While you can do as well or better than a food processor on most tasks with a very sharp knife and some rudimentary skills, you simply cannot match the results of the blender without the combined efforts of a mortar and pestle, a food mill, and a chinois. If I were forced to choose between having a blender and a food processor, I would always pick the blender.<br /><br />Therefore, the better title for this book should have been `The Encyclopedia of Blender Recipes'. Appropriate to the `authoritative' tone of the title, I give this book extra credit for giving us all measurements in both English and Metric units. I really encourage any of you who do a lot of cooking to embrace metric recipe measurements, as it is so incredibly easy to size up and size down recipe sizes with metric units. And, a cookbook, which gives us the metric measurements, has already done all the hard work. My final word on this subject is that metric units are even more important with blender recipes where so many of the ingredients are measured as liquids. This advice is doubly important if you are concerned with the nutrition in the baby food recipes, as all units are metric, in grams and milligrams.<br /><br />If your interest does not include baby food, your primary concern should be the quality of the recipes and the completeness of the recipe selection. As I have yet to find any cookbook on a major subject that can be said to cover its subject completely, the issue is how close does this one come.<br /><br />The book's chapters beyond baby food are:<br /><br />Appetizers, Dips, and Spreads  26 pages<br /><br />Salad Dressings  14 pages<br /><br />Condiments, Sauces, and Marinades 36 pages<br /><br />Soups  50 pages<br /><br />Breakfast  6 pages<br /><br />Entrees  22 pages<br /><br />Side Dishes  10 pages<br /><br />Desserts  34 pages<br /><br />Smoothies  26 pages<br /><br />Cocktails  36 pages<br /><br />It were me, I would have left out the Breakfast, Entrees, and Side Dishes chapters and devoted more space to dressings, smoothies, and cocktails, as these are the subjects for which one will naturally come to a blender book. Still, the selection is excellent in these key chapters.<br /><br />Regarding recipe quality, I find the list of ingredients to be excellent, the procedure to be good, and the `tips' and headnotes to be worthwhile. There are only two things that caused me some puzzlement. First, I wondered why the recipe for bean soups pureed only part of the cooked beans and left most whole. My finest taste of black bean soup came from totally pureed soup. And, as this is a book on blender recipes, why not go whole hog and whiz down the whole thing. The other concern was in the cheese soup / Welsh rarebit recipes where there was no warning about heating the final cheese mixture too high, as there is a risk of its going grainy on you.<br /><br />If you like single subject culinary reference books or you are especially fond of soups or smoothies or sauces or baby food (and you have no other good book on these topics), then this is a very good book to have. If you already have a relatively complete culinary library, you may wish to give it a bit more thought before laying out money for this volume.here are only two things that caused me some puzzlement.

Not greatest veggie book!	`Veggie Meals' is an early Rachael Ray book, reissued by her original publisher, Lake Isle Press, probably in light of her great recent success with her latest books and TV shows.<br /><br />This is a hard book to recommend, in spite of the fact that I am a major fan of Ms. Ray's cooking show and the value I find in her '30 Minute Meal' books for people who would like to cook, but who have little time to search through the `Joy of Cooking' or similar encyclopedia for quick cooking meals, especially when they don't know the background behind fast versus slow cooking techniques.<br /><br />One thing to consider is that while Ms. Ray does give menus of three dishes at the beginning of the book, it is not her classic `three dishes together' recipe presentation where all three recipes are done in the way she does it on her `Thirty Minute Meals' show.<br /><br />The issue is probably a lot easier if you happen to already be a big Rachael Ray book fan and have many of her other, later books, and, you do not have a lot of cookbooks from other authors. This means that you can get these 95 vegetable recipes for a list price of $14.95 and have little fear of overlapping other books. This price of 15 cents per recipe is good, but not great as celebrity recipes go, but then, these are not really `celebrity' recipes in the same sense as those from Thomas Keller or Rick Tramonto or Eric Rippert. We are buying this book for versions of classic recipes that can be done quickly. And, I believe you should only get this book if:<br /><br />1. You are primarily interested in fast recipes.<br /><br />2. You really like Ms. Ray's twist on recipes and writing recipes.<br /><br />3. You do not have other good books on vegetarian recipes.<br /><br />This last condition is important because there are a whole lot of very good books of vegetarian and vegetable based recipes available from some pretty famous names in the culinary world. The three leading names are Deborah Madison, Jack Bishop, and Peter Berley. If you are really interested in vegetarian cooking and speed is not your major concern, and then you must get Madison's `Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone'. This big book is comparable in scope and quality to Julia Child's classic `Mastering the Art of French Cooking'. Another excellent Madison book is `Vegetarian Suppers from Deborah Madison's Kitchen'. Equally authoritative is Jack Bishop's `A Year in the Vegetarian Kitchen' or his book on Italian vegetarian dishes. Berley has done two very good vegetarian books, the second being `Fresh Food Fast' which presents fast vegetarian cooking in far more depth than does Ms. Ray.<br /><br />The moral of this paragraph is that Ms. Ray is treading in a field that already has its share of major league experts.<br /><br />The recommendation on fast recipes is important because while there are a lot of `classic' recipes in this book, they may not yield `classic' results because of the shortcuts taken to speed up preparation time. The other side of the coin is that this book reassures us that, in a pinch, we can in fact make risotto, pasta Primavera, ratatouille, and eggplant Parmigiano in less than a full afternoon.<br /><br />So, I suggest that you give just a little thought to parting with your 15 bucks for this book, but that you will probably not be disappointed if you are in Ms. Ray's favored audience.nd Peter Berley.

120836:US	39134375	R40IAMWX7IFJR	061813512X	422519769	The Complete Meat Cookbook	Books	5	50	52	N	N	One of two great meat cookbooks. Better of two on principles	`The Complete Meat Cookbook' by leading meat authorities Bruce Aidells and Denis Kelly is a wonderful reference cookbook for all and any foodies who really cook. The pair have written three other books, primarily on cured meats before issuing this general work.<br /><br />One symptom of the depth of Aidells' authoritative knowledge of meat cookery is the fact that he singlehandedly changed a long standing attitude about cooking meat and using salt. The conventional wisdom was that salt on raw meat before cooking drew out moisture from the meat and made it dry. Aidells demonstrated that salting the surface of beef before searing greatly enhanced the flavor of the cooked meat. This event was quoted, without necessarily giving credit to Aidells himself, on more than a few Food Network shows, most notably by Sara Moulton and the culinary world has changed ever since. The stature of that demonstration may be measured by the fact that the combined efforts of Harold McGee and Alton Brown, both with major forums in books and TV shows for their opinions, have not been able to stamp out the myth that searing meat `seals in moisture'. The difference, of course, is that a good sear has other positive benefits, so the myth is an empty talking point and culinary declaimers have no reason to change their cant, since getting people to do something good, if even for the wrong reason, is beneficial in the long run. But enough of this rant on small matters.<br /><br />The Aidells / Kelly book can and should be compared directly to a similar book by an equally prestigious pair of authors, Chris Schlesinger and John Willoughby, who published their book, `How to Cook Meat' two years later, so they would have the advantage of reading the Aidells / Kelly book. The two books, like almost everyone else in the professional culinary world, consider `meat' to be flesh from cows (beef from mature animals and veal from animals one year of age or less), pigs, and sheep (mutton from older animals and lamb from animals less than a year old). In truth, neither book really talks much about mutton, so the `big four' are beef, pork, lamb and veal.<br /><br />Aidells/ Kelly is a bit longer in page count, but I suspect the two are about the same length, as Aidells/Kelly uses somewhat larger print and is a bit more generous with margins. Of the two, Aidells/Kelly spends much more space on talking about general cooking techniques while Schlesinger / Willoughby spends more time on individual recipes. What that means to me is that while Schlesinger / Willoughby is a better source for fast recipes to do a particular type of cooking, Aidells/Kelly gives a better overview of general cooking techniques and a better understanding of meat cooking in general. Aidells/Kelly also gives much more information on picking the right cut of meat for each recipe and for each cooking technique. As one reads a lot of different material on cooking and spends all too much time watching Alton Brown on the Food Network, one gradually learns that shoulder and rump cuts are good for braising and other slow wet cooking methods and rib and loin cuts are good for fast, dry heat cooking, but things can get a lot more complicated than that, especially when you add the the creativity of supermarket marketing types who give fancy labels to cuts of meat which may obscure the meat's source and quality.<br /><br />Aidells / Kelly earn their title not by giving us every known meat cooking recipe under the sun. No book short of a multivolumed encyclopedia could do that. On the other hand, the authors do a good job of providing a pretty wide range of famous recipes. Among the beef recipes, for example, they give `beefsteak Florentine, the Philly cheese steak, barbecued beef ribs, and Italian-American meatballs. I was a bit disappointed that their `barbecue' recipe was really just grilled marinaded beef ribs with a sweet barbecue sauce.<br /><br />Their claim to completeness comes from the depth of their information given before and between the recipes on general cooking techniques and how to make the best use of them. To enhance our experience in reading the book, the authors also throw in some short histories of how these three great animal families joined the human food chain and contributed to the improved health of herding tribes over the grain eaters.<br /><br />The authors give us a lot of other nice little tools such as labels on recipes to indicate whether they are best for quick cooking, entertaining, economy, or high leftover value. The most valuable extra may be the level of detail they give to determining whether a cooked piece of meat is `done'.<br /><br />The very best aspect of the book is the number of cross references given for correlating cuts of meat with cooking methods, brines, rubs, and marinades. I was initially just a little surprised at how simple their animal butchering diagram was, in that it divided the whole carcass into no more than a half dozen primals and spoke about these basic regions as if everything from the beef round could be treated the same. But they redeemed themselves as they developed their subject and gave much more detailed treatments of more finely differentiated cuts of meat.<br /><br />I recommend this book very highly to anyone who enjoys reading about cooking. It is just a bit less useful to someone who simply wants a book they can grab now and then to find a new way to do pork chops of lamb shoulder. For that, the Schlesinger / Willoughy book may be slightly better, as their organization of recipes is great for fast reference.f their information given before and between the recipes on general cooking techniques and how to make the best use of them.

124087:US	39134375	R395AEC3GKNFZ4	0060096799	158548568	The Cornbread Book: A Love Story with Recipes	Books	5	5	8	N	N	Very Good Little Culinary Novella.	`The Cornbread Book', the first book from Jeremy Jackson subtitled `a love story with recipes' is a delightful little 120 page book written with the kind of devotion to its subject which simply draws you in and makes you love the subject almost as much as the author. And, one is drawn to affection for the author's candor in acknowledging himself for having done the lion's share of work toward completing this book. This is oddly refreshing when weighed against the `cast of thousands' acknowledgments which you find in some books where entries seem to be rewards for nothing more than a gratis contribution of a recipe or doing that for which you are being paid anyway.<br /><br />For a list price of $14.95, we get what may be considered not much more than a series of articles from John Thorne or James Villas, but I still think it's worth it. This may be considered a culinary novella. It is the food world's version of `Death in Venice' by Thomas Mann or `Heart of Darkness' by Joseph Conrad. Please overlook the fact that it was not written by M.F.K. Fisher, Elizabeth David, Jeffrey Steingarten, or Julia Child. It is a very promising first work and since I have already reviewed Master Jackson's second book, the somewhat more substantial `desserts that have killed better men than me', I expect better and better things from this author, as long as he can find things other than cornbread with to develop a love.<br /><br />Master Jackson's attachment to cornbread begins with what may be considered a baptism with corn meal, as in the chill Midwest, where one could not go out and play in the wickedly cold winter, Jackson had a little indoor sandbox filled with cornmeal which during naps and other slumbers, was stored in a great glass jar, separated from the corn meal reserved for baking.<br /><br />Since this little book is devoted to but a single rather limited subject, you can be sure that Master Jackson covers it from just about every angle. The fact that it is limited can be demonstrated that in contrast, the seemingly small and related subject of bread baking in England consumes almost 600 pages from the pen of the great Elizabeth David.<br /><br />The thing which most distinguishes cornbread baking from baking with wheat is the great variety of forms and possibilities created by wheat's gluten protein forming powers which lends itself to all sorts of leavenings, the most important of which is yeast leavening. Corn flour dough, and virtually every other type of flour dough simply does not create gluten, which is why wheat is mixed in with lots of other types of flours. But obviously, this does not stop our ancestors, especially those who trace their lineage back to pre-Columbian Americans from making various types of bread from corn meal and us.<br /><br />Before boring you much further with my rants about this splendid little book, let me say that I believe the finest use of various cornbread recipes herein are as accompaniments to soups and stews. As a relatively slow amateur cook, the making of one major dish usually takes up all my creative energies come mealtime. Thus, there isn't much time to spend making an imaginative starch side dish, with the possible exception of the simplest pasta with oil and garlic.<br /><br />Therefore, if you run through this book and master but one or two of these recipes so that you can do them without consulting the printed page, you can immediately branch out and add all sorts of things to this simple recipe and amaze your family with a scrumptious main dish accompanied by great fresh cornbread.<br /><br />The book covers four different types of cornbread recipes, basic, `beyond basic', sweet, and yeast cornbreads. To this is added a chapter on what to do with leftover cornbreads. Note that many of the recipes, especially those in the `beyond basic' and `sweet' chapters are much more like cakes, cookies, and other dessert dishes than they are like `breads'. That doesn't mean Master Jackson is movingoff message. He very gently reminds us he is on track when he gives us recipes for a corn meal crepe, but not recipes for crepe fillings, as this is not a book about crepes!<br /><br />One of my few disappointments with this book is that Master Jackson does not explain the anomaly in Yankee cornbread recipes containing sugar while Johnny Reb recipes being less sweet, while most other southern cooking tends to be richer than its northern cousins. Virtually the only culinary danger I found was the phrase which combined Jalapeno and Habanero chilis as suggestions for a certain type of recipe while taking no notice of the truly great difference in heat to be found in these two varieties of chili.<br /><br />My greatest surprise and joy in reading this book was the discovery of popcorn meal, created exactly as you might expect, by grinding up popcorn into a flour and using it exactly as you may use any other type of flour.<br /><br />If you are a foodie of just about any stripe whatsoever, it is hard to deny yourself the pleasure of this little book, as it is inexpensive and full of easy, useful, tasty recipes.<br /><br />Very highly recommended.ckson is moving off message.

Buy It!	`It Must've Been Something I Ate' is Jeffrey Steingarten's second collection of Vogue columns, following the earlier `The Man Who Ate Everything'. Monsieur Steingarten is certainly better recognized these days among the foodie masses as he has appeared as the anchor judge on many of the new Food Network `Iron Chef America' shows, and adds gravity to the show as one of the few people who can trump commentator Alton Brown's perceptions on food.<br /><br />I was always puzzled by the fact that a magazine like Vogue, which I have never once picked up to read, and which I perceived as a home largely of advertisements for goods appealing to women who have more money than they know what to do with (sic). I was chastised somewhat when I discovered that Mr. Steingarten's role at Vogue was formerly staffed by none other than Elizabeth David, one of the most interesting and respected culinary writers of the 20th century.<br /><br />Mr. Steingarten's writing has a `family resemblance' to Ms. David's work, but they are really doing a slightly different kind of dialogue with their readers. Elizabeth David took conventional food writing with recipe plus commentary and elevated it to its highest level. Her closest students were Jane Grigson and Claudia Roden. Like James Beard with American cooking, her knowledge of food, especially European and Mediterranean food was encyclopedic.<br /><br />Steingarten is doing something different! I would even argue with the blurb on the cover of my Vintage edition that states that he `knows more about food than any man now eating'. That perception may be due to the fact that Steingarten looks into food issues more deeply than almost any other writer I can cite, with the possible exception of Harold McGee. But Steingarten is a much better writer than McGee, so he is much more enjoyable to read. I think of him as being a culinary Sherlock Holmes who uses, or who has friends who use all of the very best scientific methods for tracking down the scoop on interesting food issues.<br /><br />A classic example of his `modus operandi' is the article on differences in the varieties of salt. The jumping off point for the story is the fact that appreciation for salt has reached levels formerly lavished on olive oils. The heavy of the story is fellow food writer Robert Wolke who published a series of articles that claimed that the differences from one salt to the next are small and are largely due to the shape of the salt crystals. Like me, Wolke comes to culinary matters from a background in chemistry. And, since I know, like Wolke, that virtually all forms of salt are simply 98% Sodium Chloride. And, the odds are that the remaining one or two percent of the chemical composition is composed of inorganic compounds which simply do not register either on our tongue or nose. This is not to say that there are not important differences between salts. Kosher(ing) salt, for example is truly superior to table salt for seasoning simply because it is easier to handle while cooking.<br /><br />Since Steingarten and his colleagues are more attuned to the culinary aspects of things than chemist Wolke, Steingarten felt Wolke was missing something. So, he enlists some pretty serious medical and statistical talent to conduct a true double blind test of the differences in taste. To make the experiment even better, the differences in crystal shape is factored out by doing the tasting of a 2% solution. I am very quickly getting the feeling that it is not Steingarten but the famous science writer, Stephen Jay Gould who I am reading.<br /><br />Since it makes a great story, Steingarten is not at all shy in confessing that statistically, the first experiment showed very little difference in the various salts. Steingarten did not lose me when he felt that further investigation was needed. The aesthetic perception of something that not everyone can appreciate is an entirely familiar story. Just scratch the opinions of ten people at random toask them what they think of Jackson Pollack's oil paintings and you will find more than half believing they are shams. Steingarten and his high priced scientific talent repeat the experiment with somewhat different conditions but with no loss of scientific rigor and come up with some, but not compelling statistical basis for saying that the tastes of one or two of the salts was different from the table salt controls.<br /><br />Steingarten was probably constrained by the space allotted him on the pages of Vogue, but I would have liked him to take things just one step further and consider the relative costs of the `artisinal' salts compared to the perceived differences in taste. I suspect that Steingarten won this battle, but the salt enthusiasts may have lost the war to establish the greater culinary cachet of arcane salts.<br /><br />But, unlike scientist Gould's work, this book is simply not about whether Steingarten reaches either the right or the desired conclusion. It is about the vistas opened to ways of thinking for yourself about food and the enjoyment you get from Mr. Steingarten's immensely talented way of writing about food. As with the case of the investigation into salt, I may have agreed with Professor Wolke's conclusion, but I think Steingarten was superior in every way in how he approached the issue.

Dated Material.	`Pizza, A Slice of Heaven' by New York Times culinary journalist, Ed Levine and a proverbial cast of thousands is a digest of many different opinions about pizza making around the country and around the world. The cover states that the author includes contributions from Nora Ephron, Mario Batali, and Calvin Trillin, but the `and many others' includes many heavyweights in the world of writing about food in general and pizza in particular, including Jeffrey Steingarten, Ruth Reichl, Robb Walsh, and Peter Reinhart.<br /><br />There have probably been many more books recently on pizza, but the only one really worthy of consideration to my knowledge is Peter Reinhart's recent `American Pie' which takes a much less democratic and much more analytical and rational and professional approach to the search for the greatest pizza. It is immensely satisfying that these two very different books came up with the identical conclusion that the very best American pizza is Chris Bianco at Pizzeria Bianco in Phoenix, Arizona. Bianco was easy to pick, as he is the only pizzaiolo to have been awarded a best regional chef award by the James Beard Foundation.<br /><br />For those of us who do not live within easy driving distance of Pizzeria Bianco, all is not lost. Things are especially good for those of us who live in Levine's `Pizza Corridor' stretching from Boston to Washington, D.C., the landing sites for the great wave of immigrants from southern Italy in the latter half of the 19th century. Particularly good are pizzas available in famous shops in New Haven, Connecticut, New York City, New Jersey, Philadelphia, and, to a lesser extent, in Baltimore and Washington.<br /><br />Levine's book is collected from two or three kinds of articles, depending on how you want to slice them. The most common type of article is the informal survey of pizzeria's in various parts of the country and the world. Many, but not all of these are written by Levine. Others are written by correspondents who report on the state of pizza affairs in lesser pizza hot spots, such as the report from Charlotte by baking teacher Reinhart and the report from Argentina by Tex-Mex expert, Robb Walsh. The non-survey articles can be divided into introductory pieces written by Levine to lay out the land for the survey articles and background articles, many of which are reprints from other authors' collections.<br /><br />The very best thing about the survey articles is that they give knowledgeable ratings for both whole pies and slices from a very large number of famous and almost famous pizzerias. This means that if you are a serious pizza lover, you can travel to many major cities in the United States and have on hand a reference to several good pizzerias, especially in the northeast corridor. The only drawback about these ratings is that they are not all done by the same people. Some ratings appear in articles by contributors such as Nora Ephron who is not a culinary professional. I will grant that she is a gifted amateur in pizza circles, but there is no guarantee she will evaluate things in exactly the same way as Mr. Levine. Thus, it is important to read the narrative evaluations and not go by just the number of icons given to rating the slices or pies.<br /><br />The use of so many different contributors means that there is a fair amount of overlap from one article to the next. Levine edited well enough so that this overlap is not annoying, but it is there none the less.<br /><br />One item which raised my opinion of Mr. Levine's judgment in food matters was his criticism of a Consumer Reports evaluation of frozen pizzas. He not only disagreed with their specific recommendation, but he questioned their overall competance in evaluating food products. I am certain they are honest. I am not certain they pick the right criteria on which to judge things.<br /><br />In addition to the survey of great independent pizzerias around the country, Mr. Levine also evaluates the great pizza chains and frozen pizza products. There are no big surprises here, as Mr. Levine's opinion of almost all the chains is pretty dismal. While I have probably less than one thousandth of Mr. Levine's experience in evaluating pizza, I have a hunch that pizzas from major chain outlets may show a lot more variability than he may indicate. I am certain that on average, it is simply not as good as the very best you can find, but it may, on average, be as good or better than what you get from an undistinguished local pizzeria. It's the old Howard Johnson rule. It may not be the best, but in unfamiliar cities, you know what to expect from them.<br /><br />Two pizza icons which get a tepid reaction from Mr. Levine are Chicago style deep dish pizza and California pizza. Levine goes so far as to say that deep dish pizza is really a casserole rather than a pizza. His take on Wolfgang Puck and Alice Waters is relatively gentile, but also tends to treat them as a footnote to the great classic Neapolitan / American pizza standard.<br /><br />If you are really interested in a serious discussion of what makes a great pizza, and how to make it yourself, then get Reinhart's `American Pie'. If you simply enjoy reading about pizza and want to know where the very best can be found, get this book. Just don't follow any advice found in Jeffrey Steingarten's tongue in cheek essay on how to achieve a very hot pizza baking environment.the great pizza chains and frozen pizza products.

Buy it anyway	`Cooking School Secrets for Real World Cooks' by Linda Carucci is a good amateur cooks, but it disappoints on at least two levels.<br /><br />The book reminds me of a comment by my 6th grade teacher on a project I did where it was obvious to her that I put a lot of thought into gathering all the material and knew the subject, but the end result, which was a presentation of that material to the class, simply did not communicate the material very well. This weakness is especially true of the first chapter on cooking basics, and somewhat less true in the chapters on recipes. This weakness is rampant in the sections about equipment.  Nowhere is it truer that a picture is worth a thousand words than when you are describing equipment where the terminology can be vague from one equipment manufacturer to another. This is especially true for someone who has never been in a good kitchen supply store, so that the words describing the differences between a skillet and a saute pan leave much to be desired. This observation is even stronger when the author begins her discussion of knife skills and cuts. The contrast between the author's presentation and how it should have been done is no more dramatically demonstrated than by looking at the first few chapters in Jacques Pepin's `Complete Techniques' where he illustrates all the basic knife cuts with a generous use of photographs.<br /><br />The author's discussion of how to chop an onion is a prime example of what disappoints me about this book. While I am a great admirer of Elizabeth David's generous doctrines on `the best way to cook is what works for you' with regard to certain dishes, I think this lassez faire approach is NOT true of the best way to chop an onion. I find three major concerns with the author's description. First, I do not think there are `many' legitimate ways to chop an onion. I think there is really only one, with variations depending on how coarse you want the dice. Second, the author's recommended technique is to cut off the root end as one of the early steps. Almost every good discussion of this technique recommends leaving the root end on to hold things together while you are making the cuts in the onion half. Then, you discard the root end when you are done. The third suggestion is to use the food processor when you need a lot of chopped onion and when the size of the dice is not important. While the author admits to the fact that if you do not precut the onion, the food processor will make a soggy mess of your onions, she believes that it is acceptable for some applications. I believe the best method for dealing with a need for LOTS of chopped onion is to get one or two large Bermuda onions or Spanish onions and chop away at them using the same technique you use for conventional yellow onions. You will have your four to six cups of diced onion in no time flat.<br /><br />The descriptions of the other knife techniques are similarly without illustration. If no other technique in this book had pictures, but the instructions on knife techniques did, this book would have been far more valuable to a beginner.<br /><br />My second difficulty with this book overall is the fact that the author is not a very good writer. One begins to appreciate the pains taken by a writer such as Elizabeth David or a superior editor, such as Alfred E. Knopf's Judith Jones when you see some of the weak writing in this book. Some things are simply poor fact checking or stating something as more authoritative than it really is. In the author's description of mirepoix, she claims that the STANDARD ratio is four parts onion to two parts carrots to one part celery. I checked two different authorities, the Larousse Gastronomique and Julia Child's `Mastering the Art of French Cooking' and both had a different ratio from the one given by the author. They also happened to be different from one another, which leads me to believe that there is no `standard'. Another mirepoix misstatement is when theauthor describes mirepoix as a `holy trinity'. The mistake here is that the most appropriate culinary application of the term, for those of us who have seen far too much Emeril Lagasse than we care to admit, is the famous Cajun trio of onions, sweet peppers, and celery.<br /><br />By the time I got to `Using Your Senses When You Cook', I found most of the more objectionable statements were behind me and I started encountering genuinely important material for the amateur cook. Ms. Carucci takes the imperative of using your senses when you cook to at least one or two steps beyond what you will find in statements by expert professional chefs such as Wolfgang Puck or Thomas Keller. It almost seems as if the author has arrived at the kind of material she does best. Once we get into the details of individual recipes, Ms. Carucci is on firmer ground, although I still find some annoying positions, such as the notion that one should make all measurements carefully, as if you were doing all your cooking with the same rigor with which you do baking. I also found Ms. Carucci's less than total mastery of words leaving her at a loss when she describes the effects of alcohol, acid, and fats on flavors.<br /><br />I will end with congratulations to Ms. Carucci for her tips on individual dishes and individual cooking methods. Her section on stocks is especially good for the beginner and a worthy antidote to recipes that call for very long cooking times. In the end, the book is also saved for me by her excellent description of seasoning with salt. I have never seen this technique described so well, bringing out aspects which almost every other writer does not touch.hen the author describes mirepoix as a `holy trinity'.

Better than Vol III	`The Shaping of Middle-Earth' is the fourth volume of Christopher Tolkien's exegesis of his father, J.R.R. Tolkien's unpublished writings which were done before, during, and after the writing of `The Hobbit' and `The Lord of the Rings'. It is important to realize that beginning with Volume III, `The Lays of Beleriand', these volumes are prepared according to the date on which the elder Tolkien wrote the documents. That this `real world' chronology is roughly parallel to the great ages of middle earth is simply a happy coincidence.<br /><br />One little niggle I have about the emphasis of `Middle Earth' in the title of both this volume and the series as a whole is that the land, middle earth, is just one part of the whole world in which this mythology is played out. It is basically a great continent, roughly similar to Eurasia in size, surrounded by a single great ocean which is, in turn, bounded by the undying lands. This fact is eminantly clear in the crude maps by Tolkien senior presented in this volume.<br /><br />What is also eminantly clear in most of these fragments is the great difference in both geography and physics between our world and the world in which middle earth is embedded. There is no sun and no stars, until the stars are created by some of the `gods', the Valar, who are in turn created by `the one', Iluvatar.<br /><br />The fragments in this volume are mostly early versions of the mythology which was to become the postumously published `The Silmarillion'. As such, it deals with my very favorite character outside of `The Lord of the Rings', the elven lord Feanor who, in a rough parallel to both Adam and Prometheus, disobeys the Valar based on the promptings of the ultimate bad guy in these stories, Morgoth.<br /><br />Even if one buys the unique physics, cosmology, and pantheon of gods and demigods, the hardest part of this and similar writings is how to deal with Tolkien's handling of evil. How, one wonders, are eight `good' Valar duped by the ninth evil one, who is left to subvert the Valar's most favored creations, the elves, and create all sorts of mayhem in Middle Earth. Even if one introduces the arguments about `free will', one wonders how, if you posit a very real supreme being, Iluvatar (Eru), plus eight comparably powerful beings, such beings would let Morgoth get away with being the cause of all this suffering.<br /><br />On a ligher note, I find this book an amazing source of poetic inspiration, even more poetic, sometimes than the overtly poetic `The Lays of Beleriand'. There are phrases and paragraphs here and there which sound like they are straight out of a song by Donoven Leitch or The Incredible String Band.<br /><br />Like almost all the twelve volumes in this series, this is much more a study of fragments than a complete work. Many of the fragments rework the same material, so you find yourself reading the same story over again, in slightly different words. And yet, the power of the created world holds up through the scholarly framework. As with other volumes, there is an excellent index of names at the end of the book and the aforementioned maps are invaluable in understanding the very odd geography of this invented world.the ninth evil one, who is left to subvert the Valar's most favored creations, the elves, and create all sorts of mayhem in Middle Earth.

Less value for casual users.	`Smoothies for Life' by nutritionists, Daniella Chace and Maureen B. Keane is one of those books you dread when you pick up a book on food which claims to present an important nutritional point of view. As the book was written and published in 1999, there is a good chance that some of the nutritional information may be a bit out of date. I am not an expert on nutrition, but I sensed that the book did not give as much emphasis to blueberries as an ingredient as you will see in current books. And, I was just a little suspicious of the totally negative slant given to whole milk, due to its saturated butter fat. From my view of nutrition from the outside looking in, I sense that butterfat may have made something of a recovery in reputation over the last few years, with the demonization of transfats in butter substitutes.<br /><br />The thing which dismayed me the most about the book was the heavy reliance on health store speciality ingredients such as vitamin C power, brewer's yeast, flaxseed oil, protein powder, and liquid herbal supplement. A lesser dismay was the discovery of a few misspelled words.<br /><br />My suspicion of the purported mojo obtained from brewer's yeast and protein powder is entirely personal and I point that out only because I suspect there may be others who are turned off by any recipe which requires a trip to some speciality store.<br /><br />The other side of the coin is the fact that this book has great value if you are especially fond of smoothies. I was pleased, for example, to see the warning about giving honey as an ingredient in smoothies to children under the age of two. This is probably almost as important as good sanitation practices with chicken and eggs, yet I have never seen this warning outside of a book all about honey. On the other hand, I suggest you take the authors' recommendations about the value of herbs with a grain of salt. I suspect the pharmaceutical efficacy of many herbs may have been a bit inflated 10 years ago. Most modern research detects not much more than placebo effects.<br /><br />If, like me, all you really wanted was a few good recipes for smoothies, try the appropriate volume from `Better Homes and Gardens'. If, however, you already make regular trips to you local GNC, then this may be the book for you!.

Buy It!	`The Splendid Table' by Lynne Rossetto Kasper is simply the most splendid book I have read on a regional cuisine and it is by far and away the best of the three books on the cuisine of Emilia-Romagna, even though the other two, `Biba's Taste of Italy' by Biba Caggiano and `Recipes from My Two Villages' by Mario Batali are excellent, as far as they go. Ms. Caggiano's book is simply a collection of recipes from Emilia-Romagna and Mario's book is more of a personal diary of recipes than a thorough examination of a historical cuisine.<br /><br />Ms. Kasper's book, in the year it was published, won both the James Beard and Julia Child (IACP) cookbook awards, which is roughly the same as winning both the Academy award and the Foreign Press Writers award for best picture. And, I believe this book deserved all the attention it has received. Even Mario, who has his own book on the subject, made a special point to mention this book on his `Molto Mario' show. Since I have owned the book for over a year, it is one of those cases where I deeply regret having taken so long to get to studying the volume.<br /><br />All that remains, then, is to point out what it is which makes the book so good.<br /><br />For starters, it covers every aspect of a region's cuisine. That is, it deals with the history, the agriculture, and the economy of the region as well as the great recipes. And, what a background we have to relate. Emilia-Romagna is not just another region in one of the world's great culinary countries. It is THE very heart and soul of that culinary tradition, even more than the fabled provinces of Tuscany (Florence) in the north and Campagna (Naples) in the south. It is the home of Italy's three most important non-wine food products, Proscuitto de Parma, Parmesano-Reggiano, and Balsamic Vinegar. On top of that, it is also the home of some of the most famous fresh pasta dishes to come out of Italy plus several of the most famous salume products from Italy (witness the name Bologna, the region's capital city, given to some of these products).<br /><br />While this coverage is necessary for a complete book on this subject, it is not enough. And, this book gives us the most important component, an excellent selection of very well written recipes. And, with over five hundred pages to fill, Ms. Kasper has given us several different takes on many of the more interesting recipes. A fine example is the famous ragu Bolognese, which is offered up in at least six different variations, each for a slightly different purpose or from a different background.<br /><br />Never having studied this northern (generally tomatoless) sauce in detail before, I am struck by how similar it is to the most common recipes for Texas chili. It has no beans, the meat is diced and browned, not ground, and tomato and other spices are added sparingly. In the place of dried chiles, the ragu includes cinnamon (in several of the more traditional recipes). One very odd facet of these recipes is that where a Bay leaf is specified, the author calls for the California bay leaf rather than the milder Turkish bay leaf.<br /><br />The recipes are organized like all good Italian cookbooks, by course. The chapters are:<br /><br />The Antipasto Course<br /><br />Ragus<br /><br />Essential Sauces and Stocks (In no other book have I seen such a thorough treatment of Italian broths and stocks. Ms. Kasper includes the simple traditional `brodo' but adds much more, highlighted by the rich `Il sugo de carne' or meat essence.)<br /><br />Pastas<br /><br />The Sweet Pastas of the Renaissance (So, not only do we get modern dishes, we also get recipes for historical dishes which one usually never finds outside a book specializing in Renaissance cooking).<br /><br />Risotto, Soup, and Vegetable First Courses<br /><br />Second Courses<br /><br />Vegetable Side Dishes<br /><br />Breads<br /><br />Desserts<br /><br />Aside from the atypical choice of the California bay, nothing in this book disagrees with anything I have seen from any other authority on Italian cooking. In fact, Ms. Kasper generally improves on other advice by giving more details and a finer turn to her information on ingredients, techniques, and background. I am especially happy to see recipes for some of the more complicated dishes which simply never find their way into less ambitious books, such as `bomba di riso', a northern Italian analogue to the pasta `timbale' of the south. And, while many books cover bread making in a very superficial manner, this book not only does justice to this difficult subject, it covers many of the more arcane flatbreads which tend to be overshadowed by pizza from Naples and foccacia from Genoa. Her chapter on desserts also gives the lie to Sr. Batali's often-repeated statement that the Italians are not big on sweet desserts. While many of these may have grown out of French and Austrian influences, there are tortes and tarts aplenty to enliven an Italian themed entertainment.<br /><br />Ms. Kasper also gives us a very nice little guide to ingredients, mail order sources, and a bibliography composed almost entirely of Italian language sources.<br /><br />It is not hard to see how Ms. Kasper has been able to produce such a great book. Elizabeth David lived in Italy and studied its cuisine for a year before producing her excellent `Italian Food'. Ms. Kasper has spent the better part of a lifetime, including five years living in Bologna, studying this cuisine. It is no surprise that the recipe writing in this book rivals that of Julia Child in `Mastering the Art of French Cooking', as this author has spent about the same time mastering her subject before committing it to paper.<br /><br />Any culinary library that has any pretensions to being complete must include a copy of this book!any other authority on Italian cooking.

Not Simple!	`The Italian Country Table' is Lynne Rossetto Kasper's second book, a follow-up to the `won every award in the book' title, `The Splendid Table', which is also the name of Ms. Kasper's National Public Radio show which I have not yet had the pleasure of hearing.<br /><br />It is a great pleasure to see a book this good in such a crowded field. Ms. Kasper has narrowed the field a bit by focusing on `country' recipes. By doing this, she is outflanking the Hazan / Bastianich / Batali / Bugialli / Scicolone crowd and even sidestepping the footprints of the great Elizabeth David's `Italian Food'. Instead, her primary competition is from Susan Herrmann Loomis, who has made a business out of `farmhouse cooking', Vincent Schiavelli, who concentrates on Sicily (and to whom Ms. Kasper gives an acknowledgment), and Elizabeth Romer of `The Tuscan Year'. As Ms. Romer and Senor Schiavelli spend more time on memoir material than they do on culinary content, the real comparison is with Ms. Loomis, who is at a disadvantage in that her home base is in France rather than in Italy.<br /><br />As Ms. David discovered in 1954, Italian cooking in the hinterlands can be both utterly simple or it can be incredibly complex, especially for dishes designed for major celebrations. The star of this book may very well be its vegetarian timbale made for weddings. In Italian, it is even named as a wedding dish, `Timballo Matrimoniale'. The joker behind this recipe is that it is not a genuine rural Italian dish. It is the invention of the author based on the famous dish that typically contains three or four different varieties of meat. I have seen a timbale made twice. The first was on Mario Batali's show of three years ago, `Mario Eats Italy'. The second, and much more accessible version was in Stanley Tucci's movie, `Big Night', where the chef, played by `Adrian Monk' himself, Tony Shaloub, makes two of these monster pies or `molds'. Ms. Kasper's version is true to the heritage of this dish, as it involves six subassemblies, a page and a half of ingredients, and two pages of procedure.<br /><br />This complicated dish is not a singularity in this book. There are genuinely rustic `enhanced' versions of many other Italian specialities, such as a very jazzed up version of the Caprese salad.<br /><br />While `The Splendid Table' limited itself to Emilia-Romagna, the current book includes recipes from the Alps to Sicily, although the larger number seem to come from Lazio (Rome) and north of Rome. I am especially happy to find both simple and complicated recipes here, as it reassures me that the author is not limiting herself to just simple recipes. Although, she does offer some genuinely simple methods for some tasks which may appear difficult at first, such as making homemade soft pasta.<br /><br />Ms. Kasper's method, almost identical to the one I have seen Sr. Batali do on numerous occasions, is the classic eggs in the well, with the added recommendation that we eschew the mechanical pasta roller and do everything by hand.<br /><br />I am really hard pressed to find any general, substantive difference between the book by Ms. Loomis and the book by Ms. Kasper. I will give a small edge to Ms. Kasper for the wider range of recipe complexity, more genuinely personal connection to the material, and for the better digressions into the history of some Italian culinary traditions. Ms. Kasper also opens a window to a true taste of `Italian Kitsch' when she digresses on local museums of recently antiquated farm tools and homemade toys.<br /><br />Both books cover the full range of subjects, although Ms. Kasper seems to be a bit more focused on important recipes. Ms. Kasper includes all the typical subjects in her chapters, which are:<br /><br />Antipasti / Light Meals<br /><br />Pasta (sauces without tomatoes)<br /><br />Pasta Meets the Tomato<br /><br />Rice, Grains, and Beans<br /><br />Soup<br /><br />Poultry, Meats, and Fish<br /><br />Vegetables and Salads<br /><br/>Focaccia, Pizza and Breads of Ingenuity<br /><br />Desserts<br /><br />Menus<br /><br />Ingredients<br /><br />Both books also give very good press to the Italian practice of boarding tourists in farmhouses as a method to provide income to local farmers in the face of the new European Union agricultural regulations.<br /><br />Ms. Kasper has excellent appendices on mail order sources for foods and seeds, plus the contacts for a wide selection of restaurants and farm boarding establishments in Italy. She also has a carefully identified `Partial Bibliography' which concentrates on personal and regional writings on Italian food. The `big' books from Elizabeth David, Marcella Hazan, and Giuliano Bugialli are not here.<br /><br />If I were to be copy editing this book, the only suggestion I would make regarding it's layout is that it include a map of Italy's principle provinces and cites and indicate more clearly, with each recipe, from where in Italy the recipe comes.<br /><br />I do give extra points for the great personal black and white snaps that decorate the sidebars on personal experiences in Italy. I also give extra credit for revealing something about broth making which is new to my understanding of both broth making in general and Italian brodo's in particular. I am not fond of the longish cooking time for this broth, but I take Ms. Kasper at her word that this is how they actually make `Brodo di Mamma' in Imola.<br /><br />If you are already a big fan of Ms. Loomis' other books, get her `Italian Farmhouse Cookbook'. Otherwise, Ms. Kasper's book seems to be just a little deeper and more authentic, from a spiritual native of Italy.nd Breads of Ingenuity <br />Desserts <br />Menus <br />Ingredients <br /> <br />Both books also give very good press to the Italian practice of boarding tourists in farmhouses as a method to provide income to local farmers in the face of the new European Union agricultural regulations. <br /> <br />Ms. Kasper has excellent appendices on mail order sources for foods and seeds, plus the contacts for a wide selection of restaurants and farm boarding establishments in Italy.

Buy It!	`Italian Food' is one of the three major books Elizabeth David wrote in the first five years of her culinary writing career, the other two being `French Provincial Cooking' and her first, `Mediterranean Food'. The titles of two of these three books, being about `Food' and not strictly about `Cooking' is very telling of the fact that Ms. David's major books on food are simply not like any other writer of her generation.<br /><br />For starters, it is a mistake to see Ms. David as `the English Julia Child'. While Julia Child was possibly the most outstanding teacher of cooking methods writing in English, Ms. David was the most distinguished scholar of English, French, and Italian cooking methods and cuisine. The hallmark of that difference was that while Julia Child reworked and expanded traditional recipes so that no detail was left to chance for the amateur American cook, Ms. David goes to equal lengths to describe exactly how Italians really cook, down to the marked inexactness of their measuring.<br /><br />Unlike all the great modern writers in English on Italian cuisine such as Marcella Hazan, Giuliano Bugialli, and Lydia Bastianich, Ms. David not only gives us a survey of Italian ingredients, recipes, and methods, she gives us a critique of them as well. Can you possibly imagine Marcella Hazan saying that the Italians generally do not cook eggs very well?<br /><br />Note that Ms. David is as rigorous about her giving the correct Italian names to things as the very best of the Italian writers, but unlike the Italians, she is really seeing Italian cooking through French colored glasses. Today, we commonly think, for example, of a frittata as a distinct type of dish. Ms. David translates `frittata' into `omelet'. Her description of the technique is perfect, something even Mario Batali would be proud to quote, but he may object to the interpretation of the dish as seen by `the F country'.<br /><br />The importance of Ms. David's achievement, which required a full year's research in Italy, can only be appreciated when you realize that she was working in a climate of opinion in England which saw Italian cuisine as very dull, being nothing more than variations on pasta and veal. As we are well aware today, Ms. David found an enormous wealth of regional diversity in ingredients, methods, and even language, as the same pasta shape can be called three or four different names in different parts of the country.<br /><br />Since this is a critical and analytical look at Italian cooking, it is done by type of dish rather than by region. And, the book is not intended to be a `complete' survey of Italian dishes. There are a few well known dishes such as `pasta puttanesca' or `timbales' which are not here, and some, such as `spaghetti alla carbonara' which are found under a slightly different name, `Maccheroni alla carbonara' (which is actually more appropriate, as many types of pasta shapes are done with this eggy preparation).<br /><br />One of the many things that stand out in this book is how well Ms. David's personality and point of view come out on practically every page. In a recent competition for `The next Food Network Star', the judges stated over and over that the contestants must project who they were while presenting the culinary material. Like her great contemporaries, M.F.K. Fisher and Julia Child, this is certainly one thing which Elizabeth David does to great effect. I was especially pleased when she spoke of her connection to the much older travel writer, Norman Douglas. While Ms. David's biography did not clearly reveal the source of Elizabeth's love of food and food writing, the statements in Ms. David's own `Italian Food' make it clear that the elder Norman Douglas was her primary mentor in establishing her professional interest in food and writing about it at a very high standard.<br /><br />Ms. David's high standards are evident when you compare her writing with that of Tony May in his recent handbook, `Italian Cuisine' where I found several mistakes in identifying ingredients. While the culinary content was sound, Mr. May, and his publisher's copy editors, had relatively low standards for factual accuracy.<br /><br />A quick look at the back of `Italian Cooking' confirms the fact that this is more a work of scholarship than of a simple book on cookery. There are appendices of bibliographies on both cooking and tourism and notes on wine. One may need to be a little careful with any references, especially on wine and travel, as much in this area has changed in the last 50 years.<br /><br />Short of stumbling across an autographed copy of the hardcover edition with the original illustrations, you will want to refer to the revised edition, first published by Penguin Books in 1963, as this edition incorporates most of the footnotes into the main text, as the footnoted material was largely segregated due to the 1954 rationing of food in England.<br /><br />While Ms. David had several major culinary writing disciples, especially Jane Grigson and Claudia Roden, I believe the only place you will find writing at her level of scholarly criticism is from the leading modern columnists such as John Thorne, Jeffrey Steingarten, and James Villas.<br /><br />You may not want to cook from this book on a daily basis, but as I have, I believe you can use this as your primary source of Italian recipes, and be all the wiser for choosing this volume.ine' where I found several mistakes in identifying ingredients.

Ms. Willinger in this book is focusing on vegetables in a way that is somewhat different from her closest competitor, Jack Bishop, with his book, `The Complete ItalianVegetarian Cookbook'. And, before I go any further, if all you want is Italian recipes with vegetables, then Bishop's book will definitely give you more of what you want than Ms. Willinger's older and shorter volume.<br /><br />When I started in on Ms. Willinger's book, I quickly became wary of her statement that the Italians like vegetables because they taste good. Almost every authority I have read on the matter, including some which go back to Renaissance cooking, are pretty clear on the fact that Italians like vegetables because they were poor and so many good vegetables could be gathered from the wild.<br /><br />As I was docking the author for her faulty history, I largely gave her back most of her points when I saw how she treated her subject once we got into the individual vegetables. Unlike Mr. Bishop who organizes his recipes by type of dish, Ms. Willinger treats each of her nineteen headline vegetables in a separate chapter. Note that while there are only nineteen chapters, many more species are discussed. The chapter on artichokes, for example, also deals with cardoons and there is but one chapter on all of mushrooms.<br /><br />The selection of recipes is not meant to be complete or even a selection of the most popular dishes. The chapter on artichokes, for example, does not include the famous `carciofi alla giudea' of Rome. In fact, most of the recipes are identified with the name of the individual from whom Ms. Willinger cribbed the procedure.<br /><br />This book is a bit of a lightweight compared to many, but it has a lot of historical and botanical information you may not find elsewhere. It is an excellent addition to any library on Italian cuisine, but if you have Elizabeth Schneider's `Vegetables from Amaranth to Zucchini' and Jack Bishop's book, you will probably not miss this volume.a selection of the most popular dishes.

Suggest you read originals	`South Wind Through the Kitchen' is a collection of sections from the books of premier English food writer, Elizabeth David by her literary executor, Jill Norman, with suggestions on what to include by a wide variety of Ms. David's colleagues and professional fans.<br /><br />The problem with this book is that one must decide whether it is more appropriate to review Ms. David's work or the way in which pieces of it have been assembled in this volume. As I have already reviewed most of Elizabeth David's major works that are digested in this volume, I think it is clear to me that the thing to do is judge the way in which the pieces have been assembled.<br /><br />In reviewing this book, some other Amazon.com reviewers have taken the alternate course and focused on the work of Ms. David herself. In doing so, I feel they have misjudged Elizabeth David's place in culinary writing. For starters, Ms. David was not the `English Julia Child'. Ms. David and Ms. Child had slightly different agendas, which should be clear when you examine the way they go about presenting a recipe. While Julia Child is the consummate teacher in `Mastering the Art of French Cooking' and her subsequent books and TV series, Elizabeth David is the scholar and analyst. Her recipes, especially in her major early works, `Mediterranean Food', `French Provincial Cooking', and `Italian Food' tend to be briefer, but with a whole lot more explanations on the backgrounds of dishes, where Ms. David first encountered the recipe, and why the recipe is done the way it is. While Julia Child has a great way about her writing that makes reading her recipes almost as much fun as watching her PBS shows, there is not much personal material. Julia Child is writing the great classic cookbook. Elizabeth David is recording her experiences with food. That does not mean that Elizabeth David is playing the epicure, giving us a record of her experiences and reactions to food, as you find in the writings of M.F.K. Fisher. She is giving us the scholar's diary of what she has learned about her subject. The best fit to this model of Ms. David's work is her first book in 1950, `A Book of Mediterranean Food' which was literally assembled from her culinary diary begun in 1939.<br /><br />This same reviewer devalues Ms. David's work as being good but not great for emphasizing fresh local ingredients. The reviewer makes the mistake of saying that Elizabeth David anticipated this great mantra of modern culinary doctrine. This principle is, in fact much older than Elizabeth David's writing. She is simply reporting it. My favorite illustration of how old and well established this doctrine is comes from the practice of the great 19th century New York City restaurant, Delmonicos, which maintained its own truck farm in New Jersey from which it got almost all its greens and vegetables in season.<br /><br />If any one thing is to set Elizabeth David's writing apart from most others, aside from the sheer quality of her composition, it is the fact that she downplays rules and conventions and speaks to us about the properties of ingredients, what people do with them, and what we may be encouraged to do with them. The finest example of this is her great little piece on omelet technique from `French Provincial Cooking' that is reprinted in this book. Before presenting what is the best ever description of the classic technique I have ever read she says that the right way to make an omelet is the way you want to make it! I see the same freedom from convention expressed in many of her other writings in this book.<br /><br />So how about the quality of this book? My opinion, which may or may not suit your needs, is that virtually everyone who enjoys reading culinary writings would do better by acquiring copies of Ms. David's major complete works rather than spending money on this volume. I believe the quality of her writing was so consistently high that you will not find any rough or uninteresting patches as youread the three books I mentioned above. I will say that the book `English Bread and Yeast Cookery' may not be for everyone. It may not even be for everyone interested in bread baking. But the original article is superior to the short snippets from that book you get in this volume. And, this is in spite of the fact that one of those snippets has a really excellent technique for making Irish Soda Bread, one of my favorite quickbread preparations.<br /><br />This book has one very good use. If you have no previous exposure to Ms. David's writing, this is a better sampler of her mainstream work than the collection of newspaper and magazine pieces, `An Omelette and a Glass of Wine'.<br /><br />As the words are from the incomparable writer, Elizabeth David, I must give this at least four stars, but as I think you are better served by reading her original works, I do not give it five stars, especially as all of her major works are available in incredibly cheap Penguin editions.hes as you read the three books I mentioned above.

In the world of culinary studies, most of these articles are just as weighty as theoretical studies of concepts such as `memory', `explanation', `space', `time', and `meaning'.<br /><br />The big difference between philosophical investigations and culinary `research' is that culinary investigations have no methods of their own. Virtually all culinary studies are really studies of botany, philology, chemistry, history, geography, or even jurisprudence. The thing which commonly sets the very best culinary research apart from these other studies, especially in the hands of its greatest practitioners such as Elizabeth David and her disciples, Jane Grigson, Alan Davidson, and Claudia Roden is the great sense of fun in carrying out this research simply because it is fun to do.<br /><br />Although this very English journal with the very French name is filled with relatively light, enjoyable pieces by a wide range of writers, it was created by a collaboration of Elizabeth David, Alan Davidson, and Richard Olney for a very serious, practical purpose. Richard Olney had just been given the role of editor in chief of the Time-Life series of books on `Food of the World'. And, the publishers insisted that no recipe be printed in these volumes unless it had previously been published. This put Olney in a bind, as he had perfectly good recipes that were not allowed, as they had not already appeared in print. Soooooo... the renowned Ms. David and her henchmen create the food journal `Petits Propos Culinaires' (PPC) and promptly run two articles by Richard Olney, writing under two different pseudonyms, and Olney has his published recipes. Both articles appeared in Issue 1 of PPC, but only `Aubergine Gratin' by pseudonym Nathan d'Aulnay is collected in this anthology.<br /><br />A sense of the range of issues covered by PPC can be seen by looking at the section names under which the 71 articles are collected. There are:<br /><br />Scoops and Distant Beachheads, highlighted by a three article series by a great number of collaborators doing a whimsically canted but very serious investigation into the woody `Bois di Panama', an apparent ingredient in an important Lebanese confection especially popular around Easter.<br /><br />Culinary History, featuring an article by Claudia Roden on Arab influences on western cooking, including the finding that that very French technique of the braise can be traced back to Arab practice.<br /><br />On Your Plate, featuring an article on the varieties of olive oil. While most articles are pretty arcane, some few, like this one, may be old hat to dedicated foodies, especially as olive oil is such an important ingredient these days.<br /><br />Books and Cooks, including, sadly, memorial essays by Davidson on M.F.K. Fisher and Elizabeth David who both died in 1992.<br /><br />Exotica, such as an essay on mushroom growing termites of Uganda.<br /><br />Recipes, including several by Richard Olney (disguised and in the plain)<br /><br />Finally, there is a short section with selections from the journal's `Notes and Queries', or, answers to readers questions or simply volunteered observations on things of interest.<br /><br />This is not the sort of book, like the `Larousse Gastronomique' to which you refer when you need an answer. On the other hand, it is not necessarily something you want to read from cover to cover, although I suggest that the dedicated foodie do just that. This is a place where, if you do not already know the work of Davidson and Olney and David and Grigson, you can see a sample of their writing which makes them so revered among people who know their work. Ms.David's pieces in particular are clever in the extreme.<br /><br />Onthe other hand, if you are not a dyed in the wool foodie and may wish to simply sample writing by Elizabeth David, I suggest you go to her later collections such as `An Omelette and a Glass of Wine' or `South Wind Through the Kitchen'. Similarly, if you really want high-end writing on French cuisine, consult Richard Olney's `Simple French Food' or David's `French Provincial Cooking'.<br /><br />If you are a big fan of John Thorne, Jeffrey Steingarten, or James Villas, then embrace this book with both arms and enjoy yourself.extreme. <br /> <br />On the other hand, if you are not a dyed in the wool foodie and may wish to simply sample writing by Elizabeth David, I suggest you go to her later collections such as `An Omelette and a Glass of Wine' or `South Wind Through the Kitchen'.

156109:US	39134375	R31X8JDM18OZJE	0060198281	105067816	Writing at the Kitchen Table: The Authorized Biography of Elizabeth David	Books	5	8	8	N	Y	Very Good Biography, Very Important Culinary Writer	`Writing at the Kitchen Table' is the `Authorized Biography of Elizabeth David' by Artemis Cooper. Biographer Cooper, by great sympathy with his subject, with access to great sources, and by superior narrative has given us a superior biography of one of the three great female English language culinary writers of the twentieth century.<br /><br />It is revealing to compare the lives and careers of Ms. David with the other two greats, Julia Child and M.F.K. Fisher. She stands roughly between Child, the great teacher and Fisher, the great gourmand and explorer of appetites. Her recipe writing was less pedagogical and more analytical than Child, and less subjective but more attentive to details of other peoples works than Fisher.<br /><br />In their personal lives, it is interesting to see that while David and Fisher were certifiably beautiful women through much of their lives, their success with husbands was poor to dismal by the standards of their day and ours. In contrast, the very tall and warbly voiced Julia Child was attractive by the same standards one may have used with Eleanor Roosevelt, yet her family life with husband, Paul Child was one of the world's great enduring love stories.<br /><br />A fascinating parallel with Child and David is that they both served in their country's intelligence organizations overseas during World War II. While Child was with the OSS in India and Burma, David was with British Intelligence in Cairo, where she landed at the beginning of the war after a literally hair raising flight from the Italians and Germans in 1940, across the Mediterranean just as the Germans were invading Greece. Also, Ms. Child and Ms. David both met their future husbands during the war.<br /><br />One small problem I have with the biographies of both Ms. David and Ms. Fisher is that neither does a really good job of identify the spark that ignited their interest in food. Unlike these two, Julia Child's epiphany is obvious when she found herself with a husband who liked to eat well, and she did not really know how to cook. Necessity took over and Julia dove into the subject with what became a lifelong passion.<br /><br />With Elizabeth David, the interest seems to creep up on her as a result of really dismal food in her nursery as a child, followed by the revelation of very good food while living and studying in Paris and Munich. While Ms. Fisher started writing before World War II, Ms. Child and Ms. David both started their careers around 1950, although Ms. David was first published `Mediterranean Food' seven years before Julia Child et al's `Mastering the Art of French Cooking'. In fact, by 1962, after publishing `French Provincial Food' and `Italian Food', Ms. David was quite the authority compared to newcomer Child.<br /><br />This is another interesting parallel in that the most famous works from all three authors came early in their careers. While Ms. Fisher's greatest fame came in the 1960's, it was largely based on reissues of works she did in the 1940s. And, neither Ms. Child nor Ms. David ever topped the popularity of the works in their first five years.<br /><br />Oddly, Elizabeth David's very best work of scholarship was probably published near the end of her career, and it is probably her least known major work. This is `English Bread and Yeast Cookery', which lead to her achieving her highest official recognition's from the Crown and from English intellectual society. What is surprising is that this great scholarly work may have as much in common with Rachael Carson's `Silent Spring' as it does with Peter Reinhart's books on bread baking. Along with great information on home and commercial practice, it was a revelation of how poor English commercial bread baking could be.<br /><br />In addition to her unfortunate romantic live and her James Bondean experiences at the opening of World War II, Ms. David's life in general seems to have been less happy than that of Ms. Fisher and far less happy than the `too good to be believed' life of Ms. Child. Ms. David's father died young and her mother did not have a great deal of interest in her four daughters. Early in life, Elizabeth made up for her family's alienation by living beyond her means, with the knowledge that her family's estate would bail her out of her debts.<br /><br />Her relations with her family and many friends seemed to be perpetually bumpy. Elizabeth could be both very reserved and very prickly, with a blindness to seeing the other point of view in a lot of cases, leading to more than one very long term alienation from former friends. She was, for example, very difficult to interview and had a great aversion to seeing her name in print in contexts other than as author of her own works.<br /><br />Her business dealings tended to the difficult as well, although not entirely through her doing. Her relations with publishers of books and magazines seemed to be especially difficult, leading to serious legal entanglements. Her problems with the cookware store, `Elizabeth David, LTD', of which she was just one of five shareholders were largely her own doing, as she ignored good business sense and ran things largely to suit her personal tastes. Then, she took serious offense when her business partners brought in a manager with good marketing skills.<br /><br />While Elizabeth David's influence was not great in the United States, it did have a great effect on the general direction of American cuisine in her friendship with American expatriate, Richard Olney and their joint influence on Chez Panisse movers and shakers, Alice Waters and Jeremiah Tower, plus the tiny San Francisco eatery, Zuni Caf&eacute;, soon to be the second best known San Francisco eatery, after Panisse.<br /><br />This book was more enjoyable to read than the recent Fisher biography, `Poet of the Appetites', but not quite as much fun as the Child biography, `Appetite for Life'.<br /><br />If you consider yourself a card-carrying foodie, you should read this book.than the `too good to be believed' life of Ms. Child.

I always expect that such books trade off quality for quantity and that with all the effort expended to make the magic number in the title, I am inclined to believe there is little energy left for quality material. This prejudice is odd, because I often refer to this book for Chinese recipes over highly celebrated and more recent volumes by Barbara Tropp (`The Modern Art of Chinese Cooking'), Virginia Lee and Craig Claiborne (`The Chinese Cookbook') and Eileen Yin-Fei Lo (`The Chinese Kitchen'). Two things lead to my overcoming my prejudice and doing a full review of the book. The first was my positive take on Michelle Scicolone's `1000 Italian Recipes' (even though I think Mario Batali's new `Molto Italiano' is somewhat better) and a warmly positive reference to Ms. Miller's tome in Sylvia Lovegren's \\"Fashionable Food'.<br /><br />As I already said, one of the most distinctive things about Ms. Miller's book is the fact that her recipes tend to be simpler than other leading cookbooks. This is probably a good thing if you are already an experienced cook; however, I think the other authors do amateurs a great service by going into much greater detail on important architypical recipes, very similar to the model set by Julia Child in `Mastering the Art of French Cooking'. So, while the other books may have one or two detailed recipes for Lo Mein, Ms. Miller will give us twelve (12) recipes for the same dish. And, she doesn't stop there. Each recipe of the thousand are given with one, or, more likely, several variations. Thus, this legion of recipes becomes multiplied to form a great web of interlocking recipes, techniques, and menus.<br /><br />Aside from the recipes, one of the most distinctive aspects of the book is the emphasis it places on the Chinese style of eating. Unlike French and Italian traditions, the Chinese meal has no `main course'. Like Korean and Japanese dining, it is based on a lot of little dishes, with relatively little meat, and certainly very little beef, if any.<br /><br />For as large as the selection of recipes is, the author still takes a lot of space to discuss important Chinese techniques, ingredients, and basic preparations. I was especially interested in the section on stocks. The basic technique was indistinguishable from a common French method. In fact, it even seems to improve on some French inspired techniques. Best of all, the cooking time is reasonable, the meat is not overcooked, the vegetables are not cooked too long, and the result should be clear enough to satisfy even a moderately fussy French chef.<br /><br />One of the big lessons of the book is the fact that while cooking time for a Chinese meal may be shorter than for a French meal, the prep time may be a lot longer, so, the total time comes out to be the same.<br /><br />The strongest general impression I take away from this book is a confirmation of my notion that the thing which makes both Italian and Chinese cuisines so popular and so diverse is the great many ways in which a relatively simple collection of super pantry items are mixed and matched to form an immense variety of different dishes.<br /><br />The only thing which turned me off about the book is the praise given to the Chinese cuisine for things which are true of every great cuisine. After reading hundreds of different cookbooks on food from around the world, rapsodies over using fresh, seasonal ingredients can leave me pretty cold.<br /><br />If you want to make some Chinese dishes now and then to mix things up a bit, and you really know your way around the kitchen, this may be the best book for the job. On the other hand, if you are really interested in MASTERING Chinese cooking techniques, the newer books, especially Ms. Tropp's volume, may be better. If thatis your interest, owning at least two of these four books will be a good thing.tter. If that is your interest, owning at least two of these four books will be a good thing. <br />	2005-07-20

Unlike some other grandly titled books on salads, this little volume does two big things right for a salads only book.<br /><br />For starters, it's first chapter of recipes has seven (7) recipes for major, classic salads, almost all of which originated in French, Italian, or American cuisines. These are:<br /><br />Caesar Salad<br /><br />Cobb Salad<br /><br />Potato Salad<br /><br />Salade Nicoise<br /><br />Celery Root Remoulade<br /><br />Insalata Caprese<br /><br />Ambrosia<br /><br />The second `big' thing it gets right is that the next four chapters cover salads appropriate to each of the four seasons. While your average megamart has virtually all fruits and vegetables throughout the year, there are still some important seasonal considerations that make a difference in the quality or cost of a salad. For example, asparagus and artichokes are far cheaper in the spring than at any other time of the year; tomatoes and fresh corn are at their very best if obtained locally in the summer; apples and pears are freshest in the fall, and citrus is most abundant and least expensive in the winter.<br /><br />The last chapter of recipes gives us seven (7) `picnic' salads whose taste improves over time or which are easily assembled at the last minute `on site'. They are also very good for extended periods without refrigeration as they contain no mayonnaise or any other uncooked or semi-cooked eggs.<br /><br />There is a non-recipe chapter at the end on `Salad Basics' covering the primary ingredients and techniques including vinaigrettes, creamy dressings, types of greens, and varieties of other ingredients. It is beyond me why this chapter is put at the back of the book when it is something you should read before embarking on the recipes or on a career of ad libbing salad making.<br /><br />The only other quirk of the book's organization is that the two potato salad recipes are in two different chapters, one in the classics and one in the summer chapter. Otherwise, in general, this is a very well thought out book organization, making up for the slightly pricy $16.95 list price for 43 recipes. We are also well served by the fact that there is a full-page color snapshot of the results of each and every completed recipe. For a glossy book like this, one would feel cheated if there were pics of only half the recipes.<br /><br />With all this good stuff going for it, I did find some things that were just a little off. In the recipes for the classic salads, I found at least four instructions that concerned me. The first two were where poaching chicken and cooking hard-boiled eggs were done at substantially longer times than what I have found to be necessary from both other authoritative recipes and from my own experience. I was inclined to think that the author was just trying to be careful with microbes, until I read the Caesar Salad recipe, where a totally raw egg was used to make the dressing. In all the very best recipes for Caesar Salad, the raw egg is `coddled' before adding it to the dressing. That is, it is cooked in boiling water for about a minute to kill off any microbeasties. I was also just a little concerned with the amount of fresh garlic used in the Caesar salad, and the method by which it was added. It called for first making the toasted croutons, then rubbing the fresh garlic onto the sides of all those little cubes. This seems to be a relatively tiresome method, which could easily be replaced by toasting the bread slices, rubbing on the garlic, then cutting the toast into little cubes. And even better and quite traditional technique is to rub the cut garlic into the wooden salad bowl before mixing the dressing.<br /><br />All in all, this is a better salad book than others I have seen and it is a very good first salad book./>	2005-07-17

Otherwise, in general, this is a very well thought out book organization, making up for the slightly pricy $16.95 list price for 43 recipes. We are also well served by the fact that there is a full-page color snapshot of the results of each and every completed recipe. For a glossy book like this, one would feel cheated if there were pics of only half the recipes.<br /><br />With all this good stuff going for it, I did find some things that were just a little off. In the recipes for the classic salads, I found at least four instructions that concerned me. The first two were where poaching chicken and cooking hard-boiled eggs were done at substantially longer times than what I have found to be necessary from both other authoritative recipes and from my own experience. I was inclined to think that the author was just trying to be careful with microbes, until I read the Caesar Salad recipe, where a totally raw egg was used to make the dressing. In all the very best recipes for Caesar Salad, the raw egg is `coddled' before adding it to the dressing. That is, it is cooked in boiling water for about a minute to kill off any microbeasties. I was also just a little concerned with the amount of fresh garlic used in the Caesar salad, and the method by which it was added. It called for first making the toasted croutons, then rubbing the fresh garlic onto the sides of all those little cubes. This seems to be a relatively tiresome method, which could easily be replaced by toasting the bread slices, rubbing on the garlic, then cutting the toast into little cubes. And even better and quite traditional technique is to rub the cut garlic into the wooden salad bowl before mixing the dressing.<br /><br />All in all, this is a better salad book than others I have seen and it is a very good first salad book./>	2005-07-17

Repeats other books	`French Food at Home' by Laura Calder is a very puzzling book. The biggest question which occurs to me at the get go is why write a 229 page book on a subject which has been covered in so much greater detail in the1270 pages of `Mastering the Art of French Cooking', the great cookbook classic by Julia Child, et. al. If that was not enough, you have the legions of volumes by Ms. Child's disciples such as Patricia Wells, Susan Hermann Loomis, Ina Garten, Amanda Hesser, and a dozen lesser lights who have touched on this subject. And, that doesn't even touch the professional chef's contributions to the genre with such prominent names such Thomas Keller (`Bouchon') and Tony Bourdain (`Le Halle Cookbook'). Last but not least are the books by professional teachers such as James Peterson, Jacques Pepin, Anne Willan, Richard Olney, and Madeline Kammen. So why add a new book to this very long list.<br /><br />My puzzlement was doubled when I noticed that many of the recipes in this book are chestnuts which appear in virtually all general books on French recipes, not to mention the tomes put out by `Betty Crocker', `Better Homes and Gardens', and Martha Stewart. Exactly how many recipes do you need for Tapenade, Crudites, Gougeres, Tuiles, Hot Mussels (moules mariniere), Hollandaise, Endive Salad, Ratatouille, Tarte Tatin, and on and on and on!<br /><br />Then I started to read Ms. Calder's headnotes and noticed that Miss Laura has a sense of humor about her writing. I can't give her complete credit for this, as a lightness and humor comparable to her famous high spirits on her TV shows also distinguish the great Julia's writing. But aside from Julia Child and, among writers of French cookbooks, Tony Bourdain, there may be just a little too much seriousness about cooking.<br /><br />I also discovered a few recipes that did have a strong novelty about them, as with `duck on a string'. In some of the classics, I also noticed a fairly high level of ingenuity in giving special twists to classics, such as the tapenade rolled into a spiral with pastry.<br /><br />The author is also pleasantly realistic about the fact that cooking some dishes simply does take time. To this end, she provides main courses in two different chapters, one entitled `Dinner Fairly Fast' and the other entitled `Dinner Slightly Slower'. Like the better `fast cooking' apostles, Ms. Calder's fast dishes are classics which are easy to prepare without introducing any artificial shortcuts. These include lots of fish and egg dishes. The slower dishes are braises roasts, gratins, and tarts, among other things. One of the most interesting recipes in this section is entitled `Housewife Chicken' where a 3 pound bird can be cooked on top of the stove, en casserole, with veggies thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />There are a number of better than average sidebars on techniques such as how to debone a chicken. Unfortunately, there are no pictures, so you are probably much better off going to Monsieur Pepin or Herr Peterson for some illustrated guidance.<br /><br />One page Ms. Calder takes from Patricia Wells' book is that many of her recipes are cribbed directly from major French chefs. The most common contributor is Michael Bras whose three star recipes are turned into something easy for the average amateur.<br /><br />I am really happy I found and read this book, but the extent to which it duplicates material in many other books makes it difficult to know if the book is really worth the cost. For someone who owns no books on French recipes, and who just wants to see what all the excitement is about, I strongly recommend the book. It is entertaining and it has many of the recipes which made French cookery famous. For someone who owns and has assimilated one or more major good books on French cooking, you may want to save your money for a more complete book such as Madeleine Kammen's `The Making of a Cook' or a book with more different recipes, such as Patricia Wells' books onthe cooking of Provence.<br /><br />This book gives a pretty fresh look to a very well worn path!lls' books on the cooking of Provence. <br /> <br />This book gives a pretty fresh look to a very well worn path! <br />	2005-07-15

Baruch and `Polish Cookery' by Marja Ochorowicz-Monatowa, translated from the Polish by Jean Karsavina are two common extremes in the presentation of a national cuisine, if that cuisine is not French, Italian, Spanish, Indian, Thai, Chinese, Japanese, or Mexican. I have seen many of the latter style for virtually every nation from Norway to Rumania, most especially from the central European countries. Many of the recipes are presented in the most simple of forms, with little or no discussion of technique. Their primary virtue lies in their containing a lot of authentic recipes so that if you are handy around the kitchen, you should have no trouble with the simple instructions. After all, Elizabeth David started her prodigious career as a food writer by doing a book on Mediterranean recipes with relatively simple recipe descriptions.<br /><br />As a native Pole wrote `Polish Cookery' in Poland, I have to assume the authenticity of the recipes is unimpeachable. And, in spite of my picturing the recipes in books of this class as `bare bones' descriptions, I am especially happy to say that the general introductions to all the major sections have great suggestions on how to get the best out of each type of dish. The introduction to the section that includes pierogies is an especially good example, as it gives excellent general rules for preparing pastry fillings. These rules are:<br /><br />1. Cook meat until tender, but do not brown, or it will be too dry.<br /><br />2. Grind meat at least twice through a meat grinder.<br /><br />3. Pates may be baked, but they are best steamed, as baking dries and toughens them.<br /><br />These three simple rules contain an enormous amount of wisdom as they clearly distinguish this cooking style from braising and sauteeing and show a great common ground with the famous steamed meat filled dumplings of Chinese dim sum. This second rule also points out that the author is talking about a kitchen where a meat grinder is a common appliance and a blender and food processor are not. This may seem odd, except that my Hungarian grandmother did have a meat grinder and used it on a regular basis. (One warning is that while the index is excellently done with both Polish and English entries, it may be just a little difficult to find some familiar dishes if you only know the English name. I had to look carefully to fine pierogies recipes, as the only reference to pierogies was in Polish.)<br /><br />I give this detail to warn anyone who may be inclined to ignore this book in favor of the volume with which I will compare it. This little book is marvelously inexpensive, hard covered, and sound. As complete as it is, I am surprised that it does not include any bread recipes and most basic pastry recipes are attributed to the French.<br /><br />This is one thing which pleases me so much about Michael Baruch's book, as it starts out with a chapter of excellent recipes for fresh yeast breads, featuring great rye and pumpernickel bread recipes, which are not always available in bread baking books. All bread recipes are done with a yeast sponge and technique that would make Peter Reinhart proud.<br /><br />I am happy that chef Baruch started out with such a great opening chapter because there is much in this book to turn one off if you are inclined to nit-pick. In fact, if this book were a general cookbook by some new TV celebrity show off cook, I would pan it for its misspellings, conceits, and clumsy statements. As it is an excellent presentation of Polish cuisine as interpreted by an American chef with several worthwhile sections and good details on cooking techniques, I overlook the copy editor's mistakes and focus on the chef's content.<br /><br />One thing in this book that is odd to find in a volume on a minor national cuisine is a catalogue of cooking and baking equipment. I tend to pan these lists, as they are often a basis for buying things you may never need. This is particularly true of the list of baking equipment. The list of pots and pans has it's foibles, as certain types of equipment are listed twice for no reason, but if you overlook that, the list is especially good, especially with the recommendation for having two non-stick fry pans. I do warn you against his critique of Calphalon pots, as I have found their anodized aluminum ware to be excellent and their inexpensive all metal Teflon ware to be perfect for the amateur cook.<br /><br />For an oversized book with really excellent photographs, I find the $32 list price to be a very nice deal. One thing the author establishes very well is the influence on Polish cooking from Renaissance Italy. The danger in this observation is that it is sometimes hard to distinguish between Polish dishes with Italian influences and Italian dishes the author added to pad his pages. If you think I am just guessing about this, check out the recipe for `Hail Thaddeus Caesarski Salad'. In spite of the Polish name, the recipe looks almost identical to the original prepared in Tijuana by Caesar Cardini. This filler is odd in that the author states that he has enough material for another volume sometime in the future.

173669:US	39134375	RYMEVHFE8IYSF	0609603558	183434454	The Essential Cuisines of Mexico: Revised and updated throughout, with more than 30 new recipes.	Books	5	115	116	N	Y	THE classic on Mexican cooking. Buy It.	`The Essential Cuisines of Mexico' is Diana Kennedy's Mexican answer to Julia Child's `Mastering the Art of French Cooking'. It has a similar style and quality and, like Child's encounter with French cooking, it came about as a result of her marriage to a husband who was posted to Mexico by his newspaper, `The New York Times' as their Caribbean / Mexican correspondent. This, plus a little help from New York Times colleague and friend, Craig Claiborne lead Ms. Kennedy to start teaching Mexican cooking and prompting her to write a book on the subject.<br /><br />There are two big differences between this book and Ms. Child's `magnum opus'. The first is that this volume is an amalgam of three earlier books, while `...French Cooking' was a distillation from a manuscript at least twice the size of the final published volume. The second major difference is that while Ms. Child is documenting `cuisine bourgeois', Ms. Kennedy is looking at Mexico's `cuisine provincial'. This is highlighted by the fact that the geographical home of all recipes is cited, and the geographic specifics are given for all the major ingredients cited in the appendix.<br /><br />The three earlier books being combined here are `The Cuisines of Mexico', `The Tortilla Book', and `Mexican Regional Cooking'. The author also states that some new material has been added to the recipes from these three books. To my eye, the integration of the three volumes is seamless. The author and her editors have not simply pasted the three volumes together, they have merged all the material to create a single work easily superior to the original three.<br /><br />By the time this book was published, it should be evident to the English speaking world at large that Ms. Kennedy has some serious competition from Chicagoan, Rick Bayless in the world of Mexican culinary authorities. Just as Ms. Kennedy presents recipes very similar to fellow amateur Julia Child and fellow `culinary archeologist' Paula Wolfert, chef Bayless does a much more analytical approach to Mexican cuisine, deconstructing dishes into their component parts in `Rich Bayless' Mexican Kitchen' and giving us multiple versions of important dishes in `Mexico One Plate at a Time'.<br /><br />In spite of these differences, Ms. Kennedy and Mr. Bayless agree on virtually everything important when they address the same subjects. The most important point on which they agree is the central place of Oaxaca as, to coin a phrase, the Provence of Mexican cuisine. On which author to prefer, if you are a fan of Mexican dishes, buy both authors, bypassing the earlier books which were folded into the current volume and also bypassing Mr. Bayless' `Salsas That Cook' as there is some overlap with `Rick Bayless's (sic) Mexican Kitchen'. If you are a culinary professional, Mr. Bayless may be just a bit more useful. If you simply want lots of good recipes, go with Ms. Kennedy. Also, Ms. Kennedy probably has the edge when it comes to giving recipes for Mexican baking, as that is one of her special interests. And, if that is where your strongest interest lies, go for her latest book, `From My Mexican Kitchen'. On which writer is more `authentic' I am taking it on faith that both authors are incredibly faithful to the tastes and the spirit of the Mexican originals while being very considerate of their gringo audience's kitchen equipment and skills.<br /><br />The one thing about which one may be disappointed in this book, based on the title, is that there is very little discussion of general regional differences. There is not even a dusty little map of Mexico and its regions. This is surprising in that, for example Penelope Casas includes a map of Spanish regions in all her major cookbooks and Diane Kochilas includes one in her excellent book on Greek cuisines. And, both authors give us recipes by region. Ms. Kennedy's omission is doubly puzzling as chef Bayless' first book, `Authentic Mexican' opens with a very good map of Mexican regions. This, of course, is only important if you are really interested in regionality, as when you plan to travel to Mexico. If all you want is recipes, this consideration is of no importance.<br /><br />Following the model of her spiritual mentor, Julia Child, Ms. Kennedy's recipes are exceptionally well written. To those of us for whom this is important, note that all volumetric measurements are given in both English and metric units. And, Ms. Kennedy's admonition on careful measurement, regardless of the unit, is well taken. In spite of the fact that these are interpretations of very provincial recipes, Ms. Kennedy goes to great lengths to add warnings and suggestions regarding what can be prepared in advance, what should be served immediately, and what can be refrigerated or frozen safely, without loosing flavor or texture.<br /><br />This book is not compulsively chatty, if that is something which annoys you. Many recipes have short headnotes, but not all recipes do. The overall book is organized by type of recipe, which makes it ideal for quick reference. In that regard, it is much better than Mr. Bayless PBS tie-in volumes. I went directly to the egg recipe chapter and was greeted immediately with the familiar `Huevos Rancheros', only to discover that Ms. Kennedy does anticipate Mr. Bayless a bit (and copies her Julia Child model as well) by separating the Salsa Ranchera recipe from the egg recipe with citations in the Salsa recipe for the dishes in which it is used.<br /><br />I do not miss pictures in cookbooks, but if you do, go for Bayless' first book, `Authentic Mexican'. Otherwise, if you simply need Mexican recipes, pick this book first, especially as Ms. Kennedy is a better and more engaging writer than chef Bayless in his first book. My only real regret with this book is that there is no `analytical' listing of recipes by Mexican region. Otherwise, this is a real classic!egions.

As Rick explains, the notion of a salsa is much broader to the Mexican mind than it may be to us gringos looking at the notion from the outside. The essential recipes are:<br /><br />Simmered Tomato-Jalapeno Sauce<br /><br />Roasted Tomato-Jalapeno Salsa from the Stone Mortar<br /><br />Chopped Tomato-Serrano Salsa<br /><br />Chopped Tomato-Habanero Salsa<br /><br />Simmered Tomato-Habanero Salsa<br /><br />Quick Cooked Tomato-Chipotle Sauce<br /><br />Simmered Tomatillo-Serrano Sauce<br /><br />Roasted Tomatillo-Serrano Salsa<br /><br />Roasted Tomatillo-Chipotle Salsa<br /><br />Sweet and Spicy Ancho Seasoning Paste<br /><br />Sweet and Smoky Chipotle Seasoning Salsa<br /><br />Bold Pasilla Seasoning Paste<br /><br />Simmered Guajillo Sauce<br /><br />Roasted Poblano Rajas with Seared White Onions and Herbs<br /><br />Garlicky Achiote Seasoning Paste<br /><br />Corn Tortillas<br /><br />I reproduced all these titles here to give you the best possible sense of what is at the heart of this book. Like the Italian cuisine and its preserved meats, cheeses, pasta and vinegars, the great variety of Mexican cooking is based on a few essential ingredients and the most important ingredient family, the dried chile and corn flour, came about, like Italy's meats and cheeses, from the need to preserve important ingredients from spoilage.<br /><br />If this book were nothing more than these recipes plus the dishes which can be built from them, it would be a great book of recipes, but not quite the `IACP Cookbook of the Year' winner from the Julia Child Cookbook Awards. Each recipe is presented with a variety of different methods, mostly based on alternatives between using the Mocajete (volcanic stone mortar), using the food processor, or using the blender. I give enormous credit to Bayless for not encouraging us to immediately going out and ordering ourselves a Mocajete since they are both rather expensive and (authentic versions are) difficult to find. While I am something of an atavistic cook, I may have been inclined to search one out anyway, but Bayless confession that the modern appliances are quite satisfactory in most applications leaves me satisfied with the equipment I already have.<br /><br />In addition to the richly detailed and annotated recipes, there are terrific sidebars on ingredients and methods. This is the first place I have read that there is an important difference in taste between the yellow and the white onion, and that the white onion is preferred for Mexican dishes, unless otherwise specified. Senor Bayless also makes it clear that the Habanero and the Scotch Bonnet are two different plants, and identifies those features that distinguish one from the other. Note that the level of heat is NOT one of the things that separate the two fruits.<br /><br />The remainder of the recipes fall into all the usual categories, with a few Mexican specialities. These are:<br /><br />Salads and Other Starters<br /><br />Light and Hearty Soups<br /><br />Tacos, Enchiladas, and other Casual Fare<br /><br />Vegetable, Bean, Rice, and Egg Dishes<br /><br />Classic Fiesta Food<br /><br />Main Dishes<br /><br />Desserts<br /><br />Wine and Margaritas<br /><br />As egg dishes are one of my favorite criteria for judging a cookbook, I looked at these more carefully than the others and found more than just your usual omelets, scrambles, and fried eggs with Mexican sauces and Fritos. Mr. Bayless' version of Huevos a la Oaxaquena gives us an egg cooking method which I have not seen in any French cookbook, although the result is not too different from scrambled eggs cooked hard rather than the French preferred moist result.<br /><br />One section that caught my eye was the recipes for moles (in Classic Fiesta Food). The first two recipes required 28 and 27 different ingredients respectively and the procedures for both took three pages of text. Fortunately, aside from the stock, none of the ingredients required a lot of additional preparation, but, I can easily see why moles are relegated to recipes for special occasions.<br /><br />I wish I could say that Mr. Bayless' books, especially this award winning volume, were the best sources for Mexican recipes, but he has strong competition from Ms. Diana Kennedy. I have reviewed several of her books, and I suspect that if you simply want good Mexican recipes, Ms. Kennedy may have the edge, but go with Mr. Bayless if you have an interest in what it is that makes the Mexican cuisine tick.<br /><br />You may have noticed Mr. Bayless little trade paperback on Salsas, which have a strong resemblance to some of the material in this book. Some reviewers believe the salsa book is lifted from this volume. This is not true. The approach is the same in both books, but the names of the salsa recipes in the two books do not exactly coincide. And, the salsa book has the added feature of giving the same recipe in several different sizes, which is simply great for entertaining and a real Mexican food junkie.<br /><br />This may be the best of Mr. Bayless books to get first.

Fisher	Books	4	23	29	N	N	A Very Good Biography of a most important culinary writer	`Poet of the Appetites, The Lives and Loves of M.F.K. Fisher' by Joan Reardon is, obviously, a biography of America's greatest culinary essayist. It is important to distinguish Ms. Fisher's subject from her great contemporaries, Julia Child and James Beard, who wrote about food and cooking. The point of the title of this book is that Ms. Fisher wrote about eating and the enjoyment of eating.<br /><br />Ms. Reardon is eminently qualified to do the biography of Ms. Fisher, as she was a friend and associate of Ms. Fisher for several years and a commentator on her works in earlier writings. Her main problem was that the eminent writing stylist, Ms. Fisher wrote so many memoirs on various parts of her own life that it may have been hard to compete with her subject.<br /><br />In Ms. Reardon's favor is the fact that Ms. Fisher had a tendency to `play fast and loose with her renditions of events' (quote from Ms. Reardon's introduction). This means that while Ms. Fisher's description of, for example, her early 1930s life with her first husband in Dijon in `Long Ago in France: The Years in Dijon' may be more interesting to read than Ms. Reardon's account of the same period, Joan Reardon is more likely to be giving us the unvarnished story.<br /><br />Part of my problem in reading this biography may have been the fact that I knew relatively little of Ms. Fisher's life. Unlike my reading the biographies of Julia Child and James Beard, I had no sense of anticipation to discover how, for example, Julia Child acquired her passion for French cooking.<br /><br />My exposure up to this point had been a brief essay by James Villas on an encounter with Ms. Fisher late in her career. And, many of her most famous pieces were published by the early 1950's, when the biggest events in her life were her private problems with husband number two and her daughters. When I reached this point in her life, the reading becomes much more labored.<br /><br />Ms. Reardon's narrative is, I am convinced, extremely accurate, albeit not very engaging. It is obvious from financial difficulties why Ms. Fisher wished to disengage from her second husband Donald Friede, but I simply get no strong sense of why she fell out of love with her first husband, Al Fisher, aside from her interest in Dillwyn Parrish.<br /><br />As I write this, I get the sense that maybe I wanted too much, but I will go with my visceral reaction and say that Ms. Reardon's straight talk may not get behind the events quite as well as I may hope.<br /><br />The problem may also be in the fact that where Child and Beard had such public, active lives, Fisher's life was quite private.<br /><br />The very best thing about this book is that it gives you a new perspective on Fisher's own writings and add to their value. The book may or may not encourage you to read Fisher's works, in spite of John Thorne's enthusiastic recommendation on the back cover.<br /><br />My final take on this book is the fact that I have read other culinary biographies with more interest than I got from this book, but I still consider this an excellent biography of a very important American writer.m convinced, extremely accurate, albeit not very engaging.

175996:US	39134375	R30A0CWK6RFKME	0226494071	219005878	Fashionable Food: Seven Decades of Food Fads	Books	5	18	21	N	Y	Excellent Social History of American Recipes	`Fashionable Food, Seven Decades of Food Fads' by culinary historian and food writer, Sylvia Lovegren is a great addition to the social history of American culinary folkways, especially with its concentration on actual, tested recipes from each of the seven subject decades from the 1920s to the 1980s. It is an interesting contrast in approach to `Something from the Oven' by Laura Shapiro that deals more with narrative and less with recipes. The ideal book would have been a combination of the two techniques.<br /><br />The most important thing to remember is that Ms. Lovegren is talking about things that were `fashionable', not with the demographics of food habits. As Ms. Shapiro points out in her book, the advent of the convenience foods after World War II did not permeate American cooking. They, along with their most vocal proponent, Poppy Cannon, got a lot of attention, but were always viewed as shortcuts and not necessarily a tectonic shift in American cooking habits.<br /><br />Reading a version of this book revised and republished in 2005 makes me wonder why the author did not update the material in this book to cover the last 15 years, where the playing out of so many trends, and the origin of so many new ones would have added so much interesting material to the book. The advent of the Food Network alone may have warranted a chapter. In all, the coverage of food journalism, especially TV food journalism is just a little thin. Dione Lucas and Jeff Smith (the Frugal Gourmet) are mentioned briefly and Julia Child is given her due for her truly incredible influence on American eating, but there is no mention of, for example Martin Yan, the Galloping Gourmet, and local TV cooking shows. While I take the book at its word since my interest in culinary writing is no more than three years old, I get the sense that virtually everything the author says about the 1980s is still true today. There is little that was popular in 1985 that is not a hot item on today's cooking shows or in today's cookbooks.<br /><br />On the other hand, I applaud the attention the author gives to M.F.K. Fisher's statements and writings. Ms. Fisher is too easily forgotten in the towering shadow of Julia Child and the leading current distaff celebs, Alice Waters and Deborah Madison. That doesn't mean Ms. Waters and Ms. Madison are not given their due. I especially like the fact that Ms. Lovegren has not taken sides on the issue of who originated the `California Cuisine'. The primary contenders are Alice Waters and Jeremiah Tower, Chez Panisse and Waters' first major chef who helped set the course for Chez Panisse along the lines laid out by Richard Olney's writings on `simple French food'.<br /><br />Like all good social and cultural history, the book does its share of explaining interesting facts, such as why the Chinese ended up in so many tailor, laundry, and cooking jobs. It was, according to Ms. Lovegren, simply because these were women's occupations and therefore virtually the only ones open to former Chinese railroad workers.<br /><br />In addition to the seven main chapters on the decades, there are two interludes, one covering early Chinese food and the other covering other oriental foods in America. Here again, we seem to miss any coverage of the increase of popularity in Thai and Vietnamese food. The focus on the `other oriental foods' highlights `Trader Vic' restaurants and their founder, Victor Bergeron.<br /><br />The thing I like the best about this book is that it does not equate `fads' with `poor quality'. In fact, several `fads' later in the author's decades are the `foodie' movement toward more interesting food, the health food agenda which improved the quality of its regimen over the decades, and the still growing interest in locally grown foods. This is why it is so important for the book to include good working recipes.<br /><br />The absence of a lot of analysis ties into another weakness with this book in that so many food trends didnot recognize decade boundaries. Conventional wisdom, for example, commonly defines `the sixties' as being roughly between the assassination of President Kennedy / Arrival of the Beatles and the resignation of President Nixon closing out the Watergate scandal. I think it would have been more interesting and more accurate to follow individual food trends through the years rather than to chop up the trends into arbitrary decades.<br /><br />I am struck, for example, by the fact that three major food trends important today had their origins in the sixties. The first and most obvious is the foodie movement with Julia Child as its fountainhead. The second is the health foods / organic food movement spearheaded by Adele Davis' writings plus the great influence of Rachel Carson's `Silent Spring'. I will go out on a limb here and say that the third major movement is in the influence of regional / cultural cuisines growing out of the `soul food' movement. As the author so accurately points out, people have been eating collards, okra, and black eyed peas for centuries, but it took the civil rights / black pride movement to make an icon of this aspect of black culture.<br /><br />As befitting a book published by the University of Chicago press, this book has good scholarly accouterments, including careful references to the sources of all recipes plus proper cautions on recipes which were not tested by the author or her colleagues. I must give the copy editor a slap on the hand for missing the misspelling Jeremiah Tower's first name in the Preface, especially since Monsieur Tower's name is properly spelled later in the book.<br /><br />This is an excellent, highly enjoyable book to read and an interesting source of `historical' recipes. It would be great to see it brought up to date.not recognize decade boundaries.

It is instructive to point out that as important as these books are, they are not on the same level as, for example, Isaac Newton's `Principia Mathematica' or Charles Darwin's `The Origin of Species'. That is, these are great teaching manuals whose primary achievement is in their ability to communicate their subject with their audience.<br /><br />It is also important to distinguish the subject of these books from what is loosely called Software Engineering. The greatest classic of Software Engineering is Fred Brooks' `The Mythical Man-Month', which deals with big issues of software design and allocation of human resources to software projects. Knuth's books deal with algorithms. While Brooks' software engineering is similar to architecture, Knuth is dealing with a subject similar to the subset of civil engineering which deals with the loadbearing capacities of structural materials and shapes.<br /><br />In my very first course on computer programming, my instructor said that programming had relatively little to do with mathematics (unless you happened to be programming mathematical calculations). The entire math you really needed to know was how to add one to a number. What he neglected to say was that computer programming has a whole lot to do with the related subject of symbolic logic which, by dumb luck, as I happened to be starting in a major in Philosophy, I was quite conversant.<br /><br />So, Knuth is teaching us about algorithms which are logically based procedures, almost always involving repetition of the same action, and which can be formalized in languages which can then be fed into a computer to perform a function.<br /><br />In the three volumes of the projected seven that Knuth actually completed, one volume deals with `Seminumerical Algorithms'. What that means is that his mathematical subjects are generally not the ones useful to you and me in daily life or even to a statistician, actuary, or engineer. They are typically tools used by mathematicians from which they can construct the tools used by statisticians, actuaries, and engineers, and you and me. It is highly topical to realize that one of the most important applications of Knuth's algorithms in his second volume are essential to cryptanalysis and the construction of codes. Chapter 3 on computation involving random numbers is an especially important tool of code construction and code breaking. Chapter Four, dealing with some of the basic algorithms of arithmetic is also relevant to the study of codes as it includes algorithms involving primes.<br /><br />In detailing what this book does not cover, I have gotten a bit off track in dealing with Volume 2 before talking about Volume 1 and the medium in which Knuth presents his ideas. As this series was started in the mid-1960s, the number of commonly known third generation languages could be counted on one hand. In the business world there was COBOL, in the scientific world there was a rudimentary version of FORTRAN, and in the schools, there was Basic. In my first computer programming course, we learned three languages, one of which was literally a machine language punched onto paper tape, one was a second generation language on a pre-IBM 360 mainframe, and one of which was a 2 ½ generation language invented at my school, Lehigh University, called Wiz. It was a distant dialect of FORTRAN and it was strictly constructed as an educational tool. You may recall that the languages Basic, Pascal, and Modula 2 were also designed as training languages which simply busted out of their original use, in spite of serious limitations in language design.<br /><br />All this is said in order to support the notion that in 1967, Knuth's inventing an assembly language (2nd generation) to teach algorithms was quite an accepted notion. So, this is what he did, and gave us the MIX language, named after the Roman numeral for 1009, which is the sum of the model numbers of sixteen different computers of the day which are similar to MIX and on which the MIX language can be simulated.<br /><br />This was a time before the invention of C and UNIX when virtually all operating system software was written in assembly language.

Buy It!	`Italian Cuisine (2nd Edition)' by Restaurateur, Tony May ranks as one of the best books on the general subject of Italian cuisine as a whole.<br /><br />Good books on Italian cooking come in all different flavors. There are the great recipe collections such as Michele Scicolone's `1000 Italian Recipes' and Mario Batali's `Molto Italiano'. There are the studies of regional cuisines such as Lydia Bastianich's book on Istrian cuisine, `La Cucina di Lydia' and Lynne Rosetto Casper's excellent study of Emilia-Romagna, `The Splendid Table'. There are the surveys of all Italian regions, as in the classic Claudia Roden book, `The Food of Italy' and a book of the same name by Waverley Root, not to mention the classic by Elizabeth David. There are analytic books on Italian ingredients such as Erica De Mane's `The Flavors of Southern Italy'. There are treatises on styles of Italian cooking such as Susan Hermann Loomis' `Italian Farmhouse Cooking', Patricia Wells' `Trattoria', and Joyce Goldstein's `Enoteca'. There are books of Italian vegetable cooking such as the excellent volumes by Jack Bishop and Faith Willinger. There are dictionaries, such as Antonio Carluccio's `Complete Italian Food' and Anna Del Conte's `the Concise Gastronomy of Italy'. And, let us not forget the Italian-American books such as John Mariani's `The Italian-American Cookbook'. Not to be excluded are culinary memoirs, such as Vincent Schiavelli's `Many Beautiful Things' and other volumes on Sicilian cooking.<br /><br />This litany of book subjects and titles is simply to distinguish Mr. May's book from all these others. His volume is neither complete nor regional nor personal nor vegetarian nor encyclopedic nor American nor analytical. Its primary focus is on classic recipes and cooking methods. It is very important to note very early in the book the statement that this book was written for culinary professionals. Thus, although it is packed with interesting tips and techniques, the presentation of the methods do assume you know your way around a kitchen. For example, unlike excellent illustrated instructions on pasta making in books by Lydia Bastianich and Marcella Hazan; the techniques presented here are all done without `visual aids'. This is entirely fair, as the book has declared itself a manual for professionals who already know the basics of mixing dough.<br /><br />While the book does not make the mistake of saying it is `complete'; it does describe itself as an `essential reference to the riches of the Italian table'. I am convinced that no book on a subject so rich as Italian cuisine can cover everything. Therefore, the best books limit their focus to a particular part of the beast and one hopes they don't make any mistakes.<br /><br />While I still feel this is an excellent book for serious foodies, I did find several statements that seemed mistaken to me. One was the translation of `antipasto' as `before the meal' rather than `before the pasta course', another was the classification of pine nuts and pistachio nuts as herbs, and another was some misspellings of some really rudimentary words. The most serious mistake may have been his misuse of the term soffrito at least one place (My authority is Marcella Hazan's recent book, `Marcella Says...'. While these mistakes are distracting, none of them lead me to believe that the author's statements about cooking techniques are untrustworthy.<br /><br />My most satisfying discovery in this book, after reading dozens of books on Italian cooking, is new suggestions on how to make some really basic Italian dishes. My favorite discovery was the recommendation to use an especially wide pan in relation to the number of eggs in a frittata, with the warning that if the frittata is too thick, it will take to long to cook and the center will be too heavy. And, while this is not a book on Italian culinary history, Mr. May does make several interesting and, to my knowledge, correct comments on the history of some major Italian dishes such as when he traces dried pasta to a source much older than the Marco Polo fairy tale about bringing spaghetti back from China. Another interesting comment was to cite a similarity between the origins of paella and risotto, tied together primarily by the use of saffron.<br /><br />I personally find the book exceptionally well organized for it's purpose, as each chapter is devoted to a basic ingredient, technique, or result. The chapters cover bread, condiments, herbs, spices, antipasto, sauces, cured meats, marinades, flatbreads, savory pies and molds, fried foods, eggs, vegetables and salads, legumes, mushrooms and truffles, soups and broths, pasta and polenta, rice, fish, meat, poultry and game, cheese and desserts. My most interesting discovery here is the general classification of `molds'. While almost everyone has probably seen a timbale either in the movie `First Night' or on an episode of `Mario Eats Italy', no previous discussion of this very elaborate dish lets on to the fact that there is a whole family of Italian dishes based on forming the food in molds.<br /><br />The most useful quality of this book is that it is an excellent source for most of the most common Italian dishes. Some classics may be missing (I couldn't think of any which were not here), but most, such as saltimbocca alla romana, spaghetti alla puttanesca, pizza Margherita, fettuccine alla carbonara, and carciofi alla Romana are all here.<br /><br />The bibliography is short, but it is composed almost entirely of original, Italian language sources. There are both English and Italian language indexes, which I welcome, but I find a joint index as you will find in books by Marcella Hazan to be better for the English speaker whose culinary Italian is not up to snuff.<br /><br />This may not be the best book if you simply want a bunch of good Italian recipes, but if you want a sound grounding in Italian cooking techniques, this book must be in your library!e major Italian dishes such as when he traces dried pasta to a source much older than the Marco Polo fairy tale about bringing spaghetti back from China.

183913:US	39134375	RP8OA20CZD04B	1904920101	352192797	The Food of Spain and Portugal: A Regional Celebration	Books	4	17	18	N	Y	Very Attractive book for Collectors. Not necessarily for foodies	`the food of spain & portugal' by Elisabeth Luard is subtitled `a regional celebration' which is actually more appropriate than calling it a `cookbook' or a `book of recipes'. This does not mean it contains no recipes. It contains quite a few, which are generally very good, but the primary objective of the book is to decorate a tabletop with a survey of the foods of the various regions of the Iberian Peninsula.<br /><br />For American culinary book buyers, one may be hard pressed to justify the purchase of this book as we already have two major and four minor excellent books on the food and wine of Spain from Penelope Casas. One of these, `Delicioso!' covers Spanish dishes by region, and her first book, `The Food and Wines of Spain' covers the Spanish wine scene about as well as you can possibly want. Ms. Luard spends no time on wines except an occasional mention, especially of port and sherry.<br /><br />For Portugal, there is the award winning volume, `The Food of Portugal' from leading cookbook author, Jean Anderson. Ms. Anderson makes the point in her book that there are major differences between the culinary practices of Portugal and Spain. So why do a book covering the two culinary traditions simply because they happen to be neighbors on the same peninsula. This is like doing a small book on the cuisines of (Jewish) Israel and (Christian) Lebanon because they are neighbors on the Levant, disregarding the fact that their cuisines are by necessity different due to religious background.<br /><br />There are several things which are good about this book, contributing to its winning a `Best Foreign Cookery Book -UK' award from Gourmand World. The first is that in spite of its oversized pages and excellent photography and illustrations, the book lists at $29.95. This book follows my experience that the Europeans are so much better at doing pictures in books than we are on this side of the pond. The photography is gorgeous; the selected scenes are largely decorative, but quite appropriate and generally interesting in their own right. The selection of paintings and drawings is outstanding. And, every illustration has a meaningful caption. Even the double page pictures introducing a new chapter have on overleafed caption.<br /><br />Spain and Portugal are treated in two different sections, and each country's recipes are presented by region. The number of recipes for Spain falls far short of the count in Ms. Casas' regional cuisines book. Ms. Casas, for example gives 43 recipes for Madrid and La Mancha while Ms. Luard gives only 22. The difference is more dramatic for the recipes from the Canary Islands where Ms. Casas gives us 20 to Ms. Luard's 5. Ms. Luard makes up for this a bit by slicing Spain into a few more regions (12) than Ms. Casas' nine (9). Ms. Luard gives us Andalusia; The Levante; The Balearics; Catalonia; The Basque Country; Galicia, Asturias, & Cantabria; Nararra & La Rioja; Aragon; Castile & Leon; La Mancha & Madrid; Extremadura; and The Canary Islands. In Portugal, Ms. Luard divides things up into Oporto & the Douro; Entre Douro e Minho; Tras-os-Montes & Alto Douro; Ribatejo; The Mountain Beiras & Beira Litoral; Estremadura & Lisbon; Alentejo; Algarve; Madeira & the Azores.<br /><br />I give extra credit for the author's covering all the major Atlantic and Mediterranean islands belonging to Spain and Portugal, although I give Ms. Casas even more credit for distinguishing what it is about the cuisine of the Canary Islands which sets it off from the rest of Spain.<br /><br />On recipe selection, I believe Ms. Luard has included all the important ones from both countries. She has even taken the trouble to give a recipe for a naturally yeasted sourdough bread recipe from Castile. On the other hand, there is no attempt to give a comprehensive coverage of any one kind of dish. Every major type of dish gets one exemplar and we are done.<br /><br />When I read Ms. Luard's introduction, I dispaired when she said her measurements would not be exact. It turns out her instructions are about as complete as you will find in any decently written cookbook done by a non-specialist. All measurements are done by count, by cup, teaspoon, or tablespoon. There are cases, for wine, for example, where the `glass' gives the measurement. I take this to mean the amount is at the discretion of the cook.<br /><br />For people who may be making a trip to both Spain and Portugal in the near future, this is a very useful book. It is also very nice for people who like to collect attractive cookbooks. It is clearly inferior to the collected works of Ms. Casas and Ms. Anderson in getting a really good picture of Iberian cuisines. The biggest missed opportunity in a book on this subject would was a good description of exactly what the difference is between Spanish and Portuguese cuisines. The only hint I could gather is the difference in former colonies, with Portugal being heavily influenced by Brazil and the spice trade with the east and it's former enclaves in India and Indonesia.<br /><br />This is an attractive book with sound culinary content, but it does less than less pretty books on the same subjects. And, the author does not take advantage of her dealing with the two different cuisines in a single book.said her measurements would not be exact.

And, I can say with more certainty than most other similar comparisons I have made that this is the best of the lot.<br /><br />I am not inclined to like slow cooking recipes but I am satisfied that they have an important place in a well-furnished culinary repertoire. I took to the method when I wanted a good pulled pork recipe without having to invest in a grill or smoker or any other type of outdoor contraption involving fire and smoke.<br /><br />It turns out that this book has an excellent recipe for a pulled pork barbecue recipe which should be able to hold its head high, at least outside the borders of North Carolina, where pulled pork barbecue takes on religious significance.<br /><br />Some slow cooker recipe books remind me of recipes in Church fundraising books. They have a small list of ingredients and the barest minimum of instructions on how to put the dish together. The premium on such books is in the number of recipes rather than the detail in the instructions. This is not necessarily a bad thing when we are dealing with a single method of cooking, especially one where the primary selling point is its simplicity. But, if you are a beginner you may want something better.<br /><br />Other slow cooker recipe books, especially the type from `Better Homes and Gardens' and `Betty Crocker' are better, but aside from the glossy pics, there is little to warm the hearts of a cookbook connoisseur's heart.<br /><br />Ms. Finlayson has covered all her bases. She opens with a headnote for each recipe that gives lots of background information on the origins and best uses of the recipe. She also has frequent make-ahead suggestions, especially for those who wish to turn on the slow cooker on the way to work. Finally, her ingredient lists are a real marvel, especially as they give both English and metric units for virtually every ingredient. This may not seem like much unless you have an especially good gadget for measuring small amounts where the tics for milliliters is much more finely divided than the teaspoons and tablespoons. Most people will be especially happy with her exceptionally good prep instructions for all her ingredients.<br /><br />For those who have never done slow cooking but who are expert braisers, I suggest you get this book even if you have your full complement of braising recipes. You will do better to transpose a familiar braising recipe if you have seen and done a few recipes designed for the slow cooker.<br /><br />Highly recommended.h and metric units for virtually every ingredient.

It is immensely appropriate that I review `Little Wars' by H. G. Wells on the day Stephen Spielberg's remake of a film version of Wells' `War of the Worlds' opens in theatres around the country. I have known of Wells' little book for at least 45 years, when I first became interested in wargames and searched out titles on the subject which, in 1960, seemed to be few and far between.<br /><br />The early sixtys were the heydey of Avalon-Hill's tabletop sized board games with little cardboard counters representing everything from a single sargeant to an army corp. These games grew out of the minatures rules which would later contribute, along with the popularity of  the `Lord of the Rings' novel to the creation of `Dungeons and Dragons' roleplaying games. Both Avalon-Hill styled and Dungeon and Dragons styled boardgames have been partially superceded by computerized versions of these simulations and, while I still fondly fondle my chit representing the 82nd airborne division as it participates in the Normandy invasion, I get much more satisfaction out of a good computerized version of the same campaign.<br /><br />And yet, Wells' simplified minatures rules with no more than a few dozen pieces per side and firing success being determined by real live aiming, physics of ballistics, and the effect of wind deliver the same kind of charm evoked by that old Robert Lewis Stevenson poem of the young boy with his toy soldiers navigating the hills formed by his blankets lying over his outstretched legs.<br /><br />I am not intimately familiar with minatures rules, but what I do know tells me that they are quite complicated with lots of tables based on the role of dice. Wells' rules are much simpler. And, he is not deeply involved in realistic landscapes which are so interesting to minatures hobbyists. Not a word is said here about cleaning and painting raw lead or tin soldiers. All our troops here are fully clothed straight out of the box. All the landscapes are created by nothing more complicated than the kind of plain wooden building blocks I so coveted when I was a kid. These are embellished with the outsides of houses painted or drawn on the plain side of wallpaper which is then folded and glued around the blocks. There is not interest with any ability to hide inside any of these houses, as this would simply slow things down and make the rules more complicated. The only other concern is that if rivers are part of the landscape that there are enough fording and bridged points to not funnel things too much into a single choke point.<br /><br />The rules only deal with three kinds of troops, infantry, cavalry, and artillery. As this book was written in 1913, and Europe had largely been at peace for almost a hundred years since the defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo, it is not surprising that the strategies evolving from these three types of troops are strongly similar to Napoleonic battles. As this was the period of muskets, long range infantry fire was remarkably ineffective compared to the destruction caused by Napoleonic era artillery. To a person versed in 20th century wars, it is strange to see the lineup of forces at, for example, the Battle of Waterloo, where the guns were in front of the main lines of infantry rather than far to the rear. This was before the age of indirect artillery fire, which just began in the American Civil War and it's great mortars.<br /><br />So, the only way our small forces can inflict damage at a distance is by little cannons which fire real live wooden projectiles and, a soldier is killed only if you actually succeed in knocking the little fellow down with the wooden pellet.<br /><br />A similar combat simulation which existed in parallel with Wells' and other minatures' rules is the kind of wargame simulations invented by the German General Staff with the very German name of `Kriegspiel' or War Play. An expert in English Kriegspiel practice compares this professional exercize with Wells' game and finds thelatter far more fun, as the Sandhurst (English Army Military Acadamy) version is weighed down with rulings from referees and the kind of tables of outcomes so familiar to modern manual wargame rules.<br /><br />Remembering that this book was written in 1912-1913, it is chilling to read Wells' final assessment of the lack of proficiency of professional military men at this little game. The most chillingly Strangelovean statement is that `You have only to play at Little Wars three or four times to realize what a blundering thing Great War must be'. This was written in 1913!!!<br /><br />One may be discouraged from reading this book by the prospect of reading 120 pages of game rules. This is not what this book is about. All the details of the rules are compressed into the last six pages. Everything which goes before is the stuff which is written to bring out the little boy in us all. And, the author knows nothing of politically correct gender washing, as he is firmly committed to the idea that this is an activity for little boys, and maybe girls who think like little boys.<br /><br />A minor classic worthy of it's famous author.nd finds the latter far more fun, as the Sandhurst (English Army Military Acadamy) version is weighed down with rulings from referees and the kind of tables of outcomes so familiar to modern manual wargame rules. <br /> <br />Remembering that this book was written in 1912-1913, it is chilling to read Wells' final assessment of the lack of proficiency of professional military men at this little game.

Buy It!	`The New Complete Walker' is one of those books which as probably never been outdone and probably never will be. It is easily in the same class, in my mind, as Julia Child's `Mastering the Art of French Cooking', Donald Knuth's `The Art of Programming', and Snedecor and Cochrane's `Statistical Methods'. When this book was first published, it's author was a fairly notable celebrity, interesting enough to appear as a subject on `To Tell the Truth', but not quite recognizable enough to be unfamiliar to the contestant on that show. I still recall the book's being touted on several outlets.<br /><br />It should be of little surprise that obesity is such a problem since such a great book on the simplest and most accessible kinds of exercize has fallen into some obscurity.<br /><br />The very best thing about the book is that it is not written by a professional writer but by a professional walker. At the risk of alienating some potential readers, let me say that it may be just a bit more appropriate to say that this book is more about hiking with a backpack than it is about walking a mile or so to the local farmer's market and walking back with five pounds of groceries.<br /><br />The one thing which most impressed me about Fletcher's suggestions was that he holds back on absolutely nothing. When you are living for more than a day on what you carry on your back, lots of things you may not think of suddenly become very important. One example which impressed me was the suggestion to trim the white edges off the margins of the maps you carry.<br /><br />One thing which makes this book so much easier than it was when I first read it is that the equipment it suggests is so much more readily available today than it was 35 years ago. At that time, I had to travel for hours to reach a good camping store. Now, Eastern Mountain Sports is in my local mall and the Internet has everything I can't find locally.<br /><br />The very best thing about this book may be the fact that it makes you want to get yourself a pack and get out on the trail for an overnight hike. I'm not sure what the good Mr. Fletcher would say about toting your cellular phones, pagers, blackberries, and portable computers along, not to mention the gameboys. I'll let him speak to the pleasures of emulating hobbits on the open road at night.t it makes you want to get yourself a pack and get out on the trail for an overnight hike.

Better than the First Book	`Fresh Every Day, More Great Recipes from Foster's Market' is Sara Foster's second book in about three years, with a new co-author, Carolynn Carreno, a co-author of the very good New York City bistro / bakery book, `Once Upon a Tart'. Whether it is from the change in collaborator or some other reason, Ms. Foster has succeeded in giving us a book which is not only better than her first, but it is better than books from her nearest competitors, Paula Deen and fellow Martha Stewart alum, Ina Garten. While Deen gives us very good renditions of classic Southern dishes, Ms. Foster and her allies have done a `fusion Southern' cuisine which has all the charm of the original models with maybe just a little less fat and a little more flavor. Compared to fellow caterer, Ms. Garten of Long Island, Ms. Foster gives us much more bang for our $35. I have always thought Ms. Garten's books are just a tad overpriced for their content. Sara Foster has delivered a lot more content, and more interesting content, for the same price.<br /><br />While it took a fair amount of careful reading before I gave Sara's first book my five stars, my visceral pleasure with this book kicked in almost immediately, which is a sure sign that this is a quality cookbook. Very good and very bad books usually show their colors in the first few pages. When you have to look for the good stuff, it is surely an average book.<br /><br />The book has just a slightly different focus than the first book, in that it covers a lot of things Ms. Foster cooks at home for her family and dishes she demonstrates when she is doing book tours and cooking classes.<br /><br />For starters, I always give high marks to books with good breakfast recipes. For every decent book on breakfast dishes, there are fifty or more on desserts, so, we are always in need of more and better breakfast dishes. None of the recipes are really unusual, but that isn't what you want from a rural milieu caterer. You can get the fancy breakfasts from The Plaza and the Hiltons. The scrambled egg recipe(s) are a fine sample of what Ms. Foster and company do so well in this book. She gives the basic technique that is effective, but simple. No James Beard water bath cooking for 40 minutes here. Then, she gives us six different variations plus the courage to throw in most different kinds of odds and ends leftovers from the fridge.<br /><br />I thought the following page with breakfast tortilla recipes goes a long way to showing how far Mexican cuisine has influenced our cooking in that Ms. Foster uses the terms chipotle, burrito, quesadilla, and enchilada with no explanation of what they mean and really assumes the reader will have no problems following an instruction to `fold it like a burrito'. Later in this chapter, chipotle finds its way into several different recipes. The chapter also covers such essential subjects as grits, smoothies, biscuits, muffins, and granola.<br /><br />The next chapter is `Simple Soups' which opens with a sidebar on soup making which has almost as many spiffy soup suggestions as several soup books I have reviewed. Like the breakfast dishes, most soups are pretty standard and pretty hearty, with a heavy emphasis on roasted ingredients and pureed preparations. There are some interesting surprises such as the golden gazpacho soup, but the big value is in teaching us to use soup toppings and garnishes.<br /><br />The third chapter is on `seasonal salads and salad meals'. The content which impressed me most was the number of different vinaigrette recipes, including summer herb, sweet basil, balsamic, blue cheese, tarragon, sweet and spicy, sesame ginger, red wine with chives, tangy Italian, black olive, and pad thai vinaigrettes. And that just the vinaigrettes!<br /><br />The fourth chapter is `seasonal sides' with lots of stuff on using fruits and root vegetables. The most interesting section is the general suggestion plus several recipes on mashing vegetables OTHER than potatoes. This notion, plus the variations on doing corn on the cob are worth the price of the chapter.<br /><br />The fifth chapter is `quick and tasty meat main dishes' which throws lots of Southern, Italian, Greek, and Mexican ideas into a pot and comes up with great nouveau Carolina cuisine. The featured sidebar is on grilling. The best `extras' are recipes for `fridge pickles and pan seared duck breasts.<br /><br />The sixth chapter is `fast and fresh fish, pasta, and risotto meals'. This chapter is heavy on the shrimp and scallops plus halibut, snapper, sea bass, and lots of condiments such as lemon chive oil, Cajun aioli, and green goddess dressing. The sidebar on fish cookery is excellent.<br /><br />The seventh chapter is `meals that cook themselves' which, of course, is not literally true. It is a collection of recipes that cook for a long time with little or no fuss or attention. Lots of classics appear here, many with the addition of Sara's favorite ingredient, chipotle.<br /><br />The last chapter is `a little something sweet' which tend to be quick assemblies rather than elaborate cakes and pies, although there is a pretty standard recipe for a piecrust and a blueberry pie. The recipe uses all vegetable shortening, and I am partial to pastry crusts done with butter. I don't thing Sara will mind if you use a classic French pate brisee in place of `Judy's Flaky PieCrust. Her sidebar on making piecrusts may not have every little detail, but it's very good if this is the only book you have.<br /><br />Ms. Foster's pair of books is the perfect example for those of you who don't want a lot of cookbooks, but you want interesting recipes. Getting these two books will give you great value with no risk of recipe overlap. I certainly recommend these over books from Ms. Deen and Ms. Garten, although both of these ladies have done some very nice volumes.<br /><br />Highly recommended!es.

Not the best Salmon book	`Salmon, A Cookbook by Diane Morgan' with a Foreword by distinguished culinary teacher and author, John Ash is a very nice little book, being one of my favorite types of cookbooks devoted to a single, interesting subject. Two things make one wonder why, aside from a strong interest in the subject, did the author and publisher take the time and energy to create this book.<br /><br />The first and foremost reason is that there is already a less expensive book on the market on exactly the same subject by very highly regarded culinary writer and teacher, James Peterson. I will concede that there is more than enough room for both books if there is little overlap between the two. I will investigate this in a bit.<br /><br />The second reason is that several things early in the book seem to be done in a less than totally thoughtful manner. The book opens with great anecdotes about travels around the world to major salmon fishing and farming venues, but aside from the mildly titillating travelogue value, it is hard to see how any of this has contributed to the value of the book. These tales are accompanied by smallish, unlabelled snapshots done by the author. Some of the pictures could have been taken in Alaska, Oregon, Scotland, or Norway. The oversights include no labels on very nice pics of whole and filleted salmon, plus long, careful descriptions with scientific names and everything on the various salmon species, but NO PICTURES! Then, we get a text for how to clean and gut a salmon, with NO PICTURES! When the book gets to descriptions on how to scale, de-gill, and fillet, there are some smallish line drawings which are better than nothing. In all fairness, I will concede that Peterson has few illustrations for these techniques as well, but Morgan does little to redress this omission. The very best illustrations for some of these techniques are in Peterson's book `Essentials of Cooking'.<br /><br />On the latest issues of salmon farming, wild fishing, and health, Ms. Morgan's book is a bit more up-to-date than is Peterson's, as his was published in 2001, before all the scoops on farmed fish contamination came out. Overall, on basics I believe the two authors tie, with a small edge to Ms. Morgan for giving us a technique for skin-drying salmon.<br /><br />Ms. Morgan's recipes are organized by course. The recipe chapters are:<br /><br />Appetizers - Ten recipes, including tartare, gravlax, grilled salmon sandwiches, and dips.<br /><br />Soups - Eight recipes with chowders, gazpacho, Thai Coconut, corn stews, and salmon stock.<br /><br />Pasta, Pizza, Risotto, and Sandwiches - Eleven recipes with tacos, burgers, and poorboys.<br /><br />Main-Course Salads - Ten recipes with lentils; spinach; fennel; asparagus; noodles; corn; rice; endive and bacon; and Salade Nicoise.<br /><br />Main Courses - Sixteen recipes for roasting, poaching broiling, grilling, and cedar planking.<br /><br />Brunch and Lunch - Nine recipes for salmon on bagels, blintzes, omelets, frittatas, tartlets, poached eggs, potpies, and quiche.<br /><br />I find this organization just a little confusing as there is so much overlap between categories as with the Appetizers and Brunch and Lunch chapters, yet unlike things are bundled together as with pasta and sandwiches. Wouldn't most sandwiches also be appropriate for lunch?<br /><br />In contrast, Peterson gives us recipes by cooking method, which I find much more satisfying, especially when you are unsure of the quality and variety of salmon you will find at your fishmonger's counter. Fish that may not be the very best for a raw recipe may be quite all right for poaching or broiling. One of the most important aspects of this difference is the fact that while Morgan gives us sixteen recipes for smoked salmon, Peterson actually tells us how to smoke salmon with both hot and cold smoking methods. Even Alton Brown hasn't gotten to that subject yet.<br /><br />Basically, Ms. Morgan gives us a very nice collection of Salmon recipes, but she neglects to cover several of the most basic salmon cooking techniques. For example, Peterson has a whole chapter on poaching salmon, including the method for poaching a whole fish. I Looked in Morgan's index and could not even find an entry for poaching. As I just saw a poaching recipe in `Main Dishes', I checked back to find the `Riesling-Poached Salmon' recipe. This is a fine method for a few fillets, but it may be wise to also have a recipe for those who are alcohol intolerant, especially as poaching is such a healthy method for cooking and such an easy one for large groups of people. Even if you don't have a whole fish-poaching pan, the whole court bouillon method is a good one to master for salmon and other fish.<br /><br />Ms. Morgan does also include very good wine recommendations for each dish. How can I not have some respect for a book that recommends Austrian gruner veltliner (fresh, green) wine to go with salmon tartare!<br /><br />All in all, Peterson's book does a much better job of covering the full range of salmon cookery, but Morgan's book may have just a few more recipes for everyday use. If price is no object, get both. If you want a text that touches all bases, get Peterson's book. If you just happen to like salmon, raw and cooked, get Morgan's book, plus Peterson's `Essentials of Cooking' for the full scoop on how to handle big salmon operations., but she neglects to cover several of the most basic salmon cooking techniques.

Kirk and J. E. Raven is, on a personal level, dear to me as it is the very first book I bought when I began studying philosophy as my major in college. This trade paperback cost but $3.95. For the philosophical amateurs who may have stumbled over this review while plowing through my cookbook reviews, the most dramatic aspect of this book is how little we actually have of what these great men who invented philosophy actually wrote. For the very first figure, Thales of Melitis (a town on the Asia Minor coast), we have practically nothing except second hand reports from Diogenes Laertius, Herodotus, Plutarch, and others. Also for amateurs is the great introductory essay on the difference between mythical cosmology and the beginnings of philosophy.<br /><br />If you happen to have a strong amateur interest in the history of ideas and can pick up an inexpensive early edition (I have one from 1962), I recommend you give this a look.<br /><br />For serious professionals, the most important aspect of this original text is the very scholarly presentation of the fragments in the original Greek with excellent translations and commentary on the sources.	2005-06-27

'Famous Science Fiction Stories' edited by Raymond J Healy and J Francis McComas was one of my very early hardcover book purchases. At the time, it was 'A Modern Library Giant' selling for $2.95 when this Random House series of inexpensive hardcover books was quite a bargain before the widespread publishing of trade and mass market paperbacks.<br /><br />I must have read this book from cover to cover at least five times and I probably have read some of the better stories several more times. Other reviews recount all the many accolades the book and its stories have received. I will concentrate on my personal impressions.<br /><br />I read this first when I would go through four or five similar collections of science fiction stories each summer from my local library. And yet, I would always come back to this volume as more satisfying than all the others.<br /><br />These are all written before the days of Harlan Ellison, Phillip K. Dick, and Gene Wolfe when things were just a little more literal than they have become when we have become hemmed in by the limits of the speed of light, the Godel uncertainty principle and the unknowability of quantum physics.<br /><br />I sense an urge to read these again and I envy you if you are coming to them for the first time.<br /><br />Very highly recommended!	2005-06-26

Buy it	`Parisian Home Cooking' by chef / restaurateur / culinary journalist, Michael Roberts is an early entry into what is becoming a very crowded field of cookbooks on French cooking at home, whether in Paris, Provence, or one of the many other culinary rich regions of France. The principle competitors in this market are lead by Patricia Wells, who has at least three (3) titles in this French home cooking sweepstakes. Susan Hermann Loomis also has three, if you include her culinary memoir `On Rue Tatin'. Her latest `Cooking at Home On Rue Tatin' is an especially good entry into this field. There are even several classics in this genre by Madeline Kamman and Richard Olney, but I have not yet read or reviewed them, so I mention them with no opinion on their quality. One of the most recent entries is from TV Food Network Celeb, Ina Garten, `Barefoot in Paris', which has much merit, but as much of that quality is due to her travelogue content as it is to her culinary content. To my mind, the very best entry into this genre is Amanda Hesser's `The Cook and the Gardner', which has so much more to offer it is probably best considered in a class by itself, but it does overlap the subjects of these other titles.<br /><br />Two prominent virtues of chef Robert's book are its low price and its simple recipes. The books by Wells, Loomis, and Garten also have simple recipes, which points out that all these books are really dealing with what has famously been classified as `cuisine provincial' and not `cuisine bourgeois' which is the subject of the great books by Julia Child, Elizabeth David, and Richard Olney' and certainly not `haute cuisine' which you will find in Wells' collaboration with Joel Robuchon. While most recipes are simple, Roberts has the virtue of having a few more recipes for money. Oddly, I don't see much greater depth in the description of the recipes based on the fact that Roberts is a trained chef and restaurateur.<br /><br />All these books have some overlap in recipes, but not as much overlap as you may see in similar books on Italian cuisine. In fact, Roberts gives several very interesting recipes for `potted' dishes, which seem to be a species of rustic pate. About half of his soups are based on very common themes of beans, leeks, potatoes, mushrooms, cream, and onions, but some are quite new to me, such as the sauerkraut and Brussels sprout soup from Alsace (bordering on Germany).<br /><br />The section on egg recipes is something of a surprise, as it completely eschews classic omelet recipes in favor of scrambled eggs. The only recipe with `omelet' in the name might be much more properly be called a frittata as it is done with six or more eggs, cooked on the stove top and finished in the oven, without folding. To make this turn even more interesting, the author says that French home cooks simply do not bother with the true omelet as taught to us by Elizabeth David, Julia Child, and a battalion of other notable culinary writers. Two things keep me from gigging the author on his opinion. One is David's dictum that an omelet is what you want to call it. The second is the fact that the author has lived, studied, and worked in Paris and I have not, at least not for several decades, so I take him at his word when he says the everyday at home egg dish in Paris is the scrambled egg, not the omelet. Even so, his description of the scrambled egg method, while very good, is not the very best I have seen. For that, look in `Simple to Spectacular' by Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten and journalist Mark Bittman. As someone who has struggled with scrambling two eggs, I strongly recommend Roberts' suggestion that scrambling should be done with no fewer than six eggs. On the other hand, I find the techniques here for soft boiled and coddled eggs to be too good to miss.<br /><br />Most of Roberts' salad recipes are pretty standard stuff except for his unusual suggestion on the use of verjus as a replacement for vinegar. What is so delicious about this notion is not that it is very new, but that it is so very old. Verjus is a common ingredient in most Medieval and Renaissance cookbooks and it probably went out of fashion when commercial vinegar production was well established.<br /><br />As with any good French cookbook, the vegetable recipes always seem to be the most interesting, especially the gratins and tarts.<br /><br />The seafood recipes are heavy with mussels, scallops, and salted cod with poaching, fennel, and pan-frying done in many different ways.<br /><br />The poultry recipes also include the usual collection of excellent chicken recipes, heavy on the methods for treating older birds and roasters. I was especially happy to see three different chicken casseroles. Turkey, duck, and rabbit also get their usual quota of recipes.<br /><br />In the chapter on red meats, there is the usual collection of veal, beef, lamb, and pork recipes, including a very nice take on preparing `minute steaks'. No treatment of our famous Philly cheese steak does as good a job of detailing the best way to coddle rather than to sautee the thin meat.<br /><br />The chapter on desserts follows the lead of the egg chapter, in that the average Parisian will simply not bother trying to compete with the local Patissier. So, most of the desserts are quite simple, more assemblies than fully baked cake or pastry. The author does, however, go to the trouble of giving us a lemon tart recipe, including a shortbread-like crust very similar to the Chez Panisse sweet tart crust.<br /><br />Speaking of Chez Panisse, I suspect Alice Waters and Jeremiah Tower would take issue with the author's bio that credits him with pioneering `California cuisine'.<br /><br />A very nice, inexpensive book of simple and authentic Parisian recipes.

191447:US	39134375	RZDUHNCKY0T5I	0684856948	52121947	Salsas That Cook : Using Classic Salsas To Enliven Our Favorite Dishes	Books	4	41	42	N	Y	An important essay on salsas. Very useful for entertaining	`Salsas that Cook' by renowned Chicagoan and Mexican cuisine expert, Rick Bayless is not your mama's ordinary salsa cookbook. If that is all you want, go to Mark Miller's very good `The Great Salsa Book' in the noisome Ten Speed Press tall and skinny format. Bayless' book is much more than that, and, in a sense, much less.<br /><br />Bayless' agenda is very much like Ming Tsai's programme in Tsai's book, `Simply Ming' in that Bayless gives us recipes for six (6) classic Mexican salsas and then shows us how to use each of these salsas as an ingredient in several other classic Mexican dishes. While Tsai's objective was to simplify cooking by making it modular by doing intermediate preparations in advance. Each intermediate can then be used in several different dishes. While Bayless' technique is very similar, his object is rather to make authentic Mexican dishes more accessible to the average American cook.<br /><br />Since this book was published in 1998, I suspect many of the Mexican ingredients Bayless says may be difficult to find have become much more common throughout the United States. In these brief seven years, I have seen a great growth of Latin American ingredients in even the most provincial of supermarkets. And, Bayless himself has contributed to this change with his own line of salsas under the `Frontera' trademark. In fact, this book may in some small way be considered a promotion for that product line, except that the book is so good in its own right that this does not concern me. Bayless, in a very gentlemanly voice, says his brand of salsas may serve in these recipes, but encourages us all to make them ourselves.<br /><br />The recipes in this book are presented with a very novel and genuinely useful feature in that the quantities of ingredients are given for three different amounts of final product. I simply have never seen this outside professional baking recipes. At the very least, this is a useful feature when you just want to try out a recipe and may wish to make no more than a cup or two. If it pleases your palate, you can make the eight-cup amount for your next party.<br /><br />A second major `surprise' is that none of these recipes follow the familiar chunky `pico de gallo' style. This is the first of three salsa archetypes Bayless identifies. The second is the vinegary, hot, and spicy cousin to our Louisiana hot sauces. The third is based on cooked tomatoes and tomatillos and fresh or dried chiles. All six recipes in this book belong to the third class, which Bayless considers the most versatile and is based on the widest range of flavors.<br /><br />Bayless also gives some thumbnail advice on preserving and canning the salsas, but I suggest you get some expert advice on the subject before plopping this goodness into your hardware store Ball jars. Even the `Good Eats' episode on preserving and canning is scary enough about bacterial diseases to make you want to be especially careful. I would be especially careful as Bayless specifically states that he uses less than the usual amount of vinegar, which makes the recipes a bit less bug resistant. While Bayless speaks often of the now famous molcajeta, the heavy mortar of Mexican cooking, he is quite happy to see you use a blender or food processor to make these recipes.<br /><br />The six salsa recipes are:<br /><br />Roasted Jalapeno-Tomato Salsa with Fresh Cilantro used in seven recipes.<br /><br />Roasted Poblano-Tomato Salsa with Fresh Thyme used in six recipes.<br /><br />Roasted Tomatillo Salsa with serranos, roasted onions and cilantro used in eight recipes.<br /><br />Mellow Red Chile Salsa with sweet garlic and roasted tomatoes used in ten recipes.<br /><br />Roasty Red Guajillo Salsa with tangy tomatillos and sweet garlic used in six recipes.<br /><br />Chipotle-Cascabel Salsa with roasted tomatoes and tomatillos used in nine recipes.<br /><br />Each recipe is enhanced with alternatives for the main chile ingredients (although I suggest you bevery  careful in subbing an habanero for any other chile species.) In addition to the three different columns of ingredient amounts, the procedures for all these recipes are fairly long as Bayless writes them, as his descriptions are very detailed with lots of little hints for scraping down, spreading out, and checking the taste. Even so, the procedures are pretty long even without Bayless' frequent hints. One thing I do notice is that I am certain it is Bayless who is writing these recipes, as I recognize his `chunky', slightly ungrammatical use of adjectives and adverbs I have seen in his other books.<br /><br />The forty-six `used in' recipes cover Starters; Soups, Salads and Side Dishes; Egg, Vegetable and Tortilla Main Courses; and Poultry, Meat and Fish Main Courses. I certainly can't judge how authentic these recipes are, as Bayless himself is, hands down, the best expert we have for what is authentic and what is not. I also believe that if you follow Senor Bayless' instructions closely, you will be happy with the results, assuming you don't have the anti-cilantro gene or an aversion to mild to high levels of capsicum.<br /><br />Almost as if there is a cookbook writer's union regulation that every cookbook must have dessert recipes; Bayless includes four desserts and two drink recipes in the last chapter. This is not quite as gratuitous as it may seem, as the recipes are specifically oriented and sized for entertaining a crowd large enough to fill your house. This fits the central point of the book that includes both small and large numbers of servings.<br /><br />When I opened this book, I had the suspicion that it may have been extracted from one of Mr. Bayless' other books, but I was wrong. It does compliment his `Mexico One Plate at a Time' book in that salsas play only a very small part of that book.<br /><br />This may be Bayless' most useful volume. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys cooking. Only warning is that if you want easy recipes, see Miller's book cited above.eful in subbing an habanero for any other chile species.)

Buy It!	`Will Write for Food' by culinary journalist and writing teacher, Dianne Jacob is a must read for everyone who has any intention on entering the culinary writing field. Whether intentionally or unintentionally, Ms. Jacob makes it clear that like virtually every worthwhile endeavor, success with culinary writing is difficult. As I have occasionally given some thought to trying my hand at submitting culinary writing for publication, I have thought that there may be some `easy' markets, if I were just clever enough to find them. Ms. Jacob has convinced me that there are no easy markets, at least none which actually pay real money for publication. Even the seemingly `easy' outlets such as local newspapers, magazines, and niche magazines have so many sources of either free or relatively inexpensive material that even these markets may be tough to crack. The major national markets such as `Gourmet', `Saveur', and `Food and Wine' are virtually unreachable by the newcomer.<br /><br />The second most important thing about Ms. Jacob's book is that it does not intend to teach you how to write. She does give a few pages of suggestions and hints, especially on word usage in culinary applications are spread here and there around the book. And, a few references to sources on training for writing are given, including my very favorite `The Elements of Style' by Strunk and White.<br /><br />Thus, the book is more about the food writing market than it is about writing. This is a very good thing, as all your writing efforts are worthless if you don't have a clear notion of your audience, your medium, and your medium's picture of their audience. And, the quantity and quality of sources, especially web sites given in this book are truly astounding. There is not a single culinary web site of which I am familiar that is missed, although the name of the TV Food Network web site is a bit out of date. And there are many, many more which are new to me. I am also happy to see that Ms. Jacob includes a mention of a personal web site or blog as a means of getting your writing in front of an audience. This is the modern world's version of self-publishing with even less overhead than a paper and hard covered book. She even mentions `printing on demand' where the vendor only prints the physical volume when they receive an order for the book. All this means is that this is a very up-to-date manual on all your outlet alternatives.<br /><br />So, Ms. Jacob's primary focus is identifying all the culinary writing markets, finding the one which best suits your interests and skills, and giving you suggestions on how to maximize your success in each market. Along the way, there are lots of interesting bits of information on, for example, why there are so few negative restaurant reviews. From the newspapers' point of view, there is simply no point to publishing a highly critical review of a local eatery, even if they don't advertise in the paper. People give much more interest to suggestions on where to go than where not to go. Unfortunately, Ms. Jacob's book was probably in galleys when Ruth Reichl's `Garlic and Sapphires' book was published, so there is no reference to that book. So, if you are really interested in restaurant reviewing, Ms. Reichl's latest book is also a must read.<br /><br />Along the way, Ms. Jacob quotes a really impressive range of successful culinary writing professionals, starting with Judith Jones (VP at Alfred A. Knopf and original editor for Julia Child, Madhur Jaffrey, Lydia Bastianich, and Diana Kennedy) and including Julie Sahni, Deborah Madison, Tony Bourdain, James Villas and Ruth Reichl. With all these bases covered, I'm surprised she has no mention of Michael Ruhlman who is both a major culinary journalist and collaborator in cookbook writing with Thomas Keller.<br /><br />As Ms. Jacob does not cover cookbook reviewing (my favorite culinary writing hobby), I will comment on her extensive tips on writing recipes. In general, I believeher tips are very good for the amateur or newbie recipe writer. And, I wish most cookbook writers would follow her suggestions. But, I believe there is room for more than one paradigm of a good recipe. Ms. Jacob gives us what may be called the Julia Child paradigm, where the author assumes little general culinary knowledge on the part of the reader. So, as most people react to Ms. Child's recipes, you have the feeling of the author's standing at your side and walking you through each step. This method is especially good for teaching traditional recipes to amateurs.<br /><br />A second paradigm may be called the Elizabeth David  model, as you find in her books on Mediterranean, French Provincial, and Italian recipes. Here, the object is less to give detailed instructions than to cover as broad a field as possible, spending a lot of time on comparing and contrasting recipes from different regions. The recipes are not so sparse that a trained cook could not reproduce them, but doing so may require a fair amount of specialized culinary expertise.<br /><br />A third paradigm may be called the Joel Robuchon model, which is what I expect to find in any cookbook written on a restaurant's `haute cuisine'. This model allows both unusual ingredients and difficult techniques, as the object of this writing is not so much to teach the amateur a recipe, but to simply tell us how it is done at the chef's famous venue. The best practitioner of this style is probably Thomas Keller and literary collaborator, Michael Ruhlman.<br /><br />At one point, Jacob advises against using a rather long list of words for culinary techniques in recipes. This list includes `blanch', `braise', `fold', `poach' and twelve other technical terms. I cannot disagree more on this point. The only case in which I would avoid these words is in a community fundraising cookbook.

Buy it.	`Crave' by the `award winning' executive chef of the Los Angles restaurant Bastide, Ludo Lefebvre elicits anticipation from its oversized format, its high price, and the very hip, tattooed pic of the author on the front cover. I am happy to say that the book delivers on it's expectations with a better than average restaurant cookbook.<br /><br />Like Eric Rippert's book `Le Bernardin Cookbook', this is the kind of book which cries out for half stars, as I am quite happy to give it four and a half stars, yet there are some reasons the average cookbook purchaser may wish to pass on it. Fortunately, these reasons are few.<br /><br />First, as with every good high-end restaurant cookbook, the recipes are simply not the kind you may be willing to make on a busy Tuesday or even on an average Sunday. This is because while there are relatively quick recipes in the book, there are just as many longish recipes requiring some arcane ingredients. So, you can't dip into this book the way you can a good book of Italian recipes such as Mario Batali's `Molto Italy' and come up with a good, relatively inexpensive, relatively quick AND interesting recipe.<br /><br />Second, as I have already stated, the book is oversized and just a bit overpriced for the number of recipes.<br /><br />Third, I sense that while Monsieur Lefebvre has very serious chops, with all the promise of an up and coming Jacques Pepin in the field of culinary education, he and his handlers may be just a little full of themselves in their presentation of the author. One example is my quoted fact that Ludo is an `award winning' chef, yet they give no information on what award it is he won. He was nominated for a lesser James Beard award, but he did not win. But, as I was told by a very wise man many years ago, if all the books with pretensions were removed from the library, our libraries would have very few books indeed!<br /><br />On the positive side, this is a culinary work with an excellent point of view and agenda that it executes almost flawlessly. The point of view is almost anti-scientific, insisting that the chef concentrate almost exclusively on their own five senses. This is a theme which runs through practically all cooking literature from Wolfgang Puck to Mario Batali to Jamie Oliver and everyone in between, but not the scientific wonks such as Alton Brown and Shirley Corriher. The extreme position for this point of view is in the author's description of one of his mentors, Alain Passard, who refused to even let his line cooks use thermometers to gage doneness. Passard insisted that sight and sound and touch should be enough. And, not only is it enough, it is probably preferable for a very busy line cook to use their trained senses, as this method is both much faster than poking food with an `instant read' thermometer and less damaging to the food itself.<br /><br />The book begins with a brief history of the author's culinary education and career in France, which sounds a lot like that of many other French chefs, including Monsieur Pepin. Lefebvre did not cook for the French President, but he was the personal chef to the French minister of defense during his year of obligatory military service. His career also confirms the picture of long years as an apprentice, commis, and line cook before one is even considered to be a sous chef or major specialist such as a saucier.<br /><br />The book is divided up into five chapters; each headed by one of the five recognized senses of sight, touch, smell, hearing, and taste. I believe the division of recipes among these five senses is mostly arbitrary, as every dish must involve all five senses. To be sure, some methods such as sauteeing involve direct experience far more than, for example braising, where all the action is going on in an oven, within a Dutch oven or bistro pan. But, the book does not suffer too much from this bit of artificiality.<br /><br />As a book of recipes from a `haute cuisine' restaurant, I expect unusual recipes and ingredients and I am not surprised on this count, but I am very pleasantly surprised to see how many recipes are variations on common everyday dishes such as tortilla espagnole (Spanish potato frittata) and pain perdu (French toast). I am also pleased with the range of ingredients. Many are unusual, but they appear in only a few recipes and they are the types of things where they are interesting enough so that you will probably not mind tracking them down on the Internet.<br /><br />Speaking of which, Monsieur Lefebvre gives a really extensive sources list with a feature I have seen nowhere else. For each merchant, the name of a real live person with whom you can establish a contact is given.<br /><br />Lefebvre's recipes for stock pantry items such as stocks, spice powders, puff pastry, confits and marmalades are not overly fussy. In fact, I think his recipe for brioche for his French toast is a lot simpler than you will find in a book by a bread-baking specialist. I would suggest you consult such a book for brioche.<br /><br />While I have seen this suggestion in a few other books, Lefebvre is the first author to fully incorporate the suggestion of resting cooked protein then briefly reheating it before service to bring it up to temperature. This makes so much sense that I am surprised I don't see it more often, but I also realize that it is a lot easier for a professional chef with a salamander at their station to do it than for an amateur with nothing but a conventional oven. Lefebvre also has a special technique for applying spices and herbs. He applies then at or near the end of cooking. This makes sense with fresh herbs, but I'm not sure it works for all recipes or for dried herbs.ant, I expect unusual recipes and ingredients and I am not surprised on this count, but I am very pleasantly surprised to see how many recipes are variations on common everyday dishes such as tortilla espagnole (Spanish potato frittata) and pain perdu (French toast).

Tolkien, edited by son, Christopher Tolkien is by far the most obscure and difficult yet of the postumous volumes starting with `The Silmarillion' and continuing with `Unfinished Stories' and `The Book of Lost Tales'. This is Volume III of `The History of Middle Earth' which will grow to twelve (12) volumes, to be completed by the editor, after almost twenty years, just before the release of the first of the three `The Lord of the Rings'  movies in 2001.<br /><br />From my brief examination of later `History' volumes, I suspect this may actually be the most difficult of them all. For starters, all the original material is in verse. And, with a very few exceptions, Tolkien was not a very good poet. I am not an accomplished critic of poetry, but my exposure to the epic verse of the ancients, Shakespeare, and modern `epic' poets such as Ezra Pound (`The Cantos') leads me to say that Tolkien, in these works, was primarily writing for himself and a very small circle of philologists and colleagues such as C. S. Lewis, with whom Tolkien created the club, The Inklings, who dwelled on such writings.<br /><br />Even an ardent Tolkien fan could be excused for passing by this volume, as most of the substance of the long poems is repeated in prose, primarily in `The Silmarillion'. However, before giving up on it entirely, I suggest the reader sample some of the Cantos herein to see if the sense they give of the magical elven land of Beleriand may just be a bit more than what you get in the prose stories.<br /><br />I am constantly amazed, in looking through this history, at how much of this was written in the 1920s and early 1930s, before even starting on `The Hobbit'. I am also thankful to Tolkien's primary publisher, Stanley Unwin, for pushing for another work including hobbits. Of all of Tolkien's writings, the tales in this book and all the stories between the time the Noldor left the undying lands and the sinking of Beleriand after the last battle with Morgoth tend to leave me pretty cold. They just seem to have none of the zip of the story beginning with the founding of Numenor. Leading to the wars against Sauron and the stories surrounding the rings of power.<br /><br />This volume is composed of multiple versions of two major poems, `The Lay of the Children of Hurin' and `The Lay of Leithian', both of which involve the conflict between the elves of Beleriand and Morgoth. I have read both and find little about which to get excited unless you are a serious language junkie. Unfortunately, my interest in language is based more on semantics than on philology, so I am more in tune to the linguistic tricks of Lewis Carroll than to Tolkien's inventions.<br /><br />But, if you love invented languages or you are a serious Tolkien trivia maven, this book is definitely for you.the last battle with Morgoth tend to leave me pretty cold.

Tolkien'sEarly Myths	`The Book of Lost Tales, Part One and Part Two' by J. R. R. Tolkien, edited by son, Christopher Tolkien, is, according to the editor's Foreword, some of the very earliest works written by Tolkien on the mythology of Middle Earth. Many, it is stated, were drafted in the 1920s, nearly ten years before the start of `The Hobbit'.<br /><br />This is an important fact, as it means that they were not written to `fill in' details of references made in either `The Hobbit' or `The Lord of the Rings' (LOTR). It means that both of these published novels were narratives of a preexisting world of Middle Earth with a history stretching back thousands of years, to the very creation of the world. This supports the sense of historical depth one has when you read both novels. Early in the Foreword, editor Tolkien addresses this very aspect and the danger that the great depth of history felt in the novels may not transfer to documents that lay out that history. I personally do not sense that danger when I read these works. The intellectual effort required to understand the text and tie it together with all the Tolkienania that has gone before is more than enough to keep me busy. This is the basis of my title for this review, `Fantasy for Grown-ups'.<br /><br />My experience is that neither `The Hobbit' nor `LOTR' books or movies had a strong appeal to the same audience as the literal and virtual comic book works such as Spiderman, Superman, Batman, Star Wars, Lara Croft (Tomb Raider), or even Indiana Jones. The world in which Middle Earth is set is much more subtly different from our world or the world of `Long ago, and far, far, away...' Even in `The Hobbit' one gets hints that the world of Middle Earth is not our comfortable sphereical planet with a different geography but the same physics, chemistry, and biology. One gets the sense that while the great `Gandalf the Gray' may be called a `wizard', he is not a wizard in the same sense as Merlin or a wizard of `Dungeons and Dragons'.<br /><br />The most important difference between Middle Earth and our world is that this continent is in the center of a great disk surrounded by seas across which are the undying lands including the Elven island of Eressea and Valinor. The next major difference is that there are beings, primarily elves, which walk the earth and which are literally immortal. That is, they cannot die by natural causes. They can, however, be killed in battle, as seen in `The Two Towers' movie with the death of the elven archer allies helping to defend the Hornburg with Aragorn, Theoden, and the Rohrrim. It is also interesting to see that Gandalf possesses an immortality of an entirely different order, as he survives the great battle with the Balrog in the mines of Moria, a battle that would have killed any ordinary immortal elf.<br /><br />It would have been interesting to see Tolkien deal with immortality in the same way that John Boorman did in his script for the movie `Zardoz', an easily underestimated movie. (Oddly enough, Gandalf is most like the characterization of Merlin in Boorman's movie, `Excalibur').<br /><br />Another big difference is that the physics of this world is different from our world. Light, for example, simply does not behave like our notions of light. It is much more like a liquid that can be captured in the Silmarils or in the vial give by Galadrial to Frodo in Lorien. This is part of the reason neither Gandalf nor any other character, even Sauron, seems to use much `magic'. What may appear to us as magic is simply bending the different laws of physics to the will of the magician, as Sauron does in creating the One Ring.<br /><br />These two books are yet another step removed from the `popular fiction' of `LOTR'. `The Silmarillion' was one step removed in being much more like Hesiod's mythology than Homer's epics. The `Unfinished Tales' were another step removed in that they were close to being stories with extensive editorial annotations. These two volumes, which are really one work in two books are reconstructions of even cruder material. Reading them may be about as much fun as reading Frazier's `The Golden Bough'.<br /><br />Now, reading `The Golden Bough' can be fun for a particularly intellectual interest, but it takes just a bit extra to gain the same pleasure from these works, as they are not stories from a historical mythology which may explain genuine primitive thought and beliefs. They are make believe! They just happen to be of a type of make believe which is more different than just about any other fiction you can imagine.<br /><br />The greatest insight I get from these myths on the early history of Middle Earth is on the origins of Tom Bombadil and the Ents. While neither is mentioned, there are ample hints that both are beings who sprung up from the bones of Middle Earth itself, independent of any efforts by the Valar. This explains the total difference between Bombadil and every other character in `LOTR' aside from Treebeard and the Ents. The Elves, the Wizards, Sauron, dragons, and probably dwarves, hobbits, and men all arose out of immigrants from `The Undying Lands' or were created by the Valar.<br /><br />I find the single most interesting character in these pre `LOTR' stories to be the Noldor (elven) leader Feanor. He seems to have the air of Prometheus about him in that he defies the gods (the Valar) without being an evil force like Melkor / Morgoth or Sauron. When Feanor is not on the stage, my interest drops several notches.<br /><br />These are the first two volumes of the twelve volume `The History of Middle Earth'. While several of the volumes seem independent, I would not venture to read any of them without having read `The Silmarillion'.

The `Pourcel Brothers Cookbook' by twin brothers Jacques and Laurent Pourcel, the owners of several restaurants in London, Tokyo, Bangkok, and Montpellier and Avignon, France is a reasonably priced ($29.95) oversized volume which has the look of being primarily an advertisement for their restaurants, especially the ones in southern France. It also has the look of a volume destined for a quick trip to the bargain book table, but with one or two good features to redeem it from mediocrity.<br /><br />The first strong feature of the book is its photography, which benefits from pictures of very nicely designed restaurant interiors in both France and England. The second strong feature is the dual index of recipes, listing all recipes alphabetically by title and by chapter. The third and best feature is the chapter introductions that have very nice little takes on world cuisine.<br /><br />The biggest single limitation of the book is that it is a restaurant book through and through. What's worse, it is a restaurant book for a two (Michelin) star restaurant, which cannot reach and retain its two stars without offering fine, original examples of French `haute cuisine'. The problem with this is that this is the type of dish that is not easily translated to the home dinner table. This is especially true with the level of competition, at least in American markets, among excellent homegrown restaurant cookbooks by Eric Ripert, Frank Stitt, Patrick O'Connell, Thomas Keller, Rick Tramonto, Bob Kinkead, Todd English, Charlie Trotter, Daniel Boulud, and Michael Romano. And, that doesn't even graze the surface of the Italian and French Bistro cuisines represented, for example, by Mario Batali and Tony Bourdain.<br /><br />Among other things, the dishes are limited by mixing hard to find ingredients and a relatively large amount of prep work. This latter situation signals recipes that are prepped for dozens of servings at a time. When these dishes are scaled down to a few servings, it means you need to prep a small amount of a lot of ingredients.<br /><br />The Pourcel cuisine is deeply fusion based with lots of dishes combining ingredients from all over the world. In a provocative essay on modern fusion being a lot like what happened when New World produce was introduced to Europe, the authors justify their dishes by saying they are simply doing the same thing that happened when the galleons brought back tomatoes, peppers, and potatoes back from America.<br /><br />I suggest that there is a major difference and that the authors' premise has a serious flaw. Tomatoes, peppers, beans, and potatoes took root in European cuisines because they grew easily in Europe, especially around the Mediterranean. We do not see olives and olive oil overrunning Mexican cuisine (going in the opposite direction) because olive trees simply did not grow well in Mexico. So, dishes that mix eggplant and pineapple simply didn't work 300 years ago, because the pineapple did not grow around the Mediterranean.<br /><br />Unlike most books by Keller, Ripert, and the others, this book offers no great insights into restaurant cooking and dealing with ingredients. The statements they do make, such as their talking up their fusion cuisine simply does not impress me.<br /><br />If you happen to like collecting restaurant cookbooks, this is better than some, since the French and the English know a thing or two about putting together attractive books, but if you are simply after unusual new recipes, I recommend Fredy Girardet's recent book (`girardet Recipes from a Master of French Cuisine).

Great ideas!	`Rose's Celebrations' by noted author of authoritative `Bibles' on baking cakes, pastries, and bread, Rose Levy Beranbaum has all the appearances of a `throwaway book, given its picture laden cover, oversized format, and the author's aforementioned expertise in baking rather than in savory cooking.<br /><br />While the book has some limitations as a source of savory recipes, it has many virtues that should appeal to most foodies and amateur cooks.<br /><br />The very first virtue is Ms. Beranbaum's enthusiasm for cooking and baking of all sorts. Her genuine love of culinary arts and her ability to communicate this passion in words is unmatched, in my opinion, by all but Julia Child, Rick Bayless (see `Rick and Lanie's Excellent Kitchen Adventures'), and Grace Young (see `Breath of a Wok'). I'm not saying there are not lots of great cookbook writers, it's just that Ms. Beranbaum seems to be able to draw one into her culinary world with an unrivaled attraction. For starters, she has one of the very best descriptions of the differences between baking and savory cooking. Everyone who has read a book on baking knows that measurements are much more important in baking than in savory cooking. What is less evident is that this doesn't mean savory cooking is easier. It means that the skills of constant triage needed to monitor the progress of savory cooking require just as much, if not more practical experience to get right. Add to this the variability of meats and vegetables when compared to the high level of uniformity among flours, sugars, butter, and eggs and you start to see that there is more to expert savory cooking than may meet the eye. And this from a baker.<br /><br />The ability to share her enthusiasm is oddly paired with a highly technical approach to recipes, both savory and baked. As with her baking recipes, many measurements are given in multiple units, by volume, by metric weight, and by Imperial units' weight. This means that the units most familiar to the average amateur are here, but if you happen to be in a position where you have to multiply a recipe by two or four or eight, the weights make this very easy. I also give Ms. Beranbaum high marks for admitting to rounding off the Imperial to metric conversions. I have seen very good cookbook writers have close to 20% discrepancies between Imperial and metric weights or volumes with nary a word of warning.<br /><br />This level of detail in various units means that this is an excellent book for a caterer. As it happens to be a series of recipes for holidays, the utility to caterers and large-scale entertainers is doubled. This is the only book other than Martha Stewart's classic `Entertaining' which gives good resources for cooking for a crowd of any size. That is, this is the only non-baking book for the amateur that fits this bill. I have seen expensive books for professionals which do this, but they are expensive and not friendly to a non-professional reader.<br /><br />This book is divided into the four seasons and within each season there are sets of recipes for entertaining various events.<br /><br />The major events for Winter are New Year's Eve, Washington's Birthday (dessert only), Winter Dinner for Friends and St. Patrick's Day. Spring events are Easter, Passover, and Mother's Day plus miscellaneous dishes for a spring luncheon and a wedding shower. Summer events are Father's Day, Fourth of July, Birthdays, and Labor Day. Fall events are Columbus Day, Halloween (dessert only), Election Day (dessert only), Thanksgiving, Hanukkah, and Christmas. A very special bonus is recipes for Glace de Viande and Glace de Volaille (Beef and Poultry Essences or glazes).<br /><br />The book also contains an alternate table of dishes by type / principle ingredient which identifies dishes of Beverages, Breads, Soups and Stocks, Sauces, Beef, Lamb, Poultry and so on. You get the idea.<br /><br />If, like me, your main interest is simply collecting good cookbooks and gleaning good ideas from them, this book is definitely a winner. One of the more interesting items I found was a merging of the principles of a court bouillon and a buerre blanc. Ms Beranbaum poached fish in a simple wine, vinegar, shallots, herbs, and oyster liqueur bouillon, then reduced the poaching liquid and added butter to create the buerre blanc. I may want to ask Miss Rose if she possibly forgot to mention anything about straining the chopped shallots from the reduction before adding the butter, but the idea is still a great `two birds with one stone' method.<br /><br />In looking over her Italian based recipes, you may not want to discard your Marcella Hazan or Mario Batali recipes for these, but they do have some novel ideas, such as the addition of Angostura bitters to the spaghetti (tomato) sauce.<br /><br />If you are especially fond of formal entertaining more than four people at a time, this may be the best source of recipes you will find. It does not cover as broad a range of events as, for example, Sheila Lukins' `Celebrate', but the recipes are much more impressive for formal occasions.<br /><br />To make the book a really good resource, it probably should have been about twice this size with better coverage of many events, but at a list price of only $25 and the likelihood of a good discount, I recommend this book as a great `sleeper' find for foodies, culinary readers, and entertainers.s and gleaning good ideas from them, this book is definitely a winner.

Salads are one of those culinary topics which deserves at least one or more great books. What the author has given us is nothing more than a collection of vaguely original salad recipes with poor exposition on ingredients and what I believe are modestly good results.<br /><br />There are at least four ways in which this could have been a much better book.<br /><br />The first would have been to begin with an exposition on major salad ingredients, their availability, their tastes, and their affinities with other ingredients. One volume that does this well is my old copy of a `Better Homes and Gardens Salads' volume.<br /><br />The second would have been to make a point of including all major named salads, including the Salade Nicoise, the chef's salad, the Caprese Salad, Panzanella, Cobb Salad, Salad Lyonnaise, and so on. One volume which comes close to doing this is my old friend the `Better Homes and Gardens Salads' and the `Williams-Sonoma Salads' volume.<br /><br />The third would be to do salads by the seasons. An excellent example of such a presentation is `Twelve Months of Monastery Salads' by Brother Victor-Antoine d'Avila-Latourrette. This does salads not only by season but also by the month, based on produce that comes into season in each month. The author's introduction pays some lip service to choosing the recipe based on what is available and fresh in the market, but there is nothing in the book which assists us in doing the same thing.<br /><br />The fourth would have been to devote the time and energy into addressing a single type of salad, such as the `Pasta Salad' by Barbara Lauterbach.<br /><br />Ms. Scott-Goodman's book has the appearance of a volume on an express to the discount table at Barnes and Noble or Borders. Two signs are the fact that the author's bio gives her virtually no culinary credentials and that the bio of the photographer is longer than that of the author. These are only symptoms. There is nothing to say that a culinary newcomer can't put together an excellent book. Unfortunately, there is little in this book which distinguishes it from the very good to excellent titles cited above.<br /><br />I will give Ms. Scott-Goodman some credit for organizing her chapters by major ingredient. My sense of the logical is just a bit offended when there are chapters on vegetables and beans. Beans are vegetables! That same sense is also offended by the chapter title `vinaigrettes & dressings'. Vinaigrettes are, of course, just a special type of dressing.<br /><br />The introduction to the chapter on `Greens' shows a remarkably myopic view of the history of salads when the author describes the archetype for the recently past salads as being a wedge of iceberg lettuce and a bottled dressing. This may have been true of many suburban midscale restaurants, but all the classics mentioned above plus many more have been around for most or all of the 20th century and people enough interest in food to look up salads in a good cookbook would have found recipes for one or more of these classics.<br /><br />The very first recipe in the `Greens' chapter annoys me just a bit when the first ingredient is `4 cups mixed salad greens'. For the moment, I will forget that you can find cellophane bags of `mixed salad greens' in large supermarket produce departments. Would it not have been better to specify either such a bag of greens or a list of specific greens names such as endive, frisee, arugula, and red leaf lettuce? This same recipe calls for vinaigrette of balsamic vinegar and olive oil, with salt and pepper being tossed in after mixing the greens with the vinaigrette. My first problem with this is that I doubt most people would associate balsamic vinegar with a `classic' mixed greens salad. Red wine vinegar is much more appropriate here, as this recipe is probably most accurately traced to the French cuisine. My second problem is why in the world would you toss in the salt and pepper instead of adding it to the vinaigrette? The very first vinaigrette recipe in the last chapter is simply oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper.<br /><br />None of these little things mean that this is a BAD book. It is simply a journeyman author's effort that includes fairly good recipes but practically nothing special. There is no spark on inspiration that gives us some extra utility. There is certainly little which justifies the book's title.<br /><br />All in all, for decent recipes presented in a clear manner with average to better than average photographs, I give it four stars, but suggest you look for something better unless you can get this volume for a steeply discounted price. Other books on the same subject are better. The food is good but the communication breaks down here and there.d to the French cuisine.

206279:US	39134375	R1P2ET2NSZM649	0936184868	409874473	The Cook's Illustrated Guide To Grilling And Barbecue	Books	5	201	203	N	N	Great Introduction to Outdoor Cooking.	`The Cook's Illustrated Guide to Grilling and Barbecue' by the editors of `Cook's Illustrated' magazine may be the very first book you should get on the title subject. Unlike the charcoal only coverage of the excellent `The Thrill of the Grill' by Chris Schlesinger and John Willoughby, this book gives equal coverage to charcoal and gas, although it does not address grilling with raw hardwood.<br /><br />The first thing which impressed me about this book is that early in editor in chief Christopher Kimball's introduction, the point is made in no uncertain terms that good grilling and barbecue is hard to do. Doing it right requires both book learning and experience. The second thing that impressed me about the book was that I found lots of very good general information on techniques. I was expecting not much more than an anthology of grilling and barbecue recipe articles from the magazine as I see in many other `Cook's Illustrated' books. I was not surprised with the quality of this information, as `Cook's Illustrated' always provides reliable, albeit somewhat uninspired advice.<br /><br />One thing I find true of the `Cook's Illustrated' books is that they are fun to read. Every other page seems to have a sidebar of interesting opinions about everything from Santoku knives to catsup (Heinz is the best). I suggest you take opinions on ingredients such as vinegars or olive oils with a grain of salt, as there is a good chance that a minority of available brands were tested and their testers tend to play it safe. When they say they were surprised by their results, it's time to sit up and take notice! The best thing about their opinions is that they give the reasons behind their recommendations and when the reasons are sound, there is little room for argument, as when they describe their experiments with the heat distribution in a kettle grill measured from five different points in a comparison of two different methods of creating a high heat zone and a low heat zone in the same grill.<br /><br />A second big distinction between this book and `The Thrill of the Grill' is that `Cook's Illustrated' gives us recipes for all the standard dishes that appear on 90% of America's grills. It may be great to find out how to grill octopus, but it's a lot better to exercise one's grilling technique with hamburgers, steaks, and chops until you have the basic techniques down pat. As with most `Cook's Illustrated' recipes, I have a bit of a problem with the ones in this book. While I totally trust their opinions and findings on general grilling technique, I will probably adapt their recipes with a certain caution. Their recipes for hamburgers and London Broil have lots of good information about shaping the patties and choosing the meat, but the actual recipes are, I believe, not as good as my favorite methods acquired from Julia Child and James Beard respectively. I would be inclined to read what they have to say about the recipes, but use my own experience in seasoning or marinading. The other side of the coin is that many recipes give separate instructions for how to handle the same recipe on gas and on charcoal. My best suggestion is that if you have a favorite saute recipe you wish to move to the grill, look up a comparable recipe in this book and transpose your favorite recipe to the grill with these authors' grilling recommendations.<br /><br />Part of what makes this book so good as armchair reading is that it does an excellent job of explaining the differences between cooking methods for tender versus tough forms of meat. This dichotomy is especially interesting when lined up with the differences between grilling and barbecuing. The former is a high heat method very similar to sauteeing while the latter is a low heat method very similar to braising. It explains the seeming paradox of a piece or beef loin going tough if cooked too long while a piece of chuck becomes tenderer under the right long cooking circumstances.<br /><br />For those who are not familiar with the `Cook's Illustrated' style of presentation, I have to give a good word about their line drawing demonstrations of techniques. I have always preferred the skillful drawing to photographs as the former illustration highlights what is important and leaves out any extraneous information. On the other hand, when the subject is produce as when you are looking at good versus bad racks of ribs, a series of well cropped photographs is better than the drawing. Here, you don't want to chance hiding any detail of the product being shown. In any case, the illustrations are a lot better than what you get from Schlesinger and Willoughby or Bobby Flay. I will say that in a few cases, the black and white photos are a little weak in that the definition of detail doesn't do justice to the point being made in the text.<br /><br />This oversize volume has two introductory sections on basic outdoor cooking techniques and outdoor cooking tools. This is followed with seven chapters of all your basic grilled or barbecued proteins, including beef, pork, lamb, chicken, turkey (and other birds), fish, and shellfish. Vegetables give us an eighth chapter on grilling. The tenth chapter covers grilling breads, especially pizza. If you are pretty expert at pizza making, this is probably really a good thing to try, as your kitchen oven can barely make it above 500 degrees Fahrenheit, while a charcoal grill can easily reach over 750 degrees Fahrenheit, much closer to your favorite pizza shop oven. The last chapters are on side dishes and rubs and sauces.<br /><br />If I were editing the book, I would have put barbecue techniques and recipes in separate chapters, especially for those who specialize in one or the other, but a little extra reading never hurt anyone, and I am all in favor of the value of serendipity.<br /><br />Highly recommended first book on grilling and barbecue!or those who are not familiar with the `Cook's Illustrated' style of presentation, I have to give a good word about their line drawing demonstrations of techniques.

207520:US	39134375	R11XH5TSRWMU43	0471445940	496116269	Go Fish: Fresh Ideas for American Seafood	Books	5	17	22	N	N	Great 2nd book on Fish cookery. Buy It!	`go FISH' by Laurent Tourondel and Andrew Friedman is one of those books which exudes promise from its pores, as it were. It has the very promising subtitle, `Fresh Ideas for American Seafood', the talented co-author who has assisted several other major New York chefs with their books, and complementary back cover blurbs from six of the heaviest of heavy culinary hitters. I will be only a little skeptical about the fact that all but Thomas Keller are French chefs with restaurants in New York. This `coincidence' is offset by the fact that one of the French five is Eric Ripert, who is a first rate fish specialist in his own right. So, if Eric is willing to pass some of his cachet off to our man Laurent, then I will take him at his word.<br /><br />The book explains itself as a collection of recipes for only fish found in American markets (not necessarily in American waters) and as a collection of recipes written to be prepared at home rather than at a restaurant. That is, although Monsieur Tourondel is a seafood restaurant chef, these are dishes he prepares at home and not in his restaurants. So far, all of this sounds really great.<br /><br />Tourondel continues to please me when he says that fish is really easy to cook. This coincides with everything I have read and experienced about fish cookery so far. In fact, the main talent you need with fish is to avoid overdoing it with strong flavors so as to avoid loosing the identity of the fish under a blanket of strong flavors.<br /><br />Tourondel pays up on this promise by offering many dishes of raw (sushi, sashimi, tartare, carpaccio) acid-cooked (ceviche) recipes which are practically all about good knife skills and involve virtually no cooking by heat.<br /><br />The authors offer us a great service by providing a chapter of  fifty-eight (58) profiles of fish in American markets, almost all of which are also from American waters. Understandably, many will only be available in certain parts of the country. In eastern Pennsylvania, I have never seen stone crab, frog's legs, spiny lobster, rock shrimp, sea urchin, snails, Dungeness crab, or peekytoe crab at my fishmonger or megamart. The only seafood I miss from their list is abalone and terrapin, which are both in `James Beard's New Fish Cookery'. I will certainly not hold that against this book, as I would rather have two good books that do not overlap than two good books which succeed in the same areas.<br /><br />Another introductory section gives expert advice on how to select and care for seafood purchases. This advice covers everything I have heard or read before, but with not much I have not heard or read before.<br /><br />Thus, the authors seem to have succeeded with three important big ideas, all of which add up to a promising book for American home cooks. The next issue is whether their recipes are good and they have a good supply of little ideas to back up their agenda.<br /><br />For starters, I believe their recipes are written in an especially good format. My usual preference is for numbered steps that make it easy to see where you are at any given point in the preparation. The authors go one better and give titles to each step. This is an excellent measure for making the recipe easy to follow, but it is also an excellent step to show, upon reading the recipes, how much work is involved in actual cooking and how much is involved in prepping the ingredients and the garnishes. In almost all other regards, the layout of the recipe text is first class. The headnotes are at the beginning, the notes about ingredients are highlighted with large type names, and almost all recipes are for the same number of servings.<br /><br />An excellent last step to each procedure is instructions on how to serve the dish. Each recipe, even the appetizers, also include a wine selection which goes far beyond the usual. In fact, it goes so far that while the novice can use it, its full value may only be evident to a wine aficionado. These last two features make this book doubly valuable as a resource for dishes with which to entertain.<br /><br />I am very happy to find the names of all the recipes at the beginning of each chapter. One can see at a glance, for example, that the book includes recipes for the traditional Manhattan and New England clam chowders, Pesto Minestrone, Mediterranean Fish Soup, crab bisque, and cream of cauliflower with salt cod. The editors should have taken just one more step and put the page numbers on the recipe titles.<br /><br />With fish described as being so simple to cook, one may be surprised at the long ingredient lists and not trivial cooking instructions. The fact is that except for soups and plating instructions for things such as salads, much of the time and materials in many of the recipes goes for the dressing, sauce, or garnish. I looked at a few of the scallop recipes and found that the cooking in most of them was the same. The differences lay in the saucing and dressing. In spite of the somewhat long ingredient lists, I found nothing really expensive or out of the ordinary, as long as you are reasonably knowledgeable about world cuisines. Recipes originate from around the world, with a heavy concentration from France, Italy, America, the Mediterranean, Japan, and Southeast Asia (formerly French Indo-China). Many recipes even used water in lieu of chicken or fish stock.<br /><br />Scallops bring up an important point. These recipes were probably written and tested with the very highest quality of scallops in hand. In landlocked Pennsylvania, all the sea scallops I ever see look more like scallop pieces laden with that stuff they add to keep them looking white.<br /><br />An excellent second fish book, after acquiring Beard's book or Mark Bittman's `Fish'.aficionado.

Even before I have read and reviewed this book, it was the one I always recommended when someone wanted a good book on grilling, based solely on the reputation of the authors and my observations on their non-grilling books.<br /><br />As with several books, I picked this book out to review because I wanted to read a model for good grilling books to which I can compare other grilling and barbecue books. On reading this volume, I'm glad I have given the two Bobby Flay books I have reviewed only four stars, as they are very nice, inexpensive collections of good grilling recipes, but Schlesinger and Willoughby offer so much more. I am also just a bit chastised for having given Steve Raichlen's `BBQ USA' five stars. It is a very big book with lots of `color' sidebars on grilling and barbecue around the country, but it simply does not address the twin topics of grilling and barbecue in as well defined a manner as we get in this excellent book. Schlesinger and Willoughby are not only crystal clear on the differences between grilling and barbecue in exactly the right way, they explain all the regional differences between eastern North Carolina, western North Carolina, Texas, Memphis, and Kansas City in a way that puts all the Food Network shows rolled up together to shame.<br /><br />One of the first things you discover about the authors' grilling technique is that (in this book) they don't even consider gas grilling, almost as if a gas grill was not true grilling. Just to be sure, I checked the index for the words `propane', `gas', `bottled gas', and `natural gas' and none of these expressions appear. The next thing I noticed was that their take on the various types of fuel and fire lighting techniques was very non-denominational. They expressed no strong preferences for briquettes, hardwood charcoal, or raw hardwood. They were also kind to the technique of starting fire with lighter fluid or even an electrical fire-starting coil. The only product / technique they dismissed was self-starting briquettes.<br /><br />Like the very best grilling reference it is, the book covers virtually all aspects of outdoor cooking, including appetizers, main dishes, side dishes, breads, desserts, and beverages. Needless to say, not every dish is grilled, but every dish has a well-established role in the grilling milieu.<br /><br />The recipes themselves are a very nice contrast to Flay and Raichlen. While Bobby does southwest and Steve does `redneck' traditional, Schlesinger and Willoughby are heavy on Caribbean and Oriental flavors. I suspect most of this is due to Schlesinger's preferences and experiences as a professional chef. Willoughby's half of the job is probably editing the English and getting all the details right.<br /><br />The heart of the book is the five chapters on grilled dishes. These subjects are:<br /><br />Appetizers, including soups with grilled ingredients, gazpacho, sauces, raw bar dishes, and the like.<br /><br />Fish, including rubs, marinades, and vinaigrettes. This is the first book where I saw good specialized instructions on grilling fish, including the notion that not all fish take to the grill.<br /><br />Meat, including Poultry, with lots of recipes for pork and Caribbean jerk seasonings.<br /><br />`Grilling at the Ritz', or things to do with expensive or unusual ingredients such as figs, mushrooms, frogs legs, tuna, quail, rabbit, venison, sweetbreads, and duck breast.<br /><br />The next chapter gives a taste of the authors strong interest in pickling (See their book `Quick Pickles'), as it has 35 recipes for chutneys, relishes, blatjangs (highly spiced South African preserves), jams, sauces, and glazes.<br /><br />The next chapter gives an excellent introduction to the technique of barbecue, which they very accurately point out has muchless to do with any sauce than it does with a method of slow cooking over an open fire plus smoke. They are also careful to differentiate it from curing with smoke (as done to bacon and some sausages). There are not many recipes in this section, but each one is a major exemplar for an important classic barbecue meat. The recipes include whole chicken, duck, baby back ribs, Missouri style ribs, North Carolina pulled pork, Texas beef brisket, and bologna. There is but one recipe for a barbecue sauce, with five major variations. For a serious survey of different barbecue sauces, rubs, and mops, see Paul Kirk's `Championship Barbecue'.<br /><br />The next chapter covers the essential outdoor eating side dishes. This includes slaws, salads, biscuits, grits, dips, beans, greens, and fruity glazes. I strongly recommend the recipe for Cheddar Biscuits ( page 309).<br /><br />The Breads and desserts chapter includes everything you would expect in an outdoor cooking and eating book, which is heavy on the corn bread, flat breads, and classic American desserts such as cobblers, pies, and crisps. Baking instructions are not given for baking on a closed grill. Most are done in the modern kitchen oven.<br /><br />Note that while the recipes are very well written and annotated, the book enhances these dishes with sidebars of very well illustrated instructions on basic techniques such as making compound butters and cutting meat to serve or to prepare to grill.<br /><br />Every good prescription for the grilling setup specifies  that you have a flavorful beverage at hand before starting. Just to be sure this requirement is covered, the authors give us a few recipes for classic tea-totaller and alcoholic libations. The authors outdo fussy Alton Brown in the depth to which they set you up for a grilling session.<br /><br />Virtually the only point where where I doubted the author's statement was when they said grilling is cooking by heat convection.

Buy It.	`Cooking At Home On Rue Tatin' is Susan Hermann Loomis' seventh book, a followup to the memoir, `On Rue Tatin'. Many of Ms. Loomis' books follow the rubric of `Farmhouse' cooking, especially as she and her family live in a French farmhouse in northwestern France.<br /><br />The first great coincidence I encounter with this book is that it reinforces an observation in the last culinary book I reviewed, `The Perfectionist' about the career and suicide of the major French three star chef, Bernard Loiseau. Loomis' book reflects exactly that trend which helped do in Monsieur Loiseau. That is, French cooking, both `haute cuisine' done by the great restaurants and `cuisine bourgeoisie' is being greatly influenced by food and cooking from France's current and former colonies from around the world, most especially in the North African Madgreb (Morocco, Algeria, and Tunesia) and Indochina (Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia). This is almost exactly the same kind of influence which Indian cooking has had on English cuisine. In fact, one wonders why it took so long, as London has been infused with Indian cooking for the last century.<br /><br />It is important to note that while Ms. Loomis is a very good cookbook writer, she is not quite in the same class as Paula Wolfert for her analysis of national cuisines or of the great Julia Child for doing definitive interpretations of French dishes. But then, who is as good as these two fine culinary writers. Rather, Ms. Loomis is easily on a par with her good friend and `Franco-American' expatriot Patricia Wells. In fact, I would recommend Ms. Loomis' books over Ms. Wells to the less experienced cook who wants some exposure to French dishes but who is not ready to tackle Child's `Mastering the Art of French Cooking'.<br /><br />This book is most like Ms. Wells' two books on cooking at her rural home in Provence, with the addition of the focus on the arorementioned colonial influences. The other major difference is that while Ms. Wells' interest is primarily with travel, entertaining, and wine accompaniments, Ms. Loomis is about improving her reader's general cooking skills.<br /><br />Your interest in this book will have a lot to do with your cookbook collecting interests. If, like me, you are a full service foodie reader, stop now and order the book. It is an enjoyable read as well as a very nice source of internet addresses for foodstuffs.<br /><br />If you like to have a nice variety of cookbooks on hand, but have limited space or budget for cookbooks, I suggest you pick one good author and get all their books. If you are especially fond of French cooking, Ms. Loomis, Ms. Wells, Mr. Olney, or, of course, Julia Child are all excellent choices. By focusing on a single author, you minimize the chances of having more than one recipe for the same dishes. And, of all these, Ms. Loomis is the easiest to read with a wide range of dishes.<br /><br />If you have limited space but like a selection of books from a wide range of cuisines, then I also recommend this book, even over Ms. Loomis' other books, as I think this book is one of her warmest and most personal, and you will probably find it more enjoyable than her other cookbooks.<br /><br />I thoroughly endorse Ms. Loomis' organization of subjects. In a smallish book which is meant to be a working cookbook (rather than a citizen of the library), it is best if the chapters are done by either course or by major ingredient type. Her chapters are:<br /><br />The Aperitif Hour - Both classic French (Tapenade) and imported (Hummus) recipes for hors d'oeurves.<br /><br />A Bowl of Soup - Spanish, North African, and Provencal standards.<br /><br />First Hot and Cold Courses - Omelets, Salads, Pates, Quiches, and Mussels, oh my!<br /><br />Fish, The Beautiful Swimmer - Fish a la Meuniere (dredged and fried), en papillote (in paper) and so on.<br /><br />A Choice of Poultry - Wings, With Artichokes, steamed, Syrian (with tahini), brined and roasted, and, of course, coq au vin plus a few duck, duck breast, and turkey recipes.<br /><br />All the Flavors of Meat - Especially stuffed vegetables, eggplant, steak, stew, braises, and grilled lamb.<br /><br />A Selection of Vegetables - Gratins (My favorite!) and veggie braises. Oh la la.<br /><br />Breads and Pastries - Including crepes, waffles, cookies, sweet bread, tarts, and chocolate cake.<br /><br />Custards, Compotes, Cakes, Tarts and More - All the neat things the French do with fruits and ice cream.<br /><br />Basics and Preserves - Stocks, Pastry Doughs, Court Bouillon, Vinaigrette, Herbes de Provence, flavored oils, onion marmalade, eggplant caviar, and steamed couscous. If you can get the tiny cucumbers, there is even a recipe for cornichons.<br /><br />The best thing about this book is that it gives you a sample of a wide range of French specialities. While books specializing in pastry or preserves or braising or egg dishes or baking may cover each of these individual subjects in more detail, this book gives you a great way to learn about the full range of French `home cooking' in easy bites with reliable recipes.<br /><br />In addition to the recipes, there is a great range of especially good sidebars on various cooking materials and techniques. All are good, but one I thought was especially good for a general book was the sidebar on making preserves. The very best source for French preserve making is Christine Ferber's `Mes Confitures', but this is an excellent way to get acquainted with the subject and not shoot yourself in the foot while trying it out.<br /><br />Just in case you need an excuse, Ms. Loomis is excellent at making you feel good about cooking, and gives you lots of new things with which to exercize this interest.<br /><br />Highly recommended for all foodies and Francophiles.u vin plus a few duck, duck breast, and turkey recipes. <br />All the Flavors of Meat - Especially stuffed vegetables, eggplant, steak, stew, braises, and grilled lamb. <br />A Selection of Vegetables - Gratins (My favorite!) and veggie braises.

Titled `Die Geschickte Hausfrau' (The Handy Housewife) and written in `Pennsylvania High German', it was a collection of traditional German and New World recipes done by a printer who acquired many of the recipes by simple plagiarism from many different American and German sources.<br /><br />While this book is based on the 160-year-old volume, the author contributes an enormous editorial labor to make the material accessible to the modern cook and scholar. And scholarly indeed is this exposition of Pennsylvania Dutch cooking in general. I am from a Pennsylvania Dutch background and have lived on the fringes of this world for all my life and I found things about this group that I have never heard before.<br /><br />And, after having read dozens of books on the nature of French, Italian, Italian regional, Chinese, Japanese, Mexican, Philippine, Greek, Lebanese, Moroccan, Turkish, and Thai cuisines, I have to say that this book gives as good or better treatment of the nature of its subject than any others I have read! It is important that what I mean here is not the culinary virtues of the recipes but the illuminating value of the scholarship. In fact, I would NOT recommend this book if what you want is a good book of Pennsylvania Dutch recipes. For that, you should go to any number of books by Betty Groff, Phyllis Good, or Mary Showalter. The latter's book `Pennsylvania Dutch Cooking' is especially good, larger collection of recipes.<br /><br />To that litany of world cuisines, I should add that I have not seen as good an exposition of either `Southern' or `Tex-Mex' cuisines, the two other most clearly defined `home grown' cuisines. While there are dozens of excellent books on `Southern' cooking, not one of them fully characterizes the essence of what distinguishes this cuisine from its European antecedents. Although I must say that southerner James Villas and New Englander John Thorne have both done excellent essays on important aspects of Southern cooking.<br /><br />Appropriate to the year in which Weaver's source text was first published, it was aimed at the original wave of south German immigrants to Pennsylvania. These are the Mennonites, Amish, Lutherans, and Moravians who came seeking religious freedom in William Penn's colony before the Revolutionary War. And, just as Italian cuisines were transformed by the greater wealth of food available in the New World, so the German's were able to indulge to the hilt all their culinary inclinations.<br /><br />Unlike the Italians who were virtual vegetarians due to the cost of meat in their native Italy, the South Germans tended to have a very high preference for meat over vegetables. The meat of choice, of course, was pork, as pigs were much easier to raise in Pennsylvania. Sheep did not do well in the Lancaster County summer, and lamb meat simply didn't work well in transposed pork recipes. And, in spite of the great reputation of the Italians for making full use of the porkers, it is the Germans who actually have the widest variety of cured sausages. And, there are the famous scrapples and pig's stomach dishes. No wonder Emeril Lagasse loves Pennsylvania Dutch cooking (`Pork fat rules'). The most distinctive combination of flavors in this cuisine is represented by the famous dish `Schnitz un Gnepp' which may be considered the Pennsylvania German's version of  cassoulet. It combines acid from dried apples, starch from dumplings, and sweet and salty flavors from the braising liquid.<br /><br />It's interesting that many of the dishes commonly associated with the Pennsylvania Dutch such as shoo fly pie are actually late arrivals. And, beef becomes a more important component of Pennsylvania Dutch cooking when the beef ranching in the Midwest and the southwest, plus the railroads for carting them to Chicago and the East make it impractical for Lancaster county small farms to compete in the Baltimore and Philadelphia markets with beef prices. So, they started eating the beef themselves.<br /><br />This book is oddly reminiscent of the better presentations of Medieval and Renaissance recipes and cookbooks. As in those cases, the original authors gave few exact measurements of ingredients and did not spell out methods in great detail. All of this was assumed since the original authors were writing for people who either learned to cook over many years at their mother's side or as an apprentice to a cook in a royal court or wealthy household.<br /><br />Thus, the author gives us an English translation of the original `High Pennsylvania German' text and follows this with an exposition of both culinary details the recipe may be assuming and the historical context for each recipe. Each recipe is also presented with an English name, the name in the book (high Pennsylvania German) and a Pennsylvania Dutch dialect (`Pennsylfanisch') name. The commentary also translates, where necessary, the cooking method from open hearth to modern oven or stovetop.<br /><br />The book does not give the recipes in the same order as in the original. It rearranges them to fit modern cookbook topics with chapters on:<br /><br />Meats and Hearthside Savories<br /><br />What the Dutch Call Gefliggel (Poultry)<br /><br />Fish and Shellfish<br /><br />A Karrich of Vittles and Herbs (Vegetable Side Dishes)<br /><br />Soups, Broths, and Stews<br /><br />Puddings, Pies, and Other Sweets<br /><br />Siesses and Sauieres (Fermenting, Canning, and Preserves)<br /><br />Heady Punches and Small Beers<br /><br />The chapter on pies and sweets is an ample confirmation of Wayne Harley Brachman's (`American Desserts') description of the Pennsylvania Dutch as `dessert central' for the United States. The chapter on canning explains why the leading producer of catsup (H. J. Heinz) is a Pennsylvania company!<br /><br />This is clearly a book for people who love to read about food. If you simply want a good chicken potpie recipe, get James Beard's book on poultry. But, if you love connecting the dots between foods at different times and different places, this is a book for you!o Chicago and the East make it impractical for Lancaster county small farms to compete in the Baltimore and Philadelphia markets with beef prices.

The book gives far more than the story of one chef. In many ways, it is one of the very best presentations of one aspect of world cuisine. As a description of the realities of food business, it ranks with Michael Ruhlman's two books, `The Soul of a Chef' and `The Making of a Chef' and with Anthony Bourdain's `Kitchen Confidential' with its insights into the culinary life.<br /><br />The elements of this story follow. Loiseau, a lightly educated and seemingly unteachable young boy is apprenticed with the very famous chefs Jean and Pierre Troisgros, whose restaurant in Roanne, along with Paul Bocuse outside of Lyon, were the two leading centers for the development of `nouvelle cuisine'. Loiseau spends three years at `Les Frere Troisgros', earning the certificate showing he has successfully completed his culinary apprenticeship. The next step on the ladder of culinary advancement was to be hired as a `commis' or assistant, typically starting as a specialist at one of the main stations in the French professional kitchen. Bernard takes such a position with culinary businessman Claude Verger who takes over a restaurant in Paris. After a few years of success in Paris, Loiseau moves as sous-chef to a venerable but run down restaurant-hotel in Saulieu, a small town in Burgundy, several miles from the new highway from Paris to the Mediterranean coast. Even this early in his career, Loiseau has the ambition to earn the coveted Michelin three star rating which marks his restaurant as one of the very few (counted in the low twenties) best in France. After five years as Verger's resident chef at this `Cote d'Or', Loiseau buys the restaurant from Verger and embarks on a mission to enhance the physical hotel and restaurant and the restaurant's cuisine to achieve the coveted Michelin three stars. The big problem is that, without the benefit of a professional clinical diagnosis, it is fairly clear that Bernard Loiseau suffered from bipolar disorder. At one point, he was even prescribed Prozac which helped, but which so deadened his drive that he weaned himself from the drug as soon as he felt he no longer needed it. Loiseau gets his three stars in the 1991 edition of the Michelin guide that he retains until his suicide in 2003.<br /><br />One constant theme in this story from the point at which Loiseau take over as owner of `Cote d'Or' is that much of Loiseau's success is due to his Herculean efforts at public relations. This was done with all the techniques so well known to American foodies. Just replace the name of Bernard Loiseau with Emeril Lagasse and you get a good sense of the efforts Loiseau made to keep the name of his restaurant in the public eye. Fortunately, Loiseau, like Lagasse, had the perfect personality for this task. And, unlike Lagasse whose base is smack in the center of US Food Central (New Orleans), Loiseau's venue was almost literally out in the sticks, isolated from mainstream car travel by the new superhighway several miles away. And, in a sense, it was this `deadly embrace' with the press that brought him down. One has to wonder how much time Emeril Lagasse really spends in the kitchens of his many New Orleans, Florida, and Las Vegas restaurants when he appears on television out of New York City practically around the clock on tape and live at least once a week. Similar questions arose about Loiseau, since his audience was unaware of the fact that between appearances in Paris, Loiseau would race back to his restaurant in time for the dinner service, so he was at the critical expediter's station for almost every service. The proverbial straw was a newspaper article predicting that his three stars were in jeopardy and that his rating with a Michelin competitor would drop. An actual drop in this less important rating followed this.<br /><br />The broader culinary story is much more interesting. The book opens my eyes to the fact that our home cooking is about as much like French haute cuisine as my e-mail writing is like Proust, Dickens, or Dostyevski. The words may be the same and the grammar is the same, but the way things are put together is in a completely different league. And, what you read in Julia Child's `Mastering the Art of French Cooking' is just the starting point for these masters.<br /><br />Still, with all the nouvelle cuisine cachet attached to his cuisine, Loiseau was still based firmly on classic French technique. He really had only three years of formal training. Even if this was with the great Troisgros brothers, it was still less than usual. And, it gave him no exposure to world cuisines, just at the time when French cooking was opening up to fusion principles, starting with some of the `experimental' cooking coming from Ferran Adria just across the border in Spain. If Loiseau had not been a superb culinary artist, he would not have had the success he made in spite of his limited knowledge and disadvantageous location, but I have the suspicion that he simply was not in the same class as Paul Bocuse, Joel Robuchon, the Troisgros brothers, Freddie Girardet, Guy Savoy, or Alain Ducasse, just to name a few.<br /><br />The book benefits from the fact that the author know Bernard Loiseau well for much of his career, just as he know many of the other major chefs. This is not a book written from a distance. On the other hand, it is a purely journalistic treatment, with no citations of sources for statements and inconsistent translations of French expressions.<br /><br />Still, if you have an interest in world food business and lore, buy this book!pardy and that his rating with a Michelin competitor would drop.

Tolkien of the world of Middle Earth. It was the first of a series of posthumously published volumes, edited from Tolkien's documents by his son, Christopher Tolkien. And, it is the only complete work, as it was probably polished for publication near the time of Tolkien's death.<br /><br />On a personal note, I encountered Tolkien's fiction in 1964 when it was published in paperback for the first time, after being published in hardcover originally between 1954 and 1956. So, I became engulfed in the world of Middle Earth during the second wave of popularity, the third being initiated by the impending release of director Peter Jackson's movie version of `Lord of the Rings'. This second wave was large, and it was instrumental in launching the popularity of many other `Sword and Sorcery' works, the greatest being the creation of the `Dungeons and Dragons' game in, I believe, 1971.<br /><br />Soon after the paperback `Hobbit' and `Lord of the Rings' came out, rumors started circulating about Tolkien's writing two more `trilogies' named `The Silmarillion' and `The Akallabeth'. The first was to deal with the tales of the high elves lead by Feanor and of the lost city of Gondolin. The second was to tell the story of Numenor, the great island awarded to the humans who assisted the elves in their war with Morgoth, an evil being who makes Sauron look like a second rate thug. When Tolkien died, the promise of these works stayed alive as it became known that Christopher Tolkien was editing his father's unpublished works. In the mid-1970's I happened to be working for a fellow Tolkien devotee and we both had high hopes for the publication of SOMETHING, while faint promises of a work appeared now and then in the periodicals about books.<br /><br />I can still remember the moment when `The Silmarillion' reached the bookstores, as I snatched it up as fast as my little VW Beetle wheels could carry me. In all honesty, I was just a little disappointed with what I read. The book is nothing less than a great mythic structure, giving the details of all the great events leading to the War of the Rings we know so well from `The Hobbit' and `The Lord of the Rings'.<br /><br />While the physical book is titled with the story of the Silmarils, three jewels created by Feanor, capturing the light of the two trees of Valinor before Morgoth poisoned them, it is really built of at least five different histories.<br /><br />The first is `Ainulindale', which has roughly the same relation to Tolkien's canon as the book of Genesis has to the Judeo-Christian bible. While it tells of the beginning of the world, it's story is a cross between Judaic and Greek mythology in that the mythology has multiple gods or `Holy Ones' in addition to `Eru, the One'. The second is `Valaquenta', the story of the Valar, very similar to the Olympian gods, with a hint of Norse mythology in that at least one of the Valar has a lot in common with Loki, the evil demiurge who bedeviled Thor and Odin. The third and longest part is `The Silmarillion' itself. These second and third sections each seem to have a slightly different version of the birth of the world, almost as if the elder Tolkien had written the tales at different times, without a close cross-referencing of his facts. This is not to say there are gross inconsistencies, only that some finer points are in one telling which are missing from the others. The anomaly is more in the overlapping than in any inconsistency.<br /><br />The Fourth section is `The Akallabeth' which tells of the origins and the ultimate downfall of the line of men who ultimately founded Gondor and who were the ancestors of Aragorn, the King of `Lord of the Rings'. This tells much of the geography of `the rest of the world' outside of Middle Earth. The Noldor were given a homeland island named Erissa which lay in sight of the `undying lands', the home of the Valar. The Edain, men who assisted the Noldor invanquishing Morgoth for the last time were given another island, Numenor, between Erissa and Middle Earth. Ultimately, Numenor went the way of Atlantis of Greek legend when Sauron corrupted the Numenorean kings. In punishment for their corruption, the Valar sank Numenor and a faction of uncorrupted survivors survived to found the kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor on the shores of Middle Earth.<br /><br />The last narrative section, `The Rings of Power and the Third Age' tells the story of Sauron, a mighty being whom Morgoth corrupted before his banishment from the world. There is a bit of this story in the appendices to `The Return of the King', but this tells the whole story behind the little poem which summarizes the one ring, the three rings for elves, the seven rings for dwarves, and the nine rings for men. It also tells of the origins of the white tree of Gondor and the seven palantiri, both of which get just the barest look-see in the films.<br /><br />After these narrative sections, there are genealogical tables, notes on elven languages, an index of names with a brief description of the referent of each name, and a map of Beleriand, the location of the action in `The Silmarillion'. The map is by Christopher, but very much in the style of senior Tolkien's great map of middle earth.<br /><br />The mythology in these sections is simply fantastic and the history leading up to the four main books goes far to enriching one's experience of those tales. The only thing I missed was a good background for Gandalf and the other wizards and my favorite Tom Bombadil. The stories in `The Silmarillion' fall flat in comparison to the tall tales of the original novels.<br /><br />If you love Tolkien's novels, buy this book.

Weak writing.	`Get Saucy' by food writer Grace Parisi is based on a really terrific idea and it has a great value as a multiplier of diversity in familiar dishes with relatively little effort spent learning new recipes. The biggest problem with the book is that this general subject of sauces has already been addressed by James Peterson's classic, award winning book `Sauces' which was so good and so popular, it warranted a second edition, something very uncommon in the world of cookbooks.<br /><br />Ms. Parisi's book would not suffer much in comparison with Peterson's work if Parisi had not gone too far in simplifying great classic recipes, possibly in the interests of making recipes easier for the amateur cook. But then, this means that you think you are getting a pedigreed dog when you are actually getting a half-breed. The best example I found of this is in the comparison of Parisi and Peterson's recipes for `beurre blanc', French for `white butter', a relatively simple, extremely useful sauce of butter flavored with shallots, wine, and vinegar. The great value of this sauce is that it is a relatively crude emulsion similar to a vinaigrette which can be whipped back into shape easily instead of going through a lot of high maintenance procedures to bring back mayonnaise or hollandaise. It is most notable in being the darling of `nouvelle cuisine' because it was much lighter than bechamel or veloute. I say all this to emphasize that cutting corners in the presentation of this sauce is a more serious shortcoming of this book than one may think.<br /><br />One can argue that while Peterson's book was written for professional cooks and Parisi's book has been written `for the rest of us', I will only recommend Parisi to those who simply want a quick and easy reference book for lots of common sauces which appear day in and day out in magazines, newspaper columns, and TV cooking shows. Having all these recipes in a single place with the added value of lots of cross references telling us what sauces are good for what dishes and ingredients. If you are a foodie or simply a serious amateur cook of any stripe, get James Peterson's book instead of this one.<br /><br />For example, Peterson spends four pages discussing `beurre blanc' versus Parisi's half page column. Where Parisi gives an abbreviated (incomplete) recipe, Peterson, after giving us the historical perspective on the sauce, gives the full recipe in six steps (versus three in Parisi) and detailed instructions on how to store leftover sauce, including tips on how leftovers can be used in future hollandaise or b&eacute;arnaise sauces. In the twice as long procedure for preparing the sauce, Peterson adds tips on what to look for to prevent bad things from happening, adds the butter over high heat rather than low for quicker incorporation, and adds checkpoints to taste the sauce for any needed adjustments. The most important step that Parisi leaves out entirely is the suggestion to strain the sauce before using. I have used `buerre blanc' both strained and unstrained and I am certain the strained version is superior, especially when entertaining. The bits of shallot remind one far too much of a vinaigrette and add little to the taste. Parisi would have done well to add this step as an option.<br /><br />Now such differences in a single recipe may seem a bit trivial for lowering the rating of a 440-page book that has genuine value and lots of high-powered blurbs on the back cover from Jacques Pepin and Bobby Flay. But I find minor annoying things on every other page. For example, I think the organization of chapters is poorly done. Why have a chapter for pasta sauces when you have separate chapters on tomato sauces and pestos?<br /><br />Other annoyances are based simply on the lack of skill used in the writing. In one sidebar on how to fix a broken hollandaise, I found two or three redundant expressions within two sentences. In another recipe, I was puzzled when the instructions had me puttingbutter in a microwave safe dish, with no instruction to put the dish in a microwave.<br /><br />I also found other recipes that are not as good as ones available in standard texts. Ms. Parisi's recipe for Puttanesca sauce takes 17 minutes of cooking time while what is essentially the same ingredients are cooked up within 10 minutes in the `Cooks illustrated' version in their `Italian Classics' book. Aside from being outrageously flavorful, Puttanesca's main claim to fame is the speed with which it can be made. So, Ms. Parisi certainly does not have `the best recipe'.<br /><br />In the long run, I think Ms. Parisi did an excellent job of collecting an amazingly comprehensive selection of sauce recipes that perform exactly the function she intends. That is, it multiplies the amateur cook's ability to vary dishes far beyond what can be offered by just another book of recipes. My only reservation is that the amateur needs to apply just a little critical judgment in applying sauces to dishes, and Ms. Parisi does provide the material with which to make good choices. I suspect Ms. Parisi and especially her copy editors may have been just a bit less careful than they should have in checking out English usage and recipe pedigrees. The very best thing this book could have included would have been a reference to each and every recipe to books that give more information and alternatives to Parisi's material.<br /><br />I will still recommend this book to people who just want a fast reference to sauces, dressings, stocks, and salsas.

225959:US	39134375	R31CCAHIY45MAI	0375507604	342065401	Amuse-Bouche: Little Bites Of Delight Before the Meal Begins	Books	5	136	145	N	Y	Great book for professionals and serious foodies.	`amuse-bouche' by Chicago Tru restaurant owner / chef Rick Tramonto is all about a newly trendy corner of French cuisine which arrive before the appetizer, are generally offered for free by the restaurant, and are `Little bites of food to amuse the mouth, invigorate the palate, whet the appetite...' as stated by author.<br /><br />The value of this book is based largely on the fact that, to my knowledge, there is no other book on the subject available in English which even addresses this subject, let alone does it as well as Sr. Tramonto. The primary value of `amuse-bouche' to the average amateur cook / entertainer is that it gives one the chance to present a small amount of relatively expensive ingredients such as caviar, truffles, foie gras, or sushi grade tuna in a dramatic setting. The dish has the added virtue of challenging the host's ingenuity in presenting these `little bites'.<br /><br />The disadvantages are that for a single bite of food, these dishes can be a lot of work. As Tramonto prepares them, there is a relatively large amount of pureeing, straining, blanching, grinding, mixing, and reducing going on to distill the ingredients into a powerful taste which has but one chance to make an impression. Compare to this the utterly simple composition of many antipasti, often based on nothing more than a joining of bread or cured ham or olives or fruit or cheese with one another, possibly with the addition of olive oil, a tapenade, or a pesto. The problem lies in the fact that the flavors and the presentation of the amuse-bouche must be exceptionally strong and unusual. The great tripod of antipasto flavors of salty plus oily plus bitter just doesn't cut it, if only because they are so familiar to experienced eaters already.<br /><br />For the professional chef, this book is probably one of the most interesting and useful they can get if they are interested in boosting the cachet of their restaurant. The book presents nine different types of dishes. These are:<br /><br />Soup. This is a type of bite where you get lots of bang for the effort you put into the preparation. On the one hand, almost all these soups are creamed, requiring lots of pureeing and straining, especially of ingredients that were not necessarily created to go easily through a strainer, such as the fibrous parts of asparagus. On the other hand, you get lots of economies of scale. With a single run through, you can make enough for eight or sixteen with the same effort as it takes to make one.<br /><br />Vegetables. These give more work per serving, as you have the job of creating both a sauce and a finely cut or grilled vegetable to lay on top of the sauce. Many are based on terrines which are easy for a trained chef, but which may be a bit much for the amateur.<br /><br />Pasta and Grain. The heavy lifting here comes from skills needed to pipe sauces into hollow pasta shapes. There almost seems like a special effort is being made to turn a frittata, a very easy dish, into something difficult, which, due to its small size, creates very few servings from a style of dish which is famous for creating easy tapas and antipastos.<br /><br />Fish and Seafood. This is probably a category where the strong tastes of the fresh ingredients will do most of the work for you. For most people, a single bite of raw tuna, nicely dressed for the evening, is about all they will want. But, even these get their share of aspics, flavored oils, and sauces, which are a breeze to whip up when you have a battalion of sous chefs.<br /><br />Meat and Poultry: The realm of forcemeats, mousses, foie gras, and cured hams. Many dishes familiar to fans of hors d'ourves everywhere.<br /><br />Forks and Spoons. More of a method of presentation than a class of ingredients. These recipes involve combining purees or soups with a spoon and long stringy things with a fork, or integrating the utensil into the presentation as the obvious means to eat the food.<br /><br />Juice. This may be thesimplest variety, as all you really need is a good juicer, the primary fruit or vegetable, and the appropriate spices.<br /><br />Foam. This is the land of the famous Spanish chef Ferran Adria of Barcelona. Having never actually used a foamer, I have no idea how hard it is. I saw Masaharu Morimoto use one on `Iron Chef America', but then he has probably done it a thousand times over, so he will make it look easy. I can tell from the recipes that in order to foam, you must first puree. No free lunch here!<br /><br />Sorbet. More specialized machines, as in order to create a decent sorbet, you need some kind of ice cream machine. Take my word for it, sticking sugary fruit juice in the freezer doesn't do it!<br /><br />The last chapter contains basic pantry recipes for intermediate ingredients such as stocks and flavored oils or tuiles and crackers to build presentations.<br /><br />I generally put little value on photographs in a cookbook, but in this case, they are essential. Half the value of spending all this time on a single bite is to load it up with all the bang you can muster, including dramatic presentations. These do not have to be expensive. I was particularly impressed by the one done using little paper cups commonly available at fast food outlets for condiments. I was also especially fond of the miniatures made to look like something else. Thomas Keller has based much of his reputation on such clever presentations. It is easy to miss, as it is done with light pastel lettering, but each dish is labeled by the best season for it's principal ingredients.<br /><br />I think this book is a must for chefs and foodies.

226526:US	39134375	R5U06OKR3FZS8	0743267222	638044481	Paula Deen & Friends	Books	5	4	15	N	Y	Inexpensive Resource for Southern Entertaining	`Paula Deen & Friends' by, you guessed it, Paula Deen and `Savannah Magazine' columnist, Martha Nesbit is Deen's fourth book, her first without the plastic many-fingered loose leaf format and her first for publisher Simon and Schuster. It is also the one with by far the largest `As Seen On food Network' logo of all recent publications by that cable channel's culinary stars.<br /><br />I really sort of miss the plastic binding, although Ms. Deen and her Simon & Schuster handlers seem to have kept the price of this volume down in spite of the fully sewn binding. This format really seemed to match the `church fund-raiser' flavor of her recipes.<br /><br />The premise of this book is Ms. Deen's statement that she loves to cook, and she loves to entertain, but she hates to plan parties. And, since she expects this attitude is not hers alone, she sets out to prepare for us 21 menus and their component recipes to relieve us of the task of putting together a lineup of dishes to fit these and similar occasions.<br /><br />The good news, and the bad news, is that these premises for parties are not your usual Thanksgiving, Christmas, Valentines Day, Easter, Fourth of July, occasions. There is at least one birthday menu and a New Years day menu, but all others are for events which you may never encounter, such as a bridge club supper, a tailgating party, a boss comes to dinner menu, a hunt (fox?) lunch in the field, a christening brunch, a Kentucky Derby party, and a christening brunch. Now obviously, a `bridge club supper' can be adapted to any number of different sit down dinner occasions, especially since, like all of Deen's recipes, none of the ingredients are very pricy.<br /><br />One complaint I have about the recipes in the menus is that none of them are scaled for a large number of people and in parties where one may expect a large number of people, the recipes are not scaled to the same number of people. Thus, in the `cooking shower', the Tomato Tarts makes 24 count, the shrimp and grits serves 4 as a main course, the fish serves four, the roasted new potatoes serves six to eight and the fresh fruit tart serves eight. I think it should not have been too difficult to scale all the recipes within a menu to the same number of people, and make that number appropriate to the type of occasion. On the other hand, each party menu includes six to eight dishes, which means that you can always leave one or two out if you are serving just four people. Similarly, this gives a nice variety to please a wide range of tastes if you are serving eight to twelve.<br /><br />Being a Mario Batali kind of cook, I am not especially fond of Martha Deen's brand of Southern recipes, as I always seem to find her dishes too sweet for my tastes. And, if I want to go ethnic, I always have my Pennsylvania Dutch style of sweet tooth cooking on which to fall. But I really happen to like her show on the Food Network and I think her style of cooking has a lot of appeal to a lot of people, and this book simply adds a new dimension of utility to her published recipes.<br /><br />Like all her earlier recipes, there are virtually no expensive ingredients used. The number of prepared foods in the recipes is relatively small and relatively unobjectionable. And, virtually all recipes are relatively straightforward, requiring few special appliances or techniques. There are some recipes that understandably do require a rather large number of ingredients, such as the recipe for gumbo. There are also some dessert recipes that are a bit involved, but most take all available shortcuts, such as the one for apple strudel. My Austro-Hungarian heritage forces me to point out that strudel dough is NOT the same as the Greek phylo dough used in Ms. Deen's recipe, but it will get the job done a lot more easily than a trip to Vienna for a crash course in strudel making. Note that the title of this book should make it clear that many of these recipes were created by Paula's friends andneighbors, to whom she gives ample credit in the Acknowledgments and headnotes.<br /><br />Part of the charm of a lot of cookbooks based on cooking in Italy, Provence, or Spain lies in the little stories that surround the recipes. It is easy to forget that just because Ms. Deen's terroir is close to home, she does not have some very heartwarming stories of her own.<br /><br />Paula Deen is your Down Home Savannah version of the more scholarly James Villas. And, it isn't exactly Martha Stewart either, but it's a darn good, darn cheap (far cheaper than Ina Garten's similar volume) bindle of suggestions for entertaining.friends and neighbors, to whom she gives ample credit in the Acknowledgments and headnotes. <br /> <br />Part of the charm of a lot of cookbooks based on cooking in Italy, Provence, or Spain lies in the little stories that surround the recipes.

228551:US	39134375	R29ETRG0JMHR3B	0385488416	563493339	Le Bernardin Cookbook: Four-Star Simplicity	Books	5	73	79	N	Y	One of the Best Seafood Restaurant Books	`Le Bernardin Cookbook' by highly regarded seafood chef Eric Ripert and restaurateur Maguy Le Coze (cofounder of the restaurant with her brother Gilbert) is the first case where I wished I could give a half a star. In many ways, it is a classic restaurant cookbook which is better than average in many ways, but I usually need a little more than `better than average' to give five stars. In comparison to Rob Feenie's `Lumiere' cookbook I reviewed yesterday, `Le Bernardin' exceeds expectations in the following ways:<br /><br />It is almost entirely a cookbook for all sorts of fish, based primarily on classic French recipes. This means that if you had a shelf of 100 famous restaurant cookbooks and wanted a recipe for fish, you could immediately go to either this book or Bob Kinkead's recent restaurant book, depending on whether you wanted something from Brittany or Baltimore. Oddly, this book also shares with the Kinkead book the fact that at least one recipe author (Bob Kinkead and Gilbert Le Coze) for each book was entirely self-taught.<br /><br />The story behind this book is about as endearing and as interesting as they come. `Le Bernardin' was originally opened in Paris by brother and sister Le Coze in 1972, after the siblings spend their early life together helping their parents run a struggling little restaurant on the coast of Brittany. After an initial splash and failure based on no experience, they ultimately succeeded in Paris. They followed this with opening the Manhattan restaurant in 1986, just as culinary consciousness in New York made it worth their while to open a restaurant which specialized in fish. All of this would be very ordinary if it were not for the incredible affection brother and sister had for one another, ended with the death of Gilbert at the age of forty-eight in 1994, just a year or two after hiring classically trained Eric Rippert as executive chef at the Manhattan restaurant.<br /><br />The recipes, many the creation of unschooled Gilbert, tend to be much more original than what you may find in the standard fish cookbooks by Mark Bittman, James Beard, and Alan Davidson. None of the classic bistro recipes for mussels (which you will find in Tony Bourdain's `Les Halles' book) are here. While some tend to the involved, fish recipes tend to be involved primarily in the preparation of stocks, nages, butter sauces and court bouillons. If you get the techniques for doing these things well, many of the recipes devolve into very simple preparations, befitting the generally fast cooking times for fish.<br /><br />Each recipe has a separate headnote from each author, and the counterpoint between them is almost worth the price of the book in itself. It is not uncommon for Madame Le Coze to really hate a recipe that Monsieur Rippert has just praised up and down the avenue. She usually comes around in the end, but the honesty is so unexpected that you start looking forward to contretemps in the next recipe dialogue.<br /><br />The recipes are organized in a very satisfactory way for a restaurant book on fish. The first chapter is an especially good collection of recipes for the basics. These are for the stocks, nages, butter sauces and court bouillons cited above. This is one of the few cookbooks I can thing of which includes a shrimp, lobster, and clam stock recipe. And, near and dear to my heart is the fact that the chicken stock recipe cooks for only three hours! The following eight chapters on fish dishes is just a little mixed, in that two chapters represent courses, `Salads' and `Appetizers' while six chapters represent the techniques `Raw Fish', `Poached and Steamed Fish', `Saut&eacute;ed Fish', `Roasted Fish', `Grilled Fish', and `Shellfish'. The penultimate chapter on `Big Parties' gives seven over the top recipes for entertaining, most giving eight servings rather than the usual four to six servings. The last chapter on desserts seems relatively long, giving 31 recipes, including three for basics suchas pastry cream, hazelnut-almond cream, ganache, and sweet pastry dough. With all the pastry books available, you will not be buying this book for the desserts, but it does add to the book's value. As usual, some of the dessert recipes are quite involved.<br /><br />There are no chapters or separate recipes for vegetables, as all the vegetable side dishes are included in the recipe for the seafood. This means many of the fish recipes may not be as complicated as they seem from their length if you removed the vegetable garnish, but that would take away the cachet of serving a dish as done at the great and famous Le Bernardin!<br /><br />Ultimately, this book deserves more than four stars because it is a restaurant cookbook that is more valuable than a source of instructive recipes to read. It has lots of great fish recipes that can be made by an amateur at home, as long as you have access to high quality ingredients. My only disappointment in reading the book is the feeling that there is simply no way I would be able to get the kind of fresh fish used by Le Bernardin unless I opened a restaurant in an Atlantic seaport.<br /><br />The mantra for this book that should be intoned as you look for a recipe is to respect the differences between the fishes. Things that work for skate will not work for tuna and vice versa. Respect the fish and you will be rewarded.as pastry cream, hazelnut-almond cream, ganache, and sweet pastry dough.

230234:US	39134375	R2CKJQJSE3UWID	1580083765	235530914	Lumiere	Books	4	6	9	N	Y	A decent book of good 'haute cuisine' restaurant dishes	`Lumiere', written by Rob Feenie on the recipes of his British Columbian restaurant of the same name is a competent write-up of the restaurant's great recipes, mostly invented by chef Feenie. This means that in spite of the great recipes, it is a mediocre cookbook for the rest of us.<br /><br />The book is very good if you happen to share the same seasons and produce of Vancouver and you happen to be a dedicated foodie who enjoys reproducing the dishes of great restaurants. Unfortunately, that is a relatively small population. The book should also appeal to those who are especially fond of seasonal eating, as the chapters of recipes are organized by season and by tasting menu.<br /><br />In some ways, this book is very similar to `The Arrows Cookbook' covering the cuisine of a seasonally oriented restaurant in Maine; however the Maine restaurateur / authors transcend their Restaurant cookbook genre by adding great material on their personal truck garden which produces most of the seasonal vegetables for the restaurant.<br /><br />While I am certain chef Feenie invented most of the savory recipes in the book, the Acknowledgments give us the sense that he had little to do with the writing of the book. As usual, there is the battalion of editors, book designers, and recipe testers, but there is also Marnie Coldham who assembled the recipes and adapted them for home preparation. There is also Nathan Fong who `whipped the manuscript into shape'. In addition to inventing most of the recipes, I suspect Feenie did little writing aside from the brief headnotes to each major recipe.<br /><br />Lumiere is very much of a `haute cuisine' restaurant, similar to Chicago's Tru and Charlie Trotter's and to Napa Valley's French Laundry. It seems to concentrate on fixed price tasting menus, of which there are three for each of the four seasons. All recipes in the book (except for the pantry items in the `Basics' chapter) are on one of these twelve tasting menus. One result is that the portion sizes for these recipes are relatively small. And, it strikes me that these are the perfect sort of recipes to use on `Iron Chef', as they give the judges just two or three bites so that at least four portions can be made from the materials usually needed for two conventional portions. And, lo and behold, Chef Feenie recently won his competition on `Iron Chef America' against the very formidable Masaharu Morimoto.<br /><br />When I saw that the Foreword to this book was written by Charlie Trotter, I suspected this would be an `Advertisement for Myself' kind of book with recipes similar to great 18th century furniture rather than the more immediately useful instructions for bookcases, Adirondacks chairs, and compost boxes. Feenie has learned much from Trotter and both are great chefs, but this is the kind of book which is much nicer to look at and read than to try to cook from, unless you happen to own a high end restaurant and don't mind a little recipe piracy now and then.<br /><br />To be perfectly clear, let me say that that not all recipes in this book are complicated and not all recipes include expensive ingredients or involved stocks, sauces, or glazes, but many do. For starters, many recipes include varieties of cheese of which I have never heard, and I have heard of a lot of cheeses. And, many of these cheeses are specifically made with raw milk. It also manages to use dried pasta shapes I have never heard of. Other unusual or expensive ingredients are ice wine (a Canadian speciality), poussin (very small chicken), feuillantine (Not even in the Larousse Gastronomique!!!), tobiko (flying fish roe), veal sweetbreads (thymus glands), black truffles (oh my).<br /><br />Certainly I am having just a little fun at Chef Feenie's expense, but I still find this book merely a `good' expensive restaurant cookbook and not a great one such as Thomas Keller's two weighty volumes. `The French Laundry Cookbook' went off the top of the scale for providing the aesthetic rationale behind tasting menus and the culinary rationale behind supporting local artisinal suppliers. At best, Feenie is saying `I can do that too'. Similarly, `Bouchon' ranks high as a reference on recipes for high-end bistro cuisine dishes. Feenie doesn't seem to have any such terroir anchor, as he uses ingredients from around the world. He avoids olive oils (which carry hints of their birthplace) by replacing them with the very bland grapeseed oils, but he calls for things such as fresh Roquefort cheeses, which must come from France. Not exactly in the Vancouver terroir. It is almost funny to see Yukon Gold potatoes crop up in every other recipe as the starch of choice. Certainly a strong advertisement for the gourmet cachet of these Canadian spuds.<br /><br />The use of grapeseed oil is certainly an interesting change, after having read hundreds of books on Mediterranean cooking sopping with olive oil, it's almost refreshing to find an oil based cuisine which does not use olive oil. He also uses lots of butter, as befitting his northern French influences.<br /><br />At $35, you will not feel cheated if you buy this book and you know what to expect. The recipes are interesting, the section on Basics has lots of good recipes for glazes and infused oils, and the dishes have plenty of `Wow' factor if you use them to entertain. It just does not have a lot of value outside the world of professional chefs and foodies.<br /><br />Recommended with reservations.ng the aesthetic rationale behind tasting menus and the culinary rationale behind supporting local artisinal suppliers.

Buy it!	`Simple to Spectacular' is the second of two collaborations by the dynamic duo of chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten and New York Times columnist and cookbook writer, Mark Bittman. The first, `Cooking at Home with chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten' is very good. This book is even better. To my seven (7) categories of modern cookbooks, I would add an eighth category for this and a select few other books such as Tom Colicchio's `How to Think Like a Chef', Paul Bertolli's `Cooking by Hand', and `Jeremiah Tower Cooks'. These are all `master class' texts on cooking techniques. If cooking is not your hobby or you are not a professional cook, your money would probably be much better spend on one of the `big' cookbooks such as the `Joy of Cooking' or on books by one of the fast cooking gurus such as Rachael Ray.<br /><br />I have often thought that learning cooking is a lot like learning chess. There are lots of general strategies and tips, but you really cannot master the game until you actually play lots of games and see how the strategies play out in many different situations. One of the cleverest techniques for teaching chess is the method of playing through successively more difficult games in which the same rule(s) are applied with increasing sophistication. This book promises to do exactly the same thing with cooking, per its subtitle, `How to Take One Basic Recipe to Four Levels of Sophistication'.<br /><br />One of the very few disappointments in this book is that it doesn't really follow this agenda. For each recipe title, it certainly begins with a very simple example and at least one of the later recipes certainly is more complicated with more expensive ingredients, but in practically no cases is there a clearly defined progression where the later recipe simply adds either ingredients or techniques to the earlier, simpler recipe. But this is simply not a big thing, as recipes, like chess game paradigms, simply do not evolve linearly. Another inconsequential deviation from the advertised plan is that there are often more than four variations on the same recipe and sometimes as many as six.<br /><br />One of the unadvertised virtues of this book is that many of the most basic preparations are amazingly simple, and this is from a very important French influenced chef. Two of my favorite examples are the recipes for quick chicken stock and the `Best scrambled eggs' recipe.<br /><br />I concede that many expert chefs, including those who teach other chefs recommend very long simmer times for their chicken stocks. In this book, Vongerichten and Bittman are recommending a single hour's cooking, using easily acquired chicken legs and just a few common vegetables, with practically no knife work. I am certain that a stock simmered for 12 hours may have some virtues that a one hour stock does not have, especially in the amount of gelatin picked up from the connective tissues, but you got to love this express recipe.<br /><br />Similarly, some people such as James Beard have given us recipes for scrambled eggs done in double boilers which, according to our authors, can take up to 40 minutes to complete. Now, having done Beard's recipe myself, I know his method is less prone to error and is probably great if you are cooking for a dozen people, but the Vongerichten/Bittman recipe will have your pillowy soft scrambled eggs on the table in 10 minutes flat. If you never quite understood the difference between scrambled eggs and omelets, this book is worth its price for these recipes alone. After the plain eggs comes a recipe for eggs with tomato and basil, eggs with cream cheese, smoked salmon and sorrel, eggs with crispy potatoes and prosciutto, and eggs with caviar.<br /><br />In addition to the section on `Eggs, Crepes, and Savory Tarts', there is are chapters on:<br /><br />Soups, with variations on squash soup and gazpacho.<br /><br />Salads, with variations on Frisee and Mesclun salads.<br /><br />Pasta, Noodles, and Rice with variations onfresh pasta, cannelloni, sauces, spaetzle and sticky rice.<br /><br />Vegetables, with variations on stuffed tomatoes, mashed potatoes, saut&eacute;ed veggies, and tomato confit.<br /><br />Seafood, with halibut, slow cooked salmon, red snapper, beurre noisette, raw tuna, shrimp, and poached lobster.<br /><br />Poultry, with roast chicken and saut&eacute;ed chicken.<br /><br />Meat, with steak dishes, braised ribs, veal stew, roasted pork, venison and rabbit<br /><br />Seasonings and sauces, which is simply the typical chapter on pantry preparations.<br /><br />Desserts, with sorbet, ice cream, cr&egrave;me brulee, poached pears, and tarts.<br /><br />Except for the recipes of rabbit and venison and the occasional caviar and foie gras, virtually all of these recipes are for dishes which are popular today and which the casual Food Network / Public Television / Today Show TV chef audience would be more than happy to try and wish to learn how to do better and with more variations. Some may argue that spaetzle is just a little obscure, but it happens to be very similar to gnocchi, and even easier to make, as long as you have the right kind of collander or spaetzle maker.<br /><br /> I have heard Ina Garten and some others say that all you really need are to know about a dozen recipes well. I disagree with this number. If I repeat any dish more than once a month or even repeat an ingredient (other than for breakfast) more than once a week, I get complaints. The only dinner exceptions to this rule are for corn and tomatoes when they are in season locally. Therefore, this book is a really great source of recipes that are easy, popular, and highly adaptable.<br /><br />While I am not a professional dietitian or nutritionist, my sense is that the recipes are also extraordinarily healthy. A perfect example is the egg, smoked salmon, and cream cheese recipe used to replace the high carb, high calorie bagel, lox, and cream cheese.<br /><br />This book is easily among my top five favorite cookbooks for foodies.fresh pasta, cannelloni, sauces, spaetzle and sticky rice.<br /><br />Vegetables, with variations on stuffed tomatoes, mashed potatoes, saut&eacute;ed veggies, and tomato confit.<br /><br />Seafood, with halibut, slow cooked salmon, red snapper, beurre noisette, raw tuna, shrimp, and poached lobster.<br /><br />Poultry, with roast chicken and saut&eacute;ed chicken.<br /><br />Meat, with steak dishes, braised ribs, veal stew, roasted pork, venison and rabbit<br /><br />Seasonings and sauces, which is simply the typical chapter on pantry preparations.<br /><br />Desserts, with sorbet, ice cream, cr&egrave;me brulee, poached pears, and tarts.<br /><br />Except for the recipes of rabbit and venison and the occasional caviar and foie gras, virtually all of these recipes are for dishes which are popular today and which the casual Food Network / Public Television / Today Show TV chef audience would be more than happy to try and wish to learn how to do better and with more variations.

231625:US	39134375	R13LNJQKRO3JTP	0743272722	965746770	Bobby Flay's Grilling For Life	Books	4	48	56	N	Y	Flay's Grilling for Healthy Living. Very Good but not Great.	`Grilling for Life' is the second Bobby Flay book I have reviewed and it is very similar to his last book. Like `Boy Gets Grill', it is relatively short at only 75 recipes to the earlier book's 125. It is correspondingly less expensive than similar celebrity cookbooks. At a list price of $22, it is worth about 120 recipes if it were priced at the celeb cookbook median of $35. The theme of the book is highlighted by a nutritional analysis of all the recipes plus a selection of recipes that naturally avoid empty calories, saturated fat, and excess sodium.<br /><br />In addition to the low recipe count, you also get the budget treatment from the photography, which is almost entirely in black and white and almost entirely of small amateur looking snapshots of Bobby at the grill. The book has none of the insider culinary wisdom I have seen in my last two reviewed books written by chefs (Gordon Ramsay and Michael Schlow). On the other side of the coin, Bobby does give us some very nice, no nonsense introductory chapters on basic grilling equipment; cooking to safe meat temperatures; herbs, spices, and chiles; flavorings; and basic grilling how-tos. All of these sections are done in the confident style of someone who knows what he is talking about and without a trace of doubt. This is in spite of at least one egregious error that probably has Alton Brown cringing in his `Iron Chef America' anchor chair at his colleague's scientific gaff. The error was in Bobby's correctly rejecting an artificial sweetener for the very wrong reason that it contained chlorine. Just two pages later, Bobby sings to the importance and varieties of table salt, which is half chlorine and half sodium, an explosive metal!<br /><br />Flay repeats one really great feature from his earlier book when he gives the titles of each and every recipe in his table of contents. He also repeats his appendix of Internet sources.<br /><br />The overriding raison d'être of this book is to give us nutritionally sensible recipes, ideally to replace all the high saturated fat, high sugar recipes in all the world's previous grilling recipes. And, the nutritional analysis is done by a professional dietitian, Joy Bauer, who oddly, is not given author's crediting, only the honor of writing the foreword.<br /><br />One very good thing about the book's nutritional strategy is that it does not follow any one-diet plan. Rather, it gives you all the facts you need to have about the amount of total fats, saturated fats, cholesterol, carbohydrates, sugar, protein, sodium, fiber, and total calories. Thus, you pick your regimen and look for the recipes that fit that regimen, be it low carb, low fat, high fiber, or low calorie. The problem is that in order to find the recipes that best fit your lifestyle, you have to be pretty sophisticated about nutrition. For example, is 410 milligrams of sodium a lot or a little? It seems like a big number, yet a milligram is a very, very small amount. The same recipe shows 30 grams of fat, which seems like a small number, except that a gram is 1000 times larger than a milligram. The blocks of nutritional analyses would have been just a little more useful if they would have included the minimum daily requirements for a middle aged person of slightly higher than normal weight. A similar service would have been to give a nutritional summary for the party menus at the end of the book, summing up all the statistics for the various dishes in the menus. A third nutritional service the book overlooks is to provide a good moderate calorie / low carb barbecue sauce. In the index, there is no reference to any recipe for barbecue sauce at all. A fourth idea would have been to give a cross reference of recipes by type of diet, whether low fat, low calorie, low carb, or vegetarian.<br /><br />Bobby's general outlook on healthy eating is the same as mine and the same as Rachael Ray's point of view in her latest book, '30 Minute Get Real Meals'. That is, avoid empty calories and eat reasonably sized portions. Bobby (and Rachael) both avoid extreme products such as 0 fat imitation cheeses and other dairy products. This is important not only because non-fat dairy (and many dairy imitation products such as margarine) simply do not behave the same as the real thing when baked or saut&eacute;ed. Like Bobby, I also like to avoid the synthetic weight loss foods as you can never tell what some of the many chemicals put into the mix will do to you over time. We learned our lesson on margarine and transfats. I'll stick to moderate amounts of real butter and vegetable oils and go easy on other animal fats.<br /><br />So why provide all the statistics when the objective would have been served by portion sizing, replacing white bread with lettuce wraps and whole grain flatbreads, and avoiding transfat sources. As I said above, these numbers are still useful if either carbohydrate or protein or fat content is important to your regimen.<br /><br />As far as the recipes go, they are all classic Flay, with lots of strong flavors from chiles, cilantro, garlic and onions, vinegars, ginger, fresh herbs, and strongly flavored cheeses. There are a few grill friendly recipes such as cole slaw that are not actually grilled, but the large majority of the recipes have one or more grilled ingredients. Flay keeps the recipe selection on the healthy side by using lots of vegetable recipes (15), seafood recipes (26), and poultry recipes (11). That's over 2/3 of the recipes right there. There are only 16 four hoofed meat recipes and 8 drink and dessert recipes to round out the count. In addition to the selection, I really like the very simple organization into basic ingredients. All this really fits Bobby's `no nonsense American boy made good in the kitchen' persona.<br /><br />Recommended to health conscience grilling enthusiasts.empty calories and eat reasonably sized portions.

232828:US	39134375	R2IJO741U77L7N	0764588346	533290989	In The Heat Of The Kitchen	Books	5	149	168	N	Y	Artfully organized and carefully described recipes. Buy it!	`In the Heat of the Kitchen' by London chef Gordon Ramsay, the host of a Fox TV culinary show, `Hell's Kitchen', which I have not had the pleasure of seeing. Ramsay is the partner and executive chef for three restaurants in and around London and his writing is entirely different than his two countrymen, Jamie Oliver and Nigella Lawson. Both Oliver and Ramsay are professionals down to the tips of their asbestos-conditioned fingers, but where Oliver revels in simple dishes a la River Caf&eacute; and the Mediterranean cuisines, Ramsay is very much a French influenced chef.<br /><br />Before I get too far afield, I must say I think this is an excellent book on cooking, even if some of the recipes may be just a bit impractical for the casual amateur cook.<br /><br />To explain, cookbooks can be divided into at least seven different categories and the criteria for judging a book depends on the category into which it falls. There are:<br /><br />Textbooks such as the CIA's `New Professional Chef' and Jacques Pepin's `Complete Techniques'<br /><br />Great Collections such as the `Joy of Cooking' and `James Beard's American Cookery'<br /><br />National or Regional Cuisine Collections such as Julia Child's `Mastering the Art of French Cooking'<br /><br />Restaurant `haute cuisine' such as Joel Robuchon's `Simply French' and Thomas Keller's books.<br /><br />Entertaining cookbooks such as Martha Stewart's classic `Entertaining' and Gourmet magazine books<br /><br />Special Subjects such as Alice Waters' `Chez Panisse Fruits' or Rachael Ray's '30 Minute Meal' books<br /><br />Moneymaking Cookbooks promoting a person or an organization. Local fundraising cookbooks and non-chef (Patti LaBelle, Al Roker, etc) books fall into this category.<br /><br />Celebrity Chef / Restaurant cookbooks from people such as Emeril Lagasse, Tyler Florence, Jamie Oliver, Rocco DiSpirito, and dozens of others.<br /><br />The last category generally provides value by including the virtues of at least one or more of the other major categories added the cachet obtained by being able to say you are cooking a recipe from Babbo or Caf&eacute; Boulud or Lespanisse or Sara Moulton or Ina Garten.<br /><br />Ramsay's book is certainly a member of this last category with a strong grounding in the `haute cuisine' category. Ramsay makes no pretensions that his dishes are easy to make. His primary influence is clearly French and Spanish, primarily Catalan (Barcelona) techniques plus the rich range of American ingredients. His book is the perfect example of the kind you would want in a library by your best armchair, where you want to read it carefully for ideas in creating your own recipes. The first thing which comes to mind as I read the book is Bob Kinkead's statement that he owns about 1200 cookbooks, but he has never followed the recipe in any of them, step for step. Rather, he reads and `digests' their ideas that become ideas he puts into his own recipes.<br /><br />The first thing I like about Ramsay's book is that it has chapters based on ingredients. I have seen several books recently with all sorts of whiz-bang chapter titles that mean practically nothing when you pull the book off your shelves and glance at the table of contents. Some of these books are good, but their organization is not to their credit.<br /><br />Ramsay's chapters are:<br /><br />Shellfish, with an emphasis on American blue crabs plus oysters, clams, langoustines, and scallops.<br /><br />Fish, with red mullet, cod salmon, tuna and a few unusual species such as skate and monkfish.<br /><br />Poultry and Game Birds, where he addresses the perennial question of how to deal with different cooking times for white and dark meat. I recommend you give his solution a try when roasting chicken.<br /><br />Meat, with a very nice selection of recipes for braised pork, filet mignon, stuffed roast lamb, tomatoes stuffed with chili, veal and foie gras, and a new perspective on sauteeing calves liver.<br /><br/>Pasta and Rice, with an emphasis on risottos, stuffed pastas, and spatzle (German pasta / dumplings)<br /><br />Vegetables, with several recipes for soups and salads. First time I've seen a fondue of lettuce!<br /><br />Eggs, one of my very favorite subjects, which Ramsay does to a tee. Perfect omelet and fried egg recipes. Since all recipes are organized by primary ingredient, many of the dessert recipes fall in this egg chapter and the following chapter on fruits.<br /><br />Fruit with sorbets, sherbets, gelatins, walnut cake, great pain perdu (French toast) with peaches and berry kebabs.<br /><br />Flour, with breads, pastries, and cakes. I invariably give good scores to general cookbooks that have a good chapter on interesting bread baking. While his nibs Jamie Oliver does the easy Italian stuffed breads, Ramsay goes for things a bit more complicated but more interesting with a great sun-dried tomato fougasse (French for focaccia) plus a very nice recipe for a vanilla flavored pate sucree. Unlike the flaky style of pastry Americans use for pies where the butter must stay cold and the dough must be handled with kid gloves, this dough is less delicate and fussy.<br /><br />The last chapter on stocks, sauces, and dressings has all the usual stuff, including a very nicely simple recipe for chicken stock. I really respect those who simmer their stock for half a day or overnight, but I personally prefer this simpler three-hour recipe.<br /><br />Ramsay has a reputation for being very demanding in the kitchen, and his recipes benefit from his eye for detail. Many recipes are easily within the amateur's abilities and while there are a few which need more expensive and rare ingredients, you can trust that Ramsay is giving you some of the very best techniques for dealing with them, as he is for his egg and flour recipes.<br /><br />This is an excellent book for cookbook readers and people who like to perfect simple dishes and try their hand at dishes that are both classic and just a bit unusual.<br /><br />Very highly recommended.fed pastas, and spatzle (German pasta / dumplings) <br />Vegetables, with several recipes for soups and salads.

The author's credentials are good enough so that it brings into question some of those very criteria, and leads me to high recommendation for the book in spite of myself.<br /><br />For starters, the book does not follow through on its major promise as signaled by the title. The title and introduction suggest that this book will give us a totally new point of view on time and cooking, in somewhat the same way Alton Brown looked at all cooking methods as different ways of applying heat. Time is an only casually applied theme in that some of the chapters focus on dishes, which can be done either very quickly (within the familiar 30 minutes), or which take a very long time. In the absence of strongly positive qualities in other areas, failing to follow through on your major stated premise is usually a sure demotion from five to four stars.<br /><br />As luck would have it, recently crowned best chef in the country (James Beard Awards, 2005) saves the day in his foreword when he points out the truly distinctive and unusual aspect of Schlow's cooking. Unlike restaurants around the world, including Mario's hot spots, Schlow uses a low heat oven, with 300 degrees Fahrenheit as his norm rather than the more usual home temperature of 350 degrees or the blistering inferno found in restaurant kitchens. I have often questioned Mario's love of blisteringly hot saute pans for many dishes especially for inexperienced cooks who can have the saute ingredients go from hot to charcoal in a heartbeat if you are not paying close attention to what you are doing. And, if you are inexperienced, you don't always know to what to pay attention! Thus, I am enthusiastic to see another well-credentialed advocate (along with Tom Colicchio) of moderate temperatures for various cooking techniques. Schlow does often use high saute temperatures and I agree that there are many cases where this is important, but with the promise of high success comes high risk. Happily, Schlow comes to the rescue near the end of the book when he says that you will simply not get dishes right the first time all the time. Something may always go wrong. But keep at it and learn from your mistakes.<br /><br />Another area where Schlow violated one of my key criteria is in his very long cooking stock recipes. On the one hand, I have seen good books on home cooking techniques create very good stocks with about three (3) hours of cooking. I have also seen restaurant chefs call for ten to twelve hours of stock cooking. For home cooking, I definitely prefer the shorter times, but in this case, I will bow to chef Schlow's opinion, with reservations.<br /><br />The thing that sells me on Schlow's recipes in general is the fact that they are exceptionally well written. I have found more good new cooking tips in this book than I have in the last several dozen I have reviewed. And this is without a single mistake that I can find. As I became more and more impressed at the care and level of detail applied to the cooking methods, without resorting to very many exotic ingredients, I discovered Schlow's inspiration to be the collaboration of Patricia Wells and Joel Robuchon on the book `Simply French', which I reviewed and found to be a true paradigm of a good restaurant cookbook. And, my reasons were the same as those cited by Schlow, in that Robuchon's attention to detail is better than any I have seen, with the possible exception of Thomas Keller.<br /><br />The single best recommendation for this book for novice cooks is the same thing I like about Jamie Oliver's books. Both authors have a truly infectious enthusiasm for cooking and both are able to make that enthusiasm jump off the printed page and into your psyche. And, Schlow and his team have been able to do this without some of Oliver's misdirected typographical pyrotechnics on his printed pages. In fact, Schlow has had his photography done by Shimon & Tammar, the leading culinary photographic team in the business.<br /><br />The very high quality of the recipe writing and the infectious enthusiasm are more than enough to overcome any objections to this book and its somewhat high price per recipe. This is really a super book for beginners. I would suggest this volume immediately after reading a good introductory text such as the Alton Brown opus cited above `I'm Just Here for the Food' or Anne Willan's `The Good Cook'.<br /><br />If the recipes in this book were not of such a high quality or if I found some factual errors in this book, the organization of the chapters would annoy me, as they are organized by occasion rather than by major ingredient or course. In fact, this organization is the one aspect of the book which is consistent with the title and theme of time, in that the first chapter (`Time to Eat and Now') is about fast cooking and the last chapter is about spending the day in the kitchen (`Time to Celebrate'). But, if you need something to spark your creative cooking juices, this book will provide the inspiration.<br /><br />The book also provides one last thing I expect in a professional chef's writing, which is some insight into professional cooking practice or the inspiration that brought the author to cooking. The book provides a little of both, with a glimpse at the kind of networking between leading chefs which makes the culinary world go around.<br /><br />On a par with Colicchio and Stitt and Kinkead and O'Connell.

Not for the Novice Mexican	`My Mexico' by leading authority on Mexican food, Diana Kennedy is her eighth book, seven of which are on Mexican cuisine. This easily puts her in the forefront of writers on national cuisines, along with Julia Child, Penelope Casas, Marcella Hazan, and Diane Kochilas. It even puts her ahead of the very well known writer, educator, and Chicago restaurateur, Rick Bayless, who has paltry four books on Mexican food to his credit.<br /><br />I have reviewed Ms. Kennedy's ninth book, `From My Mexican Kitchen', which I consider a real gem among treatises on the techniques of national cuisines. It goes into various techniques, especially baking, on which Ms. Kennedy is a certifiable expert, to a level of detail that one rarely sees in other books. The current book under consideration is much different from the later volume and should expect to find a much narrower audience.<br /><br />`My Mexico' is a personal culinary diary, with echos of a John Steinbeck `Travels With Charley' air about it. Like many other culinary surveys, it is organized by Mexican province rather than by type of dish. And, unlike Ms. Casas' excellent `Delicioso!' culinary geography of Spain, with lots of interesting summaries of characteristics of the various regions, Ms. Kennedy is purely the tourist in this book, dwelling on the specific people and places and dishes she encounters in her travels throughout Mexico.<br /><br />As an aside, I will add the opinion that Ms. Kennedy seems to find much ugliness in the urban development, congestion, lack of good highways, and disappearance of natural beauty in her beloved Mexico. The recitation of changes she finds distasteful make one wonder how her affection for the country survives the uncontrolled and somewhat corrupt development in Mexico. But then, she talks about the food and all seems forgiven.<br /><br />As someone who is not nearly as familiar with Mexico as I have come to be of Italy, France, Germany, or England, the first thing I miss is a good map. This absence is especially noisome as this is about culinary geography, regardless of how personal. The second thing I miss is a listing of recipes by type of dish. As all recipes in the text are located by region or state, many of whose names are unknown to me, a listing by primary ingredient or course in the style of most cookbooks would make this book much more valuable to the novice to Mexican food. The book does include an alphabetical listing of recipes, but since it is alphabetical by Spanish name, it doesn't do me much good. I can barely find my way around culinary Italian, let alone Spanish. My study of German does little good in the largely Latin world of culinary diversity.<br /><br />This is the kind of book that will be enjoyed primarily by people who already know and love Mexico. I get the picture of such readers being hobbits at Bilbo Baggins 111th birthday party with their feet up on the table and nibbling to fill in the odd, empty corners of their generous stomachs. This is the book for people who would not learn much from yet another book of familiar Mexican recipes. I would get pleasure out of a similar book on German or Austrian cuisine as I have been to many places in Germany and I believe there are not enough books concentrating on Austro-Hungarian cuisine.<br /><br />Ending on a positive note, I relish the discovery in this book of a culinary treatment of cuitlacoche (on page 456), the fungus that grows on corn and which I understand it is a great delicacy in Mexico. I have been familiar with this foul looking stuff for many years, but I first encountered its culinary interest on the very first Food Network `Iron Chef America' show pitting Bobby Flay against Sr. Bayless of Frontera Grill. I was really rooting for Bayless, who lost by a single point to Flay, and I was left wondering, with Alton Brown, who was the brave soul who first looked at the stuff as something good to eat. Well, Ms. Kennedy fills us in on the subject.<br /><br />Highly recommended for all who can't get enough of books about Mexican food. For all other, check out Ms. Kennedy's other books./> <br />Highly recommended for all who can't get enough of books about Mexican food.

I bought this book before I was very familiar with Ms. Scicolone's abilities and track record as an Italian recipe writer, so I tended to dismiss it as bargain table fodder. But now, in looking back at my unreviewed backlist, I find this volume is something of a buried treasure.<br /><br />Scicolone has most recently made a big splash in the Italian cookbook world with her 1000 Italian Recipes book, another highly formulaic volume that I still found very worthy alongside the heavyweights of Italian cookbook writing such as Bastianich, Hazan, and Bugialli. I did compare some recipes in this volume to Mario Batali's latest, `Molto Italy' and found the newly crowned (2005 James Beard Awards) best chef in the country to have the advantage on Ms. Scicolone's 1000 recipes in interest and in quality of procedure.<br /><br />I have done a similar comparison of our volume `Savoring Italy' to the encyclopedic `1000 Italian Recipes' and find a similar result. For starters, I looked for six different recipes from `Savoring Italy' in the larger book and found only two with exactly the same Italian name. Two of the six had similar recipes in the two books. Two of the recipes in `Savoring Italy' had no close counterparts in `1000 Italian Recipes'.<br /><br />What is more interesting is that where the recipes had the same or a similar name, the ingredients and procedure in `Savoring Italy' were always more elaborate than the corresponding recipe in `1000 Italian Recipes'. For example, `1000 Italian Recipes' has a recipe for stuffed beef rolls in tomato sauce (`Braciole al Pomodoro') with eight ingredients while `Savoring Italy' has a similar English named dish (`Braciole di Manzo') which has twelve ingredients, adding prosciutto, pine nuts, raisins, and parsley, and substituting Provolone cheese for Pecorino Romano. I see similarly more elaborate treatments for all the recipes I check, including such classics as Caponata. Oddly, while `1000 Italian Recipes' salts the eggplant in its caponata recipe, `Savoring Italy' does not. Like Joel Robuchon (actually, because of Joel Robuchon's statements), I prefer avoiding the eggplant salting and prefer to look for younger fruits to avoid the bitterness of older produce.<br /><br />I take issue with the reviewer who says these are simple recipes. Compared even to Scicolone's major reference book, they are more complicated.<br /><br />So, on the recipe front, the big picture book is a totally worthy addition for anyone who happens to collect Italian cookbooks, or happens to like big, glossy culinary books in general.<br /><br />I am not a very good critic of photography, but my gut feeling about the pics in this book is that they are above average, but not of the very highest quality. The only real technical issue I saw was that inside shots seemed a bit grainy compared to those done in full outdoor sunlight. But, for a book retailing at a smidge below $40, they are pretty good. Their selection of subjects was equally good, in that it did not concentrate too much on the very familiar and avoided the `been there, done that' feeling. My biggest issue with the pics is that there are several on the early pages of the book which have no captions. A naïve eye could put some of the pictures anywhere from California to Greece.<br /><br />The book has the obligatory culinary map of Italy with provinces and major cities identified by name among all the cute little produce icons. The non-recipe text is good, but has little which is revealing to anyone who has read much of Italian cuisine, or spent more than a few months watching `Molto Mario' and `Mario Eats Italy' on the Food Network. If you want a good overview of Italian regional cuisines, see Claudia Roden's `The Food of Italy, Region by Region' or Waverly Root's `The Food of Italy'.<br /><br />The glossary on stock foods and wines of Italy is good, but typical of short treatments. It is good for the casual reader, but not all there for the foodie or professional. The edge this has over some other books is that it contains thumbnail instructions on how to make and or prepare things such as breadcrumbs, beans, and anchovies.<br /><br />This book is all about the sum of its parts. The recipes are probably more lavish than you will fine on Nonna's dinner table. These are the more celebratory versions of classic recipes, saved for special occasions or served at upscale restorantes. But this format calls for lavish dishes to match the oversize scale of the pages and the photographs.<br /><br />Bottom line is that this book is worth its salt. So, if you are looking for a big, expensive Italian cookbook with evocative pictures and good frills, this one will give you your money's worth.he Food of Italy'.<br /><br />The glossary on stock foods and wines of Italy is good, but typical of short treatments.

237283:US	39134375	R1MTLFUNT3XVOJ	2080304720	630052137	Gourmet Shops of Paris: An Epicurean Tour	Books	5	48	48	N	Y	A very moveable feast.	`Gourmet Shops of Paris', translated from the French written by Pierre Rival and Christian Sarramon is a high end oversize book which is almost as sweet and luscious as the comestibles on which it dotes. This is a foodie's travel guide to Paris, with photos which are just rich enough to make you want to get on to your favorite ticket vendor and book a flight to Paris. It especially makes you wish your passport were up to date, if it has been collecting dust for more than 10 years.<br /><br />The $40 American list price may be just a little pricy, raising the risk of landing the book on the discount table at Borders and Barnes and Noble, but if you do find it well priced by Amazon and you like food, I strongly recommend you acquire a copy. This is especially true if you happen to do high end entertaining, but more on that later. As far as I can see, the translation is transparent, offering no impediment to appreciating the book.<br /><br />The book is divided into four main categories.<br /><br />The first is `Sweet Paris', which is further divided into sections on `Confectionery and Chocolates', `Cakes Large and Small', and `Tea and Coffee'. The first of these three parts claims that while Paris is coming to the game late, behind major players such as Belgium, Switzerland, Italy, and Spain, it is becoming one of the world leaders in creativity in chocolate, plus a dealer or two who goes so far as to actually manufacture their own chocolate in house from the beans rather than depending on chocolate processed by the big dealers such as Vahlrona or Callibut. I give strong credence to this Paris boosting, as it agrees with Mort Rosenblum's assessment of French chocolatiers in his recent book, `Chocolate'.<br /><br />The second is `Savory Paris', divided into `Bread and Cheese' and `Fine Food Stores'. Bread and cheese are easily products for which France can claim world primacy. And, some of the very best bread bakers are certainly in Paris. The most famous is Poilane, who has been featured in more than one Food Network show. Their flagship product is a giant 4.2 pound boule with their initial emblazoned in the crust. If all this were not enough to run to the Internet for plane tickets, there is the section on fine food stores. I confess none of them looks quite as fully stocked as Zabar's in Manhattan or the Harrah's food court in the London department store, but the cachet is impeccable (If the lure of the pictures is stronger than your pocketbook, you can get a fix of continental food by visiting De Palo's in Manhattan's Little Italy).<br /><br />The third section is `Paris in a Glass', covering some of the leading wine merchants in the city. While I suspect that New York City may have specialist wine merchants, I doubt that you will find as great a variety of specialties anywhere in the world to surpass the variety in Paris. What is even better, Paris offers vendors who offer tastings of great wines so you can get a sip of an expensive vintage without breaking your bank account.<br /><br />The fourth section, `Small Snacks' starts off with the fact that the first major restaurant item in Paris starting around 1765 was the serving of soups. This trend became `bouillons' or shops specializing in soups. This trend seems to be the French speciality paralleling the tapas of Spain and the Mezes of Greece. This reinforces the notion that if you want to learn soup making, concentrate on learning French culinary methods. Unlike almost all the other establishments pictured in other sections, many of the soup and snack outlets in this section have a hypermodern design.<br /><br />One is almost surprised that the book stops at this point. Where are the brassieres? Where are the bistros? Where are the Michelin rated restaurants? There is a sense in the title of the book that this is about `walk-in' establishments, but you almost wish they would have gone one step more, but then, that is probably more than enough material for another book.<br /><br />Any disappointment felt at not seeing the inside of a name brasserie disappears when you get to the last section, `The Gourmet's Notebook'. Hock the ticket you just ordered and get onto the Internet, because this section gives the Internet addresses of all the shops covered in the book, with the means of ordering from these shops. Just imagine the impression you can make at a party when you serve bread, petit fours, olive oil, and preserves from shops in Paris! It makes you think that someone could really make a go of a store featuring these items locally at a reasonable discount.<br /><br />I think this book is absolutely essential if you are a foodie who has any plans to visit Paris in the next five years. Even if you are a stay at home foodie, this gives you lots of ideas of what to look for if you happen to go to New York, Atlanta, Chicago, New Orleans, Las Vegas, or San Francisco.<br /><br />Personally, I think Air France should give this book away, but look for it at a good price and you will be rewarded. It is an especially good source for anyone interested in getting into food retailing.nother book. <br /> <br />Any disappointment felt at not seeing the inside of a name brasserie disappears when you get to the last section, `The Gourmet's Notebook'.

239401:US	39134375	R3524BW03YH5EU	0471836842	801847484	The Chef's Art: Secrets of Four-Star Cooking at Home	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Excellent Introduction to Professional Haute Cuisine.	`The Chef's Art' by Wayne Gisslen is a textbook on modern French technique, as interpreted by American chefs and American cooking schools. Two of the few problems with the book are when the author tries to represent this book as an embassy from professional cooking to the home cook and as a manual of American cooking.<br /><br />This is through and through a book of professional techniques. One of the very few concessions Gisslen makes to the home cook is to begin with a chapter of material that a freshman at the Culinary Institute of America would already know. One of the most impractical assumptions the author makes is that by reading this book, the home cook will buy a good kitchen scale for weighing ingredients to the gram or to the quarter of an ounce. Yeah, right! There is no question the minds of anyone who knows anything about baking that weighing flour carefully is clearly a good thing. But, TV chef / educators such as Rachael Ray, Tyler Florence, Giada De Laurentiis, and Jamie Oliver would simply not be as popular as they are if they did not liberate the home cook from careful measurements when doing savory dishes in a saute, braise, stew, grill, roast, or bake. This doesn't mean that this ad libbing style of cooking doesn't need a fair amount of experience so that you can have a pretty keen sense of how much a tablespoon of olive oil looks like. This is why I like metric quantities so much, since I spent ten years as a professional chemist and can tell the difference between 5 ml and 15 ml a lot easier than I can between a teaspoon and a tablespoon, until I memorized the fact that a teaspoon was 5 ml and a tablespoon was three times the size of a teaspoon.<br /><br />I say all this because this is really an excellent book. It's just that if you believe the glosses on the cover and think you are getting recipes for home cooking, you would be very disappointed. You would be much better off spending your money on a copy of `The Joy of Cooking', because what you are getting is much closer to Escoffier than it is to Irma Rombauer or even to Julia Child, for that matter. Child taught us French home cooking. Gisslen's book is `haute cuisine' straight down the middle.<br /><br />On the other side of the coin, Gisslen's book is really great for conveying general techniques, especially the great techniques of French stocks, sauces, braises, gratins, soups, salads, and vegetable cookery. While this is new breed Escoffier, there are many classic French dishes and techniques that are not here. There is not a hint of a souffle, a crepe, an omelet, or a pastry. Not even any savory tarts. But for those techniques he does cover, Gisslen is very, very good. He may even be as good as Jacques Pepin for explaining techniques, although I think the photographs in Pepin's `Complete Techniques' are better (not as dark and with better focus and more of them) and for a complete treatise on sauces, James Peterson's classic on `Sauces' is better. But, this is still a very good book for covering the important bases of French technique.<br /><br />One application for which I have found very few good cookbooks is in cooking for a crowd, as you may do for a large potluck gathering or a church social, or even for school cafeterias, where you need soup by the dozens of servings and stock by the tens of gallons. For cooks with such needs, this book may be a godsend, as long as what you want to make is in Gisslen's Franco-American lexicon. Gisslen accomplishes this by giving the quantities for all his recipes in four different measurements. Two columns of units are in standard U.S. units giving four or 16 servings and two columns in metric measurements for the same two serving counts. And, I encourage you to use the Metric unit columns, as I believe it is as easy or easier to measure out 60 ml than it is to measure 2 oz.<br /><br />Since there are no omelet recipes, I loose one of my favorite means of evaluating a cookbook, but there are still plenty of recipes for stocks for me to ponder. And, I am humbled, because Gisslen is quoting Escoffier and other French culinary authorities chapter and verse in calling for very long simmer times for stock making. While I am certain Gisslen's stock recipes will produce excellent results, this is a bit much for the casual home cook and may even strain the avid foodie's patience. And, I would not suggest you leave 8 quarts of hot water sitting on a live burner unattended for more than a few minutes. Especially if this is your first time at major league stock making.<br /><br />If this book interests you, I strongly recommend you read the first several chapters from front to back, at least through the chapters on sauces, stocks, and soups. From there, skim over the recipes, but read all the general information from cover to cover. The placement of the stock and other utility recipes at the end of the book is a bit annoying, but you can live with it, as this is a very, very nice book to become familiar with professional doctrines and techniques. It may not be quite as good as Pepin on technique or quite as authentic or complete as Escoffier, but it is a worthy book if you need to cook it right and in large quantities.l plenty of recipes for stocks for me to ponder.

It is one answer to my wish that every TV chef who is attempting to teach cooking to us foodies take a two semester course in chemistry. The book is not a rigorous approach to the chemistry of sugars, salt, fats, chemical leavenings, heat, acids, bases, and the like. Rather, it is a collection of enhanced answers to questions posed to the author in a regular newspaper column. This makes the book more interesting to read, if a little less available as a resource to applying its teachings to new situations.\\"<br /><br />This statement is equally true of the second volume. And, I must believe Professor Wolke has read this comment in my review or elsewhere. In his introduction he recognizes that his little columns are all answers to specific questions; however, science, by its nature, is `all tied together' in theories which enable its predictive and explanatory powers. Thus, Wolke says that in order to explain the answer to two related questions, we may find him repeating himself now and then, as he does over and over when he invokes how proteins denature by unwinding themselves and wrapping themselves into tight knots, leading to, for example, cooked eggs or tough cooked meat. I have absolutely no problem with that within the context of his format of question and answer.<br /><br />On the other hand, this format does not lend itself to be used as a source for looking up specific answers to questions that were not asked by the people writing into Dr. Wolke at the Washington Post. This is a small but real problem, made all the more frustrating because buried in the answers to some questions are some real gems of wisdom such as Table 5 on page 222 which gives the best kinds of sauces for various shapes of hard pasta. As good as the battalions of Italian cookbook writers are in covering their field, none of them has, to my recollection, put things quite so succinctly. This illustrates that genius in writing about cooking is not so much in what science you use, but in how well you present the answer. And, with a few small reservations, it is in this talent where Professor Wolke is a champion. While I may still vote for Alton Brown as my favorite TV foodie, Wolke has mastered the connection between Science, English, Food, and his audience.<br /><br />One of my favorite examples of how Wolke successfully addresses an issue is on the matter of cutting onions and tears. For starters, he corrects Alton Brown's error in attributing the tearing to sulfur trioxide dissolving in the moisture in your eyes, thus creating a weak sulfuric acid solution. In fact, if any sulfur oxide gas is involved, it is much more likely to be sulfur dioxide which, when dissolved in water, creates the much weaker sulfurous acid. Wolke goes on to say that the phenomena is due to a number of different causes, which makes absolute sense, because if there were a single cause, then the chances of finding relief would be much higher. Wolke goes on to show the problems with all the various remedies. He and Alton agree on the importance of a sharp knife, although I use an extremely sharp Japanese vegetable knife when dicing onions, and I tear like a two-year-old on a jag. Sticking with onions, Wolke gives an excellent explanation of the French vintner's notion of `terroir' and how it relates to the lower bite of Vidalia onions. And, he correctly points out that it is fewer nasty compounds rather than more sugars which make the Vidalia and its cousins milder.<br /><br />There are three general areas where Wolke could stand some improvement. While I was a journeyman chemist, I was an expert on linguistics and linguistic philosophy so, first, I find Wolke is occasionally a bit inconsistent in his use of works such as alkali (the opposite ofacid). Early in the book, he says that alkali should be reserved for the extremely strong bases such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide, yet I see him frequently using `alkali' for things that are just a tad over pH 7. The second quibble is that while science and the arts have long ago come to a d&eacute;tente and science and religion seem to be at an armed truce, Wolke constantly takes potshots at aspects of legal and political practice. It in incredibly easy for someone schooled in the doctrines of science to take pleasure at the apparent foibles of political practice, yet the people in the political world have problems of entirely different nature than either science or art, so cheap shots at food regulations, for example, are just that, cheap. The last problem I see is with Wolke's humor, especially in his little `Foodie's Fictionary' blurbs. I'm afraid I found not one of them very funny. Sorry. I think most of the humor in his main text is pretty basic and certainly welcome, but Alton Brown does not need to fear his position as the leading culinary class clown. The book would have been just a wee bit better with a good bibliography on food science references.<br /><br />New in this sequel are sidebars on various scientific issues. Most of the really valuable reference stuff is in these sidebars. What you may wish to do is stick some of those cute little post it note tabs on the sidebarred pages and write a word describing the topic.<br /><br />This is a really great book to take to your armchair and read from cover to cover.

241191:US	39134375	R3COI2451Q0TQC	0393300234	978554487	The Panda's Thumb: More Reflections in Natural History	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Second Collection of Great Essays on Science and Life	`The Panda's Thumb' is the second in a long series of bound essays by leading science writer Stephen Jay Gould. As important as these columns from the journal `Natural History' is, this is but a modest part of Gould's importance in American intellectual life. Gould, who died about three years ago from cancer, was a professor of geology, biology, and history of science at Harvard University and one of the world's leading researchers in broadening and interpreting Darwin's theory of evolution.<br /><br />I was reminded of Gould just yesterday when an advocate of creationism (belief that the accounts of the history of the world as recounted in the Bible have some literal truth) described the theory of evolution as a `dogma'. This is exactly the kind of statement which Gould was so capable of dissecting in the most gentle manner to expose how completely wrongheaded the statement was, using the force of reason alone, without resorting to any appeal to emotion.<br /><br />Gould was the consummate intellectual whose primary targets were beliefs which were based on mistaken reasoning or which base logically correct inferences on unsound or inappropriate premises.<br /><br />My favorite example of the first pathology is his arguments showing that in spite of the fact that baseball statistics on performance have been dropping since the 1940's, overall baseball performance has actually been improving. This is one of the many inconsistencies between a rigorous application of probability versus an uncritical intuition.<br /><br />The application of the word `dogma' to a scientific theory may be an example of the second pathology. The speaker is confusing scientific belief and religious belief. Scientific discourse creates theories whose power of explanation comes from its grounding in observation. As soon as an observation contradicts a theory, the quest to improve the theory or find a better one should begin. In Science, a `theory' is not something that is unproved, it is something which is believed and which is subject to disproof by evidence. A religious belief or dogma is, at least in Christian theology, something that is taken to be true because it was said under the influence of divine inspiration. By it's nature, since it is the result of a private experience (See William James' great `The Varieties of Religious Experience'), it cannot be disproved. That is not to say that the person who witnessed this experience is not free to write it down and try to convince someone else of the truth of what the true believer says they experienced. The whole Bible is composed of such stories. The fact that the Bible has inspired and improved the quality of life of billions of people over the millennia is evidence that it's message is worth advertising. But none of that changes the fact that religious beliefs are based on faith, which by its very nature is NOT based on empirical evidence.<br /><br />The very best example of this dichotomy is in the methods used by the investigators on the CSI TV show, where the physical evidence is paramount and eyewitness testimony is the least reliable evidence there is. That someone says it is true does not make it so! This includes things said and written down 3000 years ago.<br /><br />While I am going on a length without talking about the book `The Panda's Thumb', I wanted to state as clearly as possible what Gould was all about. And, I chose a review of this book to explain Gould's general position because it was the finding of this book in a bookstore in 1981 which lead me to the discovery of Gould's writing, and I have been a fan of his writing up to his death.<br /><br />If I may, my love of Gould's writing is a match made in heaven, as my interest in evolutionary theory goes back to the tenth grade and my interest in the general history and philosophy of science goes back at least to the mid-1960's when I began my study of philosophy. My focus on this book is also based on the fact that Gould's essays in his earlier books seem just a little fresher than his later works. Whether that is because his ideas were coming to paper for the first time of because he was not distracted by the battle with his cancer I do not know. Gould himself says he found his earlier essays somewhat shallow. I simply don't see it. It is possible that the earlier essays were somewhat less technical, but if that is so, the difference is subtle. It may all be due to the fact that Gould revisits certain themes over and over, so my reading them for the first time had a lot more punch than the 10th time around.<br /><br />The subject of the title essay in this book, the panda's thumb, is all about a sixth digit on the panda's hand which is not a true finger, but something developed out of a bone in the wrist to enable the panda to easily strip leaves off of bamboo shoots, the panda's favorite gourmet snack. While this may seem like a really insignificant detail, this is one of Gould's persistent themes. Most of the best examples of evolutionary theory can be found in some of the most innocent looking cases. I am constantly reminded of this as I discover examples in the oddest of places, as the last book I reviewed on bees and honey gives the story of a little experiment conducted by Charles Darwin on how bees construct their hexagonal cells of beeswax to hold honey.<br /><br />As with all his books, this collection is divided into eight (more or less) sections covering all his various fields of interest such as Evolution, Darwinania, Human Abilities and Evolution, Science and Politics, the nature of change, geology and fossils, biological conjectures (Were dinosaurs dumb?), biological scale and development.<br /><br />Gould is arguably the best writer on science for laymen in this generation. Everyone should read him, and this is an excellent place to start.uld's essays in his earlier books seem just a little fresher than his later works.

Buy It!	`Robbing the Bees, A Biography of Honey (The Sweet Liquid Gold that Seduced the World' by novice beekeeper and first time book author, Holley Bishop is a great little read, with a subject matter very similar to Mark Kurlansky's works, `Cod' and `Salt' but with an engaging style similar to `New Yorker' writer, Susan Orlean, author of `The Orchid Thief'. The fact that the primary subjects in both Orleans' and Bishop's books live and work in Florida is pure coincidence.<br /><br />Bishop evokes Orleans' style by switching back and forth between three main narrative lines. The opening line chronicles Bishop's own foray into beekeeping at her rural Connecticut home. This thread gives us an excellent firsthand picture of the trials of a real beekeeping novice. In the first chapter, we are introduced to the star of the second and, in many ways, the most important thread. This is Donald Smiley, a successful operator of a modest but growing beekeeping operation in the Florida panhandle who, upon being contacted by Bishop had 600 hives which grew to over a thousand in the three year course of writing this book. Aside from the fact that Smiley was the only professional beekeeper to answer Bishop's letter of inquiry, his operation is interesting because the collecting of the very interesting tupelo honey from blossoms native to the southern U.S. swamps is a major part of Smiley's yearly routine. Tupelo honey is distinguished from almost all others in that its sugars never crystallize out of the liquid honey.<br /><br />The story of Smiley's yearly routine is one that makes one scratch ones head in wonder over how anyone can like such a demanding schedule. But since thousands of beekeepers, just like professional chefs, commonly put in twelve to sixteen hour days and love every minute of it, one has to believe the psychic rewards to such a life are high. Smiley does have the advantage of being self-employed AND of running a business which give him an income at about twice the average of rural Florida panhandle residents. The hard part only begins with the dangers of dealing with stinging bees that are, at best, disinterested partners in the collection of honey and beeswax. In order to create a true tupelo or orange or clover specific honey, Smiley and his assistants must run through all 600 to 1000 hives and harvest what is in the hives, clean the honeycomb racks of every last trace of the previous honey, replace the honeycomb racks, and move all these hives to locations close to where the target blossoms or flowers are just opening. And, all of this has to be done in two or three days so the bees can catch the blossoms just as they start to open.<br /><br />The third thread in Bishop's book covers the backstory of honey, bees, and beeswax. I give Bishop serious extra points for remembering to include a chapter on beeswax. While it is a relatively unimportant product today, it is historically exceedingly important. Its surviving use in Moravian candles, for example, just scratches the surface of its uses. If you imagine a world without plastics, rubber, or synthetic hydrocarbons, the importance of wax should become obvious. It was used in waterproofing, preserving, embalming, and beautifying furniture. Bishop doesn't stop with its uses; she also discusses how bees create beeswax and how they use it to build the hexagonal cells of honeycomb. I was particularly interested in the citations of experiments performed by Charles Darwin in revealing how it was that honey bees were able to construct their marvelously geometric structures which just happen to need the least amount of material to contain the greatest volume. The evidence of Darwin's genius never fails to amaze me.<br /><br />One pitfall which Bishop avoids is a favorite subject of linguistic philosophers back in the 1960's when it was thought that the bees' dance upon returning to the hive was a form of language whereby the bee was telling her colleagues where to find an especially rich source of nectar. This very scholarly topic simply fell to the ground when, I believe, it was discovered that the basis for the dance was to shake loose pollen so that the onlookers could get a sample of the pollen from the rich source of flowers.<br /><br />Every subject's background is covered with the same excellent selection of material from history and modern science. Most of the illustrations are drawings from the dawn of publishing through the 19th century, the heyday of artistically done drawings of subjects from natural history. The subject of stinging, for example, is covered by anecdotes from the author's own experience and from Smiley's experience plus a brief on how a bee's sting works. Like most things in the natural world, it is a lot more complicated than it appears on the surface. The mechanics of a bee's sting make a modern hypodermic needle look crude. The biochemistry of the bee's venom makes injected medical cocktails look primitive.<br /><br />If this story has any dark side, it is in the story of the Africanized bees which were introduced into Brazil in the 1950's to create a strain which would do better than European bees in Brazil's tropical climate. The problem arose because these smaller, less productive bees were both more nomadic and more aggressive than their highly productive European cousins. This meant that the Africanized bees have been moving north through the Americas and colonies have already reached the southern United States. Their stings are no worse than European bee stings, but they will go after a human intruder out of sheer aggression, even if the nearby human makes no move to disturb the hive. As there is no known antidote to this moving ecological danger, one wishes we still had Darwin around to provide some clues to solving the problem.<br /><br />If Bishop's book has any weaknesses at all, it is the absence of a good bibliography and a few minor inaccuracies that got past her copy editors.cially rich source of nectar.

R. R. Tolkien is one of the most influential popular novels of the 20th century. Other bases of big motion pictures such as `Ben-Hur' and `Gone With the Wind' can't hold a candle to it as it had an influence far beyond its role as the basis for a movie script. For starters, `Lord of the Rings' has had a large and growing readership from its original publication in the mid 1950s to the present, while I suspect practically no one reads Lew Wallace's `Ben-Hur' any more and few people have recently read Margaret Mitchell's `Gone With the Wind'. Another `Lord of the Rings' offspring is the whole `Dungeons and Dragons' role playing games phenomenon. This game originally appeared a few years after the second blooming of `Lord of the Rings' popularity in 1965, when the books were published in paperback by Houghton Mifflin in response to a pirated copy published by Ace. This is when I first became enraptured by the stories of Middle Earth.<br /><br />In many ways, it is almost impossible to speak of any one of the three volumes which do not in the usual sense of the word form a trilogy of three independent novels related by common characters, location, and history. `The Lord of the Rings' is a single novel which was serialized in three volumes published over two and a half years in the mid 1950's. When the three titles are published in a single volume, it is not hard to see that the work is really not much longer than `Gone With the Wind' and it is certainly shorter than some notable novels such as `Atlas Shrugged'. One virtue we did get from the division into three titles by Tolkien is that Peter Jackson had a valid basis on which to split a single story into three long movies totaling close to 10 hours of viewing time.<br /><br />Like the movie version of `The Fellowship of the Ring', the `Return of the King' movie leaves off one important chapter. And, unlike the Tom Bombadil / Barrow Wight episodes in the first volume, the deleted `Scouring of the Shire' chapter in `Return of the King' created what was virtually the only real criticism of the movie, because the drama of `the scouring' was left out of the events between the celebrations in Gondor over the defeat of Sauron and the departures at the Gray Havens. So, we get a half-hour of celebrating and saying good-bye. Not too much in relation to the previous nine and a half hours, but a bit tedious in the context of a three hour movie. So, for the three of you who are reading the books for the first time, you have a great `lost' event to look forward to in reading `The Fellowship of the King'.<br /><br />One of the easily most important parts of this third volume is the very long historical appendix which lays out the major events of the first three ages of Middle Earth. One of the most satisfying aspects of both `The Hobbit' and `The Lord of the Rings' is the sense of the great depth of history. The appendices show that the history of the One Ring just scratches the surface, as Isildur wrested the ring from Sauron (see the opening scene of `Fellowship of the Rings') at the beginning of the Third Age. There are two earlier ages of Middle Earth from the time of the birth of the elves to the end of the first war with Sauron. It is a knowledge of this history which tells us why a ranger from the distant north is an heir to the throne of Gondor and why Denethor, the Steward cannot be King. One thing which amazes me is that no reviewer has noted is wondering about the fact that Arwen and Aragorn are very, very, very distantly removed cousins, since it is quite possible that Elrond was the brother of Aragorn's great,....great grandfather. This is because Elrond and brother Elros Tar-Minyatar were given the choice of immortality as a half-elf or very long life and a homestead on the island of Numenor, removed from the sorrows of Middle Earth. Elrond chose immortality and `exile' to Middle Earth'. Elros chose long life on the Eden-like island.<br /><br />This appendix contains a great many other bits of miscellany. The most important for those who have seen the movie is the story of the love between Arwen and Aragorn, which is not in the main narrative. This history is easily one of the most elaborate fictional histories created to date. Other fantasy histories such as Robert E. Heinlein's future history (in which he predicts the turmoil of the 1960's with amazing accuracy) is tiny in comparison. And, according to Tolkien's own writings, almost all this history was created before he began writing `The Lord of the Rings'. For those of us who get pleasure from such invented worlds, these appendices were just a little amuse-bouche. Enough to give us a taste of how deep this history went, without giving us many details of the great events of the first and second ages. It was this hunger which created such demand for `The Silmarillion', the last complete (posthumous) work by Tolkien, assembled by son Christopher Tolkien.<br /><br />If you have not read `The Hobbit', I strongly recommend reading that before picking up `The Lord of the Rings'. And, I suggest you read or at least browse the appendices at the end of this volume before starting `The Fellowship of the Ring'. I am almost inclined to suggest you read `The Silmarillion' before reading `The Hobbit', but `The Silmarillion' reads a lot more like history than like dramatic fiction. It is a much poorer novel than either `The Hobbit' or `The Lord of the Rings'.<br /><br />Truly great ending to the greatest fantasy novel, ever.arth'.

One virtue we did get from the division into three titles by Tolkien is that Peter Jackson had a valid basis on which to split a single story into three long movies totaling close to 10 hours of viewing time.<br /><br />Unlike the movies of the first and third books, almost every major scene of the book `The Two Towers', is captured in the movie. The chapters of Merry and Pippin with Treebeard and the Ents are shortened a bit. Seems as if the Ents are much too slow for 21st century cinema. One thing the movie did get wrong in its promotional artwork is the suggestion that the two towers of the title were Orthanc and Baradur, the fortress of Sauron. Actually, the second tower of the title is Minas Morgul, the city of Gondor, originally named Minas Ithil, but renamed when the Nazgul captured it several years before the start of the events in `Lord of the Rings'. The only piece of action I really miss is the role of Fangorn in the defeat of the besiegers of the Hornburg. And, in one of the very rare Peter Jackson additions to the story, I thought the skirmish between the Rohrrim / Aragorn and Saruman's warg riders was great cinema action, but just too much of a replay of Gandalf at the bridge in Moria, where a principle character is thought to have been killed and lost.<br /><br />I have read `The Lord of the Rings' at least 10 times, and the story of Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli from the banks of the Anduin to the victory at the Hornburg is by far one of my favorite parts of the novel. Treebeard comes in a close second, as he is a piece of the same ancient history of Middle Earth to which only the faintest hints are given in the stories of Fangorn, The Old Forest by the Shire, and Tom Bombadil. Basically, Bombadil and the Ents stand for what is most worth saving from the evil of Sauron. This innocence is something that is tainted even in the sheltered lives of the Hobbits.<br /><br />In contrast, after about the third or fourth reading, I often became anxious to get through the chapters about Frodo, Sam, and Gollum as quickly as possible. One of the greatest of Jackson's accomplishments in the films was to breath life into the characterization of Frodo Baggins, who always seemed to be to be something of a wimp, drawn along by the inexorable hand of fate. Sam, on the other hand, was pursuing the quest entirely out of love and grit. Another great service of the movie was the realization of Gollum. I think that Gollum's implementation may be about as close as we will come for a long time in seeing a computer generated character be nominated for an Academy Award for acting.<br /><br />Even though `The Two Towers' is the middle third of the complete novel, it really has a much more satisfying ending than `The Fellowship of the Ring'. One starts to see how it may be possible to defeat the great evil challanging all the good guys in the story, but of course, the difficulty of Saruman's defeat is just a way of showing that defeating Sauron will be just that much more difficult.<br /><br />The second of the great three part classic!ther great service of the movie was the realization of Gollum.

Buy It.	`Garlic and Sapphires' is the third volume of memoirs by Ruth Reichl. After `Tender at the Bone' which deals with her childhood and teens and `Comfort Me with Apples' which deals with her early journalistic career in San Francisco, this latest volume deals with her five years as the lead restaurant critic for the New York Times.<br /><br />This volume proves that Ms. Reichl is truly the best culinary memoirist today, and easily the best since M.F.K. Fisher. And, as one who has read more than a few of Ms. Fisher's memoirs, I would easily choose Ms. Reichl's humor and great stories of the modern scene over Ms. Fisher's slightly musty, albeit exquisitely crafted tales of cities and towns in France.<br /><br />The primary point of this volume is to tell the stories behind Ms. Reichl's various disguises and personas she took on in order to dine at Daniel's and Lespanisse and Le Cirque without being identified as the restaurant critic for the Times. The book starts off with the amazing story of Reichl's flight from Los Angles to New York seated, by coincidence, along side a waitress of a major Manhattan restaurant. It turns out that posted in all restaurant kitchens in New York City was already a photograph of Ruth Reichl with a reward to any staff member who identifies Ms. Reichl in their restaurant.<br /><br />In spite of all the other things on which Ruth could dwell, she stays remarkably on message. There is only the slightest of references to the great New York Times culinary writer, Craig Claiborne, who was still alive while Reichl was at the Times. And, there was only a slightly more specific reference to R. W. Appel and Amanda Hesser. The only two writing talents cited to any extent are Marion Burros, a friendly colleague who mostly worked out of the Washington bureau and adversary Bryan Miller who left the critic's post and objected to Reichl's overturning a lot of his restaurant opinions. What Miller forgot was that the power of the restaurant critic's column was not based on the writer, but on the newspaper which published the column.<br /><br />The most important character in this story after Reichl may be `THE NEW YORK TIMES', commonly thought to be the best and most powerful newspaper in the world. This fact makes it almost unthinkable that Reichl would question whether or not she really wanted to work for the Times when she was literally offered the job on a silver platter. There may have been some foundation to her doubts when she saw the Times offices for the first time. In contrast to the light, airy, Los Angles Times offices, the New York offices were crowded and filled with lots of old desks and unmatched chairs. After a full day's interviews plus total willingness from her husband to relocate to New York, Reichl took the job and immediately changed the tone of the paper's reviews.<br /><br />Reichl's personal philosophy was that reviews were nothing more than informed opinion and taste. This may seem utterly subjective, but actually, it is not far from what you would see in a scholarly work on the nature of aesthetic judgment. One is much better off trusting the opinion of a literary critic who has read 10,000 novels, both good and bad, than of your dentist who may have read 10, all from the same author. The thing that endeared her to her Times editors and publishers was the idea that her columns were written to sell newspapers, not to promote restaurants.<br /><br />For someone who does not read reviews of major Manhattan restaurants, I was a bit surprised at the incredible difference between the quality of food and service given to a pair of `beautiful people' versus the quality of food and service given to a drab looking old woman. And, if the diner is known to be the critic from the Times, food and service quality goes off the charts. This was the reason for the many disguises. And, it is obvious that more than one was needed, as it was all too easy for an astute restaurateur to connect a person with the byline on a review which can change their gross by tens of thousands of dollars a week. The truly remarkable thing about many of the disguises is how the personality embodied by the wig and clothes became part of Reichl's persona in dealing with people who were not in on the ruse. By far the funniest was the incident when Reichl took on her mother's persona, using her mother's clothes and jewelry. The story is doubly amusing if you have read `Tender at the Bone' where Reichl describes her primary chore was to keep her mother from poisoning any guests by serving spoiled food.<br /><br />It should be no surprise that Reichl's job had a serious downside. In addition to all the nasty mail from offended restaurateurs and their advocates and the political backbiting at the newspaper, there were the really unpleasant situations where Reichl offered `a dinner with the New York Times restaurant critic' as a prize to be auctioned off for charity. Ruth recounts one especially distasteful episode where the situation went so far as to turn her well-trained chameleon personality into someone who was distasteful to her husband. This job is no picnic. From this encounter comes the name of the book from a line in T. S. Eliot's `Four Quartets', `garlic and pearls in the mud' which echoed the fact that the evening had nothing to do with Reichl's love of cooks, food, or writing.<br /><br />The book includes the Times reviews Reichl wrote as a result of the meals described in the book. These are fun and interesting, but are really just sidebars to the real action in the main text. My only regret is that Reichl did not find it useful to include photographs of her disguises.<br /><br />Very highly recommended reading for foodies and non-foodies alike.with the byline on a review which can change their gross by tens of thousands of dollars a week.

We do not get the high theory of Spanish cuisine as we do from Hazan with her very Italian techniques that border in sophistication on great French culinary thinking.<br /><br />Unlike Hazan and Bastianich, Casas is not a native of her subject country and she does not live there full time, so we get no books about the cooking of `My Spain', as we do from Bastianich' first book on the cuisine of Istria and northern Italy. However, this book, unlike all her previous volumes, comes close to being a presentation of Spanish `home cooking'.<br /><br />Her four previous books can be easily divided into two pair. The first pair is the smaller volumes on the two great Spanish contributions to world cuisine, `Tapas' and `Paella'. The second pair cover the entire range of Spanish cooking, with the first, `The Food and Wine of Spain' being a very systematic, classic approach. The second, `Delicioso', is less formal, but does follow a very useful structure based on the culinary regions of Spain, to which Casas gives some very inventive and illuminating names such as `The Region of Sauces' for Galicia and `The Region of the Casseroles' for Catalunya and the Baleares Islands.<br /><br />`La Cocina de Mama' is more anecdotal than the previous four books, picking up lots of recipes from home and restaurant cooks which have great interest in themselves, but which may not have been as representative of typical cooking in Spain.<br /><br />I was especially pleased to see a Foreword from the very important Spanish chef, Ferran Adria as it would have been especially curious to see a book on Spanish restaurant cooking without a not to Adria, who has been touted from here to Timbuktu as the world's greatest working chef. And yet, there are no Adria recipes in this book. One has to believe that some time soon we should see a book in English on Adria's cuisine, but we get no hints of his famous foams on these pages. Instead, true to the nature of this book, we get a recipe for a Paella done by Adria's mother. Like bouillabaisse and so many other classic dishes, I always give a little wince when I hear paella described as a `simple, peasant' dish. I confess that relatively speaking, Ferran Adria's mother's dish of rabbit, green beans, tomato, and rice is pretty easy, but it is definitely more complicated than your typical 30-minute meal. Even so, Casas takes a little liberty with the procedure for the benefit of inexperienced American cooks and finishes off the dish in an oven rather than doing everything on the burner. Casas does repeat her caution from `Paella' to bake about 10 minutes longer in an electric oven than in a gas oven.<br /><br />It seems to be the season for recanting old beliefs, so just as Mario Batali recently confessed that Italians do indeed eat their fair share of pastry, Casas has discovered that pasta is a more important ingredient in Spanish cooking than a simple noodle in Catalunya (northeastern Spain, with ties to old Spanish possessions around Naples) soups. The newly discovered flagbearer of pasta in Spain is a thick soup / thin stew from the grandmother of Andalusian chef Bartolome Rodrigo Lucena. Even more unusual than the pasta dish itself is the fact that the recipe gives a recipe for fresh pasta to be used instead of the dried pasta of southern Italy. The bland fresh pasta almost plays the same role as central European dumplings by offering a bland contrast to the strongly tasting salt cod, artichoke hearts, two types of paprika tomatoes, and green peppers.<br /><br />With each of Casas' books, I am again and again amazed at the predominant role of sweet red peppers in the cuisine of Spain. They seem to be in practically every dish in every region. In spite of this overwhelmingpresence, Casas has yet to explain the seeming connection between the paprika's of Spain and the paprika's of Hungary, halfway across Europe. The Moorish connection doesn't work because sweet peppers came from the New World a few years after the Moors were expelled from Spain. The only other connection may be the royal house of Hapsburgs that ruled both Spain and Austria-Hungary.<br /><br />The book has the obligatory map of Spain (if you don't realize how important this is, try reading a book on regional dishes without a map) in the front and a very simple organization of chapters on Tapas, Salads, Vegetables, Soups, Rice and Pasta, Fish and Shellfish, Poultry and Game, Meats, and Desserts.<br /><br />One new `vector' I discovered in Spanish cooking is the important role of canned tuna in the salads. While France has its classic salad Nicoise, Spain gives us three major salad recipes with canned tuna. Aside from the omnipresent paprika or fresh red peppers, there is a lot of hard-boiled egg, cooked beans, and canned white asparagus.<br /><br />The desserts have their fair share of chocolate, especially hot chocolate, the favorite form of the Aztecs from whom the Spanish acquired the brown gold. There are also spicy doughnuts that are made in almost exactly the same way as you would find in New Orleans or in Amish Pennsylvania. As you may expect, custards are also a big thing, plus lots and lots of almond, meringue, and lemon. One thing I miss in all of Casas books is bread. If Ms. Casas is listening, I should mention that in none of her books is there any mention of the special tool used to flip tortilla Espanola, of which I read in Ruth Reichl's new memoir, `Garlic and Sapphires'.<br /><br />Excellent, low priced introduction to great Spanish cooking and stories about Spanish food.ming presence, Casas has yet to explain the seeming connection between the paprika's of Spain and the paprika's of Hungary, halfway across Europe.

If Ms. Casas is listening, I should mention that in none of her books is there any mention of the special tool used to flip tortilla Espanola, of which I read in Ruth Reichl's new memoir, `Garlic and Sapphires'. <br /> <br />Excellent, low priced introduction to great Spanish cooking and stories about Spanish food. <br />	2005-05-10

This recent cookbook by Mario Batali presents the recipes done at his flagship restaurant, Babbo, with a few borrowed from the seafood restaurant, Esca. The book appears to be as good or better a representation of the food at its namesake restaurant than most I have read. It is thereby, the best possible consolation for those of us who have tried repeatedly and failed to attain a reservation at Babbo at a reasonable time for an American to eat dinner.<br /><br />Unlike Mario's earlier two books, there is no attempt in this book or at his restaurant to be wholly true to original Italian recipes, but only because Mario is true to the very Italian doctrine of buying what is the best at local markets. He, for example, makes great use of Pennsylvania grown shittake mushrooms, even though they are unknown in Italian cuisine.<br /><br />The chapters follow the course of a typical Italian meal, including:<br /><br />Aperitivi (before dinner drinks)<br /><br />AntiPasti<br /><br />Pasta<br /><br />Mare (seafood)<br /><br />Contorni<br /><br />Terra e Bosco (Domestic and Foraged Meats)<br /><br />Pre-Desserts and Cheese<br /><br />Dolci (Sweet desserts)<br /><br />Digestivi (after dinner drinks)<br /><br />The book ends with short chapters on `Tools of the Trade', Babbo's Tasting Menus, and Sources. As one of the two tasting menus show, pasta is one of the main stars at Babbo. The pasta chapter is the longest and includes some of the most interesting dishes. Being very fond of lamb, I was especially attracted to the recipe for mint tagliatelle wherein lamb shoulder is cooked into an olive flavored ragu used to dress a fresh tagliatelle made with dough including a mint puree. From his Food Network show, `Molto Mario', I am already convinced of the flavorfulness of the lamb shoulder. Here, Mario gives the perfect excuse to use it.<br /><br />If one accepts the challenge of making fresh pasta and are not put off by the occasionally exotic ingredient such as guanciale (pork jowls), calf's tongue, and beef cheeks; most of the recipes are fairly simple for the experienced amateur chef. If you wish to make your own stocks, the chicken stock recipe is straightforward and relatively similar to one found in `The Best Recipe' from Cooks Illustrated. There is little of the hyperfussiness you may find from Jeremiah Tower or Thomas Keller. As Mario states in his introduction, this is not a result of `dumbing down' the recipes for the home cook, it is simply the way things are done at Babbo. There is, however, a devotion to high quality ingredients. One of the drawbacks of this dedication is that Babbo has access to some cured meat only because they make the products themselves. While this is a bit unfair to the rest of us, there is still plenty here which we should have no problem assembling from a good farmers market of a good megamart.<br /><br />I generally am not impressed by the culinary photography in most cookbooks. It seems that there are only two ways to do it right. One approach is to do none or limit them exclusively to hand models demonstrating techniques. The second approach is to give us a picture of every single dish. Mario takes the latter option and the photographer, Christopher Hirsheimer deserves the credit he receives on the title page along with Mario. All photos are in color, in focus, and appetizing.<br /><br />While the book is primarily about the recipes, Mario does throw salt in our wounds from failed attempts at making reservations by describing some of the supporting features which make Babbo the success it is. Wine, for example is an important part of dining at Babbo. Mario's partner Joe Bastianish is an important expert on Italian wines and Babbo is billed as both a Ristorante and Enoteca, a wine bar, so the attention to details of serving wine are very serious. However, Mario did not include wine pairings for these dishes, and I do not miss them.<br /><br />My perceptions may be clouded by my admiration for Mario as a teacher of regional Italian cooking, but one of the most rewarding aspects of this book is the way in which Mario communicates the sense of Italian hospitality he strives for at Babbo. The sense of `gemutlichkeit' (sorry, I don't know the Italian take on this Austrian notion) is palpable as you read the recipes and stories behind the food at Babbo.<br /><br />A delightful restaurant cookbook and a must for Mario fans.an cooking, but one of the most rewarding aspects of this book is the way in which Mario communicates the sense of Italian hospitality he strives for at Babbo.

Great Fantasy!	`Fellowship of the Ring', the first of the three volume novel, `Lord of the Rings' by philologist J. R. R. Tolkien is one of the most influential popular novels of the 20th century. Other bases of big motion pictures such as `Ben-Hur' and `Gone With the Wind' can't hold a candle to it as it had an influence far beyond its role as the basis for a movie script. For starters, `Lord of the Rings' has had a large and growing readership from its original publication in the mid 1950s to the present, while I suspect practically no one reads Lew Wallace's `Ben-Hur' any more and few people have recently read Margaret Mitchell's `Gone With the Wind'. Another `Lord of the Rings' offspring is the whole `Dungeons and Dragons' role playing games phenomenon. This game originally appeared a few years after the second blooming of `Lord of the Rings' popularity in 1965, when the books were published in paperback by Houghton Mifflin in response to a pirated copy published by Ace. This is when I first became enraptured by the stories of Middle Earth.<br /><br />In many ways, it is almost impossible to speak of any one of the three volumes which do not in the usual sense of the word form a trilogy of three independent novels related by common characters, location, and history. `The Lord of the Rings' is a single novel which was serialized in three volumes published over two and a half years in the mid 1950's. When the three titles are published in a single volume, it is not hard to see that the work is really not much longer than `Gone With the Wind' and it is certainly shorter than some notable novels such as `Atlas Shrugged'. One virtue we did get from the division into three titles by Tolkien is that Peter Jackson had a valid basis on which to split a single story into three long movies totaling close to 10 hours of viewing time. There is simply no way the whole story could be squeezed into three hours. Ralph Bakshi's attempt to do it was a total failure.<br /><br />With all of the truly demoniac scenes in the second and third volumes, not to mention Gandalf's heroic stand against the Balrog in the Mines of Moria, I really find the single scariest moment in the whole novel to be the one I read on a dark Saturday night alone in our house while the dark riders on their black horses were chasing Frodo seated on a white horse in front of the Elven warrior Glorfindel as he races towards the river guarding the approaches to Rivendell. It is no surprise that this scene is one of the most powerful in Jackson's movie. Jackson even improves on the scene by replacing the mighty warrior, Glorfindel with the very slender, delicate looking Arwen, who would seem to not have the snowball's chance in hell against the nine black riders.<br /><br />While almost all the scenes in `The Two Towers' made it to the screen, important parts of both `The Return of the King' and `The Fellowship of the Ring' were understandably left behind when the film was done. Oddly, the single most interesting character of the volume, Tom Bombadil, was practically the only significant character left out of the movie. Bombadil is quite the `deux ex machina', as he rescues the four hobbits from their first two perils without being given much of an introduction, even by know-it-all Gandalf. Bombadil only crops up one afterward in the council of Elrond where it is said that if the magic ring is given to him, he will probably loose it and just as he was `the first', he will be the last to disappear under the shadow cast by ubervillain Sauron. In all my readings of Tolkien, Bombadil has always been the most elusive and interesting character, even more so than the wizards, as the wizards, the elves, and every other creature in Middle Earth (with the possible exception of the Ents) is subject to the evil of the ring. This suggests that all the peoples of Middle Earth except Bombadil and the Ents are immigrants from somewhere else. `The Silmarillion' tells in great detail how the elves came to Middle Earth, and it is clear that the wizards and the men of Gondor and Arnor came from places beyond Middle Earth, but not Bombadil. What's more, Bombadil seems to have power over the ring, as he seems to make it disappear before the hobbits' eyes. Bombadil and his soul mate Goldberry seem to be great archetypes for the hippie counterculture of the 1960s. In fact, of all the characters in `Lord of the Rings', the contrast between Bombadil and Gandalf are two of the most interesting archetypes relevant to modern humans. I certainly have less trouble identifying with these two than with the diminutive, hairy-toed hobbits.<br /><br />While the driving energy of the story comes from the need to overthrow the great evil Sauron, the greatest interest comes from battles of conscience on a much more `human' scale, as it occurs in Boromir, Gollum, Faramir, Theoden, and Frodo Baggins. These struggles of conscience are masterfully depicted in the films. The most important instance in this film is the struggle of Boromir between his sworn allegiance to the quest of the fellowship versus his fealty to his father, Denethor, steward of Gondor.<br /><br />As great as the movies are, and they are masterful in how much of Tolkien's story they got onto film, the depth of history and linguistic richness Tolkien creates simply cannot be conveyed in three hours.

Ms. Green also wrote the `Field Guide to Produce' for the same series, to which I gave a very favorable review. This book, I feel, is even more useful as a volume you own and consult often. The difference may be less in the relative quality of the books but in the relative availability of good cookbooks and reference books devoted exclusively to meat and those devoted to fruits and vegetables. Vegetables as a group are supported by superb books from leading culinary writers such as Jack Bishop, Alice Waters, James Peterson, and most of all, Elizabeth Schneider and her volume, `Vegetables from Amaranth to Zucchini'.<br /><br />Compared to these four, I know of only two leading writers, Bruce Aidell and the team of Schlesinger and Willoughby who have done good cookbooks covering a wide range of meats, and even these books don't give as broad a coverage as the veggie crowd.<br /><br />These two books solve the amateur cook's knotty problem of wandering through the market, being able to tell what looks good, and then thinking up something to do with the good stuff. When I see some especially good looking pork chops, there is only one thing I can thing of doing with them. If I wanted to stuff them, I would not be sure I knew what I would need, as all my pork chop stuffing recipes are sitting on my bookshelf at home. With these books in hand, you will can get a much better idea of the variety of things you can do with a cut of meat from this book than from virtually any other source I can think of. This is not to say it isn't there, it's just that it is so spread out across so many different books and sources that if you don't already have it all in your head, tracking it down on short notice is almost impossible. The only single source I can think of which comes close to this book is the Larousse Gastronomique, but you don't want to be lugging this 10-pound boat anchor around with you at the Farmer's Market. And, my experience with the average meat market attendant is that I know more about meat than they do. All the real butchers are back in the cold room.<br /><br />The books on produce and meats will generally be used for different things. Produce is generally much more perishable than meat in a refrigerated case. That is, the variability in the quality of produce at one store will be much higher than the variability in the quality of meat, especially since produce probably comes from 20 or 30 different suppliers, while beef, pork, veal, and lamb may come from two or three suppliers while poultry may come from two or three other suppliers. And, with the exception of lamb, practically all meat availability is independent of season. Therefore, while your first question upon opening the book on produce may be the seasonality, the first question upon opening the book on meat may be `What is a good cut for grilling?' or `How do I pick the best pork chop for stuffing?'.<br /><br />While most cookbooks separate flesh on four legged animals from flesh from two legged / two winged animals, this book is just that much better because in addition to covering beef, veal, pork, and lamb, it covers all different types of poultry (domesticated birds) and game, including wild birds and wild mammals. In fact, the range of wild game mentioned is truly amazing. I was surprised to see the `Joy of Cooking' cover boar and muskrat. This book includes sections on alligator, armadillo, raccoon, rattlesnake, and squirrel. Just what they need at the road kill caf&eacute;! Much more practical is the fact that the book also covers all sizes, shapes, and nationalities of Charcuterie and meat preservation. It even mentioned some types of hams of which I have not yet heard.<br /><br />Upon opening the book, the very first thing I did was to look up guanciale (cured pork jowl) in the index and lo and behold, there it was. This alone sold me on the book. Unfortunately some other index games came up empty, as when I looked up London broil. No references appeared anywhere in the index, even though it is mentioned in the introduction and as a method of preparation for several different cuts of meat.<br /><br />This means that you can't effectively pick a cooking method and search for the best cut(s) to use with this method.<br /><br />Otherwise, for a list price of $15, literally every American foodie needs a copy of this book, especially as the `Larousse Gastronomique' primarily deals with European butchering primals.<br /><br />Very, very highly recommended.was.

And, like his very popular colleague, Giada De Laurentiis, has produced a weak book that is banking more on his exposure on the Food Network than on the quality of his book. And, if sales of Giada's book are any indication, this volume will probably do fairly well in spite of its limitations.<br /><br />Before getting into the book, I have to say that on seeing but one of Lieberman's shows, I think he has a good talent for presenting good recipes on the tube. He has none of the giggles and tics and `you'll do better' and `look at the feeble / fattening thing you are cooking' attitude which can turn you off some other Food Network hosts. In this regard, both Lieberman and De Laurentiis are near the top among my favorites, just below Mario Batali and Alton Brown.<br /><br />Basically, Lieberman threw away his advantage of Food Network exposure by giving us a book which does not stay close to his core message, has lots of mistakes, and is organized in an overly clever manner, although not nearly as stupidly clever as Tyler Florence's second book (but Tyler didn't make any stupid cooking mistakes).<br /><br />Lieberman's theme of show and book is economical cooking. Cooking in season is really redundant to his primary message, as cooking in season is always more economical than buying Chilean blueberries in January for $3.00 a pint or December hothouse asparagus for $3.00 a pound. But, like the `Frugal Gourmet' of yesteryear, there is a lot of lip service to frugality but not much real dedication. Lieberman's frugality is largely based on avoiding expensive ingredients such as foie gras, truffles, porcini mushrooms, and caviar. This does not keep him from moderately expensive ingredients such as salmon, shrimp, filet mignon, and sun-dried tomatoes. There are lots of advice on how to equip a kitchen cheaply (more on this later), but no tips on buying food cheaply. I'm frankly jealous of Lieberman's taking the economy theme, as if I were to write a book on food, it would be on economic cooking, so I've given some thought to how this should be done. The first thing I would do is to give tables (graphs would be even better) of the prices over the 12 months of the leading fruits and vegetables. For those products whose quality is adversely affected by long travel (fresh corn) and hothouse upbringing (tomatoes), I would make special notes so those can be avoided as well. I would also provide some seasonal advice on meats, especially on lamb, pork, and veal. I feel Lieberman is not really taking his main theme very seriously. Seriously economic cooking is the kind Jacques Pepin's mother did when she shopped to stock her boarding house kitchen at the end of the day when merchants were willing to sell wilted goods at rock bottom prices (See `The Apprentice' by Pepin).<br /><br />Regarding mistakes in the book, Jacques Pepin and Jamie Oliver and Mario Batali can afford little mistakes because the overall value of their work is so high that it is not likely to interfere with the quality of their dishes or reputations. A newbie, on the other hand, cannot afford mistakes, and to my lights, one is one too many for a first book trying to create an impression. I am comfortable with the notion that some people will not sense the same mistakes that I do but here goes.<br /><br />The list of basic kitchen equipment is decent, except I would leave off the garlic press, recommend wood cutting boards over plastic, recommend heat proof silicone over plain hard plastic for spatulas, avoid calling aluminum a non-metal, recommend a Dutch oven instead of `a big pot'. I would specifically suggest cheap over `decent-quality' nonstick pans. I would NOT do the functions of a strainer and a colander with the same gadget. The other side of the coin is that Lieberman's advice on kitchen arranging is pretty good. I'm inclined to have left it at that and simply referred the reader toAlton Brown's excellent book on kitchen gear.<br /><br />I think I found some of the most serious mistakes in the section on herbs and spices. It is all very well to praise fresh spices, but fresh spices are incredibly more expensive than dried spices, especially for spices which do well in the dried form such as thyme, sage, rosemary, tarragon, bay, and oregano. A bottle of premium label dried thyme costs me about $3 and lasts at least four months in a dozen dishes. A pack of fresh thyme costs $1.30 and lasts for one dish without freezing or drying myself. This means dried thyme costs me 1/5 the amount of fresh thyme, with absolutely no loss in quality of my soups and braises. At the same time, Lieberman confesses ignorance about herbs and spices and proceeds to label two herbs, bay leaves and oregano, as spices. He also fails to make the very common recommendation to buy nutmegs whole and grate them on a microplane as needed. And, why in the world would he recommend storing oils and spices near a heat source!<br /><br />The book is organized by occasion rather than by course or primary ingredient. For such a short book, this is really silly, as it makes the book far less useful than simple chapters on soups, salads, meat, fowl, and desserts. My annoyance with the organization even extends to the index that lacks any reference to the word vinaigrette, even though there is a very decent recipe for vinaigrette accompanying a salad recipe. And, I think it's cheap to call a frittata recipe a recipe for an omelet. But that's me.<br /><br />This is not a bad book.

R. R. Tolkien is one of the most influential popular novels of the 20th century. Other bases of big motion pictures such as `Ben-Hur' and `Gone With the Wind' can't hold a candle to it as it had an influence far beyond its role as the basis for a movie script.

This game originally appeared a few years after the second blooming of `Lord of the Rings' popularity in 1965, when the books were published in paperback by Houghton Mifflin in response to a pirated copy published by Ace. This is when I first became enraptured by the stories of Middle Earth. The game's creators made no effort to hide the fact that the game based on a varied band of roving adventurers was inspired by the exploits of the nine characters who formed `The Fellowship of the Ring', especially as the primary adventurer types were Wizard, Warrior, Dwarf, Elf, Ranger, and Halfling. Sound familiar? And don't forget the dragons!<br /><br />Just as Lewis Carroll's works are imbued with logical twists and turns, befitting his training as a mathematician and logician, so Tolkien's works are filled with invented words and languages and histories loosely based on Celtic, Norse, and Teutonic mythology and folklore. In fact, lots of Tolkien's most familiar names are taken straight from old English, German, and Scandinavian works. And, it is the perception of great depth to the history of Middle Earth which magically draws one in and bewitches one with questions about the origins of this, that, and the other character or race. There is some sense of this depth in the Hobbit, but in this work, most of the background was borrowed from Grimm and other fairy tale sources. In fact, Tolkien could not begin writing `The Lord of the Rings' until he wrote out for himself the mythology and history of the demiurges and races laying their fingerprints on Middle Earth. Most of this became the posthumously published `The Silmarillion' plus the thirteen volumes of notes and stories published with the editing of son Christopher Tolkien.<br /><br />For the three of you who are not aware of the movies and books, let me be clear that `The Lord of the Rings' is NOT a trilogy. It is not three separate stories connected by common characters, venue, or history. It is a single long novel in six parts which happened to be published in three volumes over the course of two and a half years, in much the same way that the three movies were released, one a year. And, as long as I am mentioning the movies, let me say that Peter Jackson totally outdid all expectations I had for how much of Tolkien's story could be squeezed into 10 hours of film. Some may say that a lot was left out. I agree that some events and even a story line or two was left out, but nothing of major consequence.<br /><br />Oddly, the single most interesting character of the novel, Tom Bombadil, was practically the only significant character left out of the movie. Bombadil is quite the `deux ex machina', as he rescues the four hobbits from their first two perils without being given much of an introduction, even by know-it-all Gandalf. Bombadil only crops up one afterward in the council of Elrond where it is said that if the magic ring is given to him, he will probably loose it and just as he was `the first', he will be the last to disappear under the shadow cast by ubervillain Sauron. In all my readings of Tolkien, Bombadil has always been the most elusive and interesting character, even more so than the wizards, as the wizards, the elves, and every other creature in Middle Earth (with the possible exception of theEnts) is subject to the evil of the ring. This suggests that all the peoples of Middle Earth except Bombadil and the Ents are immigrants from somewhere else. `The Silmarillion' tells in great detail how the elves came to Middle Earth, and it is clear that the wizards and the men of Gondor and Arnor came from places beyond Middle Earth, but not Bombadil. What's more, Bombadil seems to have power over the ring, as he seems to make it disappear before the hobbits' eyes.<br /><br />While the driving energy of the story comes from the need to overthrow the great evil Sauron, the greatest interest comes from battles of conscience on a much more `human' scale, as it occurs in Boromir, Gollum, Faramir, Theoden, and Frodo Baggins. These struggles of conscience are masterfully depicted in the films, along with my surely most scary moment, which I recall reading on a dark Saturday night alone in our house while the dark riders on their black horses were chasing Frodo seated on a white horse in front of the Elven warrior Glorfindel as he races towards the river guarding the approaches to Rivendell. All the following scenes, including the dreadful encounter with the Balrog and the King of the Nazgul were tame in comparison to that moment.<br /><br />The only place where the movies are weak is where they compress the events from the distruction of the ring to the departure of Bilbo, Frodo, and the elves from the Gray Havens. The whole end of Saruman by the scouring of the Shire is left out due to time constraints, so we get about 30 minutes on winding down through three different ending scenes.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the movie, you really must read the books to appreciate how good a job was done with the films.Ents) is subject to the evil of the ring.

It is a grand amalgam of authentic material similar to the recipes in his first book, `Authentic Mexican', exposition on the background of dishes not unlike the essays of John Thorne, and analysis of recipes to come up with the best, not unlike the style of `Cooks Illustrated', with the difference that Bayless often gives two or more alternative recipes from which the reader can choose. One recipe is a traditional Mexican approach and the alternatives may be either additional traditional recipes or `modern' recipes. The modern alternatives are not the same as `Americanized', but just newer recipes that may make more use of prepared ingredients.<br /><br />The chapter on quesadillas is an excellent example of how Bayless approaches his subjects. The first thing which strikes me about the recipes is that while your average Food Network cook will use flour tortillas, the preferred Mexican choice is corn tortillas. And, while Rachael Ray and others build it as a sandwich of two tortillas with fillings in between, Bayless does it up much more like a wrap or possibly even a French omelet, where a single tortilla is laid flat, filled with stuffing in the center, and folded over after griddle-baking. In this chapter, we get three traditional recipes, one with a saut&eacute;ed mushroom and cheese filling, one with squash blossom and leafy greens (spinach and arugula) and cheese filling, and one with home made corn tortillas and only cheese and epazote or cilantro leaves as filling. The recipes include detailed notes on technique and on cooking ahead tips. When appropriate, a chapter on a large subject such as quesadillas will include additional recipes on appropriate condiments such as salsa verde (green tomatillo salsa).<br /><br />The `Cooks Illustrated' role comes in at the end the authors pose and answer `Questions and Answers from our Testing'. It is no surprise that the authors suggest that the best tortillas for quesadillas are homemade or made that day from a local tortilla bakery. A bit more surprising is the statement that good supermarket flour tortillas may be better than the average supermarket corn tortilla. To my mind, the biggest change giving a more authentic Mexican experience with these recipes is to switch from cheddar to Chihuahua, quesadilla, or asadero cheeses. Unfortunately, the only truly Mexican cheese I have seen in my local markets is queso fresco, which can be easily improvised with cottage cheese, farmer's cheese, or ricotta.<br /><br />Using this style of exploring selected dishes in great detail means that Bayless covers a lot less different dishes than the usual 370-page cookbook. The book is divided into only four chapters with:<br /><br />Starters, Snacks, and Light Meals with Guacamole, Ceviche, Queso Fundido, Sopes, Gorditas, Quesadillas, Tostadas, Tamales, Tacos, Enchiladas, and Chilaquiles.<br /><br />Soups, Stews and Sides with Chicken Soup, Tortilla Soup, Seafood Soup, Pozole, Rice and Beans<br /><br />Entrees with Chiles Rellenos, Turkey with Red Mole, Chicken with Green Pipian, Chicken Adobado, Fish a la Veracruzana, Fish in Excabeche, Seafood in Jojo de Ajo, Pork in Salsa Verde, Beef a la Mexicana, Carne Asada, and Barbacoa<br /><br />Desserts and Drinks with Flan, Rice Pudding, Cajeta, Mexican Chocolate, Tropical Mango, and Tequila, Beer, and Wine.<br /><br />The recipe for the Chicken Adobado is the first time where I saw a connection between a Mexican and Filipino dish, the famous Chicken Adobo. Both dishes use a strong vinegar marinade/braise. As the Philippine cookbooks claim, the Spanish influence in the islands was delivered via Mexico, so there is Mexican influence in Filipino cooking.<br /><br />Aside from the very nice pictures, I would rely on a copy of `Authentic Mexican' rather than this book for it's glossary of Mexican ingredients. The glossary of Internet and Mail Order sources is as good or better than you will find in other books. Its best feature is the sources for seeds to plant Mexican vegetables.<br /><br />One thing that strikes me as very strange is the appearance of olive oil in traditional recipes. The olive arrived in Mexico with the Spanish conquistadors, and olive trees did not flourish in Mexico. By Bayless' own statements, the traditional `lipid of choice' was lard that Bayless points out has a lot less cholesterol than butter.<br /><br />This is a really super first book on Mexican dishes for Americans. It does not cover as broad a range as `Authentic Mexican', but it gives us all the best substitutions from American megamarts. And, I believe it is better written and edited. As PBS series hosts go, Mr. Bayless is super successor to wear the mantle of Julia Child. I just wish he would have beaten Bobby Flay on `Iron Chef America', but then, Flay had the home court advantage, experience, and won by but a single point.marinade/braise.

Buy It!!	`Molto Italiano' is Food Network icon Mario Batali's fourth and, to my lights, best cookbook to date. Like Mario, it has a very nice heft to it, advertising 327 recipes in an utterly simple organization in 450 easy to read pages with a built-in ribbon bookmark, something I think should be a required feature on all cookbooks. For all of those clamoring to buy Giada De Laurentiis' cookbook, I would recommend you pass that up for this book, which is far better.<br /><br />Mario states that his cooking, and these recipes, are all based on Italian home cooking and repeats his often stated belief that in Italy, no one thinks the best cooking is done in restaurantes. Everyone believes the best cooking is done at their aunt's house or Nonna's house or at the house of the matriarch living down the street above the market. No one goes to a restaurant to get superior meals; they simply go to celebrate so Mama and Nonna don't have to cook. I have been hearing this claim for years on `Molto Mario', and it finally dawned on me the implication this has for all the Italian restaurant cookbooks out there, including Mario's own `Babbo Cookbook'. In strong contrast to cooking in `the F country' where an important difference is made between `haute cuisine' (Paul Bocuse, Joel Robuchon, et al), `cuisine bourgeoisie' ' (Julia Child, Richard Olney) and `cuisine provincial' (Elizabeth David, Patricia Wells), Italy has its regional home cooking and approximations to it done in restaurante, trattoria, osteria, and enotecas.<br /><br />I am really happy to see this book devoted almost exclusively to RECIPES. There is a five page essay by David Lynch on Italian wines after the introduction and there is a one page list of recommended kitchen equipment at the end of the book (Please add food mill to list, as it is used in the potato gnocchi recipe. This is actually more useful than a potato ricer, as it can do more different things.). There is also two-page list of suppliers at the end of the book, but that's about it. The contents and relative size of the chapters accurately reflects Mario's mantra about the relative importance of various types of food in the Italian cuisine. Meat appears in almost every chapter as the base of a sauce or as a condiment, but it is less important as a main dish. The chapters are:<br /><br />Antipasto, by far the largest chapter at 106 pages, divided into sections on vegetable, seafood, and meat dishes. This section is so large that this book can easily replace most books specializing in antipasti.<br />Soup, Rice, and Polenta takes 38 pages with 29 recipes, including all the most familiar dishes such as Roman egg drop soup, Tuscan cabbage and bean soup, saffron risotto, and polenta with clams.<br />Dried Pasta gets 24 pages with 20 recipes. For me, the most important recipe here is Mario's version of spaghetti alla carbonara, wherein he does not break the egg yolks, but leaves that to the diner to enhance the sauce by breaking the yolks. I learned this dish on `Molto Mario', and have been frustrated at everyone else's recipe which whips the yolks together with the white before mixing with the pasta.<br />Fresh Pasta chapter is over twice as long with 34 recipes, including a basic pasta dough and several gnocchi recipes. As Mario did his apprenticeship in Emilia-Romagna, where fresh pasta is much more common than the southern dry pasta, this is understandable.<br />Fish is understandably a major chapter at 48 pages and 31 recipes, including calamari, shrimp, crabs, snails, sardines, bass, sole, snapper, mullet, salt cod, monkfish, eel, tuna, swordfish, and mackerel.<br />Fowl is slightly smaller at 38 pages and 27 recipes with 10 chicken, 6 turkey, 5 duck, and 6 game bird recipes. This includes some classics such as hunter's style chicken and turkey meatballs.<br />Meat occupies a sizable chapter, at 54 pages and 40 recipes, including several of my favorites such as veal Marsala, sausage and broccoli rabe, stuffed meat loaf,and two recipes for calves liver. Yum.<br />Vegetables also get an appropriately sizable chapter with 34 pages and 34 recipes, including some with Mario's favorite ingredient, Guanciale (Note: Dean and Delucca in Greenwich Village carries Guanciale).<br />Sweets are in the last chapter of 42 pages and 32 recipes with items from the Austrian influenced Alps to Sicily. Mario goes so far as to recant his claim that Italians do not eat many sweets, revising his story to say that they don't eat many sweets at the end of big meals. Instead, they pack away the sugar with nibbles throughout the day.<br /><br />Lots of familiar Italian dishes such as frittatas are here, but Mario doesn't waste precious room on bread that has been covered so well in other books.<br /><br />While Mario gives the Italian name for each and every recipe, the recipe names in the various section tables of contents are all in English. Even those names which have become well known such as `cacciatore' are given as `hunter's style'. Italian is reserved for the recipes' subtitles. This makes the book especially good for first timers to Italian cuisine.<br /><br />The recent book to which Mario's work is most closely comparable is Michele Scicolone's `1000 Italian Recipes'. I compared several recipes in the two books and, for various reasons almost always preferred Mario's version. In the veal Marsala, for example, Mario saut&eacute;s in olive oil and uses butter as a final flavoring rather than sauteeing in hot butter. Both more practical and more authentic. In the potato gnocchi recipe, Mario gives much more delicate instructions for combining the riced potato, flour, and egg. Mario also starts off with less flour per potato, leaving the finishing amount of flour to the discretion of the cook.<br /><br />This is my new first choice among Italian cookbooks for non-foodies. The recipes are all relatively simple, but with no compromises. For Mario fans, put this under your pillow at night. Very Highly Recommended.les also get an appropriately sizable chapter with 34 pages and 34 recipes, including some with Mario's favorite ingredient, Guanciale (Note: Dean and Delucca in Greenwich Village carries Guanciale).

Buy It!	`Authentic Mexican' by notable Chicago chef and Mexican cuisine expert, Rick Bayless and wife Deann Groen Bayless is easily one of the very best books on basic Mexican cuisine. For a subject which is so big that Bayless has devoted at least three other books to it, not to mention the five thick volumes from fellow Mexico culinarian Diana Kennedy, it is hard to describe this as a comprehensive treatment of Mexican cuisine, as it weights in at only 380 pages, compared to the over 450 pages Penelope Casas devotes to much smaller Spain and 480 pages Diana Kochilas devotes to even smaller Greece. But don't let any of this put you off. This is, I am certain, one of the very best sources of information on true Mexican food for us gringos. I am almost certain that Bayless' coverage of Mexico is much better for the state of Oaxaca than for many other regions. I see this name pop up far more than any others and I have read that this is one of his favorite parts of Mexico.<br /><br />The stated impetus to Bayless' writing this book lies in the fact that in spite of the close contact between Mexico and the United States, Mexican food in the US has undergone the same kind of metamorphosis as we find in Italian-American food.<br /><br />It is an interesting exercise to highlight what is distinctive about Mexican cooking to cite the differences between Mexican and Spanish cuisines.<br /><br />While Spanish cuisine is all about olives and grapes, neither of these two products transplanted well to Mexico. Thus, Mexico did not acquire any taste for many of the things you can do with olive oil and vinegar. For these key tastes, they had animal fat and citrus juice. While Spain took to the tomato and the potato, they did not take to corn (maize). And, oddly, while Spain adopted sweet peppers like they were long lost sons, they did not take to the very picante hot chiles. And, while chocolate became very popular as a drink, it never pervaded Spanish dishes the way it runs through Mexican dishes.<br /><br />Many cookbooks of this type include the seemingly obligatory chapters on ingredients, techniques, and equipment. And, many times these sections are a waste of time in that they are incomplete, and someone not familiar with the subject will not know they are incomplete. None of this is true of Bayless' appendices on ingredients and tools. The depth of Bayless' treatment of important subjects such as chilis is just short of magnificent.<br /><br />Like every good cookbook on an ethnic cuisine, Bayless gives both the English and Spanish names for all dishes, and some naming contains little surprises. The very first recipe for `Salsa Mexicana' looks very familiar, yet I have never seen a recipe with that name before. It turns out that this is the authentic version of what we gringos call the `pico de gallo'.<br /><br />Practically every recipe contains several important cooks' notes on techniques, ingredients, and planning ahead.<br /><br />The book contains a chapter on practically every major subject in Mexican cuisine, including special chapters on Tortillas, Masa, Tacos, Turnovers and their Fillings, Enchiladas, Moles, and Drinks. The level of detail in the explanation of the recipes would make Julia Child proud. The one major subject on which Bayless does not seem to touch is bread baking. The easiest way to supplement this book with material on Mexican baking is to get Diana Kennedy's book `In My Mexican Kitchen'.<br /><br />One odd aspect of this book for which I blame publisher Morrow's editors is the less than fluid prose. Bayless is much too good with his facts to state any errors of fact or even judgment, but his sentences have this vague feeling of clumsiness about them, as if he is using just a few too many words and he is trying to achieve an effect with an odd choice of words which doesn't work. As Senor Bayless is a masterful cook and interpreter of a major world cuisine, I write this off as the result of the author's first book being edited on a budget.first book being edited on a budget. <br />	2005-05-03

Tolkien is often described as the prequel to the much longer `Lord of the Rings'. I often thought that designation simply does not do justice to the importance of this little `children's' book.<br /><br />I have an almost reverential respect for the novel, having bought my first copy of this work on a cold February day in 1965 in the Lehigh University bookstore. I began reading it on the bus on the way home from my college classes at about 1:00 PM, and simply could not put it down. I finished reading it at about 8:30 that evening. The experience is not unlike Dorothy's opening the door of her Kansas house to step out onto the grass of Oz. I am totally unsurprised by a statement that says that the entire first page of `The Hobbit' has been reproduced in `Bartlett's Familiar Quotations'. There are few more magical or evocative openings to novels I have read in my whole life. I can appreciate that there are adult readers such as my Hemingway loving uncle who simply `don't get it'. I am often driven to the point of dispair when I can't interest young readers or listeners in `The Hobbit'. Like `Winnie the Pooh' and `Alice in Wonderland', I really think these are books designed much more to bring back memories of childhood in adults than to engage young readers. And oh how much I enjoy reading `The Hobbit' aloud!<br /><br />`The Hobbit' shares many similarities with `Alice in Wonderland' in that both authors were distinguished Oxford dons who created the works out of stories they made up for young listeners. The differences are as interesting as the similarities. While Charles Dodgson (Lewis Carroll) was a logician, Tolkien was a philologist. So, while both, in a sense, studied language, the differences in their avocations are evident in their text. Dodgson's works are full of logical curiosities and Tolkien's works are full of linguistic inventions, going so far as to create parts of at least three different languages to put into the mouths of his `Hobbit' and `Lord of the Rings' characters. But Tolkien went much further than simply creating languages. Even Carroll dabbled in creating words (see the poem `Jabberwocky'). Tolkien created whole histories of a huge continent ruled by demiurges very similar to the Olympian gods and populated by at least three races of immortal elves, seven clans of dwarves, dragons, trolls, giant spiders, goblins, shapeshifting men, giant eagles, intelligent wolves, and some horrors too unspeakable to bring up here, as they do not appear in `The Hobbit'.<br /><br />This history was probably not committed to paper as Tolkien was writing `The Hobbit', but it was certainly in the back of his mind. And, it is this sense of great depth to Middle Earth's history that gives one great added pleasure in reading this book.<br /><br />For the three adults who don't know the story of `The Hobbit', it is the tale of a band thirteen homeless dwarves lead by a former king of their clan, Thorin Oakenshield who wishes to reclaim his home and treasure from a rather large and rather cunning dragon named Smaug. Thorin meets up with the wizard, `Gandalf the Gray' and over a pint of ale, hatch the scheme of hiring a thief and raiding their treasure from right under the dragon's nose. The thief who Gandalf selects is a most unlikely adventurer, a hobbit who is even more set in his comfortable ways than is usual for these very comfortable rural folk. But hobbits happen to have a few attributes that make them especially good at burglary. They are quiet in the extreme when sneaking up on something and they are exceptionally good with slings and hurling projectiles by hand.<br /><br />I will not tell much more of the plot, as the unfolding of the story is by far one of the greatest pleasures. This is in no way a character study; it's all about landing in trouble and getting out of it by the skin of their teeth. Aside from banishing a major league dragon from their cozy mines, the main point of the story is the finding of a magical golden ring, which is the jumping off point of `Lord of the Rings'.<br /><br />There is another less obvious connection between `The Hobbit' and `The Lord of the Rings'. Gandalf's support of Thorin's adventure is not done out of the goodness of his heart, it is done to remove a major calamity from the playing field before Sauron, the ultimate heavy in `The Lord of the Rings', can make use of Smaug. Even though dragons seem to be a pretty independent lot, there is no questions that Sauron could not bend even Smaug to his will, especially if Sauron recovered the `One Ring'.<br /><br />One thing which always disappointed me about the great historical back story behind `The Hobbit' and `The Lord of the Rings' is that the origin and history of the wizards in Middle Earth is never fully spelled out. The history of the elves is done in great detail, but little is directly told of Gandalf, Saruman, and the other three wizards. The only thing of which I can be sure is that unlike Beorn, the eagles, and humans, they are not native to Middle Earth. There is but a single reference to a race of magicians in `The Silmarillion', but neither the name Gandalf or Mithrandir appears anywhere in this last of Tolkien's major works.<br /><br />Since having read `The Hobbit' and `The Lord of the Rings', I have searched in vain for tales of equal quality and there are none. Arthurian legends come close and next to Gandalf, Merlin is easily my favorite fictional character, but Tolkien seems to have hit a mother lode of wonder and lore was before and remains hidden to other writers.s the finding of a magical golden ring, which is the jumping off point of `Lord of the Rings'.<br /><br />There is another less obvious connection between `The Hobbit' and `The Lord of the Rings'.

This means that all the meals are made for many servings at once rather than for a single serving at a time.<br /><br />Since all this is pretty obvious from the title and a quick read of the book's cover, let me say that I was just slightly disappointed by the fact that the book's recipes give only six to eight servings and not the 25 or more which would be needed at the restaurant. While I would (and have) criticized a home cooking book for giving recipes for twelve servings, there may be people (like me) who may really be interested in a good book of recipes for a large number of people for things like church dinners or bazaars. In all my reading and reviewing cookbooks over the last few years, I have found only a single volume which addresses cooking for a crowd. Waltuck's book doesn't even have any comments on how its recipes can be scaled up, in spite of the fact that I have seen advice that when you do scale up, it doesn't always work that you simply multiply all ingredients by two or four or eight or whatever. Spices and cooking water for rice are two things that come to mind as not easily scaleable. Waltuck's `lasagna for a crowd' recipe is one major exception to the six (6) to eight (8) serving scale. It serves twelve or more and needs a 16 x 9 inch baking pan.<br /><br />Now that all that grumbling is out of the way, let me say that the circumstances of this book's recipes result in lots of good meals based on easy techniques with inexpensive ingredients. The restaurant, after all, doesn't make any money on staff meals. This also means that the book is heavy on the soups, salads, roasts and stews and light on sautes. I do suspect, however, that some of the dishes that use pricy or unusual products such as crab meat or rabbit or quail may not be made very often. They are probably reserved for holidays and birthdays.<br /><br />While this book should not be taken as a teaching cookbook, it does contain many suggestions and much information on cooking which I have seen in few or no other books. I don't need to be convinced to use a food mill or be advised on techniques on defatting stock, but the advice on roasting beef has a lot more than I have seen elsewhere. It even gives us yet another trick for peeling lots of cloves of garlic a one time. Something you may not need for your usual Italian meal for four, but which you will need once you start in on Spanish dishes. Some of the advice may be familiar, but it is nice to have your beliefs reinforced, as when Waltuck suggests that potatoes always be boiled with their skins on, as boiling them peeled or, even worse, diced, makes them soggy and robs them of some of their flavor. The only exception is when boiling potatoes for mashed potatoes, as the point is to mash the spuds while they are still quite hot, and mere mortals without asbestos hands can't peel the hot spuds quick enough to get them mashed while still hot.<br /><br />One of the very best aspects of staff meals at a good restaurant, aside from the fact that the cooks are professionals, is that even the condiments such as salad dressings are `homemade', and this book is a very good source of recipes for all sorts of salad dressings, mayonnaises, remoulades, dips, and stocks.<br /><br />I must give credit for the book designers at publisher, Workmans, who seems to make a habit of putting a lot of careful thought into their book designs. I find myself admiring the look of their books (like this one) more than any other publisher except Alfred A. Knopf.<br /><br />This is a cookbook for which I suggest Bob Kinkead's advice. Kinkead has thousands of cookbooks, yet he practically never actually cooks a recipe straight from the book. So, I suggest you take this on as primarily an armchair cookbook, and expect that if you find a recipe in which you are especially interested, take it on in the knowledge that they have all been put through their paces by numerous talented professionals. And, I suspect that you will find much to improve your current favorite recipes.ctically never actually cooks a recipe straight from the book.

This was also in my sticky bun-baking period, before I gave it up as too much work and went back to straight breads.<br /><br />One of the main reasons the book sat unopened on my shelves for so long was the fact that the `killer sticky bun' recipe was simply not that killer. Do not believe anyone when they say they have an easy sticky bun recipe, because it probably means the end result will fall below expectations. Around the same time, I did a sticky bun recipe from funny baker Wayne Harley Brachman, and that one didn't come up to snuff anyway. Leave it to Julia Child to come through for me. I did the sticky bun recipe in `Baking with Julia' and it was a LOT of work, but it in fact surpassed anything you can get from the mall.<br /><br />But getting back to Sarah Foster's book, I have come back to it because I harbored s suspicion that there was some really good stuff in the book, and I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Part of my attraction is that I am a sucker for any cookbook that covers sandwiches. While I think Foster's sandwich recipes are not as interesting or as complete as those in Nancy Silverton's whole book devoted to the subject, they are a great resource if you happen to have no other source of ideas for sandwiches.<br /><br />Otherwise, the book covers everything you would expect, and it is especially strong on topics where you would expect expertise such as muffins, biscuits, scones, soups, salads, and egg dishes. On one of my favorite criteria for evaluating cookbooks, the recipe for a classic French omelet, Foster comes through like a champ. The only omelet tip she does not follow is to let the eggs come to room temperature before cracking and beating them, but then, this is probably quite impractical for a restaurant kitchen.<br /><br />She is also quite good on another of my favorite criteria, the making of stocks. Her recipes are very good for non-foodies and people who care not for haute cuisine, as they do not take very long to produce a very acceptable chicken, vegetable, or beef stock. My only reservations may be that some of her suggestions may lead to waste perfectly good poached chicken on the one hand and include less than edible vegetable cuttings into stocks. There is a reason some people are hyperfussy about stock making. These are but two of the reasons.<br /><br />I fully endorse Ms. Foster's recipes for muffins, biscuits, and scones. They are as good or better than recipes I have seen in books by professional bakers and books specializing in these subjects.<br /><br />The hardest aspect of whether it is worth buying this book is how if will complement your current cookbook collection. If you are a cookbook collector, the question is moot. Nothing will stop you from getting this notable title. On the other hand, if all you have is `The Joy of Cooking', this would be a welcome supplement, as like fellow Martha Stewart alumnae, Ina Garten's early cookbooks, all the recipes come from a commercial kitchen which depends on their products for good business and the products are relatively easy to make.<br /><br />This also means that the selection of recipes is very good fare for church bazaars and bake sales. While Foster is downsizing her recipes to household serving numbers, I am sure that her soups would work well at two to four to eight times her recipe size. Just be a little careful on multiplying some of the spicier ingredients.<br /><br />I find all the recipes extremely well written. They are full of important details for amateur chefs and unlike some books, everything is printed in good old fashioned black and white with a little highlight shading here and there for sidebars. And, several dishes are presented in living color photographs, and little real estate is taken up by cutsie pics of Foster's Market staff and customers. My only argument with the layout of the book is the chapter title pages where the names of the recipes are written in a kind of multicolored hodgepodge, similar to the maddening typography in Jamie Oliver's otherwise excellent cookbooks.<br /><br />Fostering this kind of material is what made Martha Stewart so respectable in what she did on her shows. Of this genre of cookbook, this is a very good sample. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for recipes from this `feel good market' venue. I think, for example, that it is more value for the money than Ina Garten's first cookbook.iving color photographs, and little real estate is taken up by cutsie pics of Foster's Market staff and customers.

The Regional Cooking of Spain	Books	5	19	22	N	Y	Excellent, Entertaining Survey of Regional Spanish Cuisine	`Delicioso!' and `Paella!' are leading Spanish cuisine writer Penelope Casas' latest books, following her similar pair, `Tapas' and `The Food and Wine of Spain'. In many ways, the later books are more similar to one another than they are to the earlier books. Both concentrate on regional cuisines. While the paella is certainly made throughout Spain, the dish originated in Valencia with many other rice dishes, described in `Delicioso!' as `region of the rices'.<br /><br />Similarly, while `Delicioso!' covers all of Spain, it is not, like `The Food and Wine of Spain', a work which is intended to touch all aspects of the country's cuisine, although it is an excellent supplement to the earlier work. Since `Delicioso!' is organized by region and `The Food...' is organized by type of dish, they are like the warp and weft of the same piece of cloth. While the latter book provides the support and strength, giving us all the details about technique, ingredients, and wines, the former book enlivens the discussion by going into depth on selected regional specialities such as four different Tortilla Espanola recipes from Andalucia (Sevilla, Granada, Cadiz, Cordoba, Gibraltar) on the southwestern corner of Spain, which Casas baptizes as `The Region of Fried Foods & Gazpachos'. This chapter may give the historically naïve a notion that the Spanish Celts somehow brought a love of potatoes to Spain. The fact is exactly the opposite, as it was the Spanish who introduced the potato to Europe, specifically through the ports of Cadiz and Granada rather than the spud's coming from Ireland into northern Celtic Spain of Galicia.<br /><br />Casas dubs Galicia as `The Region of the Sauces', which is entirely appropriate as it is very close culinarily and geographically to France. The other most important aspect of Galician cuisine is its seafood. Aside from being a coastal province, it benefits from deep fjord which harbor a much wider variety of species than can be found on less variegated coasts. It also shares with close neighbor Portugal a tradition of sailing far afield, as far as the Grand Banks off Newfoundland to fish for cod and trade in bacalao (salted, dried cod).<br /><br />The provinces of Aragon and Navarra in the interior border with France in the northeast (location of Pamplona and Zaragoza) are named `Region of the Peppers'. But, one thing that strikes me as I go through this book is how pervasive certain foods are throughout Spanish cuisine. Every region makes heavy use of sweet peppers, especially in the form of pimiento and paprika. While Aragon is `...Peppers', the recipe for stuffed pepper is in the chapter on `...Sauces'. As of this reading, I have not yet sensed a great divide as there is between northern and southern Italy. I do not hold this against Casas' culinary expertise of against this book, as I am entranced by the variety of the recipes within the world of important Spanish products.<br /><br />The most interesting aspect of the `Region of the Casseroles', Spain's southeastern Mediterranean coast of Catalunya (including major port Barcelona) is in the cooking in Spanish earthenware. This is the point at which I regret that Ms. Casas was not more photographically oriented, as a book based on location would be well served by a decent number of photographs, including some nice snaps of these earthenware cookpots. As the region closest to Provence and Northern Italy, I sense a lot of similarity in the use of garlic, greens, bread, and thick soups. In fact, I am constantly amazed by how much garlic shows up in Spanish recipes. The eight (8) to sixteen (16) cloves specified for some recipes would make a Sicilian blanche.<br /><br />Landlocked central Spain of Castilla, Extremadura, and Castilla-La Mancha (including Madrid, Salamanca, Segovia, and Guadalupe) is baptized as the `Region of the Roasts'. I am quite surprised, after seeing recipe after recipe and paean after paean to tapas, Tortilla Espanola, and paella, to findthis chapter identifying the Cocido, `a meal-in-a-pot' based on chickpeas, vegetables, and meats, that has been praised in poetry and lauded in popular song...' as the `National Dish' of Spain. This in spite of the fact that the recipes look remarkably like the French Cassolet, with a few changes in ingredients. But then, this is why we don't limit our culinary reading to `The Joy of Cooking'. Having said that, I am surprised that Casas gives us but a single recipe for cocido. What I do see is more recipes for potatoes, eggs, leafy green vegetables, and asparagus. The roasts of the region are primarily lamb, pig, and chicken, heavy on braising and marinading.<br /><br />The southeastern Spain of Valencia is, obviously, `The Region of the Rices', the home of the paella and saffron. Amazingly, it was not the Romans (who introduced olives and grapes to Hispania) but the Moors who introduced rice and the irrigation techniques needed to cultivate it to Valencia. I will say much more about paella in my review of the book `Paella!' but I do note that Casas does not duplicate any specific recipes across the two books, although there are many similar recipes, as seafood, game, meat, and mixed paella recipes appear in both books.<br /><br />The previously mentioned `Region of Fried Foods' also happens to be the region of Sherry and Sherry vinegar. This means that sherry vinegar is a much more important ingredient in Andalucia than in most other parts of Spain.<br /><br />The last region and the one closest to the New World is the Canary Islands, fittingly entitled `The Region of the Mojos'. This is appropriate as it gives a subtle link to the cuisine of Mexico. Casas and other writers often point out that there are few similarities between the cuisines of Spain and Mexico, but there are some, and the spicy dipping sauces of the Canaries are one hint of the overlap.<br /><br />If your cookbook shelf is limited, get `Delicioso!'. If you are a paella fanatic, get `Paella!', but consider both.his chapter identifying the Cocido, `a meal-in-a-pot' based on chickpeas, vegetables, and meats, that has been praised in poetry and lauded in popular song...' as the `National Dish' of Spain.

Buy it if you like Rice	`Delicioso!' and `Paella!' are leading Spanish cuisine writer Penelope Casas' latest books, following her similar pair, `Tapas' and `The Food and Wine of Spain'. In many ways, the later books are more similar to one another than they are to the earlier books. Both concentrate on regional cuisines. While the paella is certainly made throughout Spain, the dish originated in Valencia with many other rice dishes, described in `Delicioso!' as the `Region of the Rices'.<br /><br />The first thing which strikes me about the dish, paella, is that unlike its close Mediterranean neighbor, bouillabaisse, and in spite of some Valencian purists orthodoxy, paella can be just about anything under the sun which will fit into a paella pan and contain rice, olive oil, and garlic. In fact, even the requirement that the dish contain rice is stretched to the braking point when some recipes even replace rice with pasta. Thus, paella has much more in common with pizza than it does with bouillabaisse.<br /><br />As Ms. Casas writes recipes as a culinary archeologist by visiting lots of Spanish restaurants and homes to sample their dishes, I am not surprised at her claim that even after finishing this 220 page book on a single dish, she feels she has just touched the surface of the paella varieties. Well, not exactly, as I find enough similarity between recipes to sense that there is really not a lot of variation in the basic technique, just in the additions to the rice, oil, saffron, and garlic.<br /><br />The book divides paellas into four great families. The first and best known are the seafood paellas which join the rice of Valencia with the seafood of the Mediterranean. These dishes are just about every combination you can imagine of scallops, shrimp, clams, mussels, lobster, crab, squid, monkfish, salmon, and cod with mushrooms, pepper, egg, peas, and other vegetables. I suspect that the most important ingredient in all these dishes is the fish stock. Ms. Casas includes a chapter on stocks and other pantry recipes. Like most other journalistic culinary writers, and unlike most writers who are professional chefs such as Jasper White and James Peterson, her stock recipes are pretty simple. This is probably a good thing unless you are cooking for a serious gourmet. For restaurant cooking, her stock recipes are much too extravagant, as they make no use of material that has no value for any other purpose such as fish heads and bones. The other side of the coin is that for the amateur, their only weakness is cost, which means that someone is much more likely to try their hand at making them, since they are really very easy. And, they will almost certainly be an improvement over supermarket stocks, especially for fish stocks. I happily use newer chicken stocks from the supermarket, but avoid fish stocks and clam juice. The trick is to find a fishmonger who will save fish heads for you. See Jasper White's '50 Chowders' for a super fish stock.<br /><br />The second great paella family replaces fish with meat, poultry, and game. The most common ingredients are chicken, pork, sausage, rabbit, duck, quail, and lamb. A remarkably large number of these recipes call for marinated meats, which, according to `Delicioso!' seems to be a common technique throughout Spain. The book brings up an odd fact about Spanish history and it's love of pork. When the Moors were expelled from Spain, the Jews where shown the door at the same time as the Jews and the Moors shared a prohibition against eating pork. A result of this passion for pork is the great Spanish hams, Serrano and jamon. Unfortunately, the more flavorful of the two, the jamon, is not available in the United States. Fortunately, it is very similar to procuitto de Parma, so there is a very acceptable substitute for these Spanish recipes. One surprise in this chapter is that the classic Valencia Paella recipe is made from chicken and rabbit rather than from seafood.<br /><br />The third great paella family is those dishes that combine protein from land and sea and air. While there are dozens of recipes in the first two chapters, this chapter has but three.<br /><br />The fourth land of paella is for the vegetarians, where flesh protein is replaced primarily by cheese, nuts, and beans, with anchovies thrown in for some fishy flavor. What surprises me is that there are no seaweed paellas in this chapter, as seaweed does appear as an ingredient in seafood paellas.<br /><br />It is no surprise whatsoever that Casas makes a strong case for using a short grained Spanish rice for paellas. It is easy to understand this, as one step in paella making is very similar to the Italian risotto technique, and, fortunately, risotto rice such as arborio or carnaroli will stand in very nicely for Spanish rice.<br /><br />One puzzling statement Casas repeats in virtually every recipe is the claim that paellas cook a lot differently in gas and electric ovens. The difference is so great that for the latter heating source, she adds five to ten degrees to oven temperature and five to ten minutes to cooking times. While I am certain Ms. Casas knows what she is talking about, I have to suspect she may be speaking of experiences with Spanish ovens and not the modern American Maytag. But, I will consider us warned and suggest you develop a good sense of doneness and use your eyes and nose rather than your timer to evaluate your paellas.<br /><br />While the book ends with a very nice chapter on Spanish desserts, I would not make that a consideration in whether or not one should buy this book. If you are a vegetarian, serious rice head, or in love with Spanish cuisine, get this book. Also, I would strongly recommend this to any general foodie / cookbook collector over any works by any other writer on Spanish cooking.amily is those dishes that combine protein from land and sea and air.

Must Buy for Foodies	`Thai Food' by Australian chef, restaurant owner, and Thai food scholar David Thompson is one of those books which, if you have an enduring interest in food, you genuinely regret it took any more than a few days since its publication to acquire, read, and assimilate the book's material. It is one of those books where you can open it to virtually any page and find evidence of its quality.<br /><br />I recall some reviews of this book which noted that although it was certainly comprehensive, it may be criticized for giving recipes containing hard to find ingredients. While I think this is a valid criticism of a book advertised as having recipes for the home cook such as `Vatch's Thai Kitchen' by chef Vatcharin Bhumichitr, it is not a valid criticism of a scholarly book where the object of the author is to present an accurate picture of a national cuisine. And, Thompson has done this as well or better than virtually every good survey of national cuisines I have reviewed such as Diane Kochilas `The Glorious Foods of Greece', Jean Anderson's smaller book on `The Food of Portugal', Marcella Hazan's `Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking', Diana Kennedy and Rick Bayless various books on Mexican cuisines and the granddaddy of them all, Julia Child's `Mastering the Art of French Cooking'. This may be just a bit unfair to these authors, as not all of them were aiming at a grand scholarly treatment of an entire cuisine. Child, for example, was giving us `cuisine bourgeois', leaving the three other types of classic French cooking to others. Kennedy and Bayless have covered Mexico in not one, but in at least two or three different books, with Kennedy's latest, `From My Mexican Kitchen' being a model treatment of some special subjects in a national cuisine.<br /><br />Thompson has covered the whole range of Thai cooking, including very good essays on Thai history and geographical regions and the regional influences on Thai cuisine. One look at the map of Thailand and you can see how broadly different one part of the country may be from another. The northern section virtually pokes its head into the China, and Chinese make up about 11% of the population, as they seem to do in virtually every country on which they border or every nearby island group such as the Philippines. Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam surround the Northeast. The southern peninsula borders on Malaysia. The central rice-growing region is close to Burma and India. There are some parts of the country such as the far north and northeast to which it was literally impractical to travel from capital Bangkok until the mid-1920's when a railroad was build from Bangkok to Chiang Mai on the Ping river.<br /><br />While China, India heavily influences Thai cooking, and it's Southeast Asian neighbors, it is also different from China and India in important ways. While the wok is important to Thai cooking, it is not used in the same way as their Chinese neighbors. The most traditional Thai wok is actually earthenware, replaced by brass upon contact with European traders. `Traditional Thai stir-frying was not the fierce and furious method of the Chinese, but gentle frying over radiant heat in an earthenware pot.' It is obvious in this very same paragraph that Thompson is not a `scientific' food scholar, as he correctly states that the proper technique is to heat the wok before adding the oil, but describes the level of heat as `white hot'. White-hot temperatures are found only in the centers of stars, not in Bangkok kitchens. Nevertheless, his cooking advice is solid and entirely consistent with observations made by Shirley Corriher on heating metal pans before adding oil.<br /><br />Every major cuisine has their classic techniques for preserving food. In fact, one may almost measure the sophistication of a cuisine by their representative preparation and preservation methods. The Italian cuisine is one of the world's leaders because of their cheese-making for milk preservation, salumi techniques for preserving meats, drying and curing methods with ham, winemaking and olive oil techniques, and salting techniques for fish and capers. While salt is a signature ingredient of Mediterranean cuisine, it is simply not as common in southeast Asia, so Thailand and surrounding countries extending as far north as Korea use fermentation as their primary preservation technique. It seems they simply ferment everything the can get their hands on, such as bamboo shoots, bean curd, fish, rice, watercress, and soybeans. Like the Italians with Parmesan and anchovies, the fermented products are often sources for adding saltiness to dishes.<br /><br />When I go to a Thai restaurant or look at recipes in popular Thai cookbooks, many Thai dishes seem to be a mix of a great number of ingredients. Thompson, on the other hand, states that the ideal of a Thai salad is simplicity, but it is also about a balancing of ingredients, as exemplified in Alford and Duguid's book title, `Hot, Sour, Salty, Sweet'. I will venture the hypothesis that this great mix of tastes comes from the intersection of the sour of fermented ingredients and the strong capsasian chiles used to combat the oppressive Thai heat.<br /><br />Some people, even some foodies, may be inclined to dismiss this book as simply not a type of cooking with which they have any interest. I would recommend they get and read much of this book anyway. One example is the chapter on salads. In spite of the great difference in ingredients, I find a remarkable similarity between Thai and French salad making. This means that Thompson's essay and survey of Thai salads contains some insights into saladmaking that you simply may not get anywhere else. Even if you never go out of your way to find red shallots, holy basil, or Kaffir lime leaves, there is much you can learn here!<br /><br />This book should be on the shelves of anyone who wishes to be sophisticated about food.techniques for preserving meats, drying and curing methods with ham, winemaking and olive oil techniques, and salting techniques for fish and capers.

Anderson is published by J.R.R. Tolkien's American publisher, Houghton Mifflin (important because it means the cover of this book uses the same art as the cover of the most popular hard-covered American edition of the Hobbit, published in the 1960's).<br /><br />Let me be perfectly clear that this is first and foremost a review of the Annotation, not of the novel, `The Hobbit' itself. I have an almost reverential respect for the original novel, having bought my first copy of this work on a cold February day in 1965 in the Lehigh University bookstore. I began reading it on the bus on the way home from my college classes at about 1:00 PM, and simply could not put it down. I finished reading it at about 8:30 that evening. The experience is not unlike some cinematic versions of experiences like Dorothy's opening the door of her Kansas house to step out onto the grass of Oz. I am totally unsurprised by a statement in this annotation that says that the entire first page of `The Hobbit' has been reproduced in `Bartlett's Familiar Quotations'. There are few more magical or evocative openings to novels I have read in my whole life. And, while I can appreciate that there are adult readers, my Hemingway loving uncle being one of them, who simply `don't get it', I am often driven to the point of dispair when I can't interest young readers or listeners in `The Hobbit'. Like `Winnie the Pooh' and `Alice in Wonderland', I really think these are books designed much more to bring back memories of childhood in adults than to engage young readers. And oh how much I enjoy reading `The Hobbit' aloud!<br /><br />But back to this Annotation'. Like similar annotations to works of fiction such as `Alice in Wonderland' and the Arthur Conan Doyle stories of Sherlock Holmes, there are four different subjects for annotation. One is internal; where names and events are cross-referenced to other parts of the work to explain, elaborate, resolve, or point out inconsistencies. The second is external, where correspondences can be made to sources or, in the case of Conan Doyle or Carroll, events of the day that may have found their way into the fiction. The third is references to the author's unpublished notes and letters. Tolkien's works should be rich sources for all three types of annotation, as the world of `The Hobbit' and `The Lord of the Rings' is based on an enormous body of Norse, Celtic, and Teutonic mythology, fable, and epic literature. Also, standing behind `The Hobbit' is the great events of `The Lord of the Rings', `The Silmarillion', and over twelve volumes of Tolkien writings compiled and annotated by Christopher Tolkien.<br /><br />So why are the annotations in this volume so sparse? The author certainly does not limit himself to only one kind of annotation. There are examples of all three references to other Tolkien works, notes and letters, and other sources. The author does give us lots of illustrations of scenes from `The Hobbit' published in translations of the work from around the world. There are also a few illustrations from books that certainly influenced Tolkien, such as `The Marvelous Land of Snergs'. The one thing that all these illustrations tell me is that, on average, they are not very good, oriented primarily towards a children's audience rather than some of the more heroic art familiar to us from modern fantasy illustrators. It seems to me a lost opportunity also to not include Tolkien's own color illustrations for `The Hobbit', as they appeared on the very first `Tolkien' calendar in, I believe 1966 or 1967.<br /><br />I will give just a few illustrations of where I think the author may have disappointed his readers. By far the most interesting character in `The Hobbit' next to Bilbo and Gandalf is Smaug. And yet, the book has next to nothing to say about the fictional antecedents of that delightfully cagey old worm. One of my only fond memories of the rather insipid cartoon version of `The Hobbit' done several decades ago is the gravely voice of Smaug done by Paladin himself, Richard Boone. If you couldn't get John Huston, then Boone was certainly the next best thing. To the whole conversation between Bilbo and Smaug, there are but two notes regarding Smaug and dragons. At least we get a reference about the source of Smaug's name, a primitive Germanic verb, `smugan' meaning to squeeze through a hole. Tolkien confessed that this was `a low philological jest'. In the wider story culminating in the great events of `The Lord of the Rings' coming at the end of the Third Age, it is much more important to Gandalf to remove this great dragon from the field so Sauron could not use him as a weapon in the War of the Rings than it was to restore a small band of dwarves to their treasures. The book has practically nothing to say about this, or the fact that the character of the `necromancer' who takes up residence at the southwestern tip of Mirkwood forest is actually either the leader of the Nazgul or Sauron himself.<br /><br />I keep thinking, as I turn each page of ample, empty white margins, all the things that could have been included.<br /><br />In balance, this is not a bad book or even a poor purchase, especially if, like me, you simply must have a copy of every different version of Tolkien's works imaginable. It has a very nice bibliography and an Appendix of all textual changes between the 1937 and 1966 editions. For those notes it does have, it is great as a version to read to children where you can record your own notes with answers to their questions.artoon version of `The Hobbit' done several decades ago is the gravely voice of Smaug done by Paladin himself, Richard Boone.

Fair.	`Vatch's Thai Kitchen' by chef Vatcharin Bhumichitr is a relatively inexpensive (cover price $24.95) collection of recipes and adaptations of recipes he prepares in his various restaurants in London and Miami. My first impression is that this is a book on the fast track to the budget tables at Borders and Barnes and Noble, as it is in an oversized format with big pictures and a less than big name publisher. But one can be wrong about these things, so I press on.<br /><br />If a book is very good (at least five stars) or very bad (three stars or less), you can tell it after reading a page or two. I cannot tell after a few pages whether this book is very good or very bad, so there is a good chance that you can also reliably assign four stars after just two or three pages, but I will go further, because it is easy for a four star book to still have strong appeal to a special audience.<br /><br />There are at least two special audiences that can do better than this book. The first is easily those who want a taste of real Thai cooking from an authoritative source. As luck would have it, there is an excellent, authoritative book in English on Thai cooking, the book `Thai Food' by David Thompson', published by Ten Speed Press. While this book lists for $40, it has 670 pages compared to the thin 144 pages from chef Vatch. Thompson's book has been criticized for being pretty parochial for requiring a lot of hard to find Thai ingredients.<br /><br />Bhumichitr's book promises to give recipes one can make with ingredients available at your local supermarket. Well, I think not. He has several recipes that make use of ingredients I tend to have a hard time finding even at my local megamart. Lemongrass is becoming pretty common these days, but I still cannot find Kafir lime leaves on a regular basis, and I have never found fresh galangal, even in New York City in Chinatown, Dean and Delucca, or Zabars. The best I did was a tin of dried galangal. So, if you are going to the trouble of ordering ingredients through the Internet, why not simply get Thompson's authoritative book to begin with.<br /><br />I also found more than one case where the basic style of Thai food as described by Thompson is violated by Bhumichitr's dishes. Thompson says Thai salads are simple affairs with little added to distract from the featured ingredient. Bhumichitr's salads seem to have everything but the kitchen sink.<br /><br />I have other difficulties with this book. While I am usually willing to forgive a few minor errors in recipe writing, they usually mean that a book containing such lapses in editing are not suitable for beginning cooks, since an experienced cook will easily think through the lapses. In this book, I think the prep instructions are not very carefully checked, as there are several times when I believe the intention was to peal vegetables, yet there is no mention of this step. I am also not thrilled about the author's stating that deep-frying can be done with equal ease with either a wok or a deep fryer.<br /><br />The introductory section on ingredients looks good, but I think it is only fair at best. There are several Asian ingredients used in the recipes that are not covered in the chapter on ingredients. I also question some of the statements in this section, as when the author says that galangal was `immensely popular' in late Medieval Europe. I checked my medieval cookbooks and found it mentioned in only one out of three books, and only in a minor role in a few less common recipes. There was no mention of it in my Renaissance cookbook. Much of the effort going into this section is wasted, as there are pictures of some of the ingredients, but nothing to connect those pictures to the text. Tsk, tsk.<br /><br />So this book is certainly of little value for people interested in authentic Thai cuisine or to people interested in easy Thai cooking. One audience that may find value here is experienced Thai cooks who want to add interesting entertaining recipes to their arsenal. Many of the recipes are easy, with very fancy, elaborate looking results. For that purpose, almost every recipe is accompanied by a better than average photograph of the dish. This is not something you will get from `Thai Food', so, if this is your cup of tea, then this book will help you.<br /><br />While I have not reviewed it, if you are interested in Thai cooking and find Thompson's book a bit dry, try Alford and Duguid's book `Hot, Sour, Salty, Sweet'.esting entertaining recipes to their arsenal.

Good cheese too	`Home Cheese Making', 3rd Edition, formerly `Cheesemaking Made Easy' by cheesemaking equipment supplier, Ricki Carroll is one of those books like Sandor Ellix Katz's book `Wild Fermentation' and Sally Fallon's Nourishing Traditions' which a dedicated foodie should read, if only to appreciate exactly how cheese is made and to thereby appreciate the differences between hard and soft cheeses as well as cheeses made from cow, goat, buffalo, and sheep milk. The procedures for cheesemaking can give us a much closer connection between everyday cooking and the transformations which turn milk into cheese than can be achieved by even a close reading of Harold McGee's chapter on milk in `On Food and Cooking'.<br /><br />Aside from dedicated foodies and the armchair foodies whose experience is largely from Food Network travelogues, there is the hard core cheese hobbyist and unregenerated counterculture `Whole Earth Catalogue Hippie' who grows a lot of their own food and makes their own wine or beer to foster an independence from commercial products. This book is really for you.<br /><br />The first thing which both pleased and surprised me about the book is that it does not limit itself to soft, fresh cheeses such as queso blanco, mozzarella, cream cheese, mascarpone and mozzarella. It doesn't even stop at cured mozzarella, giving provolone. It goes all the way to the hard grana cheeses such as Romano and Parmesan, plus cheddar, blue cheeses, and the soft cured cheeses (Brie, Camembert, Limburger) along the way.<br /><br />One thing I should not minimize is that while the learning curve from conventional cooking to cheesemaking is not very steep, the investment in time, equipment, and special techniques for cleaning and sterilization may be a bit more than you will encounter when you get into some new culinary fields such as bread baking, souffles, and preserves. While buttermilk and cr&egrave;me fraiche may be pretty easy, even a product as simple as cottage cheese requires at least two specialized ingredients not carried by your local megamart.<br /><br />In fact, if you are already familiar with the techniques involved in home beer brewing, canning, pickling, or wine making, you are probably already halfway to having the necessary skills and space needed to do serious cheesemaking. Unfortunately, this does not give you a leg up to access to the best raw materials. I suspect that serious cheesemaking for most types of cheeses may be beyond the resources of a typical city apartment or condo dweller, unless you have the time to take regular trips to farms to obtain the right kinds of milk. While I have not looked for them in New York City, I suspect that even Zabars doesn't have a lot of the raw materials you will need for recipes in this book.<br /><br />While my favorite megamart does have only conventionally pasteurized cow's milk, it has no goat's milk, sheep's milk, unpasteurized milk, or single pasteurized cream. The very best location for getting into serious cheesemaking is probably in a standalone house and garage located close to goodly supply of dairy farmers. Living close to people like the Amish or Mennonites who just may do this on a regular basis, not to mention have a handy supply of raw cow's milk may be the very best venue for mastering cheesemaking.<br /><br />It occurs to me that I have not given this book enough credit. In addition to many recipes for some very, very serious long-term cheese making, there are a number of recipes for things such as buttermilk, cr&egrave;me fraiche, sour cream, kefir, yogurt, butter, ghee, paskha and clotted cream. Unlike recipes you may find in most general cookbooks, the recipes for buttermilk, sour cream, and cr&egrave;me fraiche are not `approximations' or close substitutes. They are the real deal, which means that the recipes call for the kind of starter culture that can only be bought from a speciality mail order source.<br /><br />Note that while the book does cover some simple yogurt recipes, I would not push it as a book on yogurt making. If that is your real interest, look for a title specializing in yogurt.<br /><br />The general utility of the book is further enhanced by Chapter 11 that includes a quick course on the proper techniques for cutting and serving cheese. This same chapter contains several recipes for staple products using buttermilk, ricotta, fromage blanc, and yogurt. These are mostly breads, muffins and biscuits. It also has several recipes for dairy-based dips, spreads, dressings, appetizers, salads, pizzas, and veggie dishes. Personally, if I ever wanted to go beyond the fringe with foodie mania, I would much sooner go in the direction of cheese making and artisinal breads than towards the raw food doctrines. Those ancient Greeks and Romans knew a good thing when they saw it!<br /><br />It will probably not be lost on you that the book's author happens to be in the business (New England Cheesemaking Supply Company) of selling equipment for making cheese in small batches, so the book is pretty self serving, but it is still an excellent introduction to the craft with several references to sources other than the author's own company. The end of the book also gives a generous number of references to artisinal cheesemakers, cheesemaking journals, and a very nice bibliography with some more advanced texts.ecipes, I would not push it as a book on yogurt making.

Not the best.	`Quick & Easy' is the first of Martin Yan's cookbooks I have reviewed. While Yan has been around for a very long time and while his venue on PBS follows in the very distinguished footsteps of Julia Child, I always felt about him the same as I feel now about Emeril Lagasse. He seems to be much more of a showman and popularizer than a serious cook. But then, there is nothing wrong with popularizers who promote preparation of good food, as long as they are not gimmicky with lots of packaged and processed ingredients, like Poppy Cannon of Ladies magazine columns in the 1950's. I have no trouble showing respect for Rachael Ray in spite of an early aversion to her Pollyanna personality.<br /><br />I always have certain expectations when I review any cookbook and if a book simply matches those expectations, I peg it at four stars. If it exceeds my expectations, it gets five stars, and if it falls below those expectations, it gets three stars. Two stars for wastes of money and one star for total rip-offs. I usually spot the three star and the five star markers on the second or third page, usually on the first page. One of the best examples I can give of a five star book is Bob Kinkead's book on his seafood restaurant's dishes. More to the point may be Jacque Pepin's most recent book, `Fast Food My Way'. The opposite case is represented by several of Charlie Trotter's books I have reviewed, where the material all seems to be written for a very small audience of professionals or people with some extreme tastes and beliefs about food.<br /><br />As with Pepin's book, my expectations upon opening Yan's book are somewhat low, as I view the book as a case of jumping on one of the several fashionable cookbook bandwagons. `Quick and Easy' cooking sells books, or at least creates more interest in books than a simple new book of Oriental recipes may do. Since Yan is an old hand at pleasing an audience, it is no surprise to find no major weaknesses in the book. But, after reading many, many pages and after finding a few Alton Brownish concerns with the accuracy of some statements, I simply cannot find anything which `lights me up with enthusiasm' for the book.<br /><br />Yan starts out with two statements which, to my mind, conflict with one another. The first, to my surprise, is his endorsing using a wok with a nonstick surface. While this may not be a major concern when cooking oil is in play, it has been said that artificial non-stick surfaces simply do not brown as well as bare metal. The synthetic coating does not get as hot. The statement that really concerns me is his recommending, in virtually every recipe, over and over again, to heat the wok to high heat before adding the oil. If we were dealing with a traditional plain metal wok, this would be excellent advice. I believe Shirley Corriher has ventured the opinion that high heat on bare metal closes microscopic fissures in the metal, reducing the tendency of hot protein to stick to the pan. The problem with heating the artificial nonstick surface is that many have said this is dangerous, as the hot fluorocarbon coating gives off toxic gasses if not buffered with cooking oil. While Yan does not present this book as a primer on stir-frying, he does give several very good tips on stir-frying, so it is odd that this anomaly gets through. The proper thing for him to have said here was to use a properly seasoned wok, which is typically seasoned in much the same way as a cast iron skillet.<br /><br />More than anything else, this little slip makes me suggest that a novice cook not use this book. But for people who are both experienced and adept at Oriental cooking, this is a pretty good book. As Yan says himself, `stir-fry' is fast, but it requires a LOT of attention. For home cooks who are most comfortable with French braises, soups, and stews, stir-frying may be a major challenge. While the book presents some tips on stir-frying prep, it does not present a good primer on the technique. For that, you should go to either `The Breath of a Wok' by Grace Young or, even better, Ken Hom's  `Quick Wok' or `Foolproof Chinese Cooking'.<br /><br />Wok cooking requires a whole reorientation of your cooking plans. Unlike a soup or stew, a stir-fried dish will require 100% of your attention for as long as it takes to cook all of your prepped food. And, while a single batch may be done in a few minutes, a home-sized wok on a home-sized gas or electric burner may only be able to do half or a quarter of the four to six servings you need.<br /><br />Chinese cooking, and Oriental cooking in general, is probably something you do not want to take up for one or two meals a month. If I were to embark on making Chinese dishes, I would plan a course of at least six months worth of meals to really get into the rhythm of Wok, steamer, and rice cooking techniques. You simply cannot switch over to Chinese techniques the way you can switch around between French, Italian, Spanish, and German dishes. Making one or two oriental dishes a month will probably mean wasting money on perishable goods such as sticky rice, lemongrass, oyster sauce, black vinegar, and ginger. If your family can take to it, buy yourself a rice cooker, a carbon steel wok, and bamboo steamers and do it up right, making these Chinese dishes at least twice a week.<br /><br />I recommend this book as a supplement to fast Oriental cooking, if you know how to do it in the first place and need some quick Chinese recipes.e.

While this event may simply confirm the author's observation that while French women are securely under the influence of the French culture, they follow practices that keep them slim. But this doesn't work either, as no sooner does Ms. Guiliano move to Paris, she falls under the influence of the great Paris patisseries, of which there seem to be at least five or six on the route between her flat and the University.<br /><br />None of this is meant to talk you out of buying this highly useful little book, especially since it's sales suggest that there is more than enough interest going around in this book. I only point it out to temper your expectations that there is some secret here to staying thin. There are lots of excellent ideas here about staying thin, plus a rather conventional regimen for getting thin in the first place, but few if any of these are great mysteries. It's just that no one, to my knowledge, has brought them all together in one place as this book does in a very digestible little package.<br /><br />The very best thing about this book is that it is not a diet book and it is not a recipe book and it is not a memoir, although it contains all of these elements. It is a recommendation and justification for a particular lifestyle. One of the most annoying things I find in books on nutrition or exercise or even many cooking books which promote some message is that they simply do not work well unless you are willing to adopt a particular lifestyle.<br /><br />The best example I can give for this is the cookbooks of Rachael Ray. They are excellent collections of recipes, but my guess is that they simply do not work unless you acquire some fairly serious culinary skills and cook with them at least three times a week. Another prominent lifestyle culinary figure is Jamie Oliver whose books are constantly exhorting us to cook at home and eat well by learning to do simplified cooking. I confess Sir Jamie is a better salesman, being something of a force of nature than a simple chef or writer.<br /><br />I digress to these two writers to suggest that if you take up with Ms. Guiliano's Francophile lifestyle, you will probably need more recipes than she supplies in her little book, and Ray and Oliver are excellent sources for this lifestyle.<br /><br />In a nutshell, Ms. Guiliano claims that `French Women Don't Get Fat' because they sit down to three modestly sized meals a day, with small portions, lots of variety, intent on what they are eating, with good china and linens, and no distractions. Doesn't this sound very much like the experience you expect when you go to a good French restaurant? In fact, this sounds almost exactly like some statements I have read in Thomas Keller's `The French Laundry' cookbook. Many of Ms. Guiliano's other precepts are virtually identical to the doctrines of the very French influenced Alice Waters which stress fresh ingredients, seasonality, and variety. All this I say to support the notion that little of this book is new, but it is much more accessible than other sources.<br /><br />If this book demonstrates anything, it is the fact that wisdom about life is not acquired by science, it is acquired by broad experience and a good mind that can synthesize precepts from these experiences. Thus, Ms. Guiliano probably would never have written this book if she had never visited the United States as a teenager who was not yet fully conditioned into all these unspoken doctrines before she was exposed to the seductive American life of fast food, motor transportation, and large portions.<br /><br />All this means is that this book is much more than a memoir, an analysis of a lifestyle, a cookbook or a diet book. It is a roadmap for how to live your whole life, by stages and by age, to improve your health, improve the quality of life, and probably to simply make you a more interesting person. Just don't expect it to work any miracles unless you are willing to sign on for the duration.<br /><br />Highly recommended book on how to live well!ifestyle, a cookbook or a diet book.

From this comes the reference to Frank Capra's classic Christmas movie, `It's a Wonderful Life' where the candidate angel Clarence Odbody shows George Bailey what life in his town would be like if he had never been born.<br /><br />While this is his major theme, several minor themes come out of this story as well. My favorite, as a once upon a time student of the philosophy of science is the way in which scientists can let theory impose its schema upon the evidence of one's own eyes. To be fair, the reinterpretation of the Burgess Shale fossils did come about by the application of some new technology for imaging the three-dimensional bodies seen in the barely more than two-dimensional pictures in the strata. This is not unlike opening old criminal cases with new technologies such as DNA testing.<br /><br />In stark contrast to the very minor incident recounted in the recent popular history, `Wittgenstein's Poker', to use Gould's own words, this `reinterpretation of the Burgess Shale is a story, a grand and wonderful story of the highest intellectual merit - with no one killed, no one even injured or scratched, but a new world revealed.'<br /><br />Chapter I lays out the traditional pictures of evolution in circulation at the time that Wolcott was interpreting the fossils of the Burgess Shale. Chapter II give background information on the fossil record in general and the Burgess Shale in particular. Chapter III gives the history and drama of the reinterpretation of these fossils. It also places this reinterpretation in the context of general evolutionary theory. Chapter IV examines the life and times of Charles Dolittle Wolcott in order to explain how he came to misinterpret the fossils. Chapter V gives us the Charles Odbody version of evolution, had tiny alterations in the paths of chance taken biological evolution down entirely different courses.<br /><br />For those who commonly identify fossils with dinosaurs, I should point out that the Burgess Shale fossils record organisms which existed hundreds of millions of years before the dinosaurs from an event commonly called the Cambrian explosion, a great proliferation of different life forms beginning about 500 million years ago or almost 400 million years before the age of dinosaurs. The Cambrian explosion is a major concern for the theory of evolution, one that Darwin himself addressed in `The Origin of Species'. The appearance of a great flowering of life forms at a single point in time can easily be interpreted as the point in time when God created all life on the planet. Therefore, the rich deposits of fossils offered important evidence for the theory that lies at the cornerstone of all biology, even more important to life sciences than the General Theory of Relativity is to modern physics.<br /><br />This book is a very important essay in the history of science, with illustrations of how science can go astray and how it can be set aright. Some other reviewers have noted new interpretations of the Burgess shale fossils which may be different from the revisions cited by Gould, but this does not diminish the lesson Gould draws about the history and logic of science and the nature of evolutionary mechanisms.gic of science and the nature of evolutionary mechanisms. <br />	2005-04-22
268560:US	39134375	R2RPFJJPVP169U	0140171991	622842279	The Greek Myths: Complete Edition	Books	5	14	20	N	N	Very Important Resource in English on Greek Myths	`The Greek Myths' by Robert Graves is a perfect example of what poets do to pay the rent when they are not writing poetry. This is, of course, a gross simplification, as Graves was also a professor of poetry at Oxford University and the author of several relatively successful novels about the ancient world, the most successful of which was `I, Claudius', the semi-fictional story of the fourth emperor of Rome.<br /><br />Robert Graves was also a great student of mythology and in addition to this great survey of myths, he has written volumes on the nature of myths, in much the same genre as the great work `The Golden Bough'. While these other works, such as `The Golden Ass' are pretty opaque to the non-specialist, his work on Greek myths is a great presentation of the material for the layman and a great antidote to famously popular works such as `Bullfinch's Mythology' and `Mythology' by Edith Hamilton. I read both of these works when I was in Junior High School and was initially enamored with the Greek myths. What these popular works failed to do was to give any connection to the sources of the myths. One gets the highly illusory sense of the myths' existing in some kind of Jungian collective consciousness, with no thought given to the documents where these were first written down and to variations in the myths' narrative from different sources.<br /><br />One may ask why it is important to study myths, and therefore be careful about understanding the myth's documentary sources. Probably the most important reason for studying myths is that understanding them is simply necessary to understand a great body of world literature, including much of English literature beginning in the Middle Ages and continuing to the present day. I don't even need to cite Shakespeare, as there are two recent episodes of CSI which make reference to the Chimera, Icarus, and the Furies, three lesser figures from the Greek Myths. Just to include at least three more modern sources, there is a reference in a Woody Allen' film to both Narcissus and to Zeus, a major recent science fiction trilogy by John Varley is based on the names and characteristics of the twelve Titans, and a retelling of the Trojan War in `Troy' with Brad Pitt as the great Achilles himself.<br /><br />Reference to myths is great cultural shorthand. Ezra Pound, a wealth of obscure literary references if there ever was one, stated that the value of writing could be measured by how much meaning can be packed into the fewest words. This, a reference to Achilles can evoke images of invulnerability, great prowess in combat, revenge, eventual graciousness to enemies, and being wronged by allies. All that from a reference to the legendary Achilles. Talk about a name to be conjured with. Don't get me started on Odysseus, especially since James Joyce already pretty well covered that subject in `Ulysses'.<br /><br />One could write volumes on the definition of myths. In simple terms, they are stories of larger than life figures who may or may not be based on actual historical people. Some, but not all, myths arise out of religion and prescientific cosmology, as in the Greek creation myths. One sure sign of mythic quality is an intermixing of the human and the divine, as in the case of Achilles of the Iliad, who is a son of a mortal man and an immortal nymph, daughter of Zeus, Thetis. Some famous characters from Greek myths such as Theseus, Jason, Oedipus, and Odysseus may not have had divine parents, but they certainly had larger than live adventures with both assistance and interference from the Olympian gods or their surrogates.<br /><br />The book is divided into 171 stories, although many of these individual sections may be part of a larger story such as the tale of the Trojan War that takes up fourteen (14) of these sections. This division is partly due to the fact that the full story of the figures in the Trojan war may include references to sources outside the Iliad, which was not a novel written by Homer like Hemingway's `For Whom the Bell Tolls'. It is much more like the New Testament gospels, written several hundred years after the historical events and based on oral tradition and documents since lost to history.<br /><br />In addition to the Trojan war, which concludes the book, and the creation myths which open the book, there are stories covering the genealogy and carryings on of the Olympian gods, a flood legend, the story of Prometheus (see the stature in Rockafeller Center), Sisyphus, Perseus, Bellerophon, Midas, Narcissus, Minos, Daedalus, Theseus, Medea, Oedipus, Orestes, Heracles (Hercules) and his 12 Labors, and Jason and the Argonauts. A perfect example of an important function of some myths is the story of Orestes and Agamemnon, where a cycle of revenge comes to an end only after the intervention of divine authority.<br /><br />If you are interested in this book and you happen to be looking at the two volume edition, it is essential that you buy both volumes at the same time, as the index to both volumes is at the end of volume 2. It is also important that all the scholarly trappings of footnotes, references, and alternate versions do not put you off. The stories are entirely readable without them, and you can go through them secure in the knowledge that this is how the Greeks, Chaucer, Spencer, and Shakespeare saw these stories. And, if by chance a reading takes you beyond the simple stories, there is more than enough to connect you to the original sources in Greek and Roman literature. And, as another reviewer notes, if there are questions about Graves' version, you have everything you need to check it out. You cannot say that about most other texts on these myths.a novel written by Homer like Hemingway's `For Whom the Bell Tolls'.

Better Recipes than Others	'12 Best Foods Cookbook' by culinary journalist, Dana Jacobi presents nutritional information in what I consider a most delightful way, very similar to the excellent book, `SuperFoods' by Steven Pratt, M.D. and Kathy Matthews. As nutritional doctrine is getting more and more complicated, it is a relief to see these two books manage to present a very large body of nutritional wisdom in an easily digestible form.<br /><br />To Jacobi's twelve (12), Pratt and Matthews present fourteen (14), but the agreement between the two lists is remarkably good. A list of the foods covered in both books follows:<br /><br />In both:<br /><br />Blueberries<br /><br />Beans (Jacobi singles out black beans)<br /><br />Broccoli<br /><br />Oats<br /><br />Salmon (Pratt specifies wild salmon. Jacobi has wild and farm-raised with a caution against the skin)<br /><br />Soy (in all its gloriously different forms)<br /><br />Spinach<br /><br />Tomatoes<br /><br />Walnuts<br /><br />In Pratt and Matthews, but not in Jacobi:<br /><br />Oranges<br /><br />Pumpkin<br /><br />Tea<br /><br />Turkey<br /><br />Yogurt<br /><br />In Jacobi, but not in Pratt and Matthews:<br /><br />Sweet potatoes<br /><br />Chocolate<br /><br />Onions<br /><br />I suspect you could pair off the sweet potatoes with the pumpkin as sources of the `orange' nutrients. As fresh sweet potatoes are available the year around, I'll go for them instead of pumpkin, not to mention the fact that you can do with sweet potatoes virtually everything you can do with pumpkin, from soup to pies and back again. Tea and chocolate are also something of a pairing, as both are sources of caffeine and other nifty natural chemicals. If I had to pick, I would go with chocolate. That leaves Oranges, Turkey, Yogurt, and Onions unmatched between the two books, although I suspect some may claim that anything yogurt can do, soy milk can do better, but I do feel a real gap in Ms. Jacobi's discussion with no true milk product, animal protein, or citrus.<br /><br />I think that all this means is that if you want excellent information in a very palatable form, get both books. If you can only have space or funds for one, I suggest Ms. Jacobi's book because, as someone who is much more of a culinary writer than a nutritionist, her very sizable selection of 200 very good recipes is more kitchen friendly than ophthalmologist Pratt and professional writer Matthews. This is probably due to both Ms. Jacobi's own talents plus her communications with some very distinguished culinary sources including Rick Bayless, Molly Katzen, Julie Sahni, Elizabeth Schneider, and Arthur Schwartz. And those are just the ones whose culinary credentials I recognize.<br /><br />While Pratt and Matthews organize their recipes by their fourteen (14) foods, Ms. Jacobi organizes her recipes by type of dish or course. Her recipe chapters are:<br /><br />Dips, Hors d'Oeuvres, and First Courses<br /><br />Soups<br /><br />Salads and Dressings<br /><br />Poultry and Meat<br /><br />Fish<br /><br />Pasta, Sauces, and Grains<br /><br />Eggs, Beans, and Soy<br /><br />Sandwiches and Baked Goods<br /><br />Vegetables and Side Dishes<br /><br />Desserts<br /><br />Breakfasts and Drinks<br /><br />One of the better things about her recipes is that almost all combine two or more of the twelve best foods. The next best thing is that she does not avoid the kinds of meats and grains that make so many dishes so interesting.<br /><br />If I were to suggest anything for improving these recipes, I would add several recipes for basic pantry items to replace recipe ingredients that call for commercial preparations such as stocks and fruit spreads. If you will go to the trouble of making your own Muesli, stocks and fruit purees are really not all that tough. Where Ms. Jacobi calls for a packaged blueberry jam in some recipes, similar recipes from Alice Waters would just have you mash up some fresh blueberries. Much more satisfactory to my mind. One thing I missed wasa good recipe for a Muesli or Granola that has a decent shelf life. This is one of the things you will be inclined to make in large batches, enough for a fortnight or a month. For those looking for it, check out Molly Katzen's `Sunlight Caf&eacute;'.<br /><br />What this buys us is the fact that Ms. Jacobi's recipes are generally pretty simple. Very few (mostly desserts) take up more than a single page. At the bottom of each recipe, there is an estimate of the calories, grams of fat, grams of saturated fat, grams of protein, grams of carbohydrates, and grams of fiber. I would stress that except for the baked goods where measurements will be pretty exact, these estimates may be off by up to 50%, especially if you have a heavy hand with certain ingredients such as onions.<br /><br />Ms. Jacobi's list of sources is better than average and needs to be, as organic versions of many of these products may not be that easy to find. Many of the sources are also good places to go for additional nutritional information and recipes. The bibliography is also better than average, roughly evenly divided between nutritional and culinary sources. Note to publisher Rodale: The Bibliography seems peculiarly difficult to read with its oddly indented layout.<br /><br />This is a really great book for presenting nutrition simply and in an extremely practical form. What few objections I have are a result of a search for a complete lifestyle. As a former Whole Earth Catalogue hippie, I like the whole picture. Not to say Ms. Jacobi will not talk you into a few good lifestyle changes herself, it's fun to see how her ideas fit into other healthy living precepts.<br /><br />A very highly recommended book for healthy and tasty cooking. This is far more important than cooking fast, cooking local, cooking organic, cooking low carb, cooking authentic xxx, cooking to entertain, grilling, barbecuing, or cooking in a wok.you will be inclined to make in large batches, enough for a fortnight or a month.

270061:US	39134375	R161LXDA7GMZNV	0151686564	831494069	Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats	Books	5	3	4	N	N	The very well known secret live of 'Cats'	`Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats' by T. S. Eliot is probably known to every literate speaker of English over the age of 18 as the source for most of the material in the very long running Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, `Cats'. I believe the long dead Eliot even received a posthumous Tony award for his having done the lyrics for most of the songs in `Cats'.<br /><br />The book `...Practical Cats' is a part of a very distinguished tradition of animal fantasy works. The most famous contributors to this genre which come to my mind are Lewis Carroll, especially for `Jabberwocky' and the poem of the walrus and the carpenter, and Don Marquis, author of a series of stories collected as `archie and mehitibal', where archie is a cockroach and mehitibal is a rather disreputable cat who would be right at home sharing an alley with Mungojerrie and Rumpelteaser. These are all some of the more distinguished precursors to modern comic strips such as `Garfield', `Heathcliff', `Cats with Hands', `Marmaduke' and `Mutts', not to mention frequent guest appearances in `Ziggy' and that most famous of beagles, Snoopy.<br /><br />What is so amazing about this collection of poems is that it comes from the pen of the very proper and immensely precocious Professor Eliot. T. S. Eliot is best known for some of the most famously pessimistic poems of the 20th century, `The Hollow Men' and `The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock'. By reputation, he is so prissy, he couldn't stand to be a part of our Babbitish American culture and beat a path to English residence and citizenship.<br /><br />One of my most cherished memories of T. S. Eliot is a story I heard first hand from the distinguished Johns Hopkins historian of ideas, George Boas who told the story of Eliot's staying with Boas in Baltimore and requesting an introduction to and visit with that most famous Baltimorean, H. L. Menchen. Boas had Menchen over after dinner and Menchen and Eliot sat down together in armchairs by the fire and Eliot said to Menchen `I understand you know something of American politics'. At this point, Menchen slipped into his best newspaper reporter barroom persona with stories of backroom dealings while Eliot slipped more and more firmly into his Oxford donnish persona. While I have no reason to doubt Boas memory, I was delighted to have the story verified in one of Menchen's many posthumously published autobiographical works.<br /><br />So what is this priggish don doing writing animal fantasy? I'm afraid I can't answer this. All I can say is that T. S. Eliot certainly deserved his Tony and a lot more for this little collection of poems. Eliot's little book contains fifteen (15) poems. Twelve (12) of these became songs in `Cats', although the `Cats' show stopper, `Memories' is not among these twelve. Also, the character who sings this song, Grizabella, is not the subject of any of the poems, although there are some similarities between Grizabella and Growltiger, the subject of one of the three poems not included.<br /><br />While I have no wish to diminish Eliot's accomplishment with these poems, he certainly knew a good thing when he realized that the animal fantasy genre offers great resources for inventing words and names to facilitate the crafting of great rhymes. Just think about the first verse of `Jabberwocky' and you will know what I mean.<br /><br />I cannot fail to mention the great Edward Gorey illustrations that come along with this edition. They make the truly tiny price for this little volume more than worth the money. For anyone on the lookout for intelligent things to read to your young'ens, you should add this to your copies of `Winnie the Pooh', `The Hobbit', the stories of Narnia, and `Alice in Wonderland'.Eliot said to Menchen `I understand you know something of American politics'.

270683:US	39134375	R1OIDD65MLILE5	0743236815	864451764	Cooking for Comfort: More Than 100 Wonderful Recipes That Are as Satisfying to Cook as They Are to Eat	Books	5	8	12	N	N	Excellent Recipes for Non-Foodies	`Cooking for Comfort' is by New York Times food columnist Marian Burros, who is part of a pretty distinguished heritage beginning with Craig Claiborne and Pierre Franey, continuing with Mimi Sheraton and Ruth Reichl and visiting columnist extraordinary R. W. Appel. With Ms. Burros, the likes of Mark Bittman and Amanda Hesser, all writers of notable columns and cookbooks hold the current standard high.<br /><br />There may be a sense in which the limelight for culinary journalism has passed from the New York Times' printed word to the hotter TV Food Network with its stable of star hosts. In most direct competition to Ms. Burros would probably be `Gourmet's' Sara Moulton, Ina Garten, or the spectacularly prolific Rachael Ray. What is unfortunate is that a cursory look at this book's title gives the impression that it is addressing the same interests as Ms. Ray's '30 Minute Meal' rubric. The fact that Rachael actually wrote a book entitled `Comfort Food' strengthens this association. This is not, however, the case. Ms. Burros has created a very special type of cooking perfectly evident when one pays close attention to the title. Her point is not to give us a book of recipes for comfort food, but a book of recipes that are comforting to make.<br /><br />It is not too hard to appreciate that a dish that appeals to none of your family will not be too comforting to make. Therefore, almost all of the classic `comfort foods' will also be comfortable to make. That is, a dishes popularity will contribute to the comfort one experiences in the act of making it. A second characteristic of foods which are comforting to make are those which require a fair amount of effort, producing a dish in which one can take great pride in having successfully made this food. It follows from this that these recipes are NOT about quick cooking. A third characteristic I gather from Ms. Burros' selection of recipes is that the dishes are either familiar to American amateur cooks (blueberry pancakes, meat loaf, mashed potatoes, spaghetti with marinara sauce) OR the dishes are interesting selections from world cuisines (Spanish tortilla, Onion soup, Greek Salad, polenta).<br /><br />In fact, as I look through the list of recipes, I get a strong sense of similarity between this book and two recent `Most Famous Recipe' books, `the greatest dishes!, around the world in 80 recipes' by Anya von Bremzen  and `The Cook's Canon, 101 Classic Recipes Everyone Should Know' by Raymond Sokolov. Oddly, I think that while these two books are great for foodies, Ms. Burros' book is specifically written for non-foodies. In this regard, she does share some common ground with the prolific Ms. Ray. Another way in which they differ, however, is that Ms. Burros' directions are much more meticulous, with lots of helpful hints on technique, serving, and wine accompaniments.<br /><br />I think Ms. Burros' biggest problem, aside from the perceived or actual competition from both Food Network luminaries and New York Times colleagues is that her subject is so ordinary. Why in the world do I want to pay even $20 for a book of 100 recipes, 70% of which can be found among the 4500 recipes in the `Joy of Cooking' or the 2500 recipes in `James Beard's American Cookery'. Any American who cooks probably owns one or the other of these two volumes. In the end, it is probably her one big idea that makes the book interesting. The book is important because it can inspire one to get more enjoyment from your cooking and it gives recipes to help you do that.<br /><br />Overall, I thing the selection of recipes is excellent, making this a great book for those who endorse that other great non-foodie doctrine of the importance of finding `a few good recipes' and learning them well and doing them well. One problem I believe most amateur food enthusiasts may experience is that they may not appreciate the pleasure in repeating a recipe and doing it well because you have done it before and have gotten all the kinks out of your technique. They are much more interested in tracking down and trying a new Thai recipe using lemon grass or galangal rather than making that same old James Beard London Broil recipe again, regardless of how good it tastes or how easy it is to make.<br /><br />Ms. Burros' recipe for chili, for example, may not be quite as elaborate as a prize winning recipe reported by Robb Walsh, it is, I believe, a much tastier chili than the Pierre Franey recipe I did for many years before the foodie bug got me and I saw other approaches which used cubed rather than ground meat. Just one example of how well thought out is Ms. Burros' presentation of these recipes can be found in her suggestion to adjust the seasoning of the chili after it has been retrieved from the deep freeze. Another insider's tip is to check the heat in the Jalapenos to see if more or less are needed to suit your taste.<br /><br />If I were to offer any ideas for Ms. Burros' next book, I would suggest she leave out the food processor and any other high end equipment from her recipe procedures. As I believe her primary audience is the occasional cook, I suspect people in this group may not have $300 food processors. And, if they do have them, they probably don't use them often enough to get the best use out of them. At the very least, I would offer an alternative to the food processor method.<br /><br />I would also leave off or improve the list of sources in the back of the book. I have to love a list that cites Lou DiPalo and his Manhatten Little Italy store, but DiPalo's is best known for its fresh mozzarella and ricotta, for which Ms. Burros gives a different source. You can get good Parmigiano-Reggiano in any megamart.<br /><br />Strongly recommended for non-foodie weekend cooks.all the kinks out of your technique.

272516:US	39134375	RZSMRWIAC7199	0394513487	723560286	The Foods and Wines of Spain	Books	5	16	19	N	N	Essential Reference on Spanish Cuisine and Wines	`The Foods and Wines of Spain' by culinary journalist Penelope Casas was the only comprehensive coverage of Spanish cuisine when it was published at the urging of Craig Claiborne in 1979 and it is probably still the only book in English which aims at covering the entire range of Spanish cuisine. As such, it stands among some of the other notable American books on national cuisines such as Diane Kochilas `The Glorious Foods of Greece', Jean Anderson's smaller book on `The Food of Portugal', Marcella Hazan's `Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking' and the granddaddy of them all, Julia Child's `Mastering the Art of French Cooking'. Casas shares in this tradition by being published by Child's publisher, Knopf, and having the same distinguished cookbook editor, Judith Jones. Since I have never seen an unattractive book published by Alfred E. Knopf, I am certain this book benefits from this association.<br /><br />Casas organizes her book by types of dishes, using the usual hodgepodge of type meaning when served and type meaning principle ingredient. The fourteen chapters on ingredients / servings are:<br /><br />`Tapas', slightly misleading, as classic tapas dishes such as the famous `tortilla Espanola' appears under egg dishes. If your primary interest is in Tapas, get Casas recent book devoted entirely to this subject.<br /><br />`Embutidos, Pasteles Y Empanadas', or sausages pates, and pies is one of the most convincing arguments that this book covers the whole range of Spanish cooking, as it includes doable recipes for making many classic Spanish Charcuterie such as chorizo. It also contains several very nice empanada recipes that show off one of many differences between Spanish and Mexican cooking. In Mexico, judging by a recipe by Rick Bayless, `empanadas' are just a bit larger than raviolis. In Spain, `empanadas' are much more like calzones.<br /><br />`Ensaladas' Salads, including a claim that it was the Spanish and not the French who invented Mayonnaise.<br /><br />`Verduras Y Legumbres' Vegetables, showing the importance of potatoes in Spanish cooking. This is historically obvious, as the Spanish brought potatoes along with all the other New World produce back to Europe.<br /><br />`Sopas Y Potajes' Soups and Meals in a Pot, very similar to the northern Italian love of ministre.<br /><br />`Huevos Y Tortillas' Eggs and Egg dishes. Evidence that there are many great Spanish frittatas.<br /><br />`Arroces' Rice dishes, including several types of Paella. `Please use Spanish Rice'<br /><br />`Mariscos' Shellfish, with as much love of mussels as the French, it seems.<br /><br />`Pescados' Fish, including several bacalo (dried, salted cod) recipes and fish steaks.<br /><br />`Aves Y Caza', Poultry and Game, with the usual European love of rabbit, partridge, and other wild things.<br /><br />`Carnes' Almost a copy of the Italian cuisine with pork, lamb, and veal. Maybe a bit more lamb than Italia.<br /><br />`Panes, Bollos Y Masas', Breads and Pastries. While I am sure this is not a complete survey of Spanish bread baking, I am just a little surprised that there is no mention of baking with wild yeasts so popular in French and Italian baking. On the other hand, there is the distinction, as in France, between bakeries that specialize in bread and shops that specialize in pastries. While almonds run through all of Spanish cuisine, it is in baking where it comes together with egg whites and puff pastry to form an especially strong affinity with Austrian baking traditions. I am not sure whether this is because these two countries shared interaction with Moorish culture or whether the countries shared the same royal house, the Hapsburgs, for many generations, or a combination of both, but it is little discoveries like this which make culinary anthropology really fascinating.<br /><br />`Postres' Desserts, sharing the Italian interest in sweetened fruits above most other dishes, plus marzipan and many other almond preparations.<br /><br />`Bebidas' Sangria, almonds, coffee, citrus, and almonds.<br /><br />Almost all main course protein dishes include a suggestion pairing the dish with an appropriate Spanish wine. This includes the egg dishes, but not other tapas dishes. The last chapter deals in great depth with the wines of Spain, including the famous Andalusian sherries. Two of the more interesting facts here is the statement that the Italian Marsala is really a form of sherry and that a bottle of sherry may contain wine from grapes harvested over many years. So much for the James Bond quote about giving the vintage of the `underlying wine fortified to create the sherry'. Not only does this chapter give lots of details about regional wine centers; it gives extensive tables of high quality vintage wine and sherry labels and the author's opinion on their quality. Since this book was published in 1979 and not revised since 1982, there may be some question on whether this information on wineries is still valuable. I will venture a guess that it is probably as good as anything else you may find, since the lists are long and most vintners endure, especially since the fortunes of Spanish businesses have improved greatly since the restoration of the Spanish republic after the death of Franco.<br /><br />Like the recipes in Casas later book on Tapas, I find all the recipes in this volume to be very good, almost as extensive as my favorites from Julia Child and Marcella Hazan. This is a real foodie book, as the discussion of regionality and authenticity of the recipes is a great pleasure to read, even if you never make any of the recipes. It is also great background for understanding the cuisine of Ferran Adria, the great modern Spanish chef working just outside Barcelona. This book also humbled my conceit at criticizing Daniel Boulud's recipe for baby eels. While they may be hard to come by, apparently the Spanish really love them.<br /><br />Even if you are not a foodie, this is a great source of recipes for eggs, rice, sweet peppers, almonds, lamb, and fish.

274369:US	39134375	RJMZDWI29K1BL	0394742354	768695743	Tapas: The Little Dishes of Spain	Books	5	29	37	N	N	Leading Title of both Spanish and Little Bite Recipes	`Tapas, the Little Dishes of Spain' by noted Spanish cookbook specialist Penelope Casas is one of my very favorite types of books which Ms. Casas has brought off with great success. It is part of his great influence on American culinary writing that even this recent book written after the death of Craig Claiborne, still shows his fingerprints as a major influence on Ms. Casas actually producing the book.<br /><br />This is only the second book on Spanish cuisine I have reviewed, and it is clearly more valuable than the first, `My Kitchen in Spain' by Janet Mendel. While both Casas and Mendel know Spanish cuisine as well as anyone writing in English, Casas is a bit more of the scholar which shows in her deeper background information on the nature and origins of `Tapas' and the great variety of Spanish tapas bars in Spain. This variety should be no surprise to someone familiar with the Italian food scene, as it closely parallels the variety of `restaurante', `trattoria', `osteria', and `enoteca' in Italy. The book also benefits, I'm sure, from the firm hand of the `El Suprimo' of cookbook editors, Janet Jones.<br /><br />A quick look at the book gives one the sense that it is a no nonsense collection of recipes with few frills and an emphasis on number of recipes rather than on the quality of recipe writing. This is a mistaken impression. The very first thing I did was to compare Ms. Casas' recipe for the tapas poster child, `Tortilla a la Espanola' with that in Ms. Mendel's book (which I have just finished making) and find that Ms. Casas' description is virtually identical to Ms. Mendel's with the added touch of suggesting to interleave sliced onions with the potatoes rather than just sprinkling in chopped onions. This simple change is eminently in keeping with the consistency you want, where you don't want the potato slices to stick together to create an undifferentiated mass of potato. Ms. Casas also adds a mini-recipe for a tomato sauce to the Tortilla, something I have seen with no other recipe for this dish. But then, I give credit back to Ms. Mendel for largely duplicating a recipe from a book that specializes in Tapas recipes.<br /><br />Aside from the quality of the recipes, the large number of recipes, and the very informative introduction to the subject, the next best thing about the book is the organization of recipes into chapters that most easily distinguish styles of preparation and presentation. The chapters are:<br /><br />Tapas in sauce<br /><br />Marinades, Pates, Salads, and Other Cold Tapas<br /><br />Tapas with Bread or Pastry<br /><br />Tapas with Some Last Minute Preparation<br /><br />I'm tempted to say that this organization could be have been taken one or two steps further. It would not have been hard to imagine all the frittata styled dishes to be in a separate chapter. The author warns us to not serve too many similar tapas at one party. For example, don't do too many bread based tapas at one time. This (and tapas in general) remind me of Thomas Keller's rationale behind small servings. He argues that the first bite impresses, the second bite verifies that the first was not a fluke, and with the third bite, boredom starts to set in. One could easily apply the same logic to using tapas as the basis for an entire meal. Otherwise, even if tapas are served in their usual role as a supplement to sipping sherry or other afternoon drink, they should still be kept small so as to not blunt the appetite for supper.<br /><br />This book is an excellent supplement to Clifford A. Wright's `Little Foods of the Mediterranean', Joyce Goldstein's book `Enoteca', Anissa Helou's `Mediterranean Street Food', Diane Kochilas' `Meze' and Carol Field's `Italy in Small Bites'.<br /><br />Highly recommended.I have seen with no other recipe for this dish.

It would not have been hard to imagine all the frittata styled dishes to be in a separate chapter. The author warns us to not serve too many similar tapas at one party. For example, don't do too many bread based tapas at one time. This (and tapas in general) remind me of Thomas Keller's rationale behind small servings. He argues that the first bite impresses, the second bite verifies that the first was not a fluke, and with the third bite, boredom starts to set in. One could easily apply the same logic to using tapas as the basis for an entire meal. Otherwise, even if tapas are served in their usual role as a supplement to sipping sherry or other afternoon drink, they should still be kept small so as to not blunt the appetite for supper.<br /><br />This book is an excellent supplement to Clifford A. Wright's `Little Foods of the Mediterranean', Joyce Goldstein's book `Enoteca', Anissa Helou's `Mediterranean Street Food', Diane Kochilas' `Meze' and Carol Field's `Italy in Small Bites'.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2005-04-17

While it is a bit less than these works, it is a bit more than Patricia Wells' two books on cooking in Provence, which are very personal recipe collections from a single region of France. It is most similar to `Rome at Home' by Suzanne Dunaway' or even to Mario Batali's `Cooking from My Two Villages'. That is, it is a personal view of a region's cooking with a fair coverage of at least all the major topics of that region's cooking, if not being a comprehensive survey.<br /><br />Ms. Mendel gets on my good side immediately upon my opening the cover, where there is a very nice map of the provinces and major cities of Spain. The book's subtitle is `225 Authentic Regional Recipes' and while the geography of Spain may be more familiar to most Americans than, say, the geography of Thailand, it is still a very important matter to have a map of your region with all the place names you mention on that map. Ms. Mendel's editors slip just a bit by mentioning places in Spain which are not noted on the map, but I will forgive them, as they are small villages and the location by direction and relation to the coast are clearly described.<br /><br />While I am sure that the recipes are authentic and I am sure that Ms. Mendel presents recipes from outside her immediate region, the presentation is not systematic by region. Rather, it is done by type of dish, leading off with the recently very popular Tapas. This chapter of 28 recipes begins with the big three classics, spiced fried almonds, olives, and the inimitable Spanish potato omelet (Tortilla Espanola). I was tickled when I discovered this dish and the related fact that the badly misnamed `Spanish omelet' of diners across the country has virtually nothing to do with Spain. I immediately tried Ms. Mendel's recipe as this is a favorite dish of mine, and I found it to be at least as good as all the other recipes I have tried. My personal observation is that I may rather finish it like a frittata by sliding it under a broiler rather than flipping it. Even with a modestly weighted Calphalon aluminum pan, this was pretty messy business. I followed the author's recipe by slicing the potatoes on a cheap mandoline, but she says her son claims that chopped potatoes give a better result than slicing. I am almost inclined to believe that the best procedure is to grate the spuds, as the object seems to get a pretty tightly intertwined mix of egg and potato.<br /><br />The book has several sidebars on major Spanish culinary products, especially ham, sherry, and olive oil. She claims Spain produces the most and the best olive oil. There is no question that Spain produces the most. Many experts believe the best comes from Tuscany or Provence, depending on your tastes.<br /><br />The author takes a very odd approach to making substitutions for Serrano ham, if you can't find the real thing. She suggests either bacon or unsmoked pancetta. Two things are odd about this. One is that pancetta is, by definition, unsmoked and the other is that I think Italian or French cured hams would be much closer to Serrano than cured pork belly. This ties in with my sense that Ms. Mendel is not the very sharpest wordsmith. This has no influence on the quality of her recipes, only in the quality of our experience in reading her books.<br /><br />The next chapter is a rather smallish selection of five recipes for bread and bread byproducts (crumbs). While bread appears to be almost as important in Spanish dishes as in Italian, it is probably that Ms. Mendel is not herself a big bread baker.<br /><br />The soup chapter is probably worth the cost of the book, as it gives a very nice collection of seven (7) gazpacho recipes plus a little essay on the origins of gazpacho and how the author came to learn how to make this hallmark Spanish dish. After the gazpachos, there are ten recipes for other soups and thirteen recipes for one-pot meals from soups and stews.<br /><br />The egg and cheese chapter makes total sense with eight (8) egg recipes and three (3) custard and cheese recipes, since it is simply unlikely that the eggy `Tortilla Espanola' would exist without a lot of similar dishes using eggs.<br /><br />The vegetable chapter reinforces the similarities between the Spanish, French, and Italian cuisines with 28 recipes for hot and cold dishes featuring artichokes, beans, onions, eggplant, asparagus, and potatoes, potatoes, potatoes.<br /><br />The rice chapter features paella, but makes it clear that there are Spanish rice dishes that are not paellas. The seafood chapter has the largest number of recipes and pages, including recipes for shellfish; finfish; stews and casseroles; and salt cod. The poultry chapter is much smaller with nine (9) chicken recipes and three others, including a recipe for a Christmas turkey. The meat chapter is larger (19 recipes, 11 with pork), but not even half as large as the fish offerings. The game chapter brings the count of land based protein almost even with the briny fare with eight (8) recipes for birds and hares.<br /><br />The centerpiece of Spanish sweets is, of course, the custard based flan. Otherwise, the Spanish seem to be light on sweets like their fellow Mediterranean Latin's, the Italians.<br /><br />This is a very nice book for cozying up to Spanish cuisine without getting too scholarly. It is a lot different from New World Hispanic cuisine (Add olive oil and subtract chilis, mostly) and therefore worth getting to know better.of seven (7) gazpacho recipes plus a little essay on the origins of gazpacho and how the author came to learn how to make this hallmark Spanish dish.

277240:US	39134375	R1L5SOSXRCHV7B	0684815729	190846302	The Olives Table: Over 160 Recipes from the Critically Acclaimed Restaurant and Home Kitchen of Todd English	Books	5	16	18	N	N	Above Average Restaurant Cookbook. Esp for Olive dishes	`The Olives Table' by the dashingly handsome celebrity chef Todd English and professional culinary writer, Sally Sampson is in every way a typical celebrity chef / restaurant cookbook. It has good, interesting recipes, some insights into what makes a good professional chef, and a slant which distinguishes it from most other celebrity chef / restaurant cookbooks.<br /><br />The special twist is obvious from the title of the book, as English really likes the cooking of the Mediterranean, especially the role olives plays in Mediterranean dishes. In fact, English agrees with virtually all other writers on this subject when he states that you simply cannot cook Mediterranean without olive oil. And, this means olives and olive oil in virtually all its different applications, from marinaded olive appetizers to aioli in place of mayonnaise and practically all other egg sauces.<br /><br />The insight into professional cooking comes in the interview of English by Sally Sampson which opens the book. When asked to explain how chefs can keep up their interest and dedication through the long hours required by a high end restaurant, English says that (and I'm paraphrasing here) once a chef gets into the groove and the adrenalin kicks in, you get the kind of endomorphin rush which comes from long, hard exercize. And, if you don't put in the kind of effort needed to reach that experience at least some of the time, you will not succeed as a chef recognized for doing quality work.<br /><br />One of the more important considerations in deciding whether to buy this book is the fact that while English has included a lot of recipes with his own special twists, there are also a lot of recipes here which simply are not too different from what you will find in other cookbooks which specialize in Mediterranean cuisine. The question is more difficult in that while this is a good book, it is not a major effort with an important extra dimension which makes it an important book for any foodie to own. Example of such books are `Bouchon' by Thomas Keller and Tony Bourdain's `Le Halle Cookbook'. Both are important because they offer a pretty complete picture of bistro / brasserie cooking from two very different perspectives. Keller adds his unique insights into brasserie cooking and Bourdain is about the most entertaining cooking writer this side of Alton Brown.<br /><br />Since this is not a distinctively great restaurant cookbook and it does include a lot of typical recipes, although each with English's own little twist, do you still want to buy it. There are a few very good reasons to say yes. First, if you make a point of only buying restaurant cookbooks, you will have less overlap than if you also happen to own the classics of Mediterranean cooking by Paula Wolfert, Joyce Goldstein, Clifford Wright, Claudia Roden, and Nancy Harmon Jenkins. Also, if you happen to be simply nuts about olives, aioli, figs, and rice dishes, then you will find much to enthrall you in this book.<br /><br />The recipes include the usual entertaining headnotes regarding ingredients, recipe inspiration, and notes about preparation. I am really both surprised and pleased by the fact that English cites canned artichokes as an ingredient in almost all his artichoke dishes. On the other hand, I was just a little disappointed by the fact that the tart crust recipe printed in the book was NOT the same as the much more complicated recipe he does at the restaurant. Well, if I wanted this dumbed down, I would go to any one of a half dozen books I have for a simple pastry recipe. I buy books by accomplished chefs to see exactly how they do things.<br /><br />I have a suspicion that there are a few instructions in a few recipes where some small detail about the cooking method is being assumed and therefore is left out. My best example is where we are instructed to `pan grill' squid rings by placing them on a hot pan with no oil and leave them cook for 2 to 3 minutes. While the recipe does specify a cast iron pan which one may or may not know will be seasoned to a non-stick finish, this is not universally known, and it is easy for someone to substitute a pain aluminum or steel coated pan. Another question raised by this instruction is the heating for more than a minute. Conventional wisdom on squid is that it is cooked for a minute or an hour, never in between. Three minutes is three times this lower time. So, although I'm sure the Olives chefs make this to perfection, there seems to be too much room for something to go wrong. Something, I suspect, will either stick or be entirely too tough.<br /><br />Since this book has very good recipes where even the standards such as paella, mashed potatoes, and roasted chicken all are done with enough difference from the standard that you will not feel cheated, I recommend this to any good amateur cook who likes famous restaurant cookbooks.cipe does specify a cast iron pan which one may or may not know will be seasoned to a non-stick finish, this is not universally known, and it is easy for someone to substitute a pain aluminum or steel coated pan.

278095:US	39134375	R2TWZXEN8WSN4R	1400052378	831673956	Eat This Book: Cooking with Global Fresh Flavors	Books	5	114	131	N	Y	Great Grabbag of Fun Recipes for Weekend Entertainer	`eat this book' is the second cookbook from Food Network notable chef / educator, Tyler Florence and except for the somewhat more breezy style and fewer pretensions on being a `complete' guide to anything, it pretty much follows in the footsteps of the earlier book by giving us bright, strongly flavored recipes to enhance our pleasure with cooking for ourselves and our families and guests.<br /><br />My biggest problem with evaluating this book is that after reviewing about 400 cookbooks in the last 18 months, my perceptions can become pretty jaded, but I like to give this book special attention, as Tyler's first book was the fourth book I ever reviewed and I feel just a tad guilty at giving Tyler only four stars, as he is one of my more favorite `serious cooking' Food Network hosts, just a rung or two below Alton Brown and Mario Batali, and at least two or three rungs above Emeril. I hope this book explains why Tyler has been relegated to the stay at home `How to Boil Water' show, when his travelogue shows such as `Food 911' and `Tyler's Ultimate' were the best of the Food Network's roadshow cooking genre. But getting back to this book.<br /><br />My strongest impression with this second book is that Tyler is even more strongly influenced by the style of Jamie Oliver with breezy, clever phrases for food measurements and catchy, untypical chapter names and very Cosmo cover typesetting for tables of contents with lists of recipes. My recommendation to Tyler is that however strongly I like Jamie Oliver's recipes, I actually dislike his expansive / creative book layouts. Oddly, while Oliver gives very kosher tablespoon measurements of olive oil and doesn't care if you estimate the measurement, Florence says things like `add a two-count of olive oil' without explaining in this book what that means. While I trust an experienced cook will handle this well, I'm afraid a novice can end up with anything from two teaspoons (10 milliliters) to four tablespoons (60 milliliters) depending on their interpretation and the size of the spout on their olive oil dispenser. Also, while I had an epiphany on Oliver's books on the fact that Sir Jamie is less talking about dishes than he is about a way of life which embraces home cooking, I don't get any strongly inspiring vibes from this book from Tyler. But that's just me.<br /><br />My next strongest impression from Tyler's choice of recipes is how many books does a poor boy need with recipes of international staples such as pasta Puttanesca, panzanella salad, braised lamb shanks, salade Nicoise, gazpacho, guacamole, Pico de Gallo, falafel, tabbouleh, spaghetti Carbonara, veal saltimbocca and mashed potatoes. I probably already have half a dozen copies of each of these recipes in various books. But, for those of you who have the same reservation, I will say that in most cases, Tyler gives the recipe a special touch, just as he did in his first book, where his `Philly Cheese Steak' never saw the inside of a stand in south Philly. Similarly, his mashed potatoes, for example, are really something new to most of us. The single most redeeming aspect of this book for me is when I see Tyler give excellent instructions on doing some of the simplest preparations. His recipe procedure for ghee (Indian butter separated from its water and milk solids) is as good or better than anything I have seen in an Indian cookbook. Similarly, the technique for veal saltimbocca has some new twists which will help the novice produce a satisfactory result (Note that I am really happy Tyler gives us the true Roman recipe and not the `Italian / American' recipe with spinach and heavy gravy).<br /><br />So, Tyler's new book, like his last, is oriented to non-foodies who may not have a lot of cookbooks, but who would like one or two which promise strongly flavored dishes without necessarily being constrained by a `fast cooking' requirement.<br /><br />For the foodies among us, I think there is even something for our jaded palates in the first chapter on pantry preparations such as mayonnaises, pestos, spice mixes, vinaigrettes, and stocks. In this assortment are 32 recipes, including a very nice collection of aioli recipes. I especially like Tyler's Italian influenced recipe for chicken stock, as it is short on vegetables and cooking time, with a byproduct of poached chicken for salads and sandwiches. This is about the easiest chicken stock recipe I have seen which I believe will work. Therefore, it is more likely people will actually do it.<br /><br />The remaining chapters have names which are simply too cute to be believed. They are:<br /><br />Devouring, or appetizers from the Spanish tapas and Greek Mezes.<br /><br />Noshing, or fun food such as pizzas, salsas, dips, and grilled goodies.<br /><br />Consuming, or fast whole meal dishes such as pasta, pan roasted chicken, and steaks with frites.<br /><br />(I am especially fond of the fact that we get the Ligurian pesto lasagna rather than the heavier Bolognese version with tomato sauce. A+ for that one, Tyler)<br /><br />Tasting, or spring and summer street food such as roasted corn, grilled squid, and pulled pork barbecue. (Extra credit for the simple little chile recipe when what you really want is a splashy hot dog topping).<br /><br />Savoring or dishes when you have a lot of time to put into the cooking such as braised and large roasts.<br /><br />Licking the Plate Clean for 15 widely diverse desserts. Some baking skills required here.<br /><br />I forgive the cute naming since the audience is people who want to cook and have fun a few times a month, not picky cookbook collectors. Good, reasonable list price and easily readable book design.<br /><br />Recommended.aded palates in the first chapter on pantry preparations such as mayonnaises, pestos, spice mixes, vinaigrettes, and stocks.

Better than Cuisine Rapide	'60 Minute Gourmet' and `More 60 Minute Gourmet' are collections of New York Times columns written by the prominent French born and trained chef Pierre Franey, who attained celebrity by being the executive chef at La Pavilion, considered by Craig Claiborne at the beginning of his New York Times career as the only truly worthy `haute cuisine' venue in New York City.<br /><br />On the surface, it may seem that these volumes are simply precursors to Mark Bittman's `The Minimalist' columns in the same New York Times or to Rachael Ray's very successful 30 Minute Meal genre. While there are strong family resemblences between these three writers, there are also significant differences. Most of these differences arise from the fact that While Bittman and Ray are journalist / educator / writers, Franey was a classically trained chef.<br /><br />This distinction is crystal clear in the way Franey describes his audience and how they live their lives. With the greatest of respect, I sense that Franey sees his audience as just stepping out of a `New Yorker' cartoon of upper West side coop dwellers who shop at Zabars and who may expect the likes of R. W. Appel or Ruth Reichl to drop in for a quick bite on any given Thursday evening. One may be tempted to say `this is not me', but give yourself a chance to believe that you can put yourself into this picture. Franey is saying that you can be prepared to entertain elegantly with even a minimal amount of time.<br /><br />Franey is crystal clear from the introduction of the first of these two books that he is not simplifying gourmet dishes, he is picking and choosing those classic French dishes which can be made in the home within 60 minutes. His message is that contrary to expectations, a lot of French cooking, even `haute cuisine' can be made very simply. And, I have no argument with this. After browsing Escoffier's big book of recipes, I find about 50 different recipes for saut&eacute;ing chicken, every one of which can easily be done in 30 minutes or less.<br /><br />The most valuable lessons in these books are things that a professional chef does to expedite his own work. One of the hidden tricks behind Miss Rachael's speed is that she spends no time whatsoever looking for her ingredients. Franey reveals the technique that makes this all possible. He exhorts us to always have a place for everything and keep everything in its place. The easiest way to experience the value of this lesson is to try cooking in someone else's kitchen. His second big lesson is cleanliness, as much for efficiency as for hygiene. He says clutter and debris distract from efficiency.<br /><br />It is important to note that these two volumes have virtually identical tables of contents, so the `More 60-Minute Meals' is literally more of the same. It's only additional topics are on appetizers and desserts. And, unlike his La Pavilion colleague, Jacques Pepin, I suspect Pierre is not as skillful with the pastry as is Jacques. Like Rachael Ray, a very large number of the recipes in these books are for grilled, saut&eacute;ed, or fried chicken, with an enormous variety of sauces. In fact, Miss Rachael just did a version of chicken Veronique that was remarkably similar to the recipe on page 22 of `60-Minute Gourmet'. I honestly prefer Franey's version, as it uses white grapes while Rachael used red, and, Franey's instructions are written in plain English while Rachael uses her Rayspeak culinary dialect for a lot of basic terms. I would suspect that Miss Rachael had cribbed this recipe from Franey except that she made a major point of stating that the recipe was acquired from her future mother-in-law.<br /><br />What Rachael lacks in sophisticated technique, plain speech, and deep knowledge of French cuisine, she makes up by addressing the two of the three major issues I have with Franey. First, even 60 minutes may be a bit more than a tired Manhattenite may be able to manage, especially after a subway ride and a 5 block walk from the local supermarket. Second, Franey makes much of planning and prepping ahead of time. The fallacy of this and practically every other `quick cooking' advice is that the problem is not only that there is little time at the end of the day, there is little time throughout the week. A third potential objection to Franey's books is that if there is so many `haute cuisine' recipes which are really pretty easy, why not simply go to the mother lode and get a copy of Escoffier or Pellaprat for their 39 ways to poach eggs and 52 recipes for saut&eacute;ed chicken. The problem with this solution is that the search for the good recipes takes more time and investment in studying the techniques needed to prepare the short recipe description in these texts.<br /><br />Like Wolfgang Puck in a very recent book, Franey cuts down on the time required to prepare a recipe by combining into a single narrative all the steps and techniques you need so you don't have to seek out and learn a lot of ancillary recipes. Also, the classic French texts don't have the entertaining headnotes you can recite to impress your dinner guest(s).<br /><br />Thus, I really think Franey's books are best used as a resource for recipes for entertaining where the plan and prep ahead time will garner big rewards with your guests. I would therefore strongly recommend Franey's books for young professional ladies or gentlemen who are out to impress a potential partner over a home-cooked dinner. I would not use these books to replace my copy of `Mastering the Art of French Cooking', as there are great realms of French cooking technique which simply lie outside Franey's 60 minutes, the most important being braising and roasting techniques.<br /><br />These books are excellent introductions to how French cooking can be easy.

First, even 60 minutes may be a bit more than a tired Manhattenite may be able to manage, especially after a subway ride and a 5 block walk from the local supermarket. Second, Franey makes much of planning and prepping ahead of time. The fallacy of this and practically every other `quick cooking' advice is that the problem is not only that there is little time at the end of the day, there is little time throughout the week. A third potential objection to Franey's books is that if there is so many `haute cuisine' recipes which are really pretty easy, why not simply go to the mother lode and get a copy of Escoffier or Pellaprat for their 39 ways to poach eggs and 52 recipes for saut&eacute;ed chicken. The problem with this solution is that the search for the good recipes takes more time and investment in studying the techniques needed to prepare the short recipe description in these texts.<br /><br />Like Wolfgang Puck in a very recent book, Franey cuts down on the time required to prepare a recipe by combining into a single narrative all the steps and techniques you need so you don't have to seek out and learn a lot of ancillary recipes. Also, the classic French texts don't have the entertaining headnotes you can recite to impress your dinner guest(s).<br /><br />Thus, I really think Franey's books are best used as a resource for recipes for entertaining where the plan and prep ahead time will garner big rewards with your guests. I would therefore strongly recommend Franey's books for young professional ladies or gentlemen who are out to impress a potential partner over a home-cooked dinner. I would not use these books to replace my copy of `Mastering the Art of French Cooking', as there are great realms of French cooking technique which simply lie outside Franey's 60 minutes, the most important being braising and roasting techniques.<br /><br />These books are excellent introductions to how French cooking can be easy.

A must for foodies	`The Great Book of French Cuisine' by Henri-Paul Pellaprat is the kind of book every foodie should own. The question is whether this is the very best summary of French cuisine or simply a very good one. The primary competition to this position would be the works of August Escoffier. I should also be clear that this book is not in direct competition with the great `Mastering the Art of French Cooking' by Julia Child. In fact, Jeremiah Tower's introduction indirectly makes it clear in echoing Maurice-Edmund Saillant's classification of four cooking styles that while Pellaprat and Escoffier are addressing haute cuisine, Mme. Child's works address `La cuisine bourgeoisie'. The numerous books on regional French and Italian cooking represent `La cuisine regionale'. La cuisine impromptue' might be represented by Jacques Pepin's latest book, `Fast Food My Way'.<br /><br />The first thing that impresses us about this `Great Book...' is that it is truly great in size, weighing in at over 750 pages of rather small printing. It is not so small to make it unreadable in the kitchen, but compact enough to assure us we are getting our money's worth for a very modest list price of $35.<br /><br />The second thing that impresses us is the confirmation that there are few things that are new under our sun. In spite of Alton Brown's jabs at French cooking, there are chapters in this book which raise the quite probable specter that if AB didn't exactly steal some ideas from this book for his two `I'm Just Here for the Food' volumes, he comes very close to taking out a long term lease on Pellaprat's summaries of types of cooking and types of mixing for doughs. The other side of the coin is that if AB never read this book, he gets high marks for coming to the same conclusions as a leading writer on French `haute cuisine'. `Sacre bleu'.<br /><br />The third thing that impresses us about the book is the encyclopedic treatment of several important culinary subjects. On poached eggs alone, there are 39 different named recipes, with names coming generally from the person, event, or location responsible for their creation. It gives on the sense that when chefs are looking for dishes with clever or impressive names; it is to this book they will turn. Marie Simmons' book, `The Good Egg' has but 11 recipes for poached eggs. An even better piece of information on eggs comes from Pellaprat's classification of omelets into classic French, American style (which looks remarkably like what some people describe as the Normandy style), and Italian (frittatas).<br /><br />The section on both omelets and stocks demonstrates that this book is long on encyclopedic coverage of the field of French cooking, but sometimes short on some of the finer details. As great an authority as this book is on French technique, I sense that the author is leaving a few details out. This is my impression on many of the thousands of recipes in this book, although, of course, there is no need to repeat all the finer points of egg poaching in 39 recipes. You just need to point out what distinguishes each variation from the basic technique. This is another distinction between Pellaprat and writers such as Child and Elizabeth David. The latter ladies are teaching people who have never before cooked an omelet or a souffle or a gratin. On the other hand, Pellaprat opens with a chapter that is straight out of the world of Martha Stewart in that it teaches us the proper methods for entertaining and serving meals.<br /><br />In many ways, the closest analogue to this book in the modern lexicon of cookbooks is `The Joy of Cooking'. Both are encyclopedic in that they focus on giving at least some attention to even the most arcane of meats. While `Joy of Cooking' gives us recipes for possum and boar, Pellaprat gives us a great number of recipes for venison, hare, and woodcock.<br /><br />This book is an eminent proof that if one is serious about cooking, you need more than one cookbook, at least on those important subjects like omelets, stews, and stocks. No one book can cover everything in the depth to which one may need. While this book covers an enormous range, it does not even cover everything French, let alone the rest of the world.<br /><br />For a translated work, this reads remarkably well. It is also much more up to date than you may expect from a book first published in the mid-1930's. There is mention of both the microwave and the food processor in many recipes. And, all measurements are in simple spoon and cup units. One may however, be on the lookout for pork recipes that may be expecting a much fatter porkie than what we get in the markets today. I have even seen 1970s James Beard pork recipes falter because the fat on the pig has been reduced so much.<br /><br />Subject to a review of Escoffier's major work, I heartily recommend this for your armchair library and as a great source of fancy pants recipes. I am sure there are thousands of restaurant chefs who refer to this for that very purpose.least on those important subjects like omelets, stews, and stocks.

Use it to supplement modern cookbooks	`Science in the Kitchen and The Art of Eating Well' by Bologna native, Pellegrino Artusi, recently republished in English with a new introduction by American food writer, Michelle Scicolone is a work originally written in Italian and published by the author almost 115 years ago. I was drawn to it by a very positive reference to it in Paul Bertolli's cookbook, `Chez Panisse Cooking'.<br /><br />If it were not for this recommendation, I may have been inclined to dismiss the book as irrelevant to today's cooks, given the wealth of Italian cookbooks from Marcella Hazan, Lydia Bastianich, Michelle Scicolone herself, and a dozen of scribblers on the cooking from the various regions (Tuscany, Lazio, Campania, Sicily, etc.) and `superregions' (north versus south) of Italy. So, here I am to say that there is much of value here for the foodie and the professional cook. For all you casual cookbook clients out there, you may want to give this one a pass. In spite of its title, it has absolutely nothing in common with the kind of kitchen science written by Harold McGee, Shirley Corriher, and Alton Brown.<br /><br />This is not to say that there is no deep thinking about food in this book. The paperback has over 650 pages filled with 790 recipes plus an English and an Italian index. And, in all that space, there are hundreds of little observations about the right way to cook dishes. The problem for the amateur is that almost all the recipes assume you already know a lot about cooking, so lots of little details are left off. One of my favorite examples is in the recipe for veal saltimbocca (Veal cutlets, Roman Style). Artusi gives scant details on the size of the cutlet except that they should be a half a finger thick. He also gives no details about the sautee time except to say that the side with the procuitto should not be cooked for too long, lest it become too tough. On the other hand, the author takes the time to say that the veal should not be prepared with a whole sage leaf, as this would be too much. One wonders how large his sage leaves are, as I have made this dish several times and used a full sage leaf with no ill effects. To the good, I welcome the warning about not sauteeing too long. I just finished making a veal Marsala which turned out poorly, as the meat was too thin for my cooking time. Live and learn.<br /><br />Probably the biggest disadvantage for typical American amateur cooks is that most measurements are made by weight. The fact that they are translated from metric into Imperial units does little good, as most kitchens are simply not equipped to weigh an ounce of butter or 2/3 of an ounce of grated Parmesan cheese. Thus, unless you use the book to provide supplementary insights to recipes from Mario Batali, I would place the book by your favorite reading chair rather than on the kitchen shelf between `The Joy of Cooking' and `Mastering the Art of French Cooking'.<br /><br />As an historical document, this is really a great read. It was first published just after the unification of Italy and, while the book has many references to the geographical sources of these recipes, it does address the cuisine of Italy as a whole, at a time before Escoffier, when claims to dominance in the cuisine of Western Europe between Italy and France was a pretty lively issue. In fact, the author was criticized for being too French and by reflecting the practices of the French professionals working for the nobility rather than the practices of mother and grandma in the kitchens of Sienna or Leghorn. The most pervasive evidence of this French influence is that almost all sauces are strained before serving. I think Mario Batali would rather sell his firstborn before he strains an Italian sauce. But there it is. Artusi gives us professional Italian culinary practice among the nobility and restaurante chefs of 1890.<br /><br />While the value of this book is unmatched, I give it only four stars to warn anyone to read the review carefully before buying this book with mistaken expectations.<br /><br />If you are a died in the wool foodie, food professional, or cookbook collector, you must have this book. In addition to the recipes, there are dozens of stories, the kind which foodie readers really appreciate. For all others, consider a more modern encyclopedia of Italian recipes such as Michelle Scicolone's own `1000 Italian Recipes'.ully before buying this book with mistaken expectations. <br /> <br />If you are a died in the wool foodie, food professional, or cookbook collector, you must have this book.

Like most celebrity cookbooks, this can be seen as a very chatty book, with lots of headnotes and essays on various subjects such as wild mushrooms and risotto techniques. So, if all you want is a simple statement of recipes, you may be much happier with a Rachael Ray book or `1000 Italian Recipes' by Michele Scicolone, although even Scicolone's very heavily recipe oriented book has its share of commentary and notes on regional origins.<br /><br />Paul Bertolli is Alice Waters' second major chef at Chez Panisse, after Jeremiah Tower went off to create Stars and claim ownership of the invention of `California Cuisine'. While Tower (and Waters) are both heavily influenced by leading English writer on French cuisine, Richard Olney, Bertolli's center is clearly in Italy, with several homages to Provence and other French influences. One important foodie note is that Bertolli cites the Pellegrino Artusi's 100 year old `L'Arte di mangiar bene' (`Art of Eating Well'). I think this is notable because I have taken a quick look at a recent translation of this work and was not very impressed with the material. It may have been a very good book 100 years ago, but I did not immediately see how it stood up to the great wealth of Italian cuisine books we have today in English. But what do I know. I obviously must go back and reconsider my opinion.<br /><br />What Bertolli attends to better than practically every other cookbook author I can think of (except for the very high-end restaurant chefs such as Thomas Keller and Rick Tramonto) is taste and the nature of his ingredients. In giving instructions for a broccoli dish, I can think of very few other chefs who would take the care to suggest that you buy older broccoli for the long braise, as this will stand up better to the heat over a longer time. This is not to say that Bertolli goes as far into essays on major ingredients in the style of his later, excellent `Cooking By Hand' book. This later book goes so far as to leave the world of cookbooks and enter the world of culinary essays you typically find from John Thorne, with the difference that Bertolli is a professional cook and amateur writer, while Thorne is a professional writer and amateur cook. I did, however, find the essay on yeast bread baking to be as good as anything I have seen elsewhere for the length.<br /><br />Note that the reference to sources of materials is not in an appendix at the end of the book, but placed at the end of the relevant essay on technique. So, names and addresses of sources for bread flour and home flourmills can be found at the end of the essay on bread baking.<br /><br />This probably explains why Bertolli succeeds in committing two of the prime fallacies exposed in a recent `Good Eats' episode by Alton Brown. Bertolli rolls out the old chestnuts about searing being a means of sealing in moisture into meat and not washing mushrooms with any water to prevent adding any more to the liberal amount of moisture in mushrooms already. I give Alton Brown great credit for shining light on these myths, but I am quite at ease with forgiving Bertolli his repeating this conventional wisdom, especially since Harold McGee's article on the searing / moisture myth came out about the same time this book was published.<br /><br />Oddly enough, the focus on works by McGee, Brown, and Shirley Corriher may be partly due to the rarity of works with Bertolli's form of culinary phenomenology. What I mean here is that Bertolli shows that there is a lot to know about good and interesting cooking which has nothing to do with science, but just simple observation and experience.<br /><br />Chez Panisse cookbooks have been published by Random House and by Harper Collins, and they are uniformly attractive to the eye, asthey are entertaining and informative to the mind. While both of these publishing houses have great reputations for putting out good books, I have to congratulate Ms. Waters for her stylish work in print. I miss the great woodcuts which appear only on the cover of this volume and not throughout, but Bertolli's text needs all the space it can get. Another item which may seem small to some, but which always boost's my opinion of a book is the fact that the Table of Contents lists every single recipe by name and by page number. I am also very happy that this book divides dishes by more by principle ingredient than by course.<br /><br />One of my routine checks on the quality of a cookbook is an examination of the recipes for stocks. And, I am quite pleased that Bertolli has given me another important rule of thumb on stock making, something I have never read elsewhere (or, just as important, if I did read it, it did not stick in my memory). The point is that all things being equal, meat stocks are better if you go light on the vegetables. Vegetable flavors can always be added in when the dish is made, but the whole story about a chicken stock should be the chicken.<br /><br />If I were not an incurable cookbook collector, this book would be high on my list of sources for my daily cooking, right behind Julia Child, Marcella Hazan, and Jamie Oliver (yes, that Jamie Oliver).<br /><br />A truly excellent book and cookbook!the eye, as they are entertaining and informative to the mind.

Less good as Intellectual History	`Wittgenstein's Poker' by journalists David Edmonds & John Eidinow is a 340 page book built upon the telling of a ten (10) minute encounter between Ludwig Wittgenstein and Karl Popper where, according to some accounts, Wittgenstein threatened Popper with a fireplace poker in rage over a difference of opinion regarding the nature of philosophical problems.<br /><br />Judging by the number of reviews of this book, I am delighted that it has accomplished the task of creating interest in two of the more important intellectual figures of the 20th century. I am less happy that until the end of the book, the authors give more or less equal weight to the statures of the two men, even so far as to give them almost equal billing in the book's subtitle. The only additional weight given to Wittgenstein is based upon the fact that Wittgenstein wielded the fireplace tool rather than Popper.<br /><br />Forty years ago, when I began my study of Wittgenstein as a prospective professional philosopher, his reputation was still rising among English speaking professional philosophers, even if he had not yet entered the consciousness of the literate public at large. There were probably yet no `New Yorker' cartoons published with Wittgenstein mentioned in the caption. At the same time, Popper's star had peaked and was already in decline. As mentioned by the authors, articles by followers of Wittgenstein's methods such as Paul Feyerabend were the primary texts in Philosophy of Science classes. Popper was not even studied in undergraduate classes on the Philosophy of Science, and that was his primary area of expertise in philosophy. Wittgenstein, on the other hand, like Plato, Aristotle, Kant, and Hume dealt with general issues of philosophical method and the big brother of Philosophy of Science, the study of Epistemology, or the questions regarding what it is we can know. And, Wittgenstein's influence did not stop there. By the time I got to graduate school for Philosophy, Wittgenstein's methods were pervasive in all branches of Philosophy and translating, publishing, and interpreting his writings had become a cottage industry for a generation of his students in both England and the United States.<br /><br />If this book suffers at all, it is in not understanding philosophy. One statement which confirms my opinion here is when they describe Popper's position regarding the defining characteristic of science as being subject to being disproved by observation, and complain that Popper did not allow the same courtesy to be applied to his theories. The problem with this statement is that while Popper is talking about science, his theory is not itself composed of scientific statements, they are philosophical statements and, as such, subject to a different kind of support or refutation than from observation of the physical world. Ironically, it is in Wittgenstein's doctrines that one can most clearly see the difference between a philosophical and a scientific statement. In a sense, philosophical statements are supported or weakened by examining how people speak about and believe about a subject. Secondarily, philosophical statements are supported or weakened by how well they hang together logically. In this sense, there are some standards which are common to both philosophy and science, but then, logical criteria is a measure of all human discourse except, possibly, some aspects of art and religion.<br /><br />Another symptom of the authors' not understanding philosophy, at least not understanding Wittgenstein, is in their summary evaluation that the meaning of Wittgenstein's philosophical pronouncements are elusive. I will not claim that one can grasp their meaning on a single reading, but unlike some poetry texts such as the famous one from Keat's on a Grecian urn, the lion's share of discussion about Wittgenstein is in the application of and the usefulness of his positions, not their meaning. Philosophers spend no more time decoding Wittgenstein's parables than they do Plato's myth of the cave in `The Republic'. I get some feeling also that they do not fully understand Wittgenstein's characterization of philosophical problems as `only' problems in language. Wittgenstein and his students do not reduce Philosophy to linguistics; rather, they have elevated linguistics into the service of Philosophy and cast new light on what is an effective philosophical solution.<br /><br />I may have less regard for this book than most because except for the details surrounding this particular incident, most of the events of both Wittgenstein's and Popper's professional life is already known to me. And yet, I do not fault the authors for picking a tabloid worthy event as a hook upon which to write for the genera public a very nice story about the lives and careers of two men who had an immense influence on 20th century intellectual history and who, at the same time, are probably relatively unknown to the general reading public.<br /><br />I believe these authors have done a commendable thing if they create an interest in reading more about these men. To this end, they have provided an admirable bibliography of biographical and philosophical works. It may have been just a little useful to separate the biographical from the philosophical, so that one can more easily choose one or the other. It would also have been a worthwhile service to give some evaluation of the biographical texts, especially since several biographies of Wittgenstein have been written since his death.<br /><br />If you know nothing of Wittgenstein, read this book and follow it to other sources if it peaks your interest. If you have a good knowledge of Wittgenstein and his life, try a new biography or new treatment of his philosophy.s parables than they do Plato's myth of the cave in `The Republic'.

Good reason to try it.	`Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me' by first time author and folksinger, Richard Farina is firmly established among the cult classics of 20th century English literature, along with all the other books such as `Lord of the Flies', `Lord of the Rings', `Catch-22', `Catcher in the Rye', `Animal Farm, and `1984' one simply had to read when I was a high school and college student in the 1960's. Before I started this review, I happened to see a gratifyingly large number of reviews of this book, almost forty years after its publication and the author's untimely death.<br /><br />What surprised me were the few, but well thought out negative, one star reviews. I can appreciate that this book may not be to everyone's taste. I could never quite fathom why my uncle could never make it past the first page of `The Hobbit', but then, he was an Ernest Hemingway man, so I never pushed the point. I am much more disappointed when my young second cousins don't seem to be captivated by the charm of their first exposure to a Hobbit hole. But I digress.<br /><br />So, I decided to see if I could answer some of the points mad by the critics.<br /><br />For starters, I am reluctant to dissuade anyone from reading any work of fiction. The evidence of my tastes versus those of my uncle show that narrative which may strike one person like a Mike Tyson blow to the viscera may simply leave someone else as cold as a frozen squid. Unlike my initial contact with Tolkein through a reference to `Lord of the Rings' by a fellow student in a class on Shakespeare, or my first encounter with Stephen King by noticing that Stanley Kubrick was to be making a movie of `The Shining', I have no memory of how I decided to pick up Farina's novel. I know it was while I was in college and I can recall the impact of those first two pages as clearly as if I had read them yesterday.<br /><br />All of this is an attempt to address those who say that this novel is not as good as works by William Burroughs, D. H. Lawrence, Thomas Pynchon, and Jack Kerouac. I approach this argument lightly because I deal with similar arguments every time I write a cookbook review. But then, cooking is different from fiction. In spite of some wide variations in taste, there are better and worse ways to make a chicken stock. If you heat it too high or cook it too long or put in too many vegetables, your stock will simply not be as good as it you religiously followed that recipe from the Culinary Institute of America or any one of a hundred other sound books on culinary basics. My personal reaction to this argument is that I have tried to read the works of William Burroughs, Henry Miller, Laurence Durrell, Thomas Pynchon, and Jack Kerouac, and many of these have left me cold, especially works by Durrell and Kerouac. I liked `Naked Lunch', but I appreciated the talent without the visceral punch. I really enjoyed Miller's `A Devil in Paradise', but that was non-fiction. I really respect Pynchon, but he has never been able to draw me into his longer works. Durrell and Kerouac simply leave me cold.<br /><br />The classic aesthetic argument is that those who have broad experience in reading and thinking about an art form best determine issues of quality. For that reason, I find a certain respect for the opinions of those who have read widely in Farina's contemporary writers, but I must submit that the book's language holds a power which should not be denied, especially if you are or were recently a college student. I confess the book may have lost some of its immediacy since the end of the draft and the Vietnam War; however, recent threats may bring back the feelings that leant such relevance to the life of the principal characters.<br /><br />This brings me to the second major argument I have seen. This is the claim that there are no admirable characters in this book, or at least no characters with which one can identify. I am inclined to dismiss the objection that there are no admirable or noble characters, as I think good fiction is filled with lead characters for which I have no admiration. Shakespeare's tragedies alone are filled with characters with `issues'.<br /><br />The central tragedy of this story is that lead character Gnossos Pappadopoulis imagines, throughout the first part of the book, that `I am invisible, ... And Exempt. Immunity has been granted to me, for I do not loose my cool. Polarity is selected at will, for I am not ionized and I possess no valence.'

Bittman certainly raised my expectations high enough to buy it immediately upon seeing the name of the author and the subject.<br /><br />Contrary to my glib title to this review, this book is much less a real cooking competition between Bittman and famous chefs than it is a `cover story' for a foodie book genre which may have been created by Julia Child late in her PBS career. The underlying structure is that the host, a journalist / cookbook author as with Bittman or Child or a famous chef, as in the case of Jeremiah Tower, visits each `FAMOUS CHEF' in their restaurant kitchens or similar venue and cook some stuff. In the case of Julia Child, the focus was strictly on the cuisine of the visiting fireman. Bittman tweaks the premise by adding his own home cooking dishes to match up with the efforts of the professional. Then, with no judges or time clocks in evidence, each samples the other's dishes.<br /><br />One of the first revelations in this book is that Bittman admits to not being a very good cook himself. While this is very interesting, it is not surprising, as Jim Villas in his `Between Bites' essay on Craig Claiborne, states that the great New York Times culinary writer was pretty deliberate in the kitchen himself (a kind way of saying `slow'). I believe it is fair to say that this certainly does not mean Bittman or Claiborne don't know food and cooking. It means that they have not spent years cooking the same dishes over and over and they have not spend decades practicing their knife skills to the point where they can reduce an onion to a fine dice in seconds. In contrast, Chris Schlesinger describes Bittman's knife skills with an onion as an exercise in `hacking'.<br /><br />My anticipation and enthusiasm for the book grew as I started reading about the differences between home and professional cooking. I have seen it said before, but never with such force, that while many restaurant dishes simply cannot be done in the home, the opposite is true as well. There are some dishes that simply cannot be made as well in a restaurant as they can at home. The primary advantage of the restaurant kitchen are the very hot heat sources, either as oven, wok, or grill plus specialized forms of heat such as salamanders and Indian tandoori ovens. Other advantages are the battalion of prep chefs and the access to very high quality ingredients (See the excellent essay on this matter in `Kinkead's Cookbook'). The home cook has the advantage of time. If a dish requires a long cooking time followed by immediate delivery to the dinner table, a restaurant simply cannot make it. All restaurant dishes must be prepped up to the final step, where ingredients sit in preparation to be fired and completed in no more than 20 minutes.<br /><br />So now I have read the introduction on how Bittman collected his collaborators, starting with old friends such as Daniel Boulud and Chris Schlesinger and ending with long time collaborator Jean-Georges Vongerichten. In between, he visits ten other major culinary stars such as Michel Richard and up and coming luminaries such as Kerry Simon. The anecdotes in this intro have honed my anticipation for the descriptions of the cooking. So now, I get to the section entitled `The Chefs and The Dishes' and am puzzled by tables of dish names by venue and chef. The reason for this section is explained as I turn to page 33 with the title `Starters' and find that all the recipes are arranged by type of dish. I am as deflated as a souffle when the oven door opens too early!<br /><br />Bittman has raised my expectations of tales of culinary rapport to a high peak, only to dash them on an organization of recipes that totally swims against the main premise of his book. When I reviewedJeremiah Tower's similar book, I was pleased with his arranging the recipes by type or course, since this improved the value of the book as a conventional reference cookbook. I expected that Bittman's premise would make an organization by chef the best choice, as this would best highlight all the differences between Bittman's home style and the chef's professional style in the four to six dishes the two cooks prepare together. It would also be an effective way to compare, for example, the French classicism of Vongerichten and Richard against the Spanish new wave cooking of Jose Andres. But this was not to be. What made it worse is that `The Chefs and The Dishes' outline did not give page numbers pointing to all the recipes of, for example Daniel Boulud. As I check the publisher, somehow I am not surprised to find that it is Wiley Publishing, the same house that does a slipshod job of editing the CIA books. Never have I more wanted to be a book editor in a position to prevent this mistake. Given my reaction to the book, it seems as if there was no senior editor at Wiley who sat down and looked over the whole project and did not see the weaknesses in the design of the book.<br /><br />After all that, this is still a very good foodie read, similar to `Kinkead's Cookbook'. Just as Bob Kinkead has thousands of cookbooks, but has never prepared a dish directly from one of these recipes, this is a book you want to read from cover to cover and garner as many insights about techniques as you can. The sidebars and headnotes are full of useful and entertaining information, but the book could have been much better!I reviewed Jeremiah Tower's similar book, I was pleased with his arranging the recipes by type or course, since this improved the value of the book as a conventional reference cookbook.

Buy this book	`Vegetarian Suppers from Deborah Madison's Kitchen' is, you guessed it, Deborah Madison's latest cookbook for her audience who eats everything but animal flesh. The photograph of the author in her kitchen pretty much says it all about what this book wants to do. There is no urban sophisticate among the many award placards from her `Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone' and no friendly farm girl from the spine of `Local Flavors'. This Deborah has the broad smile of someone who is about to cook me supper.<br /><br />Ms. Madison begins with a discourse of wordplay on the largely illusory difference between `supper' and `dinner'. Her premise, and the rationale behind her title, is that while dinner is a formal sit-down affair with courses and wine and the like, supper is much more casual, much more likely to be an ad hoc affair resulting from the casual invitation of some friends after bowling or church or a visit to the Farmer's Market. As something of a minor expert on language and a reader of quite a few cookbooks in the last two years, I simply do not find any consensus for this interpretation of these two words. Luckily, the remainder of the book depends not at all on this lexicographer's distinction.<br /><br />Unlike the encyclopedic `...Everyone' and the special interest of `...Flavors', this book is something of a `greatest hits' book based on the very sound premise that the amateur cook is served best by concentrating on doing a few recipes well instead of following the foodie path of learning to cook everything from guanciale (pig jowls) to Indian flatbreads. While I happen to lean more towards an interest in pig jowls than in limiting my range of recipes, I find this an excellent position for people for whom food is not a hobby, but they do like to cook well once or twice a week. This position is shared by everyone from Ina Garten to, in a somewhat modified form, Daniel Boulud. In Ms. Madison's case, the argument is at least three times stronger if you happen to also be someone who avoids eating animal flesh.<br /><br />All this means that the recipes in this book are expected to be better than average by either being a selection of the best recipes or average recipes rewritten to enhance their value to the average amateur cook. As an exercise, I compared the grilled vegetable sandwich recipes in this book with a similar one in `...Everyone' and found the newer recipe to be more interesting in that it replaces garlic mayonnaise with chipotle mayonnaise, replaces eggplant with zucchini, and replaces a baguette with tortillas. It also throws in some Anaheim chiles and some pepper jack cheese as options. I also compared the list of asparagus recipes in this book with the list in `...Everyone' and find no overlaps.<br /><br />On a personal, visceral level, Ms. Madison gets me where it counts by starting off with chapters on `savory pies and gratins' and `vegetable stews and braises', two of my very favorite types of dishes. These subjects should be a sure sign to everyone that this book is not about quick cooking. It is all about adding new `comfort food' dishes to your repertoire. The author compounds her hold on my interest by including lots of recipes with mushrooms and a recipe that combines mushrooms and Brussels sprouts. Yummy! I was surprised to find a ratatouille recipe in this `Supper' book, just as I was surprised to look back and find it missing from `...Everyone'. In her headnotes, Ms. Madison explains that she has actually not made ratatouille for years, being too busy making other things. So, I guess this left her the option to take a fresh approach in this book to a classic comfort food dish. One quick look at the recipe will confirm that this is a dish for a leisurely Sunday afternoon. It includes `Spongy Semolina Crepes', a yeast-risen pancake which takes a few hours to let the batter rise.<br /><br />The third chapter is `pasta with vegetables' which seems to be a bow to the low carb theme in that the recipesmake liberal use of whole wheat pasta mixed liberally with low carb veggies. I gain no end of satisfaction from Ms. Madison's confessing that she is hopeless at making gnocchi, while I have sat at Mario Batali's feet to learn how to put out a half decent potato gnocchi.<br /><br />The fourth chapter is `crepes and fritters'. This is another low blow to things I like best to make. Does this woman have no mercy! Best of all, these are not your typical Julia Child recipes.<br /><br />The fifth chapter is `mostly tofu (and some tempeh)', totally understandable as this is a `vegetarian' book and Ms. Madison has written an entire book on tofu. As I have no interest in buying a book on tofu written by a gringo (as opposed to a book by an Indian such as Madhur Jaffrey), this chapter is more than enough to give me ideas on tofu recipes.<br /><br />The sixth chapter is `eggs for supper', another cheap shot to my favorite dishes. If you are a frittata expert, you may still find interesting stuff in here.<br /><br />The remaining chapters are `hearty cool-weather suppers', `supper sandwiches', and `basics'. All very sound contributions, especially the sandwich recipes.<br /><br />The value of the recipes is enhanced by suggestions for accompaniments, both of other dishes, wines, beers, and garnishes. The appendix on pantry items is nice, but redundant if you already own `...Everyone'.<br /><br />The brightest light from this book comes from the `dozen ideas for making supper good'. Any book that gives me good guidance for living on top of good recipes immediately jumps to the top of the heap for me.<br />Unlike `Local Flavors', this book is for everyone! Very highly recommended.xed liberally with low carb veggies.

287565:US	39134375	R3SN3ZNEDAMA7V	0767909267	824735510	The Minimalist Cooks at Home: Recipes That Give You More Flavor from Fewer Ingredients in Less Time	Books	5	33	33	N	N	If you just want to cook a few dishes well, buy this book!	`The Minimalist Cooks at Home' is from New York Times culinary columnist, Mark Bittman, who is filling a classic Times role created by the noted French chef, Pierre Franey, who elevated the fast cooking genre over thirty years ago in columns in the very same New York Times and in books compiled from these columns. Since I still see Franey's '60 Minute Gourmet' volumes on the shelves of bookstores, I guess I must keep them on mine at least until I review these two volumes of columns.<br /><br />While Franey is probably a far better cook than his successor, Bittman may be a much better writer or at least better at homing in on things which are important to people wishing to make good food fast. I have reviewed his `How to Cook Everything' and his `Fish' cookbook and have found both of them excellent material for a modest shelf of cookbooks. In this book and others Bittman has done from his Times column, Bittman is playing the thinking man's Rachael Ray. I say that with no disrespect toward Ms. Rachael, as I have favorably reviewed all her books. Rachael's recipe write-ups are great for people with fair kitchen skills who want very good step by step directions on how to get from groceries to dinner as quickly as possible. Bittman, on the other hand, takes a much broader viewpoint. His `minimalist' notion is not simply a matter of doing things quickly. In his words, `...these recipes require a minimum of technique and/or a minimum number of ingredients; most of them are fast as well. The approach is strictly less-is-more', an attempt to repoduce recipes that are so sophisticated, savvy, and fresh that they will inspire even experienced cooks while making them basic and simple enough to tempt novices'.<br /><br />Like Jacques Pepin in both his classic `The Short Cut Cook' and his recent `Fast Food My Way', Bittman begins by selecting recipes which are simple to begin with rather than, like Franey and Ray, modifying recipes to shorten normally long cooking approaches. In Franey's case, a recipe in his book such as his chili has sometimes disappointed me. I believe Frenchman Franey never sensed the essence of chili and produced something which simply does not work very well as `chili', which, I suspect, simply does not make it without a long braise. Franey's collections of columns even go so far as to give us the French names of his dishes. A quick browse of Tony Bourdain's `Les Halle' Cookbook' will demonstrate that lots of classic French recipes are actually pretty easy to make, but a focus on French cuisine is a bit limiting in today's American thinking about food.<br /><br />Bittman improves on Franey by making each recipe a little essay on how to succeed with a very useful and interesting family of dishes. The recipe is simply an exemplar which can serve as a jumping off point for a modest to wide range of variations. Surprisingly, Bittman also improves on Frenchman Franey by providing suggestions for wine pairings. He also covers `Keys to Success', points on ingredients or technique which will improve the quality of the dish.<br /><br />My overall evaluation of this book may be jaded by having reviewed over 400 cookbooks and find no easy niche into which to stick this work and others based on Bittman's New York Times columns. The thing which best illuminates the value of this book for me is an opinion shared by both Ina Garten and Deborah Madison that the home cook should concentrate on mastering just a few good dishes and variations on those dishes. Madison assures us that cooking will become much more pleasurable when a simple dish can be whipped up largely from memory.<br /><br />If you agree with this position, and I find it a very attractive position to take if you are not a foodie, but like to cook well at least once a week, then this book and it's siblings are some of the very best you can choose, unless you happen to be a vegetarian, in which case you go for Deborah Madison's new book, `Vegetarian Suppers'.<br /><br />Madison and Bittman share strong writing skills with excellent choices of recipes in what are really volumes of `personal best' recipes.<br /><br />If you eat meat, like to cook now and then, and do not have room for a large cookbook collection, you could do a lot worse than by limiting yourself to Mark Bittman cookbooks.<br /><br />Highly recommended.ith excellent choices of recipes in what are really volumes of `personal best' recipes.

Not as Great as Her Earlier Books	`Local Flavors' by leading vegetarian cookbook author and teacher, Deborah Madison is quite a bit different from her most famous and critically successful book, `Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone' which I consider a candidate for top ten positioning in anyone's list of cookbooks and easily near the top of your list of vegetarian cookbooks.<br /><br />As quite loudly proclaimed by the subtitle, this book is really all about regional, seasonal, and organic produce from farmers' markets. As such, it is very close to Jack Bishop's book, `A Year in the Vegetarian Kitchen', as the primary organization of chapters is a cross between the seasons and types of vegetables. This is not quite as awkward as it may seem, as most members of a particular vegetable class, such as the cabbages and the onions typically come into season at about the same time. The book may be either more or less valuable than Bishop's book, depending on how close you live to either a Farmer's Market or a Community Supported Agriculture cooperative. If either is within an hour's drive, this book will be a great resource in making the best of these organizations.<br /><br />Part of my modest reaction to this book is based on the fact that I live within 10 to 40 minutes drive of seven different permanent or semi-permanent `farmer's market' organizations, and I believe but three of those seven sites' produce comes primarily from things grown by the chap behind the table, or a close family member of the chap behind the table. And, it is precisely this direct contact with the farmer that Madison believes is so valuable to the Farmer's Market experience. Even with these seven locations, the only produce from all these sites together which is truly local is the corn, the apples, the strawberries, some peaches, and some of the tomatoes. Almost all the other produce comes from Florida, California, or South America, with some summer stone fruits from the Carolinas and Georgia. So, almost everything Madison explains about getting the most out of your Farmer's Market experience is wasted on me.<br /><br />Madison's most important service in this book aside from the seasonally organized recipes is the clarification of what is the value of our patronizing Farmer's Markets. It is definitely not price. I strongly concur on this, as my local corn farmer's stand charges 50% more than my favorite megamart, in spite of the fact that the stand is a mere 35 yards from the cornfields. The real values are from acquiring exquisitely fresh produce (a REALLY big issue with corn and tomatoes) which is, if so advertised, free of artificial pesticides and free of treatment by herbicides or, with chickens, treatment with growth hormones or antibiotics. Additional values accrue from the fact that while the farmer gets about 9% of the sale of the produce at the megamart, they get 100% of the sale at a Farmer's Market, less the fee to rent the stand and the time required to truck in the goods and set up the stand at some ungodly hour of the morning.<br /><br />The value is also not in the acquisition of the most attractive produce. I often thought that the poor looking produce at farm stands was due to the absence of artificial fertilizer and pesticides. It turns out that the real reason may be due to the fact that the farmer is selling things at the stands that may fall below the standards of his commercial distributors.<br /><br />I think Madison's second most important contribution to her readers with this book is the advice to plan to stay a fair length of time at the market to get the lay of the land and talk to the vendors and to fellow customers. I really think this is a pretty good measure of how well the producers know their stuff. Nothing turns me off of a store faster than asking a question of a salesperson and they simply have no clue of what you speak, and volunteer no opportunity to speak to the store owner or some other potential expert. This is clearly a sign that this store is not astore or stand with which I want to do business. And, I am often surprised at how few merchants are aware of this fact. Within a block of one another there are three Italian delis in Little Italy in Manhattan with very similar wares. They even look a lot alike. Two are practically empty of customers. The third, DiPalo's, is crowded enough to require you to take a number when you enter the little store. This is because the DiPalo family members behind the counter really know what they are talking about and go out of their way to be sure you get what you want.<br /><br />Getting back to the book, I will suggest that you take a by on this one unless you are within acceptable driving distance of a genuine Farmer's Market. Many of the recipes and subjects are covered in much greater detail in `Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone' and, when I went to actually make one of the recipes, I found a fairly serious lapse in the instructions which neglected to tell me how to prep an onion for the cooking. If I would have followed directions literally, I would have put an unpeeled onion in a pot of hot olive oil.<br /><br />On the positive side, I give Ms. Madison good marks for covering eggs and cheese and poultry in addition to the veggies. The bibliography and sources are slanted toward Farmers' Markets, but there is still a fair overlap to `Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone'.<br /><br />If you are close to a Farmer's Market and fully intend to spend time there OR if you are an inveterate foodie who must have every title by important cookbook authors, then buy this book. Otherwise, buy `Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone' or `The Savory Way'.usiness. And, I am often surprised at how few merchants are aware of this fact.

I am more than happy to follow suit by giving this book five stars with a bullet! Virtually the only complaint I have about the book is that based on the title, the book has sat on my shelves for about a year, being opened only to search out a recipe for a particular vegetable, in much the same way I would open one of my several books on vegetable cooking.<br /><br />This book should be called `All Cooking for People Who Don't Eat Meat', as it is indeed a cross between the `Joy of Cooking' plus a cooking textbook from Anne Willen or Madeline Kamman, with all the references to cooking meat, fowl, game, fin fish, or shellfish removed. It's odd that the book's cover touts Madison as the author of `The Greens Cookbook', as this book is much more a successor to her later book, `The Savory Way' as a general audience cookbook rather than a restaurant menu book.<br /><br />Another of the many reasons I regret the time I have lost in discovering the virtues of this work is that I have spend great praise on similar vegetarian cooking manuals such as Madhur Jaffrey's `World Vegetarian', Peter Berley's `The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen', and Jack Bishop's `The Complete Italian Vegetarian' without advising the readers of those books that there is another title which is as good or better than these other volumes. All have their virtues, but Madison's book is the best. This is due to no little extent to her concentrating on vegetarian dishes known to and loved by Americans. While the Italians and the Indians have great vegetarian cuisines, the familiar dish will serve much better than the non-familiar. And, Ms. Madison, according to my new and improved title for her book, includes a very nice chapter of advice on entertaining with meatless dishes. Another subject which none of the other books touch is the issue of matching wines with meatless dishes. Ms. Madison even takes on the challenge of recommending a wine to accompany artichokes. My meager wine knowledge goes no further than to say she agrees with Mario Batali's recommendation. That's good enough for me!<br /><br />Ms. Madison is a model of modesty when she claims not to have given us a book on all possible subjects, as specialized books on artisinal breads and regional cooking and pasta making and pastry making can cover those subjects much better than she can in a general cookbook. That doesn't mean she has not done a bang-up job on the coverage of the topics she has chosen to present. This is how I think she fares on six of my favorite general cooking topics:<br /><br />On omelets, the treatment is concise, possibly shorter than the very detailed description by Elizabeth David, but excellent nonetheless. She touches every single recommendation I have heard about making the classic French omelet. My only reservation may be that since omelet making is all about technique, a few pictures would have really filled things out, especially as Ms. Madison's artist makes a great contribution when his drawings do appear. There are only three variations, but then, there are hundreds of variations available in the library of books on French cooking. Ms. Madison gets an A+ on her presentation of the general method.<br /><br />On stocks, Ms. Madison only has to deal with vegetable stocks, but I believe she has done the very best job of treating vegetable stocks I have seen anywhere, including the treatment given in a book on vegetarian soups. She is especially careful to warn us to only put something in a stock if we are willing to eat it. Stocks are no place for garbage. She also keeps the simmer time down to below the recommended time by stock experts like the CIA. But, she goes far beyond this contribution in that she gives an analysis of what goes well together in vegetable stocks, and what should be left out.<br /><br />On yeast breads,only a few basic recipes are covered, yet these are presented in such an effective way and with such positive words of encouragement that one may feel guilty in not making your own sandwich bread.<br /><br />On sandwiches, one can wonder exactly what you can do if you leave out meat. Ms. Madison has many, many pages of suggestions on meatless sandwiches, topping it all off with a great series of toasted cheese sandwiches and meatless quesadillas.<br /><br />On pasta making, her presentation may not replace the books by Marcella Hazan, but you could do much worse than to learn your pasta making from Ms. Madison. The best news for the amateur is that unlike Ms. Hazan, Ms. Madison gives you instruction for hand, stand mixer, and food processor techniques. Both machine methods are probably a real boon for people who love the idea of making fresh pasta but do not have the hand strength to manage the kneading of stiff dough.<br /><br />On sauces, Ms. Madison's recipes and technique are right on target. I have heard widely respected TV teaching chefs give plainly false information on sauce making. I have also experienced some really weak bechamel recipes in a cookbook under the Betty Crocker logo.

Ms. Madison has many, many pages of suggestions on meatless sandwiches, topping it all off with a great series of toasted cheese sandwiches and meatless quesadillas. <br /> <br />On pasta making, her presentation may not replace the books by Marcella Hazan, but you could do much worse than to learn your pasta making from Ms. Madison. The best news for the amateur is that unlike Ms. Hazan, Ms. Madison gives you instruction for hand, stand mixer, and food processor techniques. Both machine methods are probably a real boon for people who love the idea of making fresh pasta but do not have the hand strength to manage the kneading of stiff dough. <br /> <br />On sauces, Ms. Madison's recipes and technique are right on target. I have heard widely respected TV teaching chefs give plainly false information on sauce making. I have also experienced some really weak bechamel recipes in a cookbook under the Betty Crocker logo.

292434:US	39134375	R1SZLCZ6P952G9	0767901665	892609709	The Savory Way	Books	5	51	57	N	N	Excellent Culinary Source for Vegetarians and Others	`The Savory Way' is an early (1990) book from leading vegetarian cookbook author, Deborah Madison so, as Ms. Madison has a new book on the way, I thought it was high time for me to catch up with her body of work so I can give an informed review of how her new volume fits into her other books.<br /><br />Ms. Madison is a former colleague of Alice Waters and Lindsey Shere at Chez Panisse who specializes in a very general way, like Mollie Katzen and Madhur Jaffrey, on dishes that fit into a vegetarian lifestyle. Note that the term `vegetarian', especially as used by these three authors, is extremely misleading, as it is much more appropriate to say that they construct meals of everything under the sun except meat, fowl, fin fish and shell fish. Both Madison and Jaffrey make extensive use of milk, cheese, yoghurt, and eggs.<br /><br />Madison's objective in this book is, in fact, to cover as broad as possible a survey of what can be done without using animal flesh. The book's title may be a bit misleading to some foodies in that `savory' is often one of the words used to divide dishes in two great groups of `savory' and `sweet'. This book in fact includes two rather long chapters on sweets.<br /><br />A first look at this book shows lots of headnotes to the many recipes. The first thing you need to know if you are put off by `chatty' recipe books is that these notes are almost exclusively devoted to an understanding of the cooking involved with the recipe and how to get the best results from your ingredients. While little stories about the historical provenance of a recipe may interest many, including myself, that is not what this book is about. On top of this, I firmly agree with the blurbed opinion from Mollie Katzen who compliments both her cuisine AND her writing. Almost all professional culinary writers are pretty good, or have an excellent copy editor at work on their prose, but Ms. Madison is a food service professional who writes very well. I often wish the soon to be beknighted Jamie Oliver had a bit more talent with words, as I find his books so comforting in spite of the heavy contribution from his editors.<br /><br />The very first attraction of the book is its Table of Contents, which lists every single recipe title in the front of the book. This is doubly useful in that this relatively long book divides recipes into chapters covering eleven different types of dishes suitable for just about any time of the day, including a good selection of recipes very good for breakfast. The eleven recipe chapters are:<br /><br />Quick Bites with 40 pages of recipes for sandwiches, toasts, and spreads.<br /><br />Salads to Start or Make a Meal with 42 pages<br /><br />Soups and Stews with 50 pages of thick, thin, and pureed soups, including a new one with my favorite fall ingredient, chestnuts.<br /><br />Eighteen Quick Pasta Dishes for Five and Company, 32 pages<br /><br />Stovetop Vegetables, 27 pages of sautes and braises.<br /><br />Baked and Roasted Vegetables, 25 pages with ratatouille, gratins, tians, and other goodies.<br /><br />Grilled Vegetables and their Sauces, 11 pages with two to six sauces per grilled dish.<br /><br />Down to Earth, 26 pages on Rice, Potatoes and Beans (although beans appear throughout all chapters!)<br /><br />Morning Foods for Day and Night, 26 pages of Eggs and Cheese and Cereals and Breads.<br /><br />Finishing Touches, 31 pages of sauces, salsas, condiments, dressings, pastes, and you name it.<br /><br />Desserts, 45 pages on Fruit Dishes, Cream Cheeses, Pastries, and Custards<br /><br />Sweetmeats, 12 pages on sweet pastes, peels, syrups, dried fruits, and other dessert dressings.<br /><br />Every recipe I examined is relatively simple to prepare with fewer expensive or rare ingredients than you may find with Jaffrey or Jack Bishop, and great tips on understanding the recipes and the ingredients.<br /><br />The appendix is just right for the occasional home cook who is lost in the forest of equipment you can find in a first rate kitchen supply store such as the second floor at Zabars. Ms. Madison puts it all in perspective by highlighting all my favorite tools such as gratin and tian pots, the mortar and pestle, a few good knives, the food mill and the pizza stone and peel. The chapter on the pantry has lots for the novice and a few good tips for the foodie, such as the fact that Mexican olive oils can be very spicy. Possibly the best items in the Appendix are the lists of dishes for special purposes such as entertaining, feeding large groups, and fitting into a low fat diet (note that for the number of recipes in this book, this low fat list is surprisingly short).<br /><br />The list of sources is short with no Internet sites provided, but I recognize that virtually all of these vendors are still in business. The bibliography is also brief, but hits all the right titles, especially Joy Larkcom's excellent `The Salad Garden'.<br /><br />This book is a great resource for `liberal' vegetarians who simply eschew meat. I would add this to Madhur Jaffrey's `World Vegetarian', Peter Berley's `The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen', and Jack Bishop's `The Complete Italian Vegetarian' to create a great core vegetarian library. I cannot at this time compare this to Ms. Madison's other books, as this is the first I have read, although I sense many of her more recent books have a narrower scope, focusing on vegetable dishes. I plan to review her other books in the next few days.<br /><br />Highly recommended for both vegetarians and foodies in general.en supply store such as the second floor at Zabars.

294586:US	39134375	R1UN57D5YYW6F2	0517592215	233414309	Paris Boulangerie-Patisserie: Recipes from Thirteen Outstanding French Bakeries	Books	4	49	60	N	Y	Great Vicarious Tour of Paris Baking. Less value for recipes	`Paris Boulangerie Patisserie' by culinary journalist, Linda Dannenberg, subtitled `Recipe's from Thirteen Outstanding French Bakeries' has the look about it of being a book on the fast track to the budget book piles. This impression is reinforced by the fact that it is published by Gramercy Books, a division of Random House Value Publishing. This gives some explanation of some printing and editing gaffs such as the fact that the very first page of text is Page 9. Counting backwards, page 1 is the frontispiece. This is very, very odd by American publishing standards. Another odd symptom is that there is a reference to sources on page 00. Needless to say, the sources do not appear on the front cover. They start in the middle of page 155. One last observation I sense is that the recipes are printed in the very awkward three (3) columns per page. This means that it is very common to find lists of ingredients split across two or more columns. Adding to this test of our eyesight is the fact that many line items on the ingredient list are split into two lines. Topping of this museum of typographical errors is the fact that the steps in the procedures are not numbered. Everything is stated in a narrative style as if being recited in a Tony Bourdain novel.<br /><br />Now that I've gotten that off my chest, let me say that this book does have a lot to offer. While there are several books such as Dorrie Greenspan's `Paris Sweets' and `The Art of the Tart' and `Tarts With Tops On' by noted English culinary writer, Tamasin Day-Lewis which get the culinary content better, these books give you nothing of the travelogue or museum tour or sources catalog aspects of this attractive book. The art and history and photographs all contribute to a strong urge to find my passport and book passage on the QM2 to Paris. As someone who has been to Paris without the benefit of reading a book like this, I strongly suggest that you check out this volume before boarding your Air France Aerobus.<br /><br />One of the most interesting aspects of the book is its explanation of the distinction between patissiers (pastry makers) and boulangers (bread bakers). The story is a cross between tales of inter-union differences on a Broadway stage job and the sneers heard between Optometrists and Ophthalmologists on professional qualifications. The bright side of this history is the fact that these two disciplines have largely been merged into dual function shops which happen to specialize a bit more on bread or a bit more on pastry. But, at least this book explains the two different counters of bread and pastry at my local Wegmans megamart that, I might add, makes some of the very best artisinal bread found in the Lehigh Valley. But back to the book.<br /><br />Since my primary interest is in culinary content and, in all modesty, I suspect that is what my two review fans look for in my reviews, I have to say that the best culinary content in this book is in the appendix of sources. It tells me, for example that there is a mill producing artisinal flours just a stones throw down the Pennsylvania Turnpike from me in Great Valley. The value of the recipes is diminished by the organization, spread out across articles on the thirteen shops covered by the book.<br /><br />I must say, at long last, that the recipes are of good quality. The level of detail is just enough to prevent a total amateur from committing a major gaff; however, it is not on the level of a first rate manual on pastry making. So, even though recipes recommend not overworking pastry dough, chilling it for 30 minutes before rolling, and rolling out carefully on a floured surface, this task can fail without a fair amount of practice. The long and the short of this point is that these are advanced recipes whose primary objective is to show off the products of these Paris shops, not to teach pastry making. My conclusion to all this is that if you are an experienced pastry maker, this book will give you lots of ideas. If you are a complete novice, read the interesting stories and start with something just a bit simpler. It is important to note that the author is reporting these recipes. There is little guarantee that the author checked the procedures by baking them herself. In contrast, Dorrie Greenspan can be trusted to have rolled out all her pastries herself as she puts electronic pen to paper. So, there are no guarantees that these recipes work as written and some expertise may be needed to fill in the blanks.<br /><br />Note that while the picture on the cover is dominated by bread and the first of the two specialties in the title is bread baking, most of the recipes in the book are for pastries. A crude estimate would put it at 25% bread and 75% pastry. And, there is virtually nothing about artisinal bread baking techniques except for a reference to `sur poolish' described as a `turn of the century method of preparing dough using a starter...'. There is little mention of interest in or detail about this method for producing artisinal bread. If your love is bread, check out Peter Reinhart's `The Bread Baker's Apprentice'.

295439:US	39134375	RKKFVMJNLUXR3	0415278090	177682081	The Varieties of Religious Experience: A Study in Human Nature	Books	5	10	10	N	N	A Giant Classic of American Intellectual Work	This new edition of philosopher / psychologist William James most enduring work, `The Varieties of Religious Experience' should show that this book is as valuable today as it was over 100 years ago when it was first published in 1902. William James is credited with being a philosopher as he gets credit for being the cofounder, with friend Charles Saunders Peirce of the distinctively American philosophical position of `Pragmatism'. In fact, William James is much more of a psychologist than a philosopher who contributed, with Sigmund Freud, to the separation of clinical psychology from philosophy into a distinct discipline. This means that while Wm. James' philosophical works were a bit amateurish when compared to professional Peirce, his knowledge of the history of philosophy is profound and this knowledge pervades and elevates this work of psychology subtitled `A Study in Human Nature'.<br /><br />I will be immensely pleased if this little review convinces a single person to discover the richness of this work as I did when I first read it over 40 years ago when I was in High School. It probably reinforced my interest in becoming a professional philosopher. While I never got my philosopher's union card (Ph.D.), my interest in the subject stays alive and my regard for this book continues to grow.<br /><br />The original work is based on a series of twenty (20) Gifford lectures on natural religion presented by Wm. James to an audience at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. This is no small honor to James, as it represents a reverse of the traditional flow of original intellectual work from Europe to the United States.<br /><br />`Natural Religion' is probably a term not often used in academia today. It has probably disappeared by being split into philosophy of religion (which is something quite different from Theology) and main stream clinical psychology. And, I have a bit of a suspicion that this study may actually have fallen into obscurity by simple neglect or embarrassment similar to the embarrassment overcome by Dr. Kinsey when he did his study of sexuality. It may be that the very act of studying religion may be seen as blasphemous. If this musing is correct, then I feel even more strongly that a knowledge of James arguments and findings cannot be more important than they are today with the growing influence of fundamentalists and issues over the separation of church and state. This book does not solve those issues, but knowledge of this book can help clarify the issues in the minds of people who deal with policy in this area.<br /><br />The first thing to understand about this book is its point of view. And, the title says it all. It is about `religious experience' and how this is different from, say, scientific observation, artistic experience, or even erotic experience, although there are probably some very strong family resemblences between religious, artistic, and erotic experiences. That means the book is not about doctrines, liturgy, theology, myths, language, or political leanings. To a great extent, James shapes what he means by religion by the scope of his inquiry. In Lecture II, James goes to great lengths to caution his audience on not putting to rigid a framework on the subject before the investigation gets underway, as the investigation may take one into unexpected directions. But, one can hardly begin unless there is a starting point. Even the simplest experiment begins with a supposition, as when you go about measuring the effects of heat on sugar, you assume that melted sugar will always behave the same way at a given temperature. So, in Lecture III, James characterizes `...the life of religion in the broadest and most general terms possible, one might say that it consists of the belief that there is an unseen order, and that our supreme good lies in harmoniously adjusting ourselves thereto. This belief and this adjustment are the religious attitude in the soul.' Like James, I am neither an anthropologist nor historian of religions, but I do get a slight sense that this statement has slanted his inquiry toward those religions where a strong single godhead is the most important belief. I may be wrong, but I sense James definition may be leaving out things like Zen Buddhism. But, I believe this simply makes the work more interesting an object of contemporary study.<br /><br />Of one thing I am certain. This starting point clearly makes the phenomenon of mystical experience the central object of interest in these lectures. Throughout lectures IV to XV, many points are deferred to a full discussion of mysticism that takes up two full lectures, XVI and XVII. I confess this focus is part of my interest in this book, as one of my high school fantasies was to join a contemplative monastic order, and I wasn't even Catholic. And, here comes the discovery of an important work by an American intellectual icon on precisely the subject that so enthralled me at the time.<br /><br />James four (4) characteristics of mystical experience set the stage for his final conclusion that arises from this definition as inexorably as the curvature of space arises out of Einstein's theory of gravity. The characteristics are:<br /><br />1. Ineffability. The experience defies expression in words.<br /><br />2. Noetic quality. They give the sense of knowing about something that those who did not have a similar experience cannot know.<br /><br />3. Transiency. Mystical experiences cannot last very long.<br /><br />4. Passivity. While voluntary rituals or practices may bring on the experience, once the experience begins, the mystic's own will shuts down and experiences are directed by some superior power.<br /><br />In case advocates of religion belittle this clinical approach, I would mention that philosophy has successfully demolished all logical arguments for God, while the evidence of mystics survives to this day.<br /><br />James philosophical works are nothing more than history.

Typically Good Recipes	'30-Minute Get Real Meals' by name above the title, tenth book and counting; Ms. Rachael Ray is her take on low carb dishes. However, as a lifelong pasta and bread girl, Rachael is tempering her low carb dishes with a lot of emphasis on `you can eat anything you want as long as you eat it in moderation'.<br /><br />Since I got a look behind her Food Network career and I have spent the last three years watching her and other Food Network shows for comparison, I have come to believe that it is to Rachael herself to whom most of the credit for her success must go. The `30 Minute Meals' concept was her invention and her first book with this title predates her Food Network show. And, I have recently begun to appreciate the value of her show's presentation strengths in teaching cooking in that there are no swap-outs, so you can see every single step in real time. A second strength is the subtle little itemization of ingredients artfully hidden in the little juggling act trips to the fridge and the pantry. My mother is suspicious that Ms. Rachael has behind the scenes help during the unknown amount of real time during the commercials and that shadowy producers refill the pantry while they are off camera so the ingredients for second and third dishes miraculously appear on her pantry shelf at about 20 minutes into the show. This may be true, but it's irrelevant to the instructive value of the show. It only means we have both seen some shows in far too many reruns and have begun to focus on irrelevant things.<br /><br />With this book, Ms. Rachael turns a new page in several different ways. For starters, she has changed publishers from very small Lake Isle Press to very large Clarkson Potter with a $2.00 boost in the list price of her trade paperback first edition which in almost every other way looks the same as her earlier books. One small difference to the good is the fact that the recipe font has changed from Ariel to Times Roman which I personally find much easier to read. The fact that it has a much richer appearance is irrelevant. Oddly, the color of the type for the recipes is still in a hard to read light blue with ingredients highlighted in a dark red. The font change makes the light color a bit easier to read, but if you had problems with the color of the type in Rachael's last book, then browse this one before buying.<br /><br />I have given the high praise to all of the earlier 30 Minute Meal books I have reviewed (except for the kids book) so the heart of the question for my opinion is whether Miss Rachael has continued to do what I have liked so much in the past. The answer is a qualified yes.<br /><br />The biggest difference in the substance of this book is that the recipes are no longer put together to form two or three course meals the way they are on the TV show. Almost all recipes stand alone in chapters organized by type of dish rather than occasion or theme. That this is a bigger change than the emphasis on low carb cooking shows that the emphasis on low carb cooking does not change the nature of her dishes all that much. Rachael still focuses on building dishes with strong flavors such as the Italian classics balsamic and red wine vinegar, garlic, Parmesano Reggiano cheese, Prosciutto ham, Italian sausage, anchovies, sun dried tomatoes, capers, and olives. In fact, the poster child for this book is the very distinctive Puttanesca sauce composed from olives, capers, anchovies, and garlic. I count five (5) different recipes, none of which include pasta, which include this combination of ingredients and `Puttanesca' in the recipe title. As Rachael will be the first to say, mixtures of these strongly flavored ingredients is one of the main secrets behind quick cooking. To Potter editors, the word `Puttanesca' does not appear in the index. Not good!<br /><br />As good an educator Rachael is about quick cooking, she is not an expert on the principles of `low carb' diets and this book shows no sophistication on what makes `low carb' work and how it can be misused. As I am not a nutrition expert either, I can only point out that Rachael's `low carb' strategy is largely based on substituting cauliflower for root vegetables and squash for pasta in a lot of recipes. I am sure these are good moves for reducing carbs, but I am suspicious at the same time with the fact that virtually every savory recipe includes about a tablespoon (120 calories) of olive oil per serving plus lots of ingredients such as capers, anchovies, and olives which are high in both oil and salt. I am also suspicious of the nutritional wisdom of revising the classic Cobb salad by removing all the greens, since people commonly fish out all the good stuff anyway and leave the greens behind. This is just a little inconsistent with Rachael's love of green vegetables and the healthy eating theme of this book.<br /><br />The copy editors at Potter have not touched `Rayspeak' with such quirky terms such as `stoups', scrambles, sammies, and EVOO. With 9 best selling books as a track record, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. That doesn't mean I like it. It only means that the value of her recipes and presentation are strong enough for me to ignore them.<br /><br />The bottom line is that if you like Rachael, you will like this book, although if you like Rachael's show and don't have any of her other books, her earlier titles may be closer to what you like about Food Network Rachael. For low carb folks, this book has a very nice collection of recipes, especially burgers and soups, with strong Italian flavors with few Italian carbs.

299230:US	39134375	R2467JQEFQ2WRG	0060974648	183175053	Mediterranean Cooking	Books	5	41	42	N	N	A very good survey of Mediterranean cooking themes	`Mediterranean Cooking' by the eminent cookbook author, Ms. Paula Wolfert may not be the best book on Mediterranean recipes, it may not even be the second best book on Mediterranean recipes, especially since Ms. Wolfert is competing against her excellent `The Cooking of the Eastern Mediterranean' plus flagship volumes from her hero, Elizabeth David and books from good friend, Nancy Harmon Jenkins and scholarly works from Clifford A. Wright and home friendly books from Joyce Goldstein and others. The list goes on and on. Mediterranean cooking has been addressed from about every angle you can think of, but part of that interest is due to Ms. Wolfert's own works, starting with her landmark `Couscous and Other Good Food from Morocco'. But, if this volume were the only one you had on `Mediterranean Cuisine', you should count yourself fortunate that you found this book.<br /><br />While this is not a scholarly book by most standards, like all of Ms. Wolfert's works, it is much more than a list of recipes. One major premise of the book is that a native of a region on the Mediterranean coast could walk the perimeter of this Sea and find familiar food all along the shores of the old Roman Empire. This forms the basis of Ms. Wolfert's organization of chapters which is based on the leading foodstuffs of the Mediterranean from the Maghreb (Northern Africa from Morocco to Tunisia) to the Levant (Lebanon, Israel, Jordan, and Syria). In fact, I have to suspect than friend Nancy Harmon Jenkins borrowed Ms. Wolfert's concept of how to present Mediterranean cuisine in Jenkins' 2003 book, `The Essential Mediterranean'.<br /><br />Ms. Wolfert's basis for choosing recipes she states in for simple reasons. First there are `...great and famous dishes for which I can find superb recipes'. Second are `...regional and unusual dishes'. Third are `...dishes which illustrate contrasting or similar uses for the same materials'.  Fourth are `...delicious dishes that are not widely known'. All this means is that `This is a very personal book, a book of food that interests me'. And, almost all of the recipes come from home cooks acquired on Ms. Wolfert's many regular trips to the lands of the Mediterranean.<br /><br />One warning is necessary about the publisher's blurb that this second (1994) edition contains '75 new recipes'. In the introduction, Ms. Wolfert herself says that this has been more of a trade of 75 healthier, less fatty recipes for 60 older recipes. The book is not that much larger than the original edition, but I think all of this is of only minor concern, as the real value of the book lies in the insights Ms. Wolfert gives on the overall world of Mediterranean cookery.<br /><br />The flagship chapter tells the story of the combination of `Garlic and Oil' in Mediterranean cuisine. There are recipes combining these two items from one end of the Mediterranean to the other and Ms. Wolfert presents several samples from Spain, France, Italy, and Greece. The last of these recipes for `Sauce Rouille', a classic condiment for Bouillabaisse leads to Ms. Wolfert's riff on why bouillabaisse purists say that this dish cannot be made beyond 100 kilometers of Marseilles. All of this is done with a rather large sense of tongue in cheek. To make restitution, Ms. Wolfert offers us two recipes for the much less legendary `Soupe de Poisson', a simple Provencal fish soup with but one white fleshed saltwater fish.<br /><br />The olive oil and garlic chapter is followed by a chapter on olives themselves. Ms. Wolfert piques our intellect by observing that if you divide the Mediterranean with an imaginary line down the sole of the Italian boot, along the eastern shore of Sicily, and down the boundary between Tunisia and Libya, you will have divided the cuisines into those who eat olives marinated and cured (the east of this line) and those who eat olives cooked with their dishes (Spain, France, Italy, the Maghreb). Ms. Wolfert has no good idea why this should be andthe only thought I can offer is that this is roughly the boundary between the Eastern and Western Roman Empires when the split was made between Rome and Constantinople.<br /><br />The most famous of all cooked olive dishes is probably the Neapolitan `Spaghetti alla Puttanesca'. Ms. Wolfert gives us a new explanation for the origin of this easy dish and befitting its fame, offers three different recipes. The most traditional includes a tomato sauce. Ms. Wolfert's two alternatives include no tomatoes, but are heavy on basil or peppers and raisins. All three are as fast or faster than any other recipes I have seen.<br /><br />The remaining chapters are on:<br /><br />Eggplant, Tomatoes, Peppers, and Other Mediterranean Vegetables<br /><br />Chick-Peas, Lentils, and Beans<br /><br />Pasta, Couscous, and Other Mediterranean Farinaceous Foods<br /><br />Herbs, Spices, and Aromatics<br /><br />Yogurt<br /><br />Cheese<br /><br />Nuts<br /><br />Lemons, Oranges, Figs, Dates, and other Mediterranean Fruits<br /><br />As familiar as all of these subjects are, Ms. Wolfert has something new to say on most of them. On cheese, for example, while the most famous of Mediterranean young cheeses are mozzarella and feta, Ms. Wolfert gives equal time to Sardinian and Egyptian varieties. The highest praise is reserved, of course for Parmesano Reggiano.<br /><br />Since this edition was published in 1994, before the full flourishing of the Internet, all sources are mail order only, but most of these sources are familiar to all us foodies, so tracking down their Internet sites should be pretty easy. The Bibliography is modest with almost all entries being books available in English such as titles from Elizabeth David, Alan Davidson, Waverley Root, Claudia Roden, and other English and American writers.<br /><br />Just like her hero, Elizabeth David, Ms. Wolfert has written many excellent books, but if you could have but one from each author, I would take this volume and Ms. David's first `A Book of Mediterranean Food'.ld be and the only thought I can offer is that this is roughly the boundary between the Eastern and Western Roman Empires when the split was made between Rome and Constantinople. <br /> <br />The most famous of all cooked olive dishes is probably the Neapolitan `Spaghetti alla Puttanesca'.

Beginners Beware	`The Art of the Tart' and `Tarts With Tops On' by noted English culinary writer, Tamasin Day-Lewis both have the outward appearance of books on the express line to the discount table. And, while many good books have suffered that fate, that appearance should not be held against these two volumes. It is important to distinguish this book from the excellent volumes on general pastry making such as Rose Levy Beranbaum's `The Pie and Pastry Bible' or Nick Malgieri's `Perfect Pastry' or Flo Brakker's `The Simple Art of Perfect Baking, or Gayle Ortiz' `The Village Baker's Wife'. It is also playing in a different league than the excellent `Mes Tartes' by Christine Ferber. All of these spend many pages on the ins and outs of pastry technique. Ms. Ferber's volume is especially interesting if you are devoted to the French approach to pastry, which is just a bit different than what you will get from the American experts.<br /><br />When I first browsed through Ms. Day-Lewis' books, the absence of the heavy concentration on technique and the many familiar names of classic tart and pie recipes had me discounting the books as not worth my attention. The opening tart with a top on was nothing more than a classic chicken potpie that I have made following better instructions from James Beard.<br /><br />The first thing that began redeeming the books in my eyes was the quality of the writing. Ms. Day-Lewis has a way with phrases that seems to owe more than a little from the writing style of M.F.K. Fisher, although the writer to which she seems to pay the greatest homage is Jane Grigson. In spite of a few misstatements such as the notion that pastry making was a science, `but not an exact science', her general observations are quite a pleasure to read and make me want to read more of her books.<br /><br />Both books include chapters on `other people's recipes', and some of the most interesting material is in these chapters. Some of the borrowing is from Nigel Slater who is a writer like Day-Lewis and unlike Nigella Lawson and Jamie Oliver, whose works have not made a very big impression on this side of the pond. Others are attributed to Claudia Roden, who has made a big splash over here. Many others are attributed to friends and relatives. Regardless of the source, all these recipes are pretty far removed from your garden-variety tomato tart. Some recipes such as Michel Roux's Tourte au Jambon et Tomme de Pyrenees require ingredients such as black truffles and hard Pyrenees sheep's milk cheese which are just a bit to dear or too much trouble to acquire. Others in this chapter are both very simple and very fetching. Two that caught my eye were Nigel Slater's Stilton, Onion, and Potato \\"Frying Pan\\" pie and Deborah's Luxury Meat Loaf Pie. Both recipes are small variations on very common dishes, but the small improvements are worth a bundle of raves at the dinner table.<br /><br />The next chapter of recipes for pies covers eight variations on apple pie. Aside from the plain vanilla apple pie, all were pretty unusual, but certainly not difficult. I did miss a recipe for Tart Tatin, but I suspect I probably already have five or six recipes for this classic on my shelves already. Another reason the Tart Tatin does not appear with these apple pies is because the first book already includes nine recipes for lidless apple tarts, including the famous Tatin dessert. The first book also includes a perfect recipe for entertaining with an English theme, a treacle tart.<br /><br />The next recipe chapter of pie recipes covers classic American pies. Among these eleven recipes are peach pie, pecan pie, blueberry pie, pumpkin pie, and key lime pie, but no Pennsylvania Dutch molasses cake, which of course is much more of a pie than a cake.<br /><br />Among the recipes for sweet pies, there are a few with unusual ingredients such as gooseberries and a few which simply did not appeal to me such as the raspberry ice cream pie, which I considered a misnomer, as the filling was not a true churned ice cream but more like a simple frozen custard.<br /><br />If your cookbook collecting leans toward those that look good and read well, then these books are for you. They are also very interesting if you have a special attraction to baking tarts and pies, and already have the basic techniques securely under your belt. If you are a novice with pastry, then I suggest you take a by on these and check out the four titles I cited at the beginning of the review.<br /><br />I will note that for the very nice binding, photography, and the build-in page marking ribbon, these books are very reasonably priced, which make them even more attractive if you are fond of attractive culinary books.<br /><br />If you are always on the lookout for unusual pie and tart recipes, don't give it another thought and put in your order for these lovelies.r, as the filling was not a true churned ice cream but more like a simple frozen custard. <br /> <br />If your cookbook collecting leans toward those that look good and read well, then these books are for you.

302017:US	39134375	R2HZ65SMZ3ELP3	0060088834	573357635	Quick Loaves: 150 Breads and Cakes, Meat and Meatless Loaves	Books	5	15	16	N	Y	Great Shortcuts for Frequent Baker	`Quick Loaves' is by Jean Anderson, one of our foremost authors of cookbooks who has achieved a high distinction by high volume on better than average books, especially with `The Food of Portugal' and `The American Century Cookbook'. This book, like `Process This!' and `Micro Ways' addresses one aspect of fast and easy cooking by the amateur home cook who wants just a little more depth than what you can get from Rachael Ray's excellent collections of recipes.<br /><br />For starters, I think this book is superior to `Process This!' if only because I think that while the food processor is a major investment in a high maintenance appliance, this book requires investing in no special equipment. And, even if you do not yet have some basic baking pans, some inexpensive equipment can be had for less than twenty dollars ($20). And yet, Ms. Anderson may have painted herself into a corner with this book by limiting her audience to those who like to bake things often at home but who do not want to spend a lot of effort doing it.<br /><br />Ms. Anderson's primary theme in this book is in the preparation of home brewed mixes for making baking a wide range of both sweet and savory breads, cakes, meatloaves, and veggie loaves and puddings. In doing this, she has offered advice on good baking technique that agrees with simply everything I have ever read about baking. She has even offered the first advice I have read on the new lines of silicone plastic bakeware, with advice on how to work with them and on the most widely respected brands. I have not even seen any word about these things in `Cooks Illustrated' yet.<br /><br />I bake fairly often compared to most men, yet I do not bake more than once every two weeks, and, over half of what I bake involves yeast breads or pastry, but Ms. Anderson's book does not address yeast bread baking in detail (there are some quick yeast breads, but I subscribe to the well established doctrine popularized by Peter Reinhart that the best yeast risen breads are those which rise slowly) and she does not deal with classic French pastry crust doughs. One of the greatest ironies is that while Ms. Anderson's first mix is remarkably similar to the dough used to make buttermilk biscuits, she strongly recommends a standard all purpose flour such as Pillsbury or King Arthur rather than a soft southern flour such as White Lily. And yet, White Lily is my preferred flour for making buttermilk biscuits, which takes up about 20% of all my baking activity. So what is a fella to do with this book?<br /><br />This excellently priced trade paperback has five chapters beginning with a short chapter on `Basics' which agree in every way with everything I have ever read about good baking technique. This should be no surprise whatsoever from someone who has written over 20 cookbooks. This book presents the eight basic `make ahead' ingredients, two of which are the cornerstones of all baking in Chapters 2 and 3. One of the most important facts about the flour mixes is their shelf life. Both are good for about two months in the freezer. The big question for a reader of this book is `Will I make two or more recipes using these mixes before they expire. I know I cannot be sure of doing this, even when I bake about once every two weeks.  The four remaining chapters are all about the same size and deal with four different kinds of loaves.<br /><br />Chapter 2 is `Quickbreads and Coffeecakes plus a Few Fast Yeast Breads'. The poster child for this chapter is a spicy version of Irish Soda Bread with nutmeg, sugar, and currants. A close relative to this is a very attractive looking recipe for Welsh Speckled Bread' with some strong orange flavoring from rind and marmalade.<br /><br />Chapter 3 is `Cakes, Pudding Loaves and Other Desserts'. The flagship recipe in this chapter is a `simple yellow cake with a brown sugar and coconut topping. Shortbread cookies are in this chapter along with crumb cakes, and a flourless Bavarian Hazelnut torte.This last recipe is a great exemplar of a family of central European flourless recipes, my favorite of that is the Hungarian walnut cake that uses a meringue rather than whipped cream for its lift. One important aside here is that the author is simply gaga over hazelnut recipes, so if you are a big hazelnut fan, I suggest you ignore everything else I have said in this review and rush right out to buy a copy of this book.<br /><br />Chapter 4 deals with meatloaves. I know there are people who really like to try a lot of different meatloaf recipes. I am not one of these people, but my mother is. I am perfectly happy with my basic `Cooks Illustrated / The Best Recipe' version which comes out just right every time I make it. But, if you are like my mother, I really suggest you get this book, along with all the hazelnut addicts out there. The first recipe is for an `Easy Italian Meatloaf' which cuts time from the prep work by including a prepackaged pasta sauce. The second recipe includes the same prepared marinara sauce. The third recipe includes a prepared barbecue sauce. Since I prefer to not use such prepared sauces, and since I am quite happy with my old familiar recipe, this chapter holds no charm for me.<br /><br />Chapter 5 offers the comfort of a meatloaf to vegetarians who eschew beef, pork or anything else that travels on four hooves. The Mushroom and Pecan loaf opener is attractive even to me who is especially fond of anything with mushrooms.<br /><br />This is really a very good book and if any selling point appeals to you, then I recommend it with no reservations. I recommend it especially to anyone who likes to bake a wide variety of things but who welcomes shortcuts.elnut torte.

And, I was immediately impressed by some of the novel graphic culinary material. Closer reading showed me that the horticultural material was of an equally high quality.<br /><br />While I have read and reviewed hundreds of cookbooks and am much more familiar with the culinary content of this book, I have read a few gardening books in my time and turned a few clods of dirt in summers past, so I am not a complete newby with the gardening advice. I say this because it may have influenced my impression that the gardening advice is a lot stronger than the culinary advice. It may simply be that I am much more familiar with the culinary material, so it impresses me less. That being said, I will summarily say that I think one will have to look far and wide to find a book that does as good a job as combining these two closely related disciplines. I have reviewed only two, `The Arrows Cookbook' by culinary professionals who are horticultural amateurs with a good sized kitchen garden in Maine, and `Oriental Vegetables' by Joy Larkcom who seems to be an especially talented amateur at both cooking and gardening. Both are good books in their own little worlds, but neither can hold a candle to the wide world opened by this excellent volume.<br /><br />The book is organized with alternating horticultural and culinary chapters where each author discusses his specialities at a pretty high level of expertise. There is no dumbing up of the material here. There are a few weak attempts to show similarities between culinary and horticultural techniques as in the analogous methods for producing a stock and a compost tea. These are cute, but the real common platform for the two disciplines is nutrition. How do you get the greatest yield of nutrients out of either a patch of ground or a batch of cooked veggies?<br /><br />There are four major chapters, each beginning with a horticultural exposition followed by a culinary exposition. The first chapter may have the most important horticultural section, as it deals with climate and microclimates, choosing the best plants, planning your plantings, starting seedlings, planting in season, and rotating crops around your garden. One of the symptoms that this is not rote gardening advice is the agonizing over interpreting all the various planting zones. There are three with very different criteria and the most common, the USDA scheme based on the number of warm days can be very misleading. The culinary section to the first chapter is a bit weak and until I got to the second chapter, I thought maybe gardener Merrill was doing all the heavy lifting in this book.<br /><br />The second chapter begins with a horticultural section devoted exclusively to getting to know your soil and improving it. In this chapter, the culinary section really picks up and offers us something really new. The section is primarily about pantry preparations such as gremolata, bouquet garni, harissa, fines herbes, and lots and lots of vinaigrettes. The high point of the culinary section in this chapter is what is called `The Mesclun Wheel' that places greens on a circular scale of most tart to sweetest with dandelion being at the sharpest and butterhead lettuce being the mildest. This would be interesting in itself, but the author doubles the interest by plotting vinaigrette ingredients against types of greens to show how to match up dressings with greens. This is the kind of wisdom that is rarely so effectively summarized and which is commonly acquired only after years of reading and experimenting with salads. This is the kind of schema a cook probably pulls forward in his mind when they plan a salad based on available ingredients.<br /><br />The third chapter opens with every organic gardener's favorite topic, composting, and its related topics, humus and mulching. Having taken a few turns with a compost pile and having read a few Rodale Press items on the subject, I was still surprised to find something new to me, which was vermicomposting, or creating an environment which encourages worms to actively work on composting your biological waste. The culinary section deals with stocks and soups. The things which distinguish this section from your average introduction to soups are the discussions of combining vegetables to get the healthiest result and tips on preparing to cook in bulk. I find the emphasis on steaming as a method to preserve nutrients in vegetables to be pretty depressing, but the author redeems himself a bit by pointing out that cooking by several different methods is superior to eating raw vegetables, as cooking releases the nutrients in most veggies and makes them more easily available to our digestion.<br /><br />The opening to the fourth chapter deals with garden pests, both animal and vegetable, and plants and animals that can assist in the battle with pests. For a book that is sharing its 470 pages between horticultural and culinary material, this discussion is remarkably detailed, including sidebars on equipment and techniques for examining garden fauna and a display of the life cycles of some of the most common pesky insects. This book would be superior on its own, but it enhances its value immeasurably by offering a detailed chapter by chapter bibliography which has more details on the many different topics touched upon in this book.<br /><br />The second half of the book is something of an encyclopedia of the growing and eating attributes of the plants most commonly grown in the United States. Even this section has its pleasures to the casual reader, as it is very nicely organized by type of plant rather than by the alphabet.<br /><br />To an old `Whole Earth Catalog' hippie like me, this book is pure gold.

304109:US	39134375	R1754UOWJCPOOT	0696222132	23405707	Get Grilling	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Excellent Grilling Recipes for a Reasonable Price	`get grilling' by the `food network kitchens' is the third written by the staff of the Food Network and while the first two were sound, this volume, with recipes which are just as good, succeeds where the others may tend to get lost.<br /><br />This book succeeds because it provides lots of very good staple recipes for grilling, just in time for the 2005 living outdoors season. Basically, this book is not a winner because it apes Bobby Flay in trying to come up with a lot of innovative grilling recipes. It wins because it covers all the familiar recipes that are somewhere between easy and moderately challenging for the weekend griller who doesn't even bother to crack a cookbook or turn on Emeril over the long winter months. Like the earlier books, this volume has a very nice mix of recipes from a lot of different cuisines, but all of them are more variations on familiar dishes rather than outlandish dishes with rare ingredients such as galangal and Kaffir Lime leaves. I will not do a compete count and just indicate to you that the Mediterranean, including Europe, Africa, and the Levant; China; Japan; Southeast Asia; and Neuvo Latino cuisines are all represented, along with middle America and its heavy German influence on things such as brats, wieners, sauerkraut, and cole slaw.<br /><br />As a non-griller, the thing I liked about this book is that it struck a very nice balance between giving the rudiments without taking up a third of the book with things some people already know and some people don't need to know. My only argument with this presentation is that they picture the `TOOLS OF THE TRADE' in four group photos and don't indicate in their discussion whether the items are cited from top to bottom, from left to right or from clockwise to counterclockwise. Tsk, Tsk.<br /><br />On the much more positive side of things, the authors succeed in describe grilling as a distinctively different type of cooking, similar to, but not the same as baking, broiling, or sauteeing. They also stay on a finely impartial line between the religious factions in favor of charcoal and gas grilling. In fact, they make a very useful contribution to the charcoal camp by recommending a mix of briquettes and natural hardwood charcoal. The authors also score big with their recommendation of grilling cages. I have no idea why these have not been more broadly recommended, as they seem like naturals for doing fish and vegetables. The only Food Network show on which I have ever seen them appear was on a Martha Stewart episode hosting the owner chef of a leading New York fish restaurant. I just wish the authors had included a source for ordering these little darlings.<br /><br />The authors cover the outdoor grilling / picnic scene with ten different types of dishes. These are:<br /><br />Nibbles & noshes with some traditional dishes, grilled appetizers, and veggie oddities such as jicama sticks.<br /><br />Little Dishes from the Grill with wings, crostini, pizzas, potato salad, kebabs, and veggie Napoleons. Note that the veggie Napoleons are done much more easily with the grilling baskets than without.<br /><br />Burgers, Dogs, & Sandwiches is the chapter which clinched my strong recommendation for this book. Everyone can grill burgers and dogs, but isn't it nice to have all in one place some recipes for four different burger recipes, toppings for those doggies, and some righteous North Carolina pulled pork barbecue. This chapter alone makes me want to buy my first grill.<br /><br />Chicken & other BBQ'd birds or more staples of the well-flavored grilling repertoire.<br /><br />Meat of the Matter, or steaks, chops, ribs, medallions, and brochettes on the outdoor grill.<br /><br />Fish and Shellfish, including smoking and planking recipes for days which are not Labor Day, 4th of July, or Memorial Day.<br /><br />Salads and sides with two for potato, two for macaroni, two cole slaws, lots of tomatoes, and lots of grilled veggies. Again, this is all about basics with good variety to keep you interested.<br /><br />Sauces and Rubs with a very well informed selection of regional specialities from North Carolina, Kansas City, New Orleans, Texas, and Memphis. Bobby Flay was here!<br /><br />Sweets with some grilled fruit, s'mores, easy pies, and easy cakes<br /><br />Drinks, including all the iced tea recipes you scramble for in you misplaced Martha Stewart books, plus some coolers, sangria, margaritas, and a warning to have enough ice on hand.<br /><br />The cooking tips in the first Food Network book were, I thought, a waste of space. In this book, since the focus is very narrowly on grilling skills, the tips are just right, focusing on just enough to keep the average summer outdoor chef from cutting off your thumb or infecting his guests with ptomaine.<br /><br />Like the previous two books, there is no mention of the Food Network's culinary stars. The most we get is a sly reference to the fact that these backstage cooks have rubbed elbows with the likes of show host Bobby Flay and guests such as Chris Schlesinger and Steve Raichlen, both minor gods in the world of modern grilling. The book also does less than it could to distinguish grilling from barbecuing. Yet, while the writers and editors are not in line with my linguistic prejudices, they succeed in generally limiting the word `barbecue' to long, low heat cooking involving smoke. So all is forgiven and this book heartily gets its full five stars!<br /><br />As long as I am applauding this book, I can off the suggestion to all those cookbook publisher out there that they garnish no interest from me by imitating e. e. cummings by lower casing all their titles.

Good Read too	`Once Upon a Tart' by owner / bakers of the New York City / Greenwich Village restaurant of the same name, Frank Mentesana and Jerome Audureau is a fine little book of good sense / no nonsense recipes and instructions about how to make many of the restaurant's specialities.<br /><br />The `no nonsense' part of this accolade begins with the fact that there are none of the usual paean's to using fresh, natural ingredients all the time and stalking the Union Square market to see what is in season that day. `No nonsense' extends to their excellent list of preferred kitchen equipment. I almost invariably find relatively useless things in such lists, but this one was totally free of fluff. I have everything they mention, and I use each and every item on the list, albeit some a lot more than others, but then I don't bake every day. The commentary on the equipment is also very workmanlike. Some baking experts such as Rose Levy Beranbaum have warned against using lipped sheet pans for baking cookies and have recommended perfectly flat baking sheets. The authors simply say that this difference doesn't seem to affect the things they bake so just use what you have. I did notice some influence of their restaurant's limited cooking space on their selection of equipment. Like the Seattle soup kitchen whose book I reviewed a few months ago, these authors use the food processor for many tasks which others may opt for either the Waring blender or an immersion blender. It turned out that the Seattle kitchen was very cramped and had but one or two electrical outlets in the kitchen. So, I would suggest you splurge and get at least the immersion blender if you plan to make pureed soups.<br /><br />I tend to be a sucker for an honest and earnest story of how people got into a food business and succeeded with a reasonable about of hard work and a superior product. The authors fit the picture of a lot of others who simply wanted to work for themselves, although both started out in the food business, so there were no big career shifts going on here. It is apparent that the authors also had a fair amount of luck in picking a location in Soho that was just starting its transformation from slum to artist colony to trendy neighborhood. They literally `got in on the ground floor' as there were simply no good breakfast / lunch restaurants in the neighborhood just as the affluent crowd moved in to either live or work in the neighborhood. This does not diminish the fact that their products and the book of recipes for their products are first rate.<br /><br />As the subtitle on the very cleverly brown papered cover indicates the restaurant and the book covers a lot more than tarts, although the tart chapters are by far worth the price of the book. The chapters cover:<br /><br />Savory Tarts, 44 pages on tart dough making and tomato, leek, ham and custard goodies.<br /><br />Soups, 34 pages<br /><br />Sandwiches, 34 pages<br /><br />Salads, 42 pages<br /><br />Condiments, 32 pages<br /><br />Sweet Tarts, 46 pages<br /><br />Scones, 30 pages<br /><br />Quick Breads, 36 pages<br /><br />Cookies, 50 pages<br /><br />While the sweet and savory tart chapters may not be quite as Epicurean as the excellent English translation of `Mes Tartes' by Christine Ferber, these recipes have a rough and ready air about them which, once you have mastered crust making, you will find making these French answers to the pizza about as easy as your garden variety apple pie. Regarding crust pastry, I find that the authors' instructions are just detailed enough to tell you how to achieve a righteous tart crust. I strongly recommend you follow all their advice, even if they do not explain all the reasons for every step, although I found their explanations short, but filling.<br /><br />I don't thing I was daydreaming when I read one of the authors claim to be presenting a vegetarian menu, yet there are a few well chosen dishes which include chicken, tuna, pork loin and oceans of eggs to make the custards. Still, a vegetarian cook will find lots and lots of recipes herein to fit the ovo-lacto-vegetarian lifestyle.<br /><br />I will say that if soups are your main interest, this may not be the very best book for you. The soups are very good, but I feel they cook their stock vegetables just a bit too long for my taste. The sandwich recipes are a different story, because there are much fewer books dedicated to superior sandwich making than to superior soup making. And, the authors found their shop surrounded by deli's with great classic sandwiches, so the `Once Upon a Tart' gang had to branch out, away from the German / Jewish New York deli fare and into the world of Italian Paninis.<br /><br />I am not quite sure why scones should be in a chapter separate from quickbreads, as scones, leavened by baking powder, baking soda, and buttermilk are simply a special kind of quickbread. The only reason I can see is that the bakery makes lots of types of scones and lots of types of biscuits, so it was neater to make two smaller chapters than one great chapter. One reason may be that these scones are made with a scoop and drop method similar to the laying out of pancake batter than by rolling and cutting into triangles.<br /><br />While I would not recommend this book as a baking primer, it is loaded with pretty basic advice such as the warning against replacing buttermilk with plain milk in recipes and the suggestion to test a batch of scones by breaking open one to check for doneness.<br /><br />As with the heavy use of the food processor, I found some other aspects of these recipes affected by their origin in a restaurant kitchen, such as the sheet pan baking prep of vegetables for the ratatouille tart and the Spanish omelette, but I suggest you try it anyway.egetarian cook will find lots and lots of recipes herein to fit the ovo-lacto-vegetarian lifestyle. <br /> <br />I will say that if soups are your main interest, this may not be the very best book for you.

Good buy if you like the show.	`everyday italian' is Giada De Laurentiis' first book, based on her Food Network show which is one of my favorites, just after Alton Brown's `Good Eats' and Mr. Food Network Italian, Mario Batali's aging `Molto Mario' which looks better after five reruns than any of the latest offerings from Emeril or Bobby.<br /><br />Like Rachael Ray, Giada has proven that she is not just another pretty face. She really knows her way around the kitchen and while I have immense respect for Rachael's theme of quick cooking by busy people, I really prefer the more ethnically themed shows like those from Giada and even Paula Deen than the generic coverage from Rachael.<br /><br />Like Paula's show and later books, Giada's books also have a `joie de vivre' appeal. She places her cooking in the context of people who enjoy life, and shows how food contributes to that enjoyment. This is also one of the strongest aspects of her TV show.<br /><br />While this is a pleasing book with an accurate subtitle, `125 Simple and Delicious Recipes', the problem for cookbook purchasers is that the bar of quality for cookbooks on Italian cuisine is very, very high. Food Network colleague Mario has helped raise that bar with his own `Simple Italian Food, Recipes from My Two Villages' which is a scant $2.50 more at list price and which contains more recipes which are, on average, about as easy as Giada's and, to my mind, more interesting to cook.<br /><br />The very simplest example of this fact is in the recipes for the simple marinara sauces (Giada's recipe is from page 59) from the two books. On the face of it, they are very similar in that both use carrots instead of sugar to sweeten the sauce and Giada adds celery, which Mario leaves out. Mario also uses thyme while Giada uses bay. Mario adds garlic and Giada does not. One of the most important differences is that Mario, in almost all his recipes, uses whole, peeled San Marzano tomatoes while Giada uses crushed tomatoes. I agree that Giada's technique is a bit easier; however, following Mario's doctrine means you need to have fewer different varieties of canned tomato in your pantry.<br /><br />Giada's `cooking from her family experience' contributes much to the appeal of her books, as do the many pictures of the very attractive Ms. De Laurentiis. I would say the recipes in her books overall are two parts Italian, two parts `Italian-American', and one part French cooking school; however, this book has more truly Italian recipes than her next two books.<br /><br />As an `Italian-American' cookbook, its true competition is recent books such as Rocco DiSpirito's `Rocco's Italian American', Frank Pellegrino's `Rao's Recipes from the Neighborhood', and Eleanora Scarpetta's `Eleanora's Kitchen'. All three are `Italian-American' recipes from professionals (Ms. Scarpetta had assistance from a professional cookbook writer). I think Ms. De Laurentiis' book is comparable to the volume from chef DiSpirito and it is weaker than the volume from amateur Scarpetta. This last observation is based on the fact that Ms. Scarpetta gives more details about her technique in the same number of recipes in a less expensive book. Scarpetta's book is also printed in easy to read black and white!<br /><br />One case which demonstrates the Italian-American flavor of her dishes is her chicken saltimbocca recipe, based on a classic Roman veal dish, which adds spinach and chicken stock and leaves out the sage. David Downie's recipe in `Cooking the Roman Way' has no spinach or stock. But, Lydia Bastianich in her presentation of Italian-American recipes includes the spinach.<br /><br />None of these observations are very important if you own few cookbooks and like Giada's show. They are important if your primary interest is in learning about Italian cooking. In the end, it is a pleasing book, but it's recipes are fewer and no better than than other good but less expensive `Italian-American' cookbooks.lowing Mario's doctrine means you need to have fewer different varieties of canned tomato in your pantry.

311546:US	39134375	R2UB0RFDPOXDTB	0525245642	791122709	Lord Krishna's Cuisine: The Art of Indian Vegetarian Cooking	Books	5	104	109	N	N	Essential Reference For Indian Vegetarian Cuisine	`The Art of Indian Vegetarian Cooking' by Yamuna Devi can be placed among those great expositions in English of national cuisines such as Julia Child's `Mastering the Art of French Cooking', Marcella Hazan's `Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking', Diane Kochilas' `The Glorious Food of Greece' or Mimi Sheraton's `The German Cookbook'. And, this book has an IACP Cookbook of the Year award to prove this fact. This book even exceeds the ambitions of the books by Kochilas and Sheraton in that while these authors do an excellent job of surveying the entire national cuisine from either a serving or geographical point of view, they do little to analyze their cuisines in the way Nancy Harmon Jenkins dissects and builds a picture of the Mediterranean cuisines in `The Essential Mediterranean'. Ms. Devi does this and more.<br /><br />In fact, as big as this book is, it does itself and its readers a service by covering only the Hindu vegetarian cuisines, without touching on the cuisines of India which allow eating meat, primarily lamb and goat. Even more specifically, the author is specifically dedicated to that part of the Hindu religion that embraces Krishna. I will not touch on that aspect of the book except to point out that this means there are areas of Indian and Pakistani cuisines that this book does not cover. For those, the first stop is obviously the books of Madhur Jaffrey who, in her `Indian Cooking' does cover many meat dishes with lamb and goat.<br /><br />Indian vegetarianism as presented by Ms. Devi in this book is relative broad in that it allows a broad range of milk products. So, while `vegetarianism' allows much more than a diet of vegetables, grains, and beans, Ms. Devi treats vegetable cookery with a depth I have not seen in any book except James Peterson's book, `Vegetables'. Ms. Devi presents three basically different ways of cooking the same vegetable and suggests that these three methods may be applied to every different type of vegetable. The first method is Sauteeing and Braising Dry Vegetables (cooked entirely in oil. No water.) I believe this is what the French would call a vegetable comfit. The second method is to saute in oil followed by a braise in water based broth. This is closer to what a western cook would call a braise. The third method precooks the vegetable in water and finishes it with high heat in oil (ghee) or highly flavored sauce or broth. Pairing them up with a choice of several different seasoning mixes permutes these three methods. The author sets off with this introduction to discuss the various different types of vegetables and how the various methods can be applied to each vegetable.<br /><br />Most of this is not too different from what you can get from a close reading of Marcella Hazan's books. The Indian way with milk and yogurt is an entirely different matter. The Indian traditions with milk products seem to be about 180 degrees away from the European traditions involving aged cheeses. The only point of similarity between Indian yogurt and Western European traditions are with the Italian ricotta and the Spanish queso fresca. Even contemporary American yogurt is not the same material as traditional Indian yogurt. While much western yogurt is made with skim or reconstituted dry milk, Indian yogurt is made from fresh whole milk. From yogurt, the Indians derive a fresh cheese and a curd that serves the same purpose as the Far Eastern tofu.<br /><br />As with milk, the Indian approach to bread is just about as different from the western European tradition as you can imagine. It would be fascinating to read an analysis of the differences between, say Italian and Indian bread making traditions. The two biggest differences is that while the Italian tradition requires yeast and a hearth, the Indian tradition uses no yeast and does almost all baking on a griddle to produce a wide variety of flatbreads. Thus it is quite odd to find that while the Italian tradition does include a version of the French crepe, there is not a very big niche for pancakes, but the Indian cuisine seems to outdo even the wide range of American variations on the pancake / flapjack / hoecake / Johnny cake genre.<br /><br />While the French may have exhausted most of what can be done with their superb, high fat Normandy butter in their rich cuisine, the Indians may just have outdone them by a bit when it comes to using butter, in the form of ghee as a cooking medium. While the French are satisfied with simply clarifying butter, the Indians take this process one step further and cook the clarified butter to a nut brown color which can be stored at room temperature. One implication of the central role of ghee in Indian cooking is that if one wishes to embrace Indian cooking fully, one needs to be prepared to embrace the use of saturated butter fats, which from a purely nutritional point of view may bring back to your diet the saturated animal fats you are avoiding by not eating meat.<br /><br />The two greatest contributions to British cuisine from the Indian subcontinent are curries and chutneys. This, this book includes an entire chapter to chutneys, which may be made from either fresh or cooked ingredients. My biggest surprises were to find peanuts and cashews in chutney recipes in addition to the expected fruits and spices. In addition to chutneys, there is also a sizable chapter on related pickles, jams, sauces, and gravies. Oddly, there is no chapter on curries or even on the subject of garum masala. There is a brief article on garum masala in the superb appendix, `A-Z General Information', but no in depth discussion of Indian spice culture.<br /><br />If you take on this book, it will probably be wise to find a good Indian or Pakistani grocery for some of the less common ingredients and to have someone with whom to ask advice on techniques and equipment.big niche for pancakes, but the Indian cuisine seems to outdo even the wide range of American variations on the pancake / flapjack / hoecake / Johnny cake genre.

312562:US	39134375	R1L7XO19DHWTB8	0517596326	969191133	Madhur Jaffrey's World Vegetarian: More Than 650 Meatless Recipes from Around the Globe	Books	5	159	165	N	Y	A Very Important Book for Learning about Food. Buy It!	`World Vegetarian' by leading authority on Indian cooking, Madhur Jaffrey is one of those books you can tell after reading a page or two that it is worth your time and money if you are interested in learning new things about food.<br /><br />It is important to note that the notion of `vegetarian' in the title does not mean that the book is all about vegetables, just as a vegetarian is not a person who eats only vegetables. A vegan or vegetarian is someone who avoids meat and, to some extent, products derived from animals. Some people whose vegetarianism is based on respect for animal life go so far as to avoid vegetables like root vegetables whose harvest may entail the death of insects or worms or other subterranean living animals. Ms. Jaffrey is a partial vegetarian, based more on Indian culture and tradition than anything else. And, her book includes major chapters on dairy products derived from milk and eggs.<br /><br />This is a very big book, with very long chapters on all the big vegetarian topics. These are:<br /><br />Dried Beans, Dried Peas, Lentils, and Nuts -122 pages<br /><br />Vegetables - 200 pages<br /><br />Grains - 186 pages<br /><br />Dairy - 64 pages<br /><br />Soups, Salads, and Drinks - 82 pages<br /><br />Sauces and Added Flavorings - 54 pages<br /><br />plus<br /><br />Equipment, Glossary, and Resources - 32 pages<br /><br />Even with 200 pages and 200 recipes, this very large section does not match the depth of books dedicated entirely to vegetables such as Jack Bishop's `Vegetables Every Day' or Elizabeth Schneider's encyclopedic `Vegetables from Amaranth to Zucchini'. In fact, Ms. Jaffrey has just 31 sections dedicated to different vegetables, while Ms. Schneider covers over 130 different named vegetables, but Ms. Jaffrey gives us some insights on vegetable cookery which I believe cannot be found elsewhere. It may not be that other books don't cover the same thing, but Ms. Jaffrey seems to have a way of putting things which makes them stick in your memory a lot more firmly than other writers' coverage does. For example, in dealing with the baking of red beet roots, Ms. Jaffrey says that baking white potatoes in tin foil leads to thoroughly unpleasant soggy skins and dry flesh, but the same technique is exactly what you want to do with beets, as the skin of beets in inedible.<br /><br />Another way in which her facts are presented in an effective manner is when the section on greens discusses fourteen (14) different varieties of greens together so that similarities and differences between methods appropriate to each variety can be discussed.<br /><br />Ms. Jaffrey is certainly true to her book title in that her recipes come from all over the world. She gives us the service of stating beside each recipe name the country or cuisine from which the recipe grew. While this may only be important to nitpickers like myself, she is careful to point out when recipes are from a purely Italian or Chinese source or from a hybrid recipe developed by Italians or Chinese who are transplanted to the United States.<br /><br />The chapter on `Grains' is dedicated as much or more to dishes made with flour grains and meals, as in noodles and porridges as to the grains themselves, as in rice dishes. One of the clearest signs of Ms. Jaffrey's background is the fact that very little space is dedicated to yeast breads. Only five (5) recipes contain yeast and two of those are for pancakes. All other bread recipes are for flatbreads or breads with a chemical leavener. These recipes are welcome, as few appear in conventional books on bread, and I do not miss a fuller discussion of breads, as there are easily a dozen excellent books on bread which come to mind.<br /><br />The other side of the coin is in the dairy chapter that includes recipes for homemade cheeses which I simply have not seen anywhere outside of Diane Kennedy's most recent book on the Mexican pantry. Among these recipes are homemade Indian cheese, unflavored andflavored with pepper or herbs; Latin American cheese (`Queso Blanco'), Italian mascarpone cheese and Syrian Cheese. And, just to be sure none of this effort is wasted, there are several recipes giving us things to do with our homemade Indian cheese.  This chapter also contains a wealth of egg recipes that you will simply not see anywhere outside of a book dedicated to egg recipes or a large book on Indian cuisine. With a rather long headnoted homage to Julia Child, Ms. Jaffrey gives us an excellent recipe for the classic French omelet. You will succeed with this recipe, but mastering the technique may require a consult with Ms. Child's book or Jacques Pepin's book on technique.<br /><br />All this means is that Ms. Jaffrey's decisions on what to include in this book and what to leave out is impeccable.<br /><br />It may seem presumptions on my part to evaluate Ms. Jaffrey's recipes, but I did check out her vegetable stock recipe and found it agreed with all my experts' opinions on how and for how long to cook a vegetable stock. The only deviation from classic doctrine is that she includes a diced potato, but not until the broth has been brought to a boil and reduced to a simmer, so, I suspect the spud has no chance to make the stock cloudy.<br /><br />In a sense, this book fulfills the promise of Jeanne Lemlin's `Vegetarian Classics' without padding it with cliched recipes for macaroni and cheese and pasta Puttanesca. Very, very few recipes in this book are familiar to me, in spite of the fact that I have walked my way through close to 400 cookbooks in the last 18 months.<br /><br />This book is highly recommended for your armchair library when you are out of the kitchen, searching for new ideas and dishes.er or herbs; Latin American cheese (`Queso Blanco'), Italian mascarpone cheese and Syrian Cheese.

Not Comprehensive	`Madhur Jaffrey's Indian Cooking' by the distinguished author of Indian and South Asian cookbooks, Madhur Jaffrey, is an excellent collection of Indian recipes, but it is not quite comparable to the great expositions of national cuisines as we have seen in Julia Child's `Mastering the Art of French Cooking', Marcella Hazan's `Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking', Diane Kochilas' `The Glorious Food of Greece' or Mimi Sheraton's `The German Cookbook'. These titles are all successful surveys of an entire national cuisine, with in depth treatments of equipment, techniques, pastry, and breads. This volume from the famous Ms. Jaffrey is less than half the length of most of these other volumes. This is not to say that this is an unworthy book, but I believe there are other titles by Ms. Jaffrey which cover major aspects of Indian cooking in much greater depth than does this volume.<br /><br />I have been aware of Ms. Jaffrey's reputation as a writer and teacher on Indian cooking for many years. Her reputation in her own field is as great or greater than Diana Kennedy's reputation as an apostle of Mexican cooking or Marcella Hazan's reputation among writers on Italian cuisine. Like Ms. Kennedy, she stands out largely because, in English, she has the field pretty much to herself, unlike the very crowded field of writing on Italian and French cooking.<br /><br />I immediately developed a respect for Ms. Jaffrey before I even read any of her works when I saw her appear on a Food Network episode of the Martha Stewart show, `From Martha's Kitchen' where she pointedly replied to Martha that stockpiling a pantry of staples is simply not a good idea. The proper strategy for filling our pantries is to get only what is called for in recipes we are doing today or this week, and only as much as we need for those recipes. One can begin stocking up on a staple when we are sure that we will make use of the item within the expected shelf life of the staple. I was really pleased to see her repeat that comment in this book, as I have used this observation as a criticism of many books that pad their pages with long lists of pantry items.<br /><br />As this is only the second book I am reviewing on Indian cuisine, I am especially pleased to see that both books agree on what is probably the keystone of all Indian cooking. It is well known that Indian cuisine has a really unique way with spices with their many different spice mixes, generally addressed by the great unwashed as `curry powders'. What is much less well known is the fact that the great genius of Indian cuisine is to treat their spice ingredients in many different ways, in order to bring out subtle differences in flavor from the same ingredients. Thus, crushing together raw spices will give a different flavor than crushing together roasted spices, which will give a different flavor than cooking whole spices in oil with fried foods. Another subtlety of Indian spice mixes is that while it is well known that chili based spice mixes can help cool the body by the capsicum induced perspiration, the spice mixes from northern India are formulated to have the opposite effect of giving a warming sensation to the body.<br /><br />An important aspect of this book is that it is inexpensive, meaning that it is a relatively cheap way to get exposure to Indian recipes to see if they are something you wish to explore in greater depth. Even at this bargain price, you have the assurance that you are getting recipes from a recognized expert in Indian cooking.<br /><br />While the appendix on cooking techniques is much smaller than you may find in one of the major tomes cited above, it is still important to read this before starting the recipes. It is important enough that I would wish the author had placed the section at the beginning of the book. The paragraph on the technique of adding yoghurt (sic) to a braising stew is pretty important, as if you do not follow this technique; there is a high risk that the yoghurt will curdle, spoiling the consistency of the stew.<br /><br />While Ms. Jaffrey has written big, authoritative books on vegetarian cuisines, this is not one of those books. While very little beef or pork is eaten on the Indian subcontinent due to Hindu and Muslim beliefs, lots of lamb and goat is eaten, and Ms. Jaffrey supplies us with many excellent recipes for both, substituting lamb in recipes where Indians would typically use goat meat.<br /><br />For those of you who share my interest in bread, I will say that almost all Indian breads are flatbreads, although there is one recipe for yeast leavened bread, `Naan'. Bread and rice are the two major starches in Indian cuisine. Legumes are represented primarily by lentils and peas, both of which have the great virtue of cooking much more quickly than the beans so popular in the Mediterranean.<br /><br />This book does not deal with spice mixes in depth. For that, you can go to `The Indian Spice Kitchen' by Monisha Bharadwaj which has sections on a half dozen different spice combinations from all over India. This book does have a special chapter on chutneys, which should appeal to anyone who likes the tang of pickles in all its glorious variety.<br /><br />While there are several very unusual ingredients required by some recipes in this book, the author does an excellent job of limiting these ingredients to just a few dishes. The average American megamart will have almost all the semi-unusual ingredients, but they may be short on things such as edible silver leaf, Kalonji (onion seed), and Kewda essence (from the screwpine plant).<br /><br />If you are interested in doing serious South Asian cooking, hook up with a good Indian, Pakistani, or Thai grocery or a good Internet supplier.<br /><br />An excellent `get your feet wet' introduction to Indian cooking.hat the yoghurt will curdle, spoiling the consistency of the stew. <br /> <br />While Ms. Jaffrey has written big, authoritative books on vegetarian cuisines, this is not one of those books.

315630:US	39134375	R30AU3BB97ED8D	0781808014	722798530	The Indian Spice Kitchen	Books	5	8	9	N	Y	Excellent Survey of Indian Ingredients not covered elsewhere	`The Indian Spice Kitchen' by Monisha Bharadwaj is an earnest, ethnic, informative coverage of Indian spice ingredients, mixes, herbs, fruits and vegetables, nuts, dals and pulses, cereals and flours, and miscellaneous ingredients. While the advocates of most cuisines, especially the Italian, French, Chinese, and Japanese rhapsodize about how important food is to their respective cultures, the Indian culture outdoes all of the others with the depth to which religion and culture affects the food mores of the Indian subcontinent. In fact, if I am to believe this author, food choices are even more important to the Hindu than it is to followers of Jewish holiday and kosher traditions. The best known and deepest strictures are those which encourage vegetarianism, based on the Hindu doctrine of reincarnation, where it is believed that animals contain souls of past or future humans. In addition to this doctrine, there are associations of particular foods with various Hindu deities, such as the devotion of Lord Krishna with milk, butter, and yogurt. These traditions are not unlike the associations of the ancient Greeks who, for example, linked Athena with olives. On top of the religious connections, there is the Ayurvedic system of nutrition that has the weight of both religion and `science'.<br /><br />I have reviewed many books on Asian ingredients covering Japan, China, and Southeast Asia, including the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Burma, but virtually none of them include specifically India. Even Bruce Cost's classic `Asian Ingredients' stops at the border between Thailand and Bangla Desh. Therefore, this book is a great addition to a culinary library that aims to cover the world.<br /><br />While the book is not quite as detailed as Cost's book on linguistic and scientific matters, this volume does include the very important scientific names of plants which yield the herbs, spices, vegetables, fruits, grains, legumes, and other products featured in the book. This may not seem like much to the casual reader until they try to match up European and Indian ingredients. The very first item, dill, it turns out, has both a European and an Asian species. Fortunately, unlike basil, the differences between European and Indian dill are small, so one can easily be substituted for the other. The scientific name is essential when comparing items in this book to similar books on Western produce.<br /><br />Each section devoted to a particular plant has the following items:<br /><br />How it Grows: geographical distribution, size, harvesting, and whether it is an annual, biennial or perennial<br /><br />Appearance and Taste: Weight, aroma, and important components<br /><br />Buying and Storing: How and what to select and how to store in the pantry.<br /><br />Medicinal and Other Uses: Folk remedies and non-culinary uses. It is probably worth warning the reader at this point that the virtues attributed to many of these herbs are probably as much due to a placebo effect as to any genuine pharmacological efficacy. I suggest you do not take these suggestions at face value and only rely on suggestions that are corroborated from a more scientifically oriented source.<br /><br />Culinary Uses: What kinds of recipes use these ingredients.<br /><br />Each section also offers one or more recipes in which the highlighted ingredient is used. Each recipe is introduced with a brief headnote on the recipe's source region. Each section also has at least one or more good photographs of the product.<br /><br />By far the most useful chapter of this book is the second that deals with the famous Indian spice mixes. There are many more named combinations than the simple `curry powder' rubric. There is garam masala from Northern India, Sambhar powder from Tamil Nadu, Goda Masala from Bombay, tandoori masala from the Punjab, panch phoron from Bengal and Kholombo powder from the southwestern coast. Aside from its regional specialities, each mixture has a speciality. Few of these mixtures are `hot' in the way chili powder is hot from dried capsicum.<br /><br />The first item which gave me the sense that this was a useful and accurate source of information was when I saw the treatment of cinnamon and cassia as two different spices, in spite of the fact that practically everything labeled cinnamon in the United States is actually ground cassia.<br /><br />Next to the spice mixes, the most interesting chapter is the last, dealing with miscellaneous products. While I know little in detail about Indian cuisine, I was surprised at the number of items I found where of which I had never heard. Among these are the little crackers named appadams, sago, a starch similar to tapioca made from tree sap and subja seeds from a plant in the basil family. I was also surprised to find edible silver foil. This was a surprise not because I had not heard of it before, but because there was no section on edible gold foil, as gold has an enormous role in Indian culture.<br /><br />Possibly my only disappointment from this book is that unlike the spice mixes, there was no chapter dedicated to chutney recipes. There are several in the book, but they are distributed across sections for various different ingredients.<br /><br />As this is the very first book on Indian cuisine I have reviewed, I recommend it with the caveat that while I am sure this is better than many, there may be others that are as good or better. But, this is an attractive, high quality trade paperback that is worth the money if you are really interested in Indian ingredients.ciality.

He has three high very well received restaurants in New York City and a few scattered about the hinterlands, especially in Las Vegas. Mark Bittman is a food columnist for the New York Times, inheriting a portion of the mantle of Craig Claiborne as one of the leading culinary newspapermen in the country. Bittman is also the author of several well-reviewed cookbooks on his own, primarily the successfully presumptuous `How to Cook Everything' (See my review of this book).<br /><br />I have to believe that this book was inspired to some extent by the book created out of the collaboration between Patricia Wells and Joel Robuchon, `L'Atelier of Joel Robuchon'. This comparison is heightened by the fact that both Vongerichten and Robuchon did journeyman cooking in the Far East and both continue to have their cuisine influenced by Asian flavors. In spite of several similarities, there are some important differences between these two books. While Robuchon's collaboration deals with his haute cuisine restaurant fare, Vongerichten and Bittman concentrate on dishes from his restaurants that work very well in the home kitchen. In fact, this is the second very authoritative source I have found which says that the home kitchen has several advantages over the restaurant in that it is not constrained by the need to produce every meal in a very short time, on demand. This leads to over-prepping, so that there is a risk that some preparations may fade by the time the end of service rolls around.<br /><br />Bittman's introduction to this book sets the expectations that the recipes in this book will be relatively simple. And, I am extremely happy to report that, on average, not only are these recipes simple, they also are extremely economical with ingredients. These recipes do not wallow in foie gras, truffles, and caviar; however, some of the recipes do consume a rather large amount of wine and butter. Note that Bittman makes no claim and no apologies to the fact that these recipes are NOT about low calorie dishes! It is probably also fair to say that while most of the recipes are easy and inexpensive, they are not necessarily quick. It is simple to reduce a bottle of wine by 2/3, from 750 ml to one cup (250 ml), but it will take you at least an hour to do. So if these recipes are simple, what makes them so special.<br /><br />The simple answer to this question is that they are the original creations of an exceptionally talented chef, which means that you are guaranteed a look at some really new things you can do with familiar ingredients. This is another advantage of the fact that Vongerichten uses relatively inexpensive ingredients. It opens all sorts of possibilities with things in your grocery store every day of the year. I was especially taken by the vegetable recipes. I may have several hundred recipes for green beans, but Vongerichten gives me one that adds the Asian flavor of soy sauce to this very French ingredient. In another recipe, he combines dirt-cheap beets and turnips in an utterly simple recipe with nothing more than salt and butter to create something that will be a knockout on a dinner table for guests. In fact, Vongerichten seems to have a special love for root vegetables, as beets and carrots appear in many of his recipes. He has also brought some very easy traditional French techniques to us when he makes confits of leeks and tarts of leeks and potatoes.<br /><br />It is not surprising that his salads are relatively simple, but it is surprising that his soups are relatively simple too. He even makes terrific mushroom soup with water instead of chicken stock. The recipe does involve making a mushroom broth, but this is a really terrific vegetarian dish.<br /><br />In spite of the Far Eastern influence, Vongerichten uses relatively few really hard to find ingredients. In his glossary of ingredients in the back of the book, the only really uncommon items were galangal, Kafir lime leaves, and amchur. Virtually every other ingredient is regularly stocked by my local megamart, and, aside from lemongrass and nam pla, few of these eastern ingredients are used in many recipes.<br /><br />Everything I have said about Vongerichten's savory dishes carries over to his dessert recipes. There are some recipes for tarts and tuilles that may be a challenge if you are not adept at these techniques to begin with, but if you are, these are `easy as pie'. For the pastry challanged, there are utterly simple fruit `salads', confits, and `soups' which take no more than the patience to clean your produce carefully and have the time to be sure that the cooked preparations cool down to a good serving temperature. My favorite discovery is a simple apple confit that uses nothing more than sugar, oranges, and apples. The biggest cost to this recipe is the very long (five to six hours) cooking time in a 300 degree oven.<br /><br />The fish recipes fall heavily to dishes made of scallops, lobster, shrimp, cod, halibut, mussels and crab. The last thing about the book pleases me is the fact that the authors include several recipes for lamb. This is partially offset by the fact that most of the meat and poultry choices are from somewhat more expensive cuts or birds.<br /><br />This book is a model of what a leading chef can offer the amateur foodie! There are very few recipes in this book I do not want to make now, today, immediately.relatively simple too. He even makes terrific mushroom soup with water instead of chicken stock.

321994:US	39134375	R7SF445M8D80E	076454313X	89772125	Kitchen Coach: Weekend Cooking (Kitchen Coach)	Books	5	7	8	N	Y	Very Good Book for the Occasional Entertainer and Cook	`Weekend Cooking' by cooking teacher and writer, Jennifer Bushman, is one of a series of books set up under the rubric of `Kitchen Coach'.<br /><br />This is the kind of book which is most useful to a non-foodie who may have no more than a dog-eared copy of `The Joy of Cooking' and her church's fund raising cookbook in her kitchen. To someone with a collection of twenty or more cookbooks, this book will be a waste of space and money, since such serious or semiserious Food Network addicts will probably know most of the support material in this book already, and they will have more than enough books to supply them with good recipes when they have the time to cook something special.<br /><br />The `Weekend Cooking' notion of the title is just a bit misleading. The book is actually oriented towards the niches in people's lives where they have a little extra time and inclination to cook something special for some special event. While these situations most commonly happen on the weekend, the book actually has a broader appeal. Unlike some other books which tout the weekend as an opportunity to cook ahead in order to salt away meals in the freezer for weeknights, this book is more oriented to whole, multicourse meals when a family has time to sit down together and spend more than fifteen minutes at the dinner table (although the book does contain brief chapter on cooking for the week ahead).<br /><br />Part of the reason this book is a waste of time, space, and money for the experienced amateur cook is that it spends a sizable amount of pages on general tips for getting your kitchen organized and stocked for serious cooking. Even the least experienced foodie will have gone through this exercise and be well on their way to working efficiently in the kitchen.<br /><br />One aspect of the book that enhances it's billing as a `weekend' cookbook is the amount of space dedicated to grilling. The kitchen tune-up introduction includes an inventory of grilling equipment and a relatively large number of the recipes are either specifically designed for the outdoor grill or can easily be done on a grill rather than in a saute pan. One of the best features of the book may be its good selection of burger and sandwich recipes. I'm quite happy with my classic Julia Child recipe, but a family with three kids will probably need some decent variety in their burger lineup. It is also a great addition to have a good recipe for the New Orleans classic Muffoletta sandwich without having to invest in a Cajun cookbook.<br /><br />In fact, the whole book seems to be oriented towards the well-equipped kitchen, as it recommends, with only a brief nod to the expense, that the well equipped kitchen include a Kitchen Aid stand mixer, a digital kitchen scale, an immersion blender, and electric ice cream maker, and a fondue set. The problem with this lineup is that it may turn off part of the potential audience for this book. That is, those people who want to cook occasionally and need a cookbook which will give them thorough directions without requiring a lot of equipment which may be used once or twice a year. One does not need a digital scale unless you are doing serious baking and you don't need both an immersion blender and a Waring blender. The Waring blender is far more useful than the stick blender unless you make lots of soups and don't make mixed drinks, smoothies, and milk shakes.<br /><br />With regard to the quality of the individual recipes, I find them very, very good. The recipe for `Hot and Spicy Chili with Beans' matches my favorite from Tom Valenti's `Soups, Stews, and One Pot Meals'. The yeast bread recipes use active dry yeast, which may not be the easiest, but it gives the best quality for the effort. The biscuit recipe seems straight out of Jim Villas' southern home cooking gospel. The grilled London Broil recipe was appropriately simple, but not as simple as what you can find from James Beard. My other arguments with this recipe is that I don't think it really needs a 24 hour marinade to get the appropriate flavor and it is actually better to start searing the meat while it is still cool from the fridge if you want a rare inside.  I was especially happy with the number of good vegetable recipes, especially the mushroom and eggplant recipes and the good potato recipes that do not involve a lot of added fat. The international range of recipes is also very respectable, with voices from France, Italy, Mexico and China. I also liked the very good selection of soup recipes.<br /><br />The most remarkable oversight in this book is that there is very little here about cooking for breakfast. What can be more utterly weekendish than a long, leisurely breakfast with eggs or pancakes, biscuits, sausage, and home fries! I would easily give up the cook ahead, grilling, and fondue chapters for a really good chapter on omelets, French toast, and griddlecakes. There is a recipe for a `country frittata', but it is definitely a dish for entertaining. The recipes for smoothies and scones are good, but it would have been so nice to get more on classic breakfast fare.<br /><br />My primary message to people interested in this book is the fact that this is called `Weekend Cooking' because it is NOT fast and easy. It is a good book for the novice who wants to do something special, but `Wolfgang Puck Makes It Easy' may be as good or better a choice if you have no interest in grilling or entertaining.s that I don't think it really needs a 24 hour marinade to get the appropriate flavor and it is actually better to start searing the meat while it is still cool from the fridge if you want a rare inside.

323364:US	39134375	R1E7DDCFORN32B	1583332022	355269022	Yogi in the Kitchen	Books	4	11	13	N	Y	Quick taste of Ayurvedic nutrition and Yoga. Still Hungary	`Yogi in the Kitchen' by Elaine Gavalas, M.A., M.S. is a great little mish mash of culinary doctrine, mystic lore, yoga exercises, and recipes from around the world in a fun little book which has the power to get you interested, but drops the ball in the end.<br /><br />While the Greeks and Romans were inventing mathematics, medicine, philosophy of knowledge, and science in the Mediterranean wild west, the Indians and Chinese were mapping the relation between body, soul, and mind in a way which has never quite been matched by Western thinkers until the advent of modern clinical psychology, which could do nothing more than affirm that the eastern mystics knew a thing or two about cultivating a healthy body and mind.<br /><br />This book by a talented dabbler in both eastern lore and western nutritional science is a very nice introduction into all these matters. Ms. Gavalas manages to turn a very loose presentation into a virtue in that she does not bore us with dozens of pages on arcane Sanskrit derived words for the eastern version of a form of astrology.<br /><br />For those who may be buying this book for recipes, know that in these 230 pages, 60 are devoted to the light introduction to the four different doctrines the author throws together into a mix of healthy eating regimens. These doctrines are vegetarianism, the Mediterranean diet, the Asian diet, and the ayurvedic diet. These first three are pretty well known to the average Western foodie, although the `Asian Diet' has gotten much less press and scientific review as a healthy regimen than the `Mediterranean diet'. The Ayurvedic diet is a development of Hindu doctrines and Yoga. The author describes it as `Yoga's sister science, ... a five thousand year old Indian holistic healing system for the body, mind, and spirit. The goal of Ayurveda, which means \\"the science of life\\" in Sanskrit is to achieve balance, vitality, energy, and perfect health through proper nutrition, exercise and meditation'.<br /><br />The Ayurveda doctrine states that there are three basic body types, for which there are three recommended diets. A quick look at the description of the body types gives one a jolt of recognition when you recognize a distinction between the modern `apple' and `pear' shaped body types, plus a corresponding set of emotional and intellectual dispositions which will almost invariable describe one which fits you better than the other two. But then, most people get the same reaction when they read a description of their astrological sign. The descriptions of the three body / personality types are so general that confirming this lore using scientific techniques is almost impossible, which means the doctrines are so general as to be empty. And yet, they do seem to have some grounding in common sensical observations, and the Indians who groom this doctrine have spent the last 5000 years refining the empirical observations which have gone into the doctrine, so the odds are pretty good that they have gotten some things right.<br /><br />On several points, I give Ms. Gavalas high points for avoiding some common errors. One small point is that she differentiates the Indian preparation, ghee, from the much less well-defined western notion of clarified butter. While they are very similar, ghee goes one step beyond separation to a cooking of the butterfat to a light brown color and a slightly stronger flavor. A much more important opinion is her not embracing the doctrines of those who advocate a purely raw cuisine. She quite correctly points out that cooking above the magic temperature defined by the raw advocates has many good things to offer.<br /><br />Ms. Gavalas offers, in chapter 3, `the yoga pantry', and a very nice little overview of the benefits and dangers of a wide range of foods important to her four inspiration sources cited above. The very odd thing about this chapter is that although her four doctrines, but her recommendations set her agenda and conclusions are basedon modern nutritional research. For example, while soy and its derivatives are cited as something just short of the fountain of youth, the author is careful to give us a sidebar on some dangers of eating too much soy. But, like virtually all nutritional research, some of these warnings are inconclusive and most are outweighed by benefits and called into question by the fact that populations which rely most on soy products have fewer problems which plague western populations.<br /><br />If you are waiting for the recipes, we aren't there yet. The fourth chapter, with the same name as the title of the book, is a primer on simple yoga exercises, all of which are of the simplest sort. No joint twisting lotus positions on the kitchen linoleum today.<br /><br />After all of this interesting run-up, Part 2, with the recipes, is an anticlimax.

For example, while soy and its derivatives are cited as something just short of the fountain of youth, the author is careful to give us a sidebar on some dangers of eating too much soy. But, like virtually all nutritional research, some of these warnings are inconclusive and most are outweighed by benefits and called into question by the fact that populations which rely most on soy products have fewer problems which plague western populations. <br /> <br />If you are waiting for the recipes, we aren't there yet.

324091:US	39134375	R1JQC6SNEYBVEO	0894807544	279876166	China Moon Cookbook	Books	5	9	12	N	Y	Cooking Chinese for Fun, Fun, Fun, Seriously!	The `China Moon Cookbook' is written by important Chinese cookbook writer, Barbara Tropp, the author of the earlier `The Modern Art of Chinese Cooking', one of the three or four best manuals of Chinese cooking written in English. It is the `Modern Art...' book which earns Ms. Tropp the honorific of `Julia Child of the Chinese Kitchen' from the San Francisco Chronicle. This volume is much different than Mme. Tropp's manual, and it is much different than anything Julia Child ever wrote. It is very much in the style of a lot of other Workman published cookbooks such as those of Ms. Tropp's good friend, Susan Herrmann Loomis, who specializes in `farmhouse' cookbooks of Italy, France, and the US. That is, it's a `fun book', meant more to entertain than to teach basic material about a particular type of cooking.<br /><br />This is not to say that it is a poor book. In fact, depending on what you want from a cookbook, for a trade paperback at a list price of $16.95, it may offer a lot more than the more serious `national cuisine manuals' or essays on the cuisine of an important culinary region such as Provence or Tuscany.<br /><br />In addition to being a `fun' book, it is also a book about recipes from a particular restaurant, the `China Moon' owned by the author in San Francisco. This is a second point weighing against your learning any authentic Chinese cooking in a systematic manner from this book. But that doesn't say the book is not informative. One of the first things I noticed is a similarity between the approach to the pantry in this book and Ming Tsai's excellent second book, `Simply Ming', where his lead premise is in the creation of many base preparations which make cooking in a restaurant much faster than it would be if everything were done from scratch. Mme. Tropp's argument is that the many of the commercial preparations of things such as chili oil, hoisin sauce, and a dozen other pantry standards are simply bad. The claim is that one can do much better by making your own.<br /><br />This argument is excellent for a high-end restaurant. It is also excellent for a household that eats Chinese meals at least three times a week and has three or four members, so these pantry preparations are used up on a regular basis. This also means that the book may be just a bit less valuable to someone who is not committed to making more than one or two dishes from this cookbook in a given month.<br /><br />Although I am not as knowledgeable about Chinese cuisine as I am about French and Italian eating, I was struck at how uncharacteristic a lot of the recipes seemed to my picture of Chinese food. In the first few dozen pages, there are recipes for bread, pickles, cole slaw, clam chowder, and double stock. While there is no question that all these dishes are rooted in Chinese ingredients and techniques, there definitely seems to be more than a wink and a nod to Western tastes here.<br /><br />This international flavor pervades the book. The last salad in the salad chapter is called `Paris Salad', discovered in a small Chinese restaurant in Paris, made with a very globalized mix of European, Asian, and New World ingredients.<br /><br />The chapter on desserts and sweets, aside from a generous use of Oriental ingredients such as ginger and peanuts seems like it comes straight out of a Lyon patisserie, with lots of tarts, Biscotti, frangipane, chocolate, and cappuccino.<br /><br />True to the Workman style of `fun' cookbook, there are lots of sidebars and headers showing the sources of the recipes, tips on presentation, hints on ingredients, and general chatter. There are also lots of good sidebars on techniques, but this is still nowhere near a text on good Chinese cooking praxis. In fact, a lot of the sidebars are on very Western techniques such as cookies and tarts. But this still leaves lots of room for some of my favorite Chinese recipes, including an excellent recipe for Hoisin Pork Buns with Ginger and Garlic. Note that these recipes do not shy away from using a wok whenever Chinese traditional technique calls for it. This is another reason you may not get the full benefit from this book if you are not committed to it's premises, such as using a wok properly, which requires a very good gas burner.<br /><br />In the end, I think this book is the real deal on how to have fun with Chinese cooking. While it is based on recipes done in an American restaurant which probably caters to tourists, all the techniques are authentic and reliable, right down to the requirement that you let your dough for steamed buns rise in the fridge for at least 12 to 15 hours before shaping and filling.<br /><br />This is a great book for cooking Chinese for fun. Its recipes are uniformly interesting, even though some of the interest may have a French accent. The author has the kind of reputation that gives you the assurance that she really knows what she is talking about.at these recipes do not shy away from using a wok whenever Chinese traditional technique calls for it.

325832:US	39134375	R3987UVXOA66FS	0870136887	748191806	Mes Tartes: The Sweet and Savory Tarts of Christine Ferber	Books	5	41	41	N	Y	Very European Master Class in Pastry. Buy It!	`Mes Tartes' by Christine Ferber, subtitled `The Sweet and Savory Tarts of Christine Ferber' is a highly polished gem of a book and a rare find if you are fond of classic MittelEuropean pastries. While the book was originally written in French and finely translated into English by Virginia R. Phillips, the book's contents show a broad influence of France, Germany, Italy, and Austria, the powerhouses of western pastry traditions. This is only appropriate, as Ms. Ferber is headquartered in Alsace, near the borders with southern Germany and Switzerland.<br /><br />To my knowledge, this is the second of Mme. Ferber's works available to us in English. The first, fittingly, was on preserves and confits, the classic ingredient in sweet tarts. While this earlier book is a leader in its class, its audience is a bit limited. The audience for fine pastries, at least the audience of those willing to make fine pastries is a lot larger than the readers willing to make preserves.<br /><br />Aside from the quality of this book, the most important thing to know about it is that it covers a range of pastries much broader than what you commonly describe as tarts. While it covers both sweet and savory flat pies with pastry crust and cooked fillings, it also covers galettes, quiches, Tatins, and clafoutis (custard or flan based cherry filled pastry), although almost all recipes produce something which has a fairly strong family resemblance to a tart or pie.<br /><br />I have read many fine books on pastry making lately and this book will certainly never replace some of these better texts such as Rose Levy Beranbaum's `The Pie and Pastry Bible' or Nick Malgieri's `Perfect Pastry' or Flo Bracker's `The Simple Art of Perfect Baking' or Gayle Ortiz' `The Village Baker's Wife', but this book is by far the finest presentation of the very French techniques of making pie and tart pastry by working the butter into the flour with a cold work surface and the heel of your hand which `smears' the cold butter into the butter. There is no way this method is easier than either a pastry cutter or even better, a food processor, but the results are so distinctive, I feel anyone with a love of pastry techniques will want to see Mme. Ferber's use of this technique.<br /><br />While Ferber does not go into the depth of explanation as, for example, Ms. Beranbaum, about why certain flours are better than others for pastry making, Mme. Ferber is very careful in describing the needs of the flour in each case and typically specifies one of two French style flours and approximates how you can reproduce these products with mixtures of American wheats. The general introduction on techniques and equipment is not as big as you may find in some books, but it is more important than most in that Mme. Ferber recommends a very typically French selection of dark iron pans which may not be readily available in the United States. Knowing this is important because one may wish to pay just a little more attention to baking times if your equipment did not fly in on a plane from Strasbourg. The only piece of equipment that gave me reason to rush to the Sonoma-Williams web page was the tart pan with the detachable bottom and NO FLUTEs. Most of the finished products in the book's photographs show tarts done in fluted pans, but more than a few are done in fluteless pans.<br /><br />Like her book on confits, this book is arranged by season. Two years ago, this organization did not appeal to me as much as it does today since I do much more cooking and baking today than I did two years ago, and I find myself going more and more to cookbooks organized by season, now that I have a pretty good collection of them. In fact, I believe this organization doubles the value of this book as the variation in quality and price of fruits is much more than with vegetables. A cabbage is a cabbage the year around, but a peach is only a prime Georgia peach for two months of the year.<br /><br />Another really delightful find in this book is some of the more unusual recipes, such as the sauerkraut and Munster tart. You can almost pinpoint on the map the site of this recipe's birth, as Alsace is `sauerkraut' central, just north of Munster, Germany. You can almost imagine that in pizza was invented in the Rhineland, this is what it would look like. And, adding a little corned beef and Russian Dressing to the recipe may bring you achingly close to a great Reuben flavored appetizer.<br /><br />All measurements are given in units familiar to American cooks. When the `professional' unit is metric weight and the U.S. amateur cook would use a volumetric measurement, the primary unit is given in cups. Aside from the great variety of recipe types, the classic fruit tarts are done to a level of perfection you may not see outside of a very fancy patisserie. Fruit fillings have carefully prepared flavored glazes that I simply do not see in my average Martha Stewart recipe. This is no reflection on Martha Stewart Living's recipe writers. It is an indication that these are extremely serious recipes with no compromises to easy baking.<br /><br />For a book originally written in French, the list of American suppliers and resources is very good. In fact, this is the first and only reference I have yet to see to a web site for doing measuring unit conversions. As I thing this alone may be worth the price of the book, I suggest you buy the book and check out page 285.<br /><br />If you bake or collect books on baking or are especially fond of French cooking techniques, this book should be high on your list of future purchases.<br /><br />Very highly recommended indeed.

327169:US	39134375	R2TKEL4ZEB48T3	0060740485	573889653	bills open kitchen	Books	4	37	71	N	Y	Very nice, simple recipes for experienced cooks.	`bill's open kitchen' is the third book from young Australian (Sidney) restaurateur and chef, Bill Granger, whose dust jacket blurbs, including one from the very distinguished New York Times columnist, R. W. Appel seems to want to paint Granger as Australia's culinary counterpart to Russell Crowe and Nicole Kidman. This lavishly produced trade paperback from high-end publisher William Morrow does everything it can to attract your eye. And, while I believe almost all the dishes produced from these recipes are a delightful fusion of classic European cuisine with the tastes of Southeast Asia, I think people with little kitchen experience should be warned away from this book.<br /><br />This is a celebrity chef book heavy on eye candy and light on technique in the service of making sure the recipes look like they are very easy to do. Yet, in almost every recipe, I found some little potential pitfall for the inexperienced.<br /><br />The most common pitfall is the fact that chef Granger very properly thinks and works in metric, and all metric measurements have been given Imperial measurement equivalents, except that the equivalents are not too friendly to American cooks. In the second recipe in the book, for one of Granger's specialities, scrambled eggs, the conversion of 80 milliliters of cream is effectively converted to 1/3 cup; however, the 10 grams of butter is converted to ¼ ounces. Unfortunately, my handy Land-o-Lakes quarter pound of butter is marked off in tablespoons and fractions of cups, not in ounces. This same recipe for `scrambled' eggs includes a sample of some of the very peculiar directions sprinkled into the recipes. The odd statement is `It is important to fold the eggs, not SCRAMBLE them'. Eggs are something of a speciality for Granger's restaurants, and yet each of the four egg recipes on the first page of recipes contains something quirky to this American amateur cook. In fried eggs, the author suggests adding a cover to the saute pan of cooking eggs only if you want your yolks `harder'. My Pennsylvania eggs need a little help from a cover to harden up the albumin even if you want a liquid yolk. For boiled eggs, raw eggs are lowered into boiling water and simmered for 5 to 6 minutes. This agrees with neither of the two expert methods I know for boiling eggs, and my Pennsylvania eggs are prone to cracking if they are dropped, unpricked, into boiling water. The quirk in the poaching instructions may be more of my quirk than that of the author, but he suggests dropping eggs into simmering water and covering them with a tightfitting lid until the egg whites are opaque. No directions on whether or not the lid needs to be removed or if it needs to be a glass lid.<br /><br />Some of the difficulties are due to the use of British culinary terms as when the author calls for 8 long thin rashers of streaky bacon. Now is rasher more like an American strip or a French lardon? My favorite is the recipe for fresh baked beans where the Imperial (American friendly?) unit is `1 punnet' of cherry tomatoes. One will be lucky if they realize that the metric 250 grams is roughly 9 ounces, or about what you get in one of those cute little produce jewel boxes which hold about 10 ounces of small fruits.<br /><br />Other difficulties for the amateur are when the author leaves out some information. A recipe for breakfast potatoes does not specify starchy, waxy, or general-purpose potatoes. As the author does specify potato type in another recipe, one can conclude that the type of potato is not important. But, in our Food Network enlightened mind, not having a spud of choice in hand can lead to an Adrian Monkish paralysis of indecision. Another breakfast recipe for a five grain porridge gives a general suggestion to use `mixed grains' with a suggestion of five grain preparations, most of which are probably not available in the average American supermarket. I would have offered more suggestions with some more common grain forms. I can imagine that there are some grains that may actually not work in porridge. Does wheat germ work in porridge?<br /><br />The section on luncheon recipes gives me something positive to say about this book. Granger's influences seem to be equally divided between Mediterranean and Southeast Asian recipes, techniques, and ingredients. His very nice recipe for Thai fried rice uses Thai jasmine rice and Asian and Mediterranean greens, the Thai technique with a mortar and pestle to create the sauce, and a Lebanese cucumber. I get the really strong feeling that these are the things that are in ample supply at his greengrocer down the street from his restaurant. Even this very nice recipe has two puzzles. The first is a call for a lime cheek! Unfortunately, the full-page photograph of the dish does not show enough of the lime to enable me to tell if a lime cheek is half a lime (hemisphere) or a lime cross-section (circle). My vote is for the hemisphere. The second problem is just a bit more serious in that he instructs us to heat a non-stick frying pan over high heat in the same way as you may do for a wok. Every American culinary celebrity, including science nerd Alton Brown, warns against heating a nonstick pan with nothing in the pan. At best, this will cause excess wear and tear on the Teflon coating. At worst, it will degrade the Teflon and give off some nasty fluorocarbons. Ouch.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Granger has several good, simple egg dishes such as his spicy omelette sandwiches. Unfortunately, his directions for making an omelet are simply too sparse for the omelette uninitiated.<br /><br />Overall, the book gives many excellent, simple recipes, if you know your way around the kitchen in the first place. Mr. Granger is surely a talented chef, but not a great cookbook writer or editor with knowledge of American cooking practice.I can imagine that there are some grains that may actually not work in porridge.

328037:US	39134375	R34JRL7EBL18BX	1570671613	454227196	Buddha's Table: Thai Feasting Vegetarian Style	Books	5	87	94	N	Y	Excellent Introduction to Thai Vegetarian Cuisine.Buy It.	`Budda's Table' by Chat Mingkwan looks like a typical `little cookbook' you commonly see published by Chronicle Books, some of which are decent and some of which are a waste of money compared to other titles available for a similar price. This book, published by a house with the incredibly modest name of `Book Publishing Company' out of Summertown, Tennessee, has lots to offer, even if it isn't published by Alfred A. Knopf, Harper Collins, or Artisan.<br /><br />Unlike the dominant cuisines of India, Thai cooking is not inherently vegetarian, and yet Buddhism, a religion with strong vegetarian tendencies is the most important religion in Thailand. This gives rise to the book's title and subtitle, `Thai Feasting Vegetarian Style'. This means that fish sauce, one of the most important Thai ingredients, has been removed from all recipes. This is probably about as dramatic as removing anchovies from all Italian dishes. Fortunately, the wealth of southeast Asian fermented bean pastes are up to filling in the gaps left by removing the famous `Nam Pla' from all recipes.<br /><br />This is not to say Chat Mingkwan has abandoned Thai traditional cooking. He begins his book with an excellent little guide to Thai ingredients which is no replacement for good references such as Bruce Cost's `Asian Ingredients', but it is an honest coverage of the field with a firm commitment to the belief that there are a lot of Thai ingredients with which you cannot substitute and expect to achieve the right Thai taste. Foremost of these in my mind is galangal, a rhizome with some resemblance to ginger. But, based on the scientific names of the two plants, they are not closely related. They certainly do not belong to the same genus. Another unmistakable and unreplacable ingredient is tamarind. While I have never knowingly tasted galangal, I have tasted tamarind and can think of nothing in the western pantry that comes close to its taste. It is sharp, but its bite is somewhere between cassia (Asian cinnamon), licorice, and vinegar.<br /><br />Thai cuisine is an ancient fusion of Indian and Chinese cuisines, jolted to an entirely new level with the addition of the capsicum chilies from the New World. I know less about Indian cooking than I do on just about every other major cuisine you can name, but it seems to me that the primary transformation from Indian to Thai cuisine seems to be the shift of curry mixtures from powders in India to pastes in Thailand. This generalization may be all wet, but it is quite true that virtually all curry bases described in this book are pastes, making the mortar and pestle a very important tool in the Thai kitchen. I agree entirely with the author and millions of Mexican home cooks and Jamie Oliver and everyone else who wants to weigh in on the subject that the mortar and pestle is simply a superior tool for making pasty mixtures than any modern blender or food processor. If you want to make serious use of this book, get a good, heavy set and find yourself a good source of Thai ingredients.<br /><br />To reinforce this point, the author opens with a 15-page chapter devoted to chili and curry sauces. These recipes also reinforce the fact that you will not succeed with these recipes unless you can find a source for galangal, Kafir lime leaves, and lemongrass. Most of the other ingredients should be no problem in Mittelamerica. In my darkest Pennsylvania, my local farmers market carries fresh lemongrass and cilantro with roots and my local megamart has all the chilies, bean pastes, and tamarind you want.<br /><br />The next chapter on salads and snacks includes easy recipes with that oh so distinctive Thai taste based on peanuts, lemongrass, chiles, cilantro, and tamarind. This chapter includes a recipe for the famous Pad Thai salad, where, unlike many famous French salads, the only difficult task is finding all the ingredients. The chapter also presents rice as a salad ingredient, something rather uncommon in western menus. And, if rice isn't your dish, there is always tofu.<br /><br />The chapter on soups brings back my most indelible memory of eating Thai food when I asked for clear Thai soup to be done `spicy'. It was very, very, very spicy hot! Chef Mingkwan immediately scored points with me when I saw his vegetable stock recipe. My fussiest and most highly respected French sources on stocks insist that vegetables are simmered no more than an hour in a stock, and Chef Mingkwan puts his daikon and cilantro and chiles to the hot water for no more than 45 minutes. This chapter also includes a great foodie talking point recipe with a `Hunter's Soup'. This is the Thai vegetarian version of the soup one makes when the hunting has not gone too well.<br /><br />The next chapter deals with stir-frying, one of the strongest influences from China on the cuisines of Southeast Asia. I have seen street food people from Burma to the Philippines use woks with almost exactly the same techniques as you may see in Shanghai or Beijing. The introduction to this chapter is a fair example of the author's sense of humor as he points out that uses for the wok include steaming, smoking, deep frying, floating on flood waters and sledding in the snow. While the stir fry recipes are very good, this book is no primer on stir-frying technique or stir-frying equipment. If you are not familiar with the wok through experience with Chinese techniques, I suggest you check out Ken Hom's `Quick Wok'. I suspect Martin Yan's earlier books are also good sources, but I have not gotten around to reviewing them yet.<br /><br />This is a sample of the good Thai cooking experience available to you in this book.

Worth Buying.	`Best Bondage Erotica' edited by Alison Tyler is a superior collection of recent stories which deserves the highest complement of leaving you wanting more of the same. The only disappointing side of the picture with this collection is the homogeneity in the tone, settings, personalities, and plots among the stories. This is not to say that there is not a great range of diverse erotic contrivances within the world of modern American suburbia. In fact, the authors' inventiveness makes this an entirely rereadable volume, as I have been through the book at least three times since purchasing it.<br /><br />The problem I see is that no modern erotic fiction effectively explores the rich boundary between sensuality and horror. Two of the greatest examples of how this boundary can be exploited is the great scene where Fay Wray meets her tall dark anthropoid gentleman caller in `King Kong' and the experiences of Edgar Allan Poe's hero in his chilling short story, `The Pit and the Pendulum'. And, these treatments have not disappeared. Stephen King gave what may be the greatest tribute to Poe's approach in his novel, `Gerald's Game' published a few years ago. And, at least two episodes have appeared on both the original `CSI' and `CSI:New York' in the last few years which treats imaginative bondage situations. Admittedly, the objective of the CSI treatment is not the same as a treatment of the same situations done from the participants' points of view, but the rush experienced by seeing these plots from the victim's point of view is testament to their power. What the CSI treatment looses in concentrating on the puzzles of figuring out what happened from a rather clinical point of view, it gains from the realism the shows are able to achieve by placing the events squarely within a straight world which looks at them objectively.<br /><br />Admittedly, the CSI lead characters played by William Peterson and Gary Sinise are a lot more enlightened and professional than the average public, so their personal reactions are muted, but the treatment of the eroticism of restraint is at least as fair, if not fairer than Shakespeare's treatment of a Jew in `The Merchant of Venice'. But I'm really straying far from my point.<br /><br />The stories in this collection are all fantasies that succeed at evoking a genuine restraint imagination purely by staying very close to the world of their readers. There are no Spanish dungeons or 19th century New Orleans basements here. Several stories make a virtue out of this `close to home' attitude in creating little gems of minimalist restraint as we see in M. Christian's story `Moving'. This is so easily reproduced that I strongly suspect that hundreds of pairs of readers have done just that. Other stories such as Thomas Roche's `Bad Girls in Bondage' do require a fairly sizable cache of toys and a somewhat uncommon trio of cohabitants, but it is so likely that it is easy to put oneself in the first person position in the story. Some longer stories such as N. T. Morley's previously unpublished `Shock Therapy' does take place in a much more truly fantastic venue in that it pictures clinical scientists' studying sexual response with devices which would have made Kinsey blush. The improbabilities lie in the fact that I don't think a nonsubmissive Westchester yuppie couple would allow themselves to be put into a transparently contrived bondage. A stronger improbability lies in the fact that no psychological investigator would ever be able to get an Institutional Review Board to approve these kinds of experiments. But this probably doesn't count, as one would probably know this only if they have detailed knowledge of the laws surrounding clinical research.<br /><br />`Shock Therapy' is an example of the power and importance of pure fantasy in erotic bondage. This is not an endorsement of `Gor' novels so much as it is a request for fiction that takes the reader to a place they simply cannot go themselves. The only fictional account I have seen which effectively treats a both realistic and emotionally satisfying end to a permanent master / submissive relation is `The Story of O'. A paradigm of this fantasy is Edgar Allan Poe's `The Cask of Amontillado'. If I ever read another collection of bondage erotica, I would find it an improvement if there were one or two stories that improvised on this theme.<br /><br />I encourage the editor and the various authors to keep at it, but try to keep up with both classic and modern boundaries in perceptions of their fantasy worlds.<br /><br />I also agree with other reviewers who day the cover is one of the best things about the book.nly fictional account I have seen which effectively treats a both realistic and emotionally satisfying end to a permanent master / submissive relation is `The Story of O'.

330273:US	39134375	R18AFBMHF0J0U2	1573441562	11125379	Carrie's Story: An Erotic S/M Novel	Books	4	23	26	N	Y	Excellent Essay on Submissive Girl Story. Not quite the best	`Carrie's Story' is written by Molly Weatherfield who is described on a front cover blurb as a neo-Victorian erotic romance writer. Personally, I am very happy that there is very little which is Victorian, neo or otherwise, about Ms. Weatherfield's way of telling a story. On the other hand, this novel owes a rather sizable debt to `The Story of O'. This borrowing has a generally positive effect for the reader, except for the fact that Ms. Weatherfield simply does not come up to Ms. Reage's standard in building a successfully paced story or in capturing the state of mind of the story's heroine.<br /><br />To the good, Ms. Weatherfield has placed her story smack in the middle of 21st century San Francisco. This is a great relief to those who find the trek to Medieval Europe of the science fictional world of Gor a bit trying on the imagination when we search out good stories of this genre. The author lightly seasons the narrative with references to important San Francisco venues such as Chez Panisse and the Zuni Caf&eacute;, plus side trips to Napa Valley. Other very clever references to Shubert's `Trout Quintet' and well-known works of fiction are just enough to give a good patina of civility to the book. The high point of cultural references is the clever allusion to the Thomas Pynchon's novella, `The Crying of Lot 49'. The pun of the title fits neatly into the situation of the character in this novel.<br /><br />Also to the good, Ms. Weatherfield has succeeded in picturing a very realistic long-term discipline relationship between two people. Much of this, I am sure, is attributable to the influence of `The Story of O'. It is very easy to overplay the amount of time, in the long run, that a person can erase their pre-relation life to that of the will of their master. A normal working career with an after hours relationship based on well-established rules is the name of the game. It is also much more interesting psychologically to paint a person who lives in the world but whose mind belongs to another person.<br /><br />This is where some problems creep into the quality of the storytelling. The submissive lead character, Carrie, is simply not presented in such a way that we see the kind of psychic rewards which come from a full time master / submissive relationship. The narratives of various scenes give no hint of the kind of mystic bonds created by physical and mental submission. The life in Carrie's mind is little more intense than what has been described as the Stockholm syndrome, where captives attach themselves to their captors in much the same way that children attach themselves to parents because their entire well-being depends on favors from parents / captors. `Stockholm syndrome' may play some role in a master / submissive relationship, but it is certainly not the most important part of the relation between an independent agent like Carrie and her various masters.<br /><br />Another weakness of the story is the level of suspension of disbelief one has to attain to believe some of the situations in the novel. Some of the venues of `The Story of O' are just slightly implausible, unless you happen to live in Las Vegas, where all of this seems possible. Ms. Weatherfield's organizations and venues are really quite implausible. If one is to be erotic and gain the advantages of staying within the realities of the modern world, you can't go about inventing Astrodome sized buildings in the middle of Paris dedicated to a plainly illegal activity.<br /><br />All that being said, I found many of Ms. Weatherfield's inventions, especially her description of legal legendermains used to justify erotic slavery to be very satisfying. I am entirely willing to believe these fictions would survive a French court, but I am less certain of how they would fare in an American court outside of San Francisco. I also found her limitations on the dominance submissive relation to be an excellent service of the realities of human relations.<br /><br/>Overall, this is an excellent, satisfying novel, better than many, and almost as good as the best in its genre. My only real disappointment was in the weak ending. It didn't even end in a whimper. It seemed to be entirely written to facilitate a sequel. But then, a sequel matching the quality of this book will be very welcome indeed.> <br />Overall, this is an excellent, satisfying novel, better than many, and almost as good as the best in its genre.

Buy It!	`Seafood of South-East Asia' by noted culinary writer Alan Davidson, the author of `The Oxford Companion to Food' is a reference book which a serious cook must have in their library where time is spent deciding on what to eat rather than time spend actually cooking. This book belongs to a rare breed of books in English such as Elizabeth Schneider's `Vegetables from Amaranth to Zucchini' or `Bruce Cost's Asian Ingredients' which thoroughly cover a broad single subject. This volume is cut from exactly the same cloth and sewn with an almost identical pattern to the author's two other classics, `Mediterranean Seafood' and `North Atlantic Seafood'.<br /><br />All three books are organized in the same way that gives primacy to information on the aquatic species and secondary coverage of recipes.<br /><br />Biological family, genus, and species organize the first part on the catalog of species in order that the biological similarity of the fishes is clearly shown. Each article gives the most common English name, the two part Latin scientific name, the scientist who assigned this name (most commonly the great inventor of biological Taxonomy, Linnaeus), the biological family name, and the common name of the fish in virtually every language of the major fishing nationality bordering the relevant body of water. This Southeast Asian volume includes names found in the languages of United Arab Emirates, Bengal, Tamil, Singhalese, Burma, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, Cambodia, Vietnam, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan, and Japan. I have not seen any differentiation between the different languages of, for example, China and the Philippines. I would guess that Chinese names are in Cantonese and the Philippine names are in Tagalog. These names in themselves are entertaining to the linguistically inclined, as it is interesting to see the similarities and differences from country to country.<br /><br />The articles on every species also have a highly detailed black and white drawing of each animal. The great value to these is that it makes comparing the appearance of different fishes very easy, as every species is depicted in a similar style. It is too bad they could not be depicted to scale, but this would have had the sturgeon filling two pages while the anchovies would be the size of a period. Instead, the remarks on each fish give the average market length and a description of the typical color and markings.<br /><br />The catalog entry also gives a paragraph or two on cuisine, which is a discussion of the culinary desirability of the species and typical ways in which the animal is prepared. For most fish, this includes methods by which the fish is butchered. The catalog entries also include a list of recipes and page numbers for these recipes in the second major section of the book.<br /><br />The second major section divides recipes by country. This volume gives us eight chapters on recipes from Burma; Thailand; Cambodia; Vietnam; China and Hong Kong; The Philippines; Indonesia; and Malaysia, Brunei, and Singapore.<br /><br />One is tempted to expect these recipes to be very generic and not as interesting as those you may find in books of `haute cuisine' from a fish specialist such as Eric Rippert. This is partially true. Davidson is less the great cook than he is a great fish and food scholar. This means that while his recipes may come from common sources, he gives us much more information on the background of the recipes than the chef may do. A good example of this is in his coverage of Filipino dishes. I compared his `Fish Sinigang' recipe to the `Sinigang Na Bangus' recipe in `Filipino Cuisine' by Gerry Gelle and found that Davidson's recipe was as good or better than the one given by the Filipino chef. True to Davidson's scholarly approach, he describes what type of fish works well in this recipe, even though both he and Gelle specify milkfish (bangos). One odd fact is that Gelle's name for the fish is one Davidson attributes toMalaysia. May be due to linguistic duality between northern and southern Philippines. As with all cuisines, Davidson gives expert advice on cookbooks of the Filipino cuisines, especially as he says cookbook writing is a well-developed discipline in the islands. Icing on the cake is Davidson's overview of Filipino fish cures. One method even looks suspiciously like the famous Caribbean technique that developed into barbecue.<br /><br />One great delight was the fact that the book includes information on Gasteropods (Snails, limpets, conches, etc), sea turtles, and seaweed. You may not be cooking turtle soup any time soon, but you will know your stuff the next time you watch `Babette's Feast'! My point here is that this book is simply great fun to read and to use as a source of ideas for unusual new recipes.<br /><br />Unlike the books on the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, the bibliography shows that the author has based most of his material on sources written in English or French. While Davidson was a diplomat with serious language skills, either these skills did not extend to oriental languages OR most of the good stuff is written in English and French anyway. One of the greatest things about all these volumes is that all of this great material is available in trade paperbacks, which list for no more than $25. For you devotees of second hand bookstores, please note the author's warning that the first edition of this volume apparently had more than a usual number of errors and all known errors were corrected in the second edition.<br /><br />These are must have books for devoted foodies! A quick look at the list of species in the table of contents shows that almost all of the common named fishes show up on the ice or in the tanks of your favorite local megamart or fishmonger. I am certain that your Maine lobster will not mind being dressed in a recipe tailored to an Asian spiny lobster, although Alton Brown has quipped that the Maine flesh is slightly sweeter.<br /><br />Highly recommended.tributes to Malaysia.

While the earlier work was heavily influenced and endorsed by Bertrand Russell, who was always better known than his Austrian colleague in the world at large, the latter work is a complete departure from the logic based philosophy of Russell and the Logical Positivists, for whom the Tractatus was their bible. Although I have never seen this in any philosophical or historical analysis of Wittgenstein's work, the `Philosophical Investigations' were much closer to the `common sense' style of philosophy of G. E. Moore than to the thinking of Russell. All three were Cambridge dons and it is certain that Wittgenstein and Moore knew one another very well. The only thing which may have prevented Moore's ideas from influencing Wittgenstein is that the latter man was a much deeper thinker whose ideas still shape modern philosophy while Moore has become something of a footnote in the history of philosophy, best known for his common sense defense of the real world and his `naturalistic fallacy' invention in his pretentiously titled `Principia Ethica'.<br /><br />Wittgenstein and Moore certainly were the joint parents of modern English and American academic philosophical style and doctrines. While Wittgenstein did not publish very much in his lifetime, his influence is widespread and deep due to his long tenure as a teacher at Cambridge, from the early thirties to his death in 1955. As abstruse as Wittgenstein's philosophy may seem at first look, it is really exceptionally applicable to everyday thinking. One of my favorite stories about Wittgenstein is in a memoir written by the American philosopher and Wittgenstein student, Norman Malcolm. During World War II, Wittgenstein and Malcolm were chatting about something the Germans had done and Malcolm said it was against the English character to do any similar action. At this comment, Wittgenstein lost his temper at how his student, Malcolm could make such a statement which so totally went against Wittgenstein's teachings. A much less anecdotal application of his thought is his notion of `family resemblences' expounded early in the `Philosophical Investigations' as a tool for analyzing the meanings of words. His example was the notion of games. Try as you might, someone can probably find a counterexample to virtually any definition of games which will fit into a reasonably sized dictionary definition. Wittgenstein's solution was that everything which can be called a game has a `family resemblance' to other games and does not have a family resemblance to most things which are not games.<br /><br />This is just one tool and two examples of the extreme empiricism in Wittgenstein's thought. While there is a world of difference in the styles of Wittgenstein and the great Scottish philosopher David Hume, there is a strong `family resemblance' between their doctrines in that neither was in the least congenial to generalizations of any sort. The biggest difference between the doctrines of Wittgenstein and Hume is that while Hume was concerned with what we can know, Wittgenstein was concerned with the meanings of what we say and write.<br /><br />Wittgenstein's most famous doctrine in the `Investigations' is that to determine the meaning of words and ideas, look at how they are used. This became his E=mc squared. All his students wielded this doctrine like a bludgeon to beat any `old school' position into submission.<br /><br />Although the doctrines of the Tractatus and the Investigations are quite different, Wittgenstein's style of writing in aphorisms appears in both works and appears in virtually every posthumous collection of his notes which have been published in the last 60 years. Unlike Nietzsche, this style was not an artifice or merely done for effect. Wittgenstein's thinking was so intense I think he simply did not have the patience to connect the dots between his primary inspirations.<br /><br />After the notion of `use' and `family resemblences, the most important position in the Investigations may be his arguments against the notion of a private language. While no one in everyday life has the slightest notion that they may be talking in a private language, the concept is central to the refutation of many older philosophical positions as diverse as those of Bishop Berkeley and Rene Descartes. The concept simply was that a language that is by its nature understandable by only its creator is not possible. It is not a language.<br /><br />While Wittgenstein's own works stayed close to everyday language or mathematical thinking, the great virtue of the `Philosophical Investigations' over the system of the Tractatus is that the later work creates tools which may intelligently be applied to all kinds of discourse, from Ethics to Aesthetics to Politics to Religion. The later work does not turn its back on these things as some may have seen in the earlier work when it relegated virtually all discourse not about the natural world to the bin of meaninglessness. Since Wittgenstein's intention was to show the emptiness of metaphysics, he followed his thinking to its logical conclusion and threw the baby out with the bathwater in the Tractatus.<br /><br />One of the most indelible images imprinted on my thinking from my study of the `Philosophical Investigations' is the comment that the search for the solution to a philosophical problem is often like trying to force open a locked door, when all you need to do is turn around to see the open window. This is the notion of thinking outside the box writ large.<br /><br />Some of Wittgenstein's ideas can be very easy to grasp, like the notion of `family resemblences'. Others like the concept of a private language may be very, very hard.

336155:US	39134375	RIAS8WSEAHU4X	0415254086	411173754	Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (Routledge Classics) (Volume 123)	Books	5	16	26	N	N	Second Most Important Work of Philosophy in 20th Century	The `Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus' by Ludwig Wittgenstein is easily the second most important philosophical work of the twentieth century, the most important being Wittgenstein's second major work, the `Philosophical Investigations'. I must have an especially large case of hubris today to pretend that I can criticize such an important and dense work. This very short book is by far the best example of Ezra Pound's statement that the quality of a work (of literature) is based on the amount of meaning the author can pack into the fewest words. Every one of the sparse sentences in this book is pregnant with meaning.<br /><br />Wittgenstein's influence, unlike the Existentialists such as Nietzsche and Kierkegard is primarily through his influence of other philosophers such as the Vienna circle of the 1920s and Bertrand Russell, who did the introduction to the English translation of the book. So why would a non-philosopher have any interest in reading this book? When I am taught physics, I do not read Newton, Einstein, and Heisenberg. When I am taught German, I don't read Goethe or Rilke, at least not until I start studying German literature. So why do people always read the philosophers' original works when they study philosophy? The answer to this question is probably in an understanding of the nature of philosophical discourse itself, and this is at the root of Wittgenstein's doctrines in both his Tractatus and his Investigations.<br /><br />One of the primary tasks of modern academic philosophy, the task very much defined by Wittgenstein's works, is to distinguish between various types of discourse. The easiest to understand is statements of fact, most clearly represented by the results of scientific research. As I write these words, it occurs to me that scientific discourse may in fact not be the easiest to understand when you include discussions of the nature of theories and explanation. So, for the purposes of this discussion, lets just use Natural History as the paradigm of factual discourse. This is the sort of thing Charles Darwin did on his voyages on the Beagle. He simply described flora and fauna and suggested new scientific names for newly discovered species.<br /><br />A really difficult area is talk about art, the study of which is Aesthetics. As aesthetics is not nearly as important as science, few high powered philosophers have spent much time on the subject. Oddly, it is extremely relevant to my writing these little reviews, as I am making aesthetic judgments, even when I am writing about cookbooks, whose subject is pretty objective.<br /><br />Another clearly defined realm of discourse is morality. The study of this discourse is Ethics. This is largely the study of right behavior and good behavior and the difference between right and good. Without going into details, let me assure you, good reader, that right and wrong are NOT simply what a society says it is.<br /><br />The wishes of a society are more properly studied by Political Science. We can use a little sounder political science in our popular conversations to help us sort out the properly political issues from those that are more properly Ethical or Religious. While there are pretty good criteria for identifying right from wrong, the absence of such criteria is what characterizes religious discourse and beliefs.<br /><br />A religious conviction, by its nature, is pure and simple faith. There are simply no scientific, moral, or even aesthetic criteria that can determine whether Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, or Judaism is better. A telling fact is that all of these religions make virtually identical moral statements. This is the basis of the great wisdom of our founding fathers when they separated church and state. Politics and Religion simply do not mix. This is not to say that people with strong religious beliefs will not tend to hold certain political beliefs such as the wrongness of abortion. The problem is that they cannot use religiousstatements to support the political position that leads to laws against abortion. They can use other arguments, but saying that God believes in the rights of the fetus simply doesn't cut the mustard. This is a philosophical finding determined by analysis, not observation or reference to sacred documents.<br /><br />As an aside, it is important to note that there is an enormous amount of philosophical method which can and should be taught to non-philosophers in college and even in high school. Starting with Aristotle, the workhorse of philosophical discourse has been logic. In most colleges, the Philosophy faculty, not the Mathematics faculty, teaches Logic. Detecting inconsistencies is the bread and butter of philosophical analysis.<br /><br />Analysis of language is the kind of thing Wittgenstein taught two generations of philosophers to do with his two great works. Oddly enough, while the Tractatus is purely a work of some of the most insightful philosophy done in the Western tradition, the similarity between its findings and some of the tenants of Zen Buddhism is striking. It was the study of this connection that helped get me into a Ph.D. program in Philosophy at Johns Hopkins University. This apparent similarity is another important reason to make the effort to read this book.<br /><br />One can easily be struck by the great difference in the doctrines of the Tractatus and the Investigations, written about 25 years later while Wittgenstein was a professor of philosophy at Cambridge. And yet, Wittgenstein himself said that next to the Investigations, the `picture' of language described in the Tractatus is a reasonable `next best' theory. In fact, even though I have been out of touch with philosophy of science for several decades, I would not be one bit surprised if contemporary philosophers of science and mathematics were not still going to the Tractatus and other Wittgenstein writings from the 1920s to look for inspiration. Unfortunately, the Tractatus is just too lean to provide tools to analyze Moral, Aesthetic, Political, and Religious discourse.<br /><br />This book is too short and too important for an educated person not to at least take a crack at understanding its insights.e religious statements to support the political position that leads to laws against abortion.

Nice Read	`Beard on Bread' is one volume of a series on specific culinary topics by leading American culinary writer, James Beard. While fellow experts who knew him such as James Villas attribute Beard with an encyclopedic knowledge of food, he was not particularly an expert on bread. So, what we get in this book is an excellent selection of recipes covering a wide range of uses and techniques, but without the depth of understanding about breadbaking and its techniques which you get in books from Peter Reinhart, Nancy Silverton, or Rose Levy Beranbaum. This is not necessarily a bad thing. Cookbooks full of relatively simple recipes from a very reliable source for a small list price are always valuable to a wide audience. And, if you are reading this review, the chances are good that this book is more appropriate to your needs than one of the bread books from those leading lights I cited above.<br /><br />Dedications of books are generally relatively uninteresting, as they are most commonly made to close family members who had a lot to do with the author's surviving the experience of writing the book, but little to do with inspiration on the content of the book. This book's dedication is revealing, in that it is to the great English culinary writer, Elizabeth David, who, in addition to her famous books on the cuisine of France, Italy, and the Mediterranean, was the proud author of a superb book on English breads and baking. I am in the middle of reading that book now, and I am genuinely surprised that the book is not cited more than it is by other authors. It is a large book with really substantial sections on both the technology of bread baking and the history of bread baking in England. If you are familiar with David's book, Beard's book is, in comparison, a minor work whose survival in print rests largely on the reputation of the author and the fact that it does give us lots of good recipes at a low cost.<br /><br />Beard is well known for having created something of a little book writing shop staffed by disciples who wrote most of the actual text attributed to Beard. The most prominent of these are Barbara Kafka and Marian Cunningham, both of whom are easily charter members in an American cookbook hall of fame for their own work. And, if they are not, they should be. But this book, I suspect, has just a little more of James Beard in it than most published under his name. Biographies of Beard often cite how he constantly experimented with bread recipes, even though this was not his speciality. Oddly enough, if he can be said to have any speciality more specific than American Cuisine, it is probably grilling and outdoors cooking.<br /><br />The best thing about this book aside from the pedigree of its author is its range of subjects. Without touching on artisinal baking, Beard manages to touch just about everything else the world calls bread. The principle subjects are:<br /><br />Basic Yeast Bread and other White-Flour Breads<br /><br />Whole Wheat Breads<br /><br />Sweetened Breads and Coffee Cakes<br /><br />Egg Breads<br /><br />Batter Breads<br /><br />Baking Powder and Soda Breads<br /><br />Rolls<br /><br />Flat Breads<br /><br />Filled Breads<br /><br />Fried Cakes<br /><br />Griddle Breads<br /><br />The fact that this book was first written in 1973, just before the explosion in food interest in the United States means that much of what is in the book has just a touch of the retro about it. I am happy to find that `instant' yeast had just become available before this book was written and Beard took this opportunity to comment on it. I am especially happy to discover that while Beard recognized that it might be faster than the more familiar `active dry' yeast, he believes its results were simply not as flavorful as the older dried yeast.<br /><br />My favorite example of a retro recipe is the pancake recipe in the last chapter that leavens these goodies with yeast rather than with buttermilk and baking soda or baking powder. Thus, Beard's Yeast Griddle Cakes no longer qualify as quick breads, since it is advised that the starter be mixed and let to sit overnight. If one wonders why in the world one would want to make pancakes with yeast, you have to remember that yeast was available before commercially prepared baking powder, and, buttermilk or vinegar may not have been as commonly available as the yeast, since yeast was such a good leavener for lots of breads for which chemical leaveners did not work.<br /><br />To those for whom this is important, this is a very homey book. Lots of recipes are borrowed from friends and acquaintances, only a few, like Jane Grigson, are recognizable culinary writers. Note that many traditional breads such as brioche are not made by a traditional recipe. Virtually every brioche recipe I have ever seen, even in books on `easy cooking' ask for an 8-hour rise, preferable longer, overnight. Beard's recipe does not do this. His brioche recipe can be done in about the time it takes to make a classic white bread loaf. Thus, this is not the book for someone interested in professional bread baking or even an amateur approximation of classic professional recipes. This is a book which is fun to read and a great source of inspiration when you just happen to want to try some old school bread making.<br /><br />My only caveat is that unlike books from the experts listed above, there is little information to help figure out what may have gone wrong if the recipe does not come out as expected. And, bread baking simply does require just a bit more skill than you average savory dish.ger qualify as quick breads, since it is advised that the starter be mixed and let to sit overnight.

The most similar book I have reviewed on the same subject is Sara Deseran's `Asian Vegetables'. And, aside from the somewhat odd way this book has with the color photographs of vegetables, it is in almost every way a more rewarding book. It is certainly free of the many errors of fact and oddities of layout, which infest Ms. Lau's book.<br /><br />While Ms. Deseran's `Asian Vegetables' is better than the title under consideration in this review, it is still not a very weighty book. It is a typically colorful Chronicle Books issue that gives a pleasantly light treatment of its subject. If you want the straight poop with lots of details, get neither of these books and spend your money on `Bruce Cost's Asian Ingredients', which covers the full range of Asian groceries, albeit with no pretty color photographs.<br /><br />Getting back to Ms. Lau's effort published by St. Martins Griffin, I am really surprised that such a respected publishing house as St. Martins would let this get out under their imprimatur. The three most annoying problems with the book are errors in fact, the loosely assigned names given for products, and the odd arrangements of topics. The most glaring error is the statement that the Thai Bird pepper is stronger than the Habanero. I know the Thai Bird chile is hot, but last time I checked out the Scolville scale, the Habanero was still king of the roost. This entry is also an example of my second gripe in that the chile is labeled as Bird's Eye chile. While this is a confirmed name for this little red devil as checked in Jacki Passmore's `The Encyclopedia of Asian Food and Cooking', it is not the name most commonly known to western readers. Most other books refer to it as the Thai chile or the Thai Bird chile. Similar examples of weak naming are in names for `Basil' and `Eggplant'. Both are very common products in Mediterranean cuisine, yet the author does not avoid confusion by giving us a name appropriate to the Oriental product, since she makes the point that the oriental product is different from the western product. Giving aubergine as an alternate name for eggplant compounds the confusion. A linguistic conservative would argue that `aubergine', being a French / Italian name, should only be applied to eggplants grown in France and Italy, not to the distinctively different Japanese eggplants.<br /><br />Possibly the greatest annoyance in this book is the sloppy arrangement of topics. It is probably entirely too picky to complain about the fact that close to half of the vegetables discussed in the book are not greens. It is not too picky to point out that under the `Greens Guide' to green, purple, orange, brown, and red vegetables, one section is labeled `Fruit Vegetables' and it lists four melons, a gourd, and eggplant. The sense of the title is that these are fruits that are commonly counted among the vegetables, but the book gives no hint that this is the intent of the section.<br /><br />A similar annoyance is the fact that the book contains a chapter of recipes for fish, yet two major recipes in the `Side Dishes, Soups, and Salads' chapter are primarily seafood recipes. This chapter also has a `Meat and Poultry' chapter of recipes, yet the `Side Dishes...' chapter contains recipes with chicken. I have seen this before in other books, but not in books which are about such a very specific subject.<br /><br />A final annoyance in the produce naming is the fact that the author gives several synonyms for each lead English name, with no indication of the language from which these names come. This is not trivial, as whenyou are looking for a bottle gourd in a Vietnamese grocery store, you would want to know which of its seven (7) names is used in Vietnam. Another fact which makes this an important observation is that there are several excellent books on this subject which do go to the trouble of giving us the Japanese, Mandarin, Cantonese, Korean, Thai, Vietnamese, and Tagalog names for these veggies, not to mention the Latin scientific name.<br /><br />This book is a weak title in a field for which there are a surprisingly large number of better books available. Like all the other reviewers who rate the book so highly, I agree the recipes are decent, but this is simply just an average cookbook with general information on the ingredients which is below the average level of quality for books on this subject.ial, as when you are looking for a bottle gourd in a Vietnamese grocery store, you would want to know which of its seven (7) names is used in Vietnam.

341054:US	39134375	R16UYBFKQTDTFU	1568360177	336056022	Oriental Vegetables: The Complete Guide for the Gardening Cook	Books	5	35	35	N	Y	Great Source of Ingelligence on Growing and Using Veggies	`Oriental Vegetables' by English gardening writer Joy Larkcom is the real deal. For foodies like myself, the most important thing to know about the book is exactly what deal it is real. I bought it with a bunch of other books on Asian ingredients without paying attention to much about the book except for the title, being lead to it by Amazon's cleverly surfacing books related to the books you have already chose to buy. Especially do not be deceived by the very nice blurb on the cover from Alice Waters and play extra attention to the subtitle, `The Complete Guide for the Gardening Cook'.<br /><br />This book is much more about gardening than it is about cooking, and it tackles the subject of gardening very, very well. It does an exceptionally good job on detailing for us the ins and outs of growing the primary subject of the book, oriental vegetables.<br /><br />The very best news about this book is that it was published 14 years ago, just as commerce between the West and China and Indochina was warming up. This trade has had these 14 years to mature into something that makes the access to unusual seeds even easier. A corollary to this is the fact that the book also predates the blooming of the Internet, so most of the sources Ms. Larkcom gives from the UK, the United States, Canada, Australia, and Japan will probably be joined by others and be themselves more accessible.<br /><br />Ms. Larkcom began her inquiry into her subject already an expert on growing vegetables. She enhanced her credentials by making long trips to China and Japan and by enlisting the assistance of a large stable of translators. All of this linguistic help was probably even more necessary for Oriental plants, as the systematic naming of plants in China and Japan is probably far behind that in the west, plus the fact that there are simply so many different species to deal with. I have seen in other horticultural books that China is the source of far more plant species than any comparable region on the earth. Even a cursory look at Ms. Larkcom's table of contents gives weight to this observation. This lists 77 species or groups of species by  `common name'. This is substantially less than Elizabeth Schneider's approximately135 species covered in `Vegetables from Amaranth to Zucchini', but this book is limited to less than a quarter of the world's land mass while Schneider covers the entire world (as seen from western Europe).<br /><br />If you already own Bruce Cost's classic `Oriental Ingredients', you have not touched the surface of what Larkcom's book can offer. Cost gives us the culinary and economic scoop. Ms. Larkcom focuses on the horticultural.<br /><br />Ms. Larkcom's favorite subject may very well be the cabbages, as they are her first subject and she lovingly describes them as being very easy to grow in western soils and climates. In her general introduction to these brassicas, she covers climatic factors, stages of use, fitting the oriental brassicas into Western gardens, cultivation, pests and diseases, grouping the oriental brassicas, and specific hybrid brassicas. The introductory section finishes up with an excellent diagram of how oriental brassicas are related. This may do nothing to improve your salads or stir-frys, but it's great in helping to choose substitutes when one species is out of season and a related species is in full bloom.<br /><br />For each individual species, Ms. Larkcom follows Bruce Cost's practice by giving the most common English name, the biological family, the two part Latin name, other common English names, plus names in Mandarin, Cantonese, and Japanese. Even among the Mandarin and Cantonese speakers, some plants may have several different names. After this linguistic heading, there are paragraphs on background, use, characteristics, types, climate, soil, cultivation, intercropping, pests and disease, harvesting, storage, and varieties. Whew! All this information includes a culinary aspect I have simply not seen elsewhere. This is the fact that several plants go through different stages and while some stages may be commercially less desirable in western eyes, they are really quite highly prized by Oriental users.<br /><br />After Brassicas, the other major groups of plants are beans, cucurbits (gourds and melons), onions, radishes, water vegetables, tubers, and herbs and wild plants. If I were to take away one plant from this book and give it a shot at growing in my back yard, it would probably be the radishes. The rich assortment of oriental radishes is in strong contrast to the variety available in even a better than average American megamart.<br /><br />The biggest surprise I found was that ginger received a light coverage as an herb and its relative, galangal is not mentioned at all. I am certain this is because neither of these two plants is easy to grow in home gardens, and growing is what this book is all about. This reinforces the fact that for the foodie with a black thumb, this book needs a companion with a culinary focus to fill out one's picture of Oriental veggies.<br /><br />The main body of the book dealing with individual plants is supplemented with an excellent chapter on growing techniques. I am not as familiar with the soil as I am with the stove, but from what I can see, this chapter is first rate, covering techniques which you may not find in your average Better Homes and Gardens title. This is followed by a chapter on cooking which is even better than what I saw in other books on vegetables where the emphasis was more on cooking than in this horticulturally slanted book.<br /><br />The appendices to this book alone are worth the price of admission with its excellent tables of gardening terms, growing calendars, plant names, and bibliographies. While there is some danger that the references to suppliers may be out of date, I do recognize several current major players such as W. Atlee Burpee and Johnny's Selected Seeds.<br /><br />If any of this interests you, this book is for you!not seen elsewhere.

While Cost's classic book deals with the serious culinary details of a great many basic ingredients, Ms. Bladholm's book, as suggested by her title, is much more pointedly directed at the shopper's experience in your typical strip mall Oriental market.<br /><br />The author adds appeal and charm to her book by opening it with a visit to her own local mom and pop run Oriental grocery store. The store in question was just a bit better organized and stocked than my own favorite Filipino run store in southern New Jersey, but all the familiar staples were there, if not in all the familiar places.<br /><br />The device of providing a guided tour of an Asian market is reinforced by mentioning all the major brand names for staples such as rice, noodles, sauces, oils, and spice mixes, with opinions by the author of which may be the preferred brands. While I found a few misstatements, such as describing a gluten free flour as `general purpose' (general purpose flours by definition have 10% to 12% gluten producing proteins), and I missed some possible warnings against Texmati rice as a less than useful substitute for Basmati rice, I believe the advice and information in this book is a really great supplement to other books on Asian ingredients with a more scholarly bent.<br /><br />By far the biggest weakness of the book is the difference in quality between the promise of `over 400 illustrations of ingredients' and the quality of those illustrations. The illustrations in the book are all small black and white line drawings easily fitting into an inch square area with lots of the pictures giving no sense of the kind of thing they are depicting. The little picture of ginger certainly looks like the ginger with which I am familiar, but the picture of the related galangal rhizome does little to assure me that I would be able to use that picture to pick it out from bins of produce labeled in Chinese characters. These poor illustrations give the lie to the claim that this is a `Take It With You' guide, in that it is dealing with a guide to items which may all be labeled in not only a foreign language, but in a script we are simply not used to interpreting. The very clever chapter headings of Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Vietnamese, Tagalong and Korean ideograms for food categories (with English translations) do nothing to help the situation.<br /><br />Note that unlike many other books on Asian ingredients, this book has few recipes using these ingredients. This is not necessarily a weakness, as it means that almost all the space in the book is dedicated to the book's principle topic, the groceries. And, much of this space is dedicated to subjects which purely culinary books may not touch such as teas and medicinal herbs and spices. This is probably not the best book on these subjects, but treating these topics enhances the treatment of the book's primary metaphor, the Asian grocery store,, as they do, in fact, appear in Asian grocery stores. My most satisfying discovery was the appearance of classic frozen `fast foods' such as potstickers and Chinese dumplings. After our 25 pound sacks of rice, the primary reason for going to our favorite Asian market was to pick up a supply of frozen pork dumplings.<br /><br />The book also does a nice job of featuring those things that are uniquely Chinese or Japanese. The short appendix on oriental cooking methods and utensils is not too helpful. These will be of little value if your Asian store has a good selection of cooking utensils. It does not, for example, give any clues about the various styles of woks or the various materials or what makes a good wok. This is especially important, as the criteria for a good wok are almost exactly the opposite of those for a good modern sautepan.<br /><br />This book is great if you find yourself living within easy shopping distance of a good Oriental market, assuming that market covers all of east Asia and not, for example, just India and Pakistan. The book also useful if you plan to order lots of Asian groceries over the Internet, as the recommended brands gives one some assurance they are not buying sawdust. The book is less valuable for the culinary generalist, who has no special interest in Asian cuisine, especially in that the book includes no bibliography.

Buy it Now.	`Mediterranean Seafood' and `North Atlantic Seafood', both by noted culinary writer Alan Davidson, the author of `The Oxford Companion to Food' are reference books which a serious cook must have in their library where time is spent deciding on what to eat rather than time spend actually cooking. These books belong to a rare breed of books in English such as Elizabeth Schneider's `Vegetables from Amaranth to Zucchini' or `Bruce Cost's Asian Ingredients' which thoroughly cover a broad single subject or the `Larousse Gastronomique' which gives an overview of virtually every culinary subject, at least from the point of view of French cuisine.<br /><br />Both books are organized in the same way that gives primacy to information on the aquatic species and secondary coverage of recipes.<br /><br />Biological family, genus, and species organize the first part on the catalog of species in order that the biological similarity of the fishes is clearly shown. Each article gives the most common English name, the two part Latin scientific name, the scientist who assigned this name (most commonly the great inventor of biological Taxonomy, Linnaeus), the biological family name, and the common name of the fish in virtually every language of the major fishing nationality bordering the relevant body of water. The North Atlantic species, for example, are named in Portuguese, Spanish, French, Dutch, German, Polish, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, and others such as Gaelic (Irish). The Mediterranean species' names are given in French, Spanish, Greek, Italian, Tunisian, Turkish, and others such as Bulgarian, Romanian, and Russian if, for example, the species is most commonly found in the Black Sea, which is included in the coverage of the Mediterranean. These names in themselves are entertaining to the linguistically inclined, as it is interesting to see the similarities and differences from country to country. For example, even though the Turks came to Asia Minor from central Asia, most of their names for fishes are very similar to the Greek name, making a lot of sense, as a traveling people is likely to name things new to them based on the names given by the indigenous population. The articles on every species also have a highly detailed black and white drawing of each animal. The great value to these is that it makes comparing the appearance of different fishes very easy, as every species is depicted in a similar style. It is too bad they could not be depicted to scale, but this would have had the sturgeon filling two pages while the anchovies would be the size of a period. Instead, the remarks on each fish give the average market length and a description of the typical color and markings.<br /><br />The catalog entry also gives a paragraph or two on cuisine, which is a discussion of the culinary desirability of the species and typical ways in which the animal is prepared. For most fish, this includes methods by which the fish is butchered. The catalog entries also include a list of recipes and page numbers for these recipes in the second major section of the book.<br /><br />The second major section divides recipes by country. The Mediterranean volume has chapters of recipes from Spain, France, Italy, Greece, Turkey, the Black Sea, and Northern Africa. The North Atlantic volume has recipes from Portugal, Spain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Russia, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Canada, the United States, Scotland, England, Ireland, and Wales. France merits two sections, covering the southwest and the northwest. The US merits four sections, covering New England, the Middle Atlantic States, the Chesapeake, and the Carolinas and Georgia.<br /><br />Other books, such as `Fish' by Shirley King seems to have copied this scheme, but seems to be much less successful in that not enough valuable information is packed into the catalogue to make it interesting enough reading to outweigh the annoyance of doing a two step searchfor a recipe on haddock, for example. The other side of the coin is that if you live in Maryland, you are much more likely to be interested in recipes from the Chesapeake than in recipes from Maine.<br /><br />One is tempted to expect these recipes to be very generic and not as interesting as those you may find in books of `haute cuisine' from a fish specialist such as Eric Rippert. This is partially true. Davidson is less the great cook than he is a great writer on food. This means that while his recipes may come from common sources, he gives us much more information on the background of the recipes than the chef may do. Two perfect examples of this case are the recipes for bouillabaisse (French fish stew) and Maryland crab cakes. Davidson confesses to giving us something simpler than the `de luxe version', yet this simple treatment is entirely appropriate to the simple origins of the dish, before the gourmets got their hands on it. Similarly, the crab cake recipe has very few ingredients, mostly just crabmeat, seasonings, breadcrumbs, and enough egg to hold it all together.<br /><br />The supplementary information tells much about the fish cuisine of both regions. The most interesting information is on the fact that while the Mediterranean is very shallow, it has relatively little continental shelf while the North Sea is practically all shelf, suitable to the spawning of young fish in shallow water. This does much to explain the popularity of the North Atlantic cod in peninsular Italy, virtually surrounded by water.<br /><br />The bibliography shows that the author has based most of his material on local sources in native languages such as Polish, Turkish, and Portuguese. This may only help the multilingual scholar, but then it is the rare English culinary work that does this. One of the greatest things about these volumes is that all of this great material is available in trade paperbacks, which list for no more than $25.<br /><br />These are must have books for devoted foodies!ep search for a recipe on haddock, for example.

347754:US	39134375	R13AL1YATANXL6	1580084508	662373758	North Atlantic Seafood: A Comprehensive Guide with Recipes	Books	5	13	13	N	N	Great Read, Classic Recipes, Great Reference. Must Buy!	`North Atlantic Seafood' and `Mediterranean Seafood', both by noted culinary writer Alan Davidson, the author of `The Oxford Companion to Food' are reference books which a serious cook must have in their library where time is spent deciding on what to eat rather than time spend actually cooking. These books belong to a rare breed of books in English such as Elizabeth Schneider's `Vegetables from Amaranth to Zucchini' or `Bruce Cost's Asian Ingredients' which thoroughly cover a broad single subject or the `Larousse Gastronomique' which gives an overview of virtually every culinary subject, at least from the point of view of French cuisine.<br /><br />Both books are organized in the same way that gives primacy to information on the aquatic species and secondary coverage of recipes.<br /><br />Biological family, genus, and species organize the first part on the catalog of species in order that the biological similarity of the fishes is clearly shown. Each article gives the most common English name, the two part Latin scientific name, the scientist who assigned this name (most commonly the great inventor of biological Taxonomy, Linnaeus), the biological family name, and the common name of the fish in virtually every language of the major fishing nationality bordering the relevant body of water. The North Atlantic species, for example, are named in Portuguese, Spanish, French, Dutch, German, Polish, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, and others such as Gaelic (Irish). The Mediterranean species' names are given in French, Spanish, Greek, Italian, Tunisian, Turkish, and others such as Bulgarian, Romanian, and Russian if, for example, the species is most commonly found in the Black Sea, which is included in the coverage of the Mediterranean. These names in themselves are entertaining to the linguistically inclined, as it is interesting to see the similarities and differences from country to country. For example, even though the Turks came to Asia Minor from central Asia, most of their names for fishes are very similar to the Greek name, making a lot of sense, as a traveling people is likely to name things new to them based on the names given by the indigenous population. The articles on every species also have a highly detailed black and white drawing of each animal. The great value to these is that it makes comparing the appearance of different fishes very easy, as every species is depicted in a similar style. It is too bad they could not be depicted to scale, but this would have had the sturgeon filling two pages while the anchovies would be the size of a period. Instead, the remarks on each fish give the average market length and a description of the typical color and markings.<br /><br />The catalog entry also gives a paragraph or two on cuisine, which is a discussion of the culinary desirability of the species and typical ways in which the animal is prepared. For most fish, this includes methods by which the fish is butchered. The catalog entries also include a list of recipes and page numbers for these recipes in the second major section of the book.<br /><br />The second major section divides recipes by country. The Mediterranean volume has chapters of recipes from Spain, France, Italy, Greece, Turkey, the Black Sea, and Northern Africa. The North Atlantic volume has recipes from Portugal, Spain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Russia, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Canada, the United States, Scotland, England, Ireland, and Wales. France merits two sections, covering the southwest and the northwest. The US merits four sections, covering New England, the Middle Atlantic States, the Chesapeake, and the Carolinas and Georgia.<br /><br />Other books, such as `Fish' by Shirley King seems to have copied this scheme, but seems to be much less successful in that not enough valuable information is packed into the catalogue to make it interesting enough reading to outweigh the annoyance of doing a two step searchfor a recipe on haddock, for example. The other side of the coin is that if you live in Maryland, you are much more likely to be interested in recipes from the Chesapeake than in recipes from Maine.<br /><br />One is tempted to expect these recipes to be very generic and not as interesting as those you may find in books of `haute cuisine' from a fish specialist such as Eric Rippert. This is partially true. Davidson is less the great cook than he is a great writer on food. This means that while his recipes may come from common sources, he gives us much more information on the background of the recipes than the chef may do. Two perfect examples of this case are the recipes for bouillabaisse (French fish stew) and Maryland crab cakes. Davidson confesses to giving us something simpler than the `de luxe version', yet this simple treatment is entirely appropriate to the simple origins of the dish, before the gourmets got their hands on it.

349180:US	39134375	R257MNLDQRTRCI	0060914378	475714794	The Hungarian Cookbook	Books	5	32	32	N	N	Excellent Presentation of Distinctive National Cuisine	`The Hungarian Cookbook' by Susan Derecskey may be one of the easiest cookbooks I have yet reviewed, as this is quite literally exactly the food I grew up on. My comfort food, as a kid, was goulash, dumplings, Hungarian crepes, strudel, cabbage and noodles, and chocolate walnut cake, each and every one of these dishes made in exactly the same way as described in this book. All of these dishes came to by from my paternal grandmother who emigrated to the United States just before World War I, from a small town in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, forty miles east of Vienna, which is now in Hungary. From this background, I can say with certainty that this is an exceptionally good evocation of Hungarian cuisine.<br /><br />This is also an exceptionally good evocation of a national cuisine in general, even when compared to some of the leading treatments I have seen recently of the cuisines of Turkey, Lebanon, Germany, and Armenia. It is also as good as many treatments of French and Italian regional cuisines, although it may not be quite as good as the best of these, and it is certainly not as good as Paula Wolfert's classic work on Moroccan cuisine. It is also just a bit less than the classics on national cuisines such as Diana Kochilas on Greece or Penelope Casas on Spain. But, it is exactly all you need to recreate the great Hungarian dishes I remember from my childhood.<br /><br />Aside from finding recipes for my long lost chocolate nut birthday cake, the first thing which impressed me about the book was the care in which the author pointed out that some recipes were simply difficult to get right the first time. This fact is probably obvious for strudel dough, but it is less obvious with recipes for potato dumplings.<br /><br />For those of you who may be totally ignorant of Hungarian cooking, its most distinctive characteristics are noodles, dumplings, and soup. Egg noodles and dumplings essentially serve for Hungarians the role of pasta and risotto has for Italians. This is really carb central in that in addition to the white flour, potatoes are also an important ingredient for many dumpling recipes. And, these dumplings are real gut grenades. They are guaranteed to spike your blood sugar in record time.<br /><br />Since soup is such an important part of the Hungarian cuisine, I paid special attention to the recipes for stock in Ms. Derecskey's book and found them entirely to my liking. They are not long cooking, the vegetables are put into the simmering stock for just an hour, and the author is more careful than most in advising the cook to be very careful not to boil the stock and to skim off scum as quickly as it appears. I usually don't see as much care given to stock making in books on `minor' national cuisines.<br /><br />Vegetable dishes are always a special interest of mine and this book has several especially good ones. Like most of central Europe, the king of the vegetables was the cabbage. There are several good asparagus and beet and cucumber recipes, but no sign of artichokes or rapini. This is cabbage country, partner. I was also more than modestly pleased with the recipes for salads. I never associated salads with Mitteleuropa, but there they are. Very nice vinaigrette recipes to be sure.<br /><br />The only thing that puzzled me about the book and its recipes was the author's stating that Hungarians were not especially fond of mature beef. They preferred to cook veal, including braises and stews, which almost seems like a waste when you can let the cow mature a bit and get much more meat for stewing.<br /><br />While Hungary does not have the great pastry tradition of its neighbor much did rub off while the two countries were joined at the hip up to 1918 under the Hapsburgs in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In fact, Budapest was the empire's second city ahead of even Prague in esteem. The star of the Hungarian pastry is strudel, which has a lot of similarities with Greek filo, but it is not exactly the same. I have tried to make strudel with filo and the results are less than perfect.<br /><br />If you have any Hungarian in your blood, you really need this book. If you are simply interested in reading of world cuisines, this one is a winner. The instructions on making strudel and dumplings alone are worth the price of admission.<br /><br />Highly recommended.same.

Must Buy!	`Classical Turkish Cooking' by Ayla Algar is a great exemplar of what a cookbook describing an important national cuisine should be, if there are few or no other books on the subject in English. At the outset, it is important to point out that the author makes an excellent case for the historical fact that Turkish cuisine, based on a long history of cuisine from the Ottoman empire, which inherited much from the equally important Persian / Iranian cuisine, is a truly interesting food culture, distinctive in enough different ways from the general Eastern Mediterranean milieu to make it worthy of study and emulation.<br /><br />The Turkish / Ottoman cuisine is in every way a confirmation of the thesis stated most firmly by Paula Wolfert in `Cous Cous and Other Good Food from Morocco' that one of the four requirements for the creation of an important, interesting cuisine is the presence of a sizable nobility and wealthy court in which chefs are well paid to create interesting dishes for the court and for entertaining diplomats to the court. Conspicuous consumption was not invented in the United States. Ms. Algar does us a great service by presenting a very nice thumbnail sketch of the history of the Turkish people who migrated to Asia Minor from central Asia and, on the way, picked up lots of culinary influences from the Iranians in the centuries following the rise of Islam throughout central Asia and the Middle East. Happily, unlike several other historical sketches I have seen recently in books on purportedly important cuisines, Ms. Algar ties her story in with actual culinary information, including linguistic and historical evidence for the origins of many different culinary trends in Turkey. I will not pretend to recount all of this. It is important, however, for your appreciation of this book to realize that this cuisine, and the material in this book reflects food influenced by the full range of the Ottoman empire which, at its peak, stretched from the gates of Vienna to the bottom of the Basra on the Persian Gulf to the outskirts of Fez in Morocco.<br /><br />The book is subtitled `Traditional Turkish Food for the American Kitchen', however, I do not see a lot of effort devoted to making the recipes friendly to amateur American cooks. In many ways, this may be a good thing in that the author does not loose the `traditional Turkish' of the recipes in deference to what may be easy for the average American household. If it did, it would be much less valuable in our collection of books about traditional cuisines.<br /><br />Turkish cuisine shares much with the other cuisines of the Eastern Mediterranean. There is an especially strong family resemblance between Greek and Turkish recipes, and it is in no way clear in which direction the influence was strongest. While the Greek cuisine is older, it was also heavily influenced by Persian and Phoenician sources, so it is easy to believe that the central role of lamb, yoghurt, sesame, citrus, flatbreads, and very thin pastries all came from some common central Asian source. What is surprising is that while the Christian Greek culture not only allows, but actually encourages a wine culture and the Islamic Turkish culture disallowed wine, both cultures shared a devotion to `meze'. In fact, Ms. Algar traces the origins of meze to the pre-Islamic wine culture of Persia, where the original meze were sweets to counteract the bitter taste of young wine.<br /><br />While Turkish meze are interesting, the real star of the Turkish cuisine is Borek, a dish which is a cross between filo dough and a baked pasta dish such as lasagna. Ms. Algar gives not just one recipe for Borek, but at least a half dozen from different areas of Turkey. For some of the recipes, Ms. Algar allows the use of either filo dough or frozen puff pastry, but for her two most important recipes for Anatolian and Circassian Borek, Ms. Algar gives us the straight scoop on how to make the real deal, very thin Borek dough similar to fresh egg noodles of northern Italy, but so thin that even a pasta machine set on it's smallest opening will not give you a fine enough dough. And yet, at 1 millimeter thick, it is not yet as thin as filo. So, while it belongs to the same family as Greek pilo and Hungarian strudel, it is not the same. Like fresh pasta in general, it is used to create many different dishes which are baked, fried, or sauteed, depending on filling and shape.<br /><br />It is no surprise to the reasonably well informed foodie that coffee was a very important part of Turkish culture and cuisine and that coffee culture spread throughout Europe from its center in Istanbul. It is just slightly more surprising that the Turks invented the notion of the caf&eacute;. I take this with a small grain of salt, as I have read of fast food / wine bars in the ruins of Pompeii. What the Turks invented, I suspect, is the shop specializing in the sale of coffee, thereby originating the word `caf&eacute;'. Thus the idea of the casual food store goes back at least to Imperial Rome. It probably goes back to food stands serving the farm workers spending their flood induced vacations working on the pyramids.<br /><br />Probably the biggest surprise was the fact that flavored sherberts, sorbets, and ices were such a common item in Ottoman courts. We are always so inclined to attribute these to the Italians, yet the Turks seem to have gotten this idea quite on their own, with the resources it took to store ice from the winter or from local mountaintops for a quick summer refreshment.<br /><br />This is an excellent book and a welcome addition to the collection of anyone who loves to read about world food. It is also a superb source of dishes with healthy ingredients such as nuts, yoghurt, sesame, fruits, and light breads.h similar to fresh egg noodles of northern Italy, but so thin that even a pasta machine set on it's smallest opening will not give you a fine enough dough.

Weak on cooking technique	`Lebanese Cuisine' By Lebanese / British culinary author Annisa Helau, author of the more recent and more widely popular `Mediterranean Street Food' is a good, if somewhat flawed presentation of an important cuisine of , in the author's emphasis, the `true' middle east.<br /><br />For starters, this book is much better than some works on local cuisines of, say, Poland, Hungary, the Philippines, and Latvia which were written twenty to fifty years ago and may still be lurking on the shelves of your library in rebound, dusty editions with nothing more than one skimpily described recipe after another. One of the benefits of the renewed interest in traditional food is that the bar has been raised for writing about all ethnic cuisines, primarily by the very important works on Italian regional cuisine and works on African and Middle Eastern cooking by Paula Wolfert and Claudia Roden. And, while Ms. Helou obviously has an enormous amount of respect for Ms. Roden's important `The New Book of Middle Eastern Food', Ms. Helou takes issue with Ms. Roden on including Egypt, properly part of Africa rather than being in western Asia, the `true' middle east.<br /><br />Ms. Annisa Helou begins her book with a brief but nice outline of Lebanese history. The land began as the home of the Biblical Canaanites, who became the great merchants and alphabet inventors, the Phoenicians. Since then, they have been the proverbial welcome mat over which walked the Egyptians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Turks, and French. With all these landlords, the conclusion is that the Lebanese cuisine is one of the most interesting in the region. The cover, in fact, proclaims this as `250 recipes from the most elegant Middle Eastern cuisine'. I confess that it may be one of the most varied, but the degree to which hands are required as cooking and eating utensils tends to keep me from enlisting in this idea. And, while the author claims that the recent 25 year French protectorate of Lebanon laid the typically immense imprint of French cuisine on Lebanese cooking, I cannot easily see if from the recipes in this book. It seems to have much more in common with its Arab neighbors, including Egypt, than with the land of Escoffier.<br /><br />On reading the first three chapters on `hors d'oeuvres', salads, and soups, I began to think there was simply nothing special going on here. So many things seemed like variations on Italian and Greek dishes such as the bread and tomato salads so reminiscent of panzanella. Things started picking up in the chapter on savory pastries. While any pop food commentator worth his salt will point out that stuffed dough dumplings are found the world around, the fact that we find them in an important niche of Lebanese cuisine is very interesting and a good source of recipes worthy of an earnest foodie conversation. In Lebanon, the roles of Ricotta and pork of Italy are taken by yogurt and lamb. While the author points out that until recently, the majority of the population of Lebanon has been Christian and not Arab or Jewish, there are very few recipes in this book, which include pork. In the index, I count only two, while I count 29 references to lamb, some with occurrences on many different pages.<br /><br />Then, I got to the chapter on eggs, and I began finding a few genuinely distinctive dishes. Here, I found a style of omelet which is genuinely different from French or Italian models. It is a saut&eacute;ed egg mixture done in such a fashion that you can easily make several servings in a single pan, in very much the same way as you may make pancakes or English muffins on a griddle. The novelty of this dish is doubly interesting as it makes use of a really unusual ingredient, the liquid squeezed from the pulp in the middle of a zucchini. Most of the other egg dishes are pretty standard combinations of European style scrambled eggs with Middle Eastern ingredients. Be prepared to bone up on your egg technique beforetrying these recipes, as there is no good instruction on how to achieve light, uncolored cooked eggs.<br /><br />The real star of Lebanese cuisine appears to be `kibbe' Anglicized from `Kibbeh', which may easily be to Lebanon what pasta is to Italy and cous cous is to Morocco. Like both of these dishes, it is characterized by an extreme simplicity of ingredients, using only bulgar, chopped onion, and lamb, combined in a great variety of ways, with a great variety of sauces and accouterments. An entire chapter is devoted to the subject, but Kibbe dishes pop up in other chapters, just as pasta shows up in soup, salad, and appetizer recipes. Kibbe is baked, saut&eacute;ed, and braised in balls, cylinders, and circles the size of piecrusts.<br /><br />After Kibbe, we are back in familiar territory with a chapter on Kafta, the proper Lebanese name for shish kebabs. Next are stuffed vegetables, which seems to be at least as important to Lebanese cuisine as it is to both Italy and my central European ancestors from the banks of the Danube.<br /><br />The book also covers the classic breads of Lebanon such as pita, although advance knowledge of bread baking and yeast may be needed to work through the recipes.<br /><br />Other than a family interest in Lebanese tradition, the primary reason to check out this book would be for the rich source of healthy recipes including bulgar wheat, yogurt, nuts, lean meat, and fruits and vegetables. The writing and editing is not that of a scholar. There are many word usages which are simply the result of the author's less than perfect grasp of English and there is disorganization's in parts of the book which detract from a careful study of the volume.<br /><br />But, this is still a very worthwhile coverage of a truly interesting and rewarding cuisine.e trying these recipes, as there is no good instruction on how to achieve light, uncolored cooked eggs. <br /> <br />The real star of Lebanese cuisine appears to be `kibbe' Anglicized from `Kibbeh', which may easily be to Lebanon what pasta is to Italy and cous cous is to Morocco.

This one wins!	`The German Cookbook' by Mimi Sheraton and `The New German Cookbook' by Jean Anderson and Hedy Wurz are both written by leading American culinary writers. Although their publication dates are separated by thirty years, Ms. Sheraton's earlier book has been brought up to date at almost exactly the same time the newer book was published by Ms. Anderson and her co-author.<br /><br />The raw numbers put Ms. Anderson at about 390 pages of recipes for a list price of $30 and Ms. Sheraton at about 500 pages of recipes for a list price of $35. Ms. Anderson includes an excellent bibliography of both English and German sources, including a reference to Ms. Sheraton's book. Ms. Sheraton has no bibliography, but includes the excellent feature of an English and a German index. Ms. Anderson includes a very nice glossary of German culinary terms. Ms. Sheraton's list of terms is much shorter, at the end of a short chapter on cooking utensils, which looks almost identical to such a section you would find in a good book on French recipes. In fact, it has a lot of similarities to a much more complete section in Julia Child's landmark `Mastering the Art of French Cooking' which appeared just a few years before Ms. Sheraton's book. While my primary objective is to compare the two German books, I will say at this point that neither comes close to matching the quality of Ms. Child's classic.<br /><br />Ms. Sheraton, with the longer book, is claiming to be a complete guide to mastering authentic German cooking while Ms. Anderson specifically aims her book at `new' German cooking and avoids any claim to being a survey of all German cuisine (Ms. Sheraton does say, here and there, that there are some typical recipes which are simply so starchy and plain that she thinks they will be of no interest to American cooks, so she leaves them out). A quick look at the first few chapters confirms this assessment. In appetizers, Ms. Sheraton has 18 recipes while Ms. Anderson has but 10. In the next chapter on soups, Ms. Sheraton has 38 recipes while Ms. Anderson has but 25. And, Ms. Sheraton follows her soup chapter with a chapter on soup garnishes.<br /><br />Which of these two books one may wish to buy has a lot to do with what you want from a `German cookbook'. I happen to be from a German and Pennsylvania German background, so I am looking for a wide variety of recipes for classic German and Austrian dishes. For this, I certainly prefer Ms. Sheraton's more complete coverage. I think the most typical buyer may be interested in a few famous German / Austrian recipes such as Sauerbraten, Sauerkraut, Spatzle, Wiener Schnitzel, Sausage dishes, and Strudel (It is entirely coincidental that all of these dishes start with an `S'). A comparison of all these dishes in both books shows that in every case, not only does Ms. Sheraton have more recipes, her recipes are also more complete.<br /><br />One place where this is most dramatic is in the recipes for strudel. Ms. Anderson gives but one recipe for strudel, calling it a `Bavarian Strudel', and accurately stating that it is less like the classic Austro-Hungarian dish than like a cobbler. And, rather than giving a homemade recipe for the dough, Ms. Anderson's recipe uses frozen filo dough. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this, as long as you are not buying her book to get a good classic strudel dough recipe. Ms. Sheraton does give us a full recipe for the classic Austrian strudel dough plus recipes for apple, cheese, cherry, plum, poppy seed, rhubarb, and Tyrolean strudel. Everything but cabbage strudel (however, there is a sauerkraut strudel recipe under sauerkraut recipes)! With sausage dishes, the picture is similar. Ms. Anderson has but three sausage dishes while Ms. Sheraton gives us ten.<br /><br />Ms. Sheraton's recipes do tend to be just a bit more concise than those in Ms. Anderson's book. This is understandable since Ms. Sheraton says at the outset that her book assumes you know your way around the kitchen and know in practical terms, the difference between blanch and poach, for example. And yet, with very important recipes such as with sauerbraten and spatzle, two dishes which require considerably more than the average amount of technique, Ms. Sheraton's recipes are more descriptive than those from Ms. Anderson.<br /><br />It is entirely appropriate that Ms. Anderson's co-author is a German travel writer, as one of the things in `The New German Cookbook' which is missing from `The German Cookbook' are sidebar stories describing the origins of most recipes.<br /><br />The bottom line for all of this for Ms. Anderson's book is that it is very similar to a cookbook of recipes from a popular modern German restaurant. And, restaurant cookbooks are bought primarily to supply the reader with new ways of doing classic dishes and cute stories of how the executive chef came by the recipes. The main difference is that unlike recipes from great French and Italian restaurants, the recipes in Anderson's book are primarily simplified versions of the classics rather than fancy new twists.<br /><br />Really want good recipes from the authentic, traditional German cuisine, get Ms. Sheraton's book. If you are so devoted to German recipes that Sheraton's book simply does not supply enough variety, get both books.

This one is weaker.	`The New German Cookbook' by Jean Anderson and Hedy Wurz and `The German Cookbook' by Mimi Sheraton are both written by leading American culinary writers. Although their publication dates are separated by thirty years, Ms. Sheraton's earlier book has been brought up to date at almost exactly the same time the newer book was published by Ms. Anderson and her co-author.<br /><br />The raw numbers put Ms. Anderson at about 390 pages of recipes for a list price of $30 and Ms. Sheraton at about 500 pages of recipes for a list price of $35. Ms. Anderson includes an excellent bibliography of both English and German sources, including a reference to Ms. Sheraton's book. Ms. Sheraton has no bibliography, but includes the excellent feature of an English and a German index. Ms. Anderson includes a very nice glossary of German culinary terms. Ms. Sheraton's list of terms is much shorter, at the end of a short chapter on cooking utensils, which looks almost identical to such a section you would find in a good book on French recipes. In fact, it has a lot of similarities to a much more complete section in Julia Child's landmark `Mastering the Art of French Cooking' which appeared just a few years before Ms. Sheraton's book. While my primary objective is to compare the two German books, I will say at this point that neither comes close to matching the quality of Ms. Child's classic.<br /><br />Ms. Sheraton, with the longer book, is claiming to be a complete guide to mastering authentic German cooking while Ms. Anderson specifically aims her book at `new' German cooking and avoids any claim to being a survey of all German cuisine (Ms. Sheraton does say, here and there, that there are some typical recipes which are simply so starchy and plain that she thinks they will be of no interest to American cooks, so she leaves them out). A quick look at the first few chapters confirms this assessment. In appetizers, Ms. Sheraton has 18 recipes while Ms. Anderson has but 10. In the next chapter on soups, Ms. Sheraton has 38 recipes while Ms. Anderson has but 25. And, Ms. Sheraton follows her soup chapter with a chapter on soup garnishes.<br /><br />Which of these two books one may wish to buy has a lot to do with what you want from a `German cookbook'. I happen to be from a German and Pennsylvania German background, so I am looking for a wide variety of recipes for classic German and Austrian dishes. For this, I certainly prefer Ms. Sheraton's more complete coverage. I think the most typical buyer may be interested in a few famous German / Austrian recipes such as Sauerbraten, Sauerkraut, Spatzle, Wiener Schnitzel, Sausage dishes, and Strudel (It is entirely coincidental that all of these dishes start with an `S'). A comparison of all these dishes in both books shows that in every case, not only does Ms. Sheraton have more recipes, her recipes are also more complete.<br /><br />One place where this is most dramatic is in the recipes for strudel. Ms. Anderson gives but one recipe for strudel, calling it a `Bavarian Strudel', and accurately stating that it is less like the classic Austro-Hungarian dish than like a cobbler. And, rather than giving a homemade recipe for the dough, Ms. Anderson's recipe uses frozen filo dough. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this, as long as you are not buying her book to get a good classic strudel dough recipe. Ms. Sheraton does give us a full recipe for the classic Austrian strudel dough plus recipes for apple, cheese, cherry, plum, poppy seed, rhubarb, and Tyrolean strudel. Everything but cabbage strudel (however, there is a sauerkraut strudel recipe under sauerkraut recipes)! With sausage dishes, the picture is similar. Ms. Anderson has but three sausage dishes while Ms. Sheraton gives us ten.<br /><br />Ms. Sheraton's recipes do tend to be just a bit more concise than those in Ms. Anderson's book. This is understandable since Ms. Sheraton says at the outset that her book assumes you know your way around the kitchen and know in practical terms, the difference between blanch and poach, for example. And yet, with very important recipes such as with sauerbraten and spatzle, two dishes which require considerably more than the average amount of technique, Ms. Sheraton's recipes are more descriptive than those from Ms. Anderson.<br /><br />It is entirely appropriate that Ms. Anderson's co-author is a German travel writer, as one of the things in `The New German Cookbook' which is missing from `The German Cookbook' are sidebar stories describing the origins of most recipes.<br /><br />The bottom line for all of this for Ms. Anderson's book is that it is very similar to a cookbook of recipes from a popular modern German restaurant.

This is the loser.	`The Philippine Cookbook' by Reynaldo Alejandro  is the old standard on Filipino cooking. It has been out for about 22 years. `Filipino Cuisine' by Gerry G. Gelle is a new title that should replace the older book in the hearts and minds of Filipino cooks.<br /><br />Ten years ago, when I was looking for a book of Filipino recipes, Alejandro's book was virtually the only volume available, even making it a reference on Filipino cuisine to such major culinary writers as Raymond Sokolov in his important book `The Cook's Canon'. Gelle's book improves on Alejandro's book in almost every regard, most especially where it counts in the description of the recipes.<br /><br />Even the most cursory look at these two books will suggest that Gelle's volume is the better book. A look at the two authors' biographical sketches confirms that initial impression, as Gelle is a full time professional chef while Alejandro seems to be a jack of all trades, doing as much in dramatics and dancing as in writing and cooking.<br /><br />Both books give very informative introductions on the origins of Filipino cuisine. Both, for example, point out that the Spanish influence is less direct than an influence by way of Mexico, since the Spanish governors in Mexico were much closer to the islands than was the court in Madrid. Gelle's introductory chapter seems much more timely, however, in that influences and native foods are discussed by region, in much the same way one has come to expect in descriptions of great Chinese, Japanese, French, and Italian cuisines.<br /><br />While Alejandro's book may have been the best there was 10 years ago, it now has the appearance of a very journeymanlike effort, much like so many inexpensive books of recipes from Latvia, Rumania, Hungary, or Poland. Because, 20 years ago, a simple list of recipes was all you needed to create a credible book on a national cuisine. The book does include some nice extras such as a glossary of Filipino culinary terms and a list of sources. Unfortunately, as almost all these sources are small strip mall stores like the one I used to visit to get my 25 pound sacks of rice and my lumpia wrappers and my mung beans, most of them are probably now out of business.<br /><br />The bottom line is that Gelle really has the better recipes, and it is this fact which makes his book worth the extra cost and time it may take to find a copy.<br /><br />Oddly, Alejandro's recipes for adobo, for example are much closer to the way my adopted Filipino family actually cooked adobo, and the way I learned to cook it. Gelle's recipe, however, is quite evidently much closer to how leading native Filipino chefs cook adobo, especially since his recipe for chicken and pork adobo agrees with the recipe in the very authoritative `Bruce Cost's Asian Ingredients'. For starters, Alejandro says nothing about marinading the meats overnight in the soy and vinegar liquid, yet it is evident that this brings the recipe much closer to its Mexican roots. Gelle is also alone in citing that the vinegar in these dishes is not any garden variety Heinz product, but `sukang paombong', a native Philippine vinegar.<br /><br />Another symptom of the superiority of Gelle's recipes is in the comparison of the way the two authors deal with the classic Spanish empanada. While Alejandro gives a very simple filling of ground beef, potatoes, and raisins, Gelle's filling includes carrots, chicken, pork, hard-boiled eggs, and sweet pickle. The recipes for the dough are different, and I would be hard pressed to prefer one to the other. Alejandro's recipe is slightly simpler, in that it uses one egg yolk per cup of flour for fat. Gelle uses egg yolks and butter for the fat in his recipes. The only way I can adjudicate between the two is that Gelle's recipe is much closer to the classic Spanish recipe, as presented by Penelope Casas in `The Foods and Wines of Spain'. So, in the light of other evidence of greater fidelity to his sources, I am inclined tobelieve Gelle's recipe is closer to the way this dish is done in Manila. In any case, Gelle's description of the procedure for making empanadas is much more detailed than in Alejandro's book, and Gelle gives alternate procedures for deep-frying or baking the empanadas. Gelle also gives recommendations on how long uncooked empanadas can be held in the freezer.<br /><br />A third evidence of Gelle's superior recipes is in a comparison of their recipes for spring roll (lumpia) wrappers. Alejandro gives a quick simple three ingredient recipe while Gelle gives two different recipes, both of which are much richer and more detailed in presentation than Alejandro's book.<br /><br />Only in the number of pancit recipes does Alejandro give us more than Gelle. Also, Alejandro's recipes for pancit seem just a bit more interesting, as in his recipe for my favorite Pancit Luglug which has something of a French air about it in that it creates a broth from shrimp shells to add to the sauce while Gelle relies on canned cream of mushroom soup to finish off the sauce.<br /><br />If you are really fond of Filipino cooking, you may want both books, but you will certainly be better off with more accurate, more detailed, and more interesting recipes if you have only Gelle's book.m inclined to believe Gelle's recipe is closer to the way this dish is done in Manila.

356899:US	39134375	R1NVS1U9FURIBP	0060195967	82078043	Mediterranean Street Food	Books	5	15	17	N	N	Delightful Culinary Travelogue and Entertain. Resource	`Mediterranean Street Food' by Lebanese culinary writer Anissa Helou is an example of my second most favorite type of cookbook (first being good single dish or single ingredient books on things such as soups, casseroles, potatoes, or eggs) in that it gives us recipes which all fit into an excellent theme of dishes for entertaining, while being both informative and entertaining while discussing its subject. Other great titles in this vein are Joyce Goldstein's `Enoteca' (Italian wine bar cuisine) and Ellen Leong Blonder's `Dim Sum' on the famous Chinese (primarily Cantonese) `tea lunch' cuisine so well transplanted to San Francisco and other American Chinatowns.<br /><br />The first thing which recommends Ms. Helou's book is that while it presents something from virtually all the great cuisines of the Mediterranean, there is a relatively small space devoted to dishes from Spain, southern France, and Italy. Even though Italy is the 900 pound gorilla of Mediterranean cuisine, it doesn't contribute much to this book because the author is much more familiar with the food of the Levant and North Africa and Italy, France, and Spain have such great restaurant traditions, there is little true street food to be found in these countries. One byproduct of this fact is that this book teaches us a new word for Italian eatery to join the lexicon of restaurante, trattoria, osteria, and enoteca. This is a friggitorie or `fry shop' which may be indoors, but traditionally serves people at a counter at which they stand to eat. From Italy, most of Ms. Helou's examples seem to come from either Liguria (Genoa) or Sicily. But, far more of the dishes come from the Arab and Berber influenced part of the Mediterranean.<br /><br />The first relatively short chapter is on soups. This is no surprise, as soup dispensing and eating requires a lot more equipment and involvement than a snack you can hold in your hand. The most instructive aspect of these five recipes is that a lot of this street food seems to be based on cheap ingredients, either on beans or animal parts such as tripe which are but a step from being discarded offal. The exception that proves the rule is the snail soup based on a Mediterranean delicacy.<br /><br />The second, much longer chapter is on `Snacks, Salads, and Dips'. This chapter has a lot of old favorites such as the Spanish potato omelet (tortilla), the Italian spinach omelet (frittata), Italian vegetable meatloaf (polpettone), salads with feta, cabbage, beans, and eggplant, plus lots and lots of fried foods and dips. Frying, grilling, and breads seem to be the most common styles of street food, which seems odd to Americans, where the most common street food is steamed hot dogs.<br /><br />Breads, including pizzas and flatbreads is the next, second longest chapter. This may be the most interesting chapter in the book, as once you remove the pizza and foccacia recipes, you are left with a great source of breads from North Africa, the Levant, and Asia Minor (Turkey). By far the most familiar of these is the pita, but there are many others.<br /><br />Now that we have done breads, the next chapter is on sandwiches, which in most cases are more like Greek wraps than Italian paninis. By far the most unusual recipe in this chapter is for two variations on a `French Fries' sandwich. The author identifies the origin of this `delicacy' to Tripoli, but states that it is actually much easier to find in Paris now than in Northern Africa. What will those crazy French eat next? For Americans, the most interesting recipes may be for lamb and chicken `shawarma'. It took a bit of careful reading and attention to the pictures to discover that this is the Lebanese version of a very popular Greek dish called souvlaki, and often in Greek-American restaurants called gyros. What makes these recipes interesting is that they do not require the great vertical rotating skewer and heat source.<br /><br />The next chapter is on `barbecues', but, as so many people do, these are not true American barbecue using smoke and slow cooking, they are really grilling recipes, primarily kebabs, brochettes, and kefta (highly seasoned balls of meat skewered and grilled like a kebab).<br /><br />Next is another major category, one pot meals, which has a lot of fairly familiar recipes such as baked pasta, stewed lamb, couscous, and paella.<br /><br />The last chapter is on `Sweets and Desserts'. Most of the recipes involve a whole lot more sugar than the classic Italian desserts. Here we have puddings, syrups, compotes, pancakes, clotted cream, cakes, pies, fritters, shortbread, cookies, granitas and ice creams.<br /><br />Another novelty discovered in this book is the fact that the Tunisians have a habit of naming things in totally inappropriate ways when compared to dishes using these names from other parts of the Mediterranean. The Tunisian tagine is not the same as the famous Moroccan stew; it is a `cross between a quiche and a tortilla, thicker and denser than either'. What makes this interesting rather than confusing is the fact that our good author always gives both the native name of the dish and a clear English translation. The only times this scheme is less than ideal is when some Italian and Spanish dishes are given an English name of omelet, when almost all readers of this book will know the name frittata and tortilla, and consider the name `omelet', a distinctly French dish with an equally distinct technique, to be a misnomer. But then, not everyone is as finicky about words as I am, so I'm sure everyone will survive to enjoy this delightfully written book.<br /><br />Recommended for entertaining to a street food theme as a means to broaden your culinary horizons.ople do, these are not true American barbecue using smoke and slow cooking, they are really grilling recipes, primarily kebabs, brochettes, and kefta (highly seasoned balls of meat skewered and grilled like a kebab).<br /><br />Next is another major category, one pot meals, which has a lot of fairly familiar recipes such as baked pasta, stewed lamb, couscous, and paella.<br /><br />The last chapter is on `Sweets and Desserts'.

And, unlike a similar collection of `healthy' recipes from the Mediterranean, most of these recipes have exotic tastes of ginger, fish sauces, tamarind, Kaffir lime, lemongrass added to the strong but familiar tastes of garlic and chilis. All this is backed by the strong assurance arising from the Alfred A. Knopf cookbook publishing team, headed by the renowned culinary editor, Judith Jones, the midwife of great cookbooks from Julia Child, Marcella Hazan, and Lydia Bastianich.<br /><br />All this means is that the book is very attractive to look at and enjoyable to read. It also means that the selection of recipes is a lot broader than you may find in the average healthy eating cookbook. They all shout exceptions to the playful quote from New Yorker food writer, Calvin Trillin who says `Health Food makes me sick.'. I confess that I often find myself agreeing with Herr Trillin on this point, as I do with most of his observations.<br /><br />The chapters in this book are:<br /><br />`Something to graze on' with recipes for snacks plus lots of advice on the belief that eating little but often is a very good idea. Recipes include soybeans, vegetables and dips, pickled carrots and glazed onions.<br /><br />`Appetizers that make a meal' gives grilled shrimp, turkey sate, vegetarian dumplings, spinach pie, pot stickers, vegetarian samosas, spinach salad, a mushroom frittata, salmon sushi and pork in lettuce wraps.<br /><br />`Homey Soups' gives a very accurate Chinese chicken broth, miso soup, Cantonese corn chowder, onion and garlic soup, tomato soup, Vietnamese Hot and Sour Scallop Soup, and Indian Seafood Chowder.<br /><br />`Hearty Stews and Braises' has a nice mix of both Mediterranean and Asian chicken, seafood, lamb, turkey, and beef braises. French technique is foremost here, as braising is such a distinctively European technique.<br /><br />`Main Dish Salads' gives us traditional recipes such as Salade Nicoise and slaws, plus a lot of combined grilled meat and vegetable combinations.<br /><br />`Pleasures from the Garden' has lots of vegetable dishes using roasting, pickling, steaming, stir-frying, grilling, and raw food combinations.<br /><br />`Versatile stir-fries and sautes' includes classics such as Kung Pao Chicken, Pork Lo Mein, and Pad Thai plus stir-frys of greens, beans, mushrooms, beet and peppers, shrimp, salmon, and scallops and asparagus<br /><br />`East-West Barbecue' is not all about true barbecue recipes, but about smoked and grilled dishes, plus marinades, rubs, and dishes you would eat with classic barbecue such as salsas and wraps.<br /><br />`Irresistible vegetarian' gives recipes that are commonly seen as vegetarian substitutes for mean and other animal protein. It features beans, tempeh, tofu, miso, and noodles.<br /><br />`Satisfying stapes: noodles, rice, and other grains' gives, recipes for rice, noodles and other grains plus barbecued pork, Vietnamese Rainbow salad, couscous, and Kung Pao scallops over noodles.<br /><br />`Light and sumptuous sweets' strikes me as the rewards for eating healthy dishes for most of the day. The molasses spice cookies, for example have every bit as much sugar as a recipe from Maida Heatter. It's only bow to good health is a substitution of corn oil for butter for most of the fat, although butter is still present, albeit in a reduced role.<br /><br />Most recipes include some marginalia on the healthful benefits of a main ingredient such as yogurt, ginger, cucumbers, green beans, and the like. You get the idea. These littletips fit the `buffet' treatment of healthy eating advice. You can read and take counsel from these tips, or ignore them and just cook the recipes. Each chapter also ends with a little essay by one or more advocates of various doctrines of healthy eating. Some have a scientific basis and some represent traditional doctrines that are a based more on folklore than on science.<br /><br />Unfortunately, scientific method does not work well with holistic medicine. Science, even with the extremely powerful computers and multivariate statistical models available today, simply cannot easily formulate or address `big questions' such as all the elements that contribute to healthy living. What science can do is demonstrate the value of vitamins, exercise, and omega-3 fatty acids and the hazards of smoking, obesity, and eating too much refined sugar. A perfect example of the effects of science's tunnel vision is the shifts in the reputation of eggs and butter in one's diet.<br /><br />Equally unfortunately, the folklore-based bodies of holistic wisdom may endorse foods and activities that are as much influenced by myth as by observation of talented primitive natural scientists. The doctrines of macrobiotics, I believe, have been shown to overlook some important health issues. Fortunately for the value of this book, the author samples lots of different opinions, with the scientific point of view being represented by holistic advocates such as Raymond Weil and the folklore camp being represented by, for example, Indian holistic doctrines of Ayurveda, which seem to be based almost entirely on common sense.<br /><br />One great virtue of the book is that it is like a walk through a health conference gallery of vendors hawking their particular brand of advice. If one catches your attention, you can check them out in more detail by finding their works in the bibliography.<br /><br />The main drawback of this approach is that the organization of recipes is not as clean as you may like in a good `ready reference' cookbook. Salads and grilled dishes appear in many different chapters and several pairs of dishes in two different chapters seem to overlap one another a bit too much.<br /><br />I still recommend this book, as this is as painless a way I have seen for learning new ideas and inspirations for good living.tips fit the `buffet' treatment of healthy eating advice.

360267:US	39134375	R1QYTWMWF9SQEE	1592285651	519584892	Soup for Every Body: Low-Carb, High-Protein, Vegetarian, and More	Books	4	20	38	N	N	Good Soups. Only Fair Presentation for Healthy Use	`Soup for Every Body' by Joanna Pruess, with culinary coauthority from Lauren Braun RD, LD is a very nice little soup book that specializes in recipes that cater to five different dietary doctrines. These are `Low Carb', `High Protein', `Smart Fat', `Low Calorie', and `Vegetarian or Vegan'. While I have not read or reviewed any of Ms. Pruess' other works, her biography places her among the middle range of talented and respected cookbook authors such as Jean Anderson, Mark Bittman, and Jack Bishop.<br /><br />My very first reaction to this book is that it is bound to fail, as it tries to imitate the Democratic Party in trying to appeal to five different, not necessarily compatible special interest groups. The two most antagonistic interests I can imagine are Vegan versus low carb. I do not know low carb doctrines, but I do know that meat, eggs, and heavy cream are low carb darlings while these are antithetical to vegan diets. I also note that the very dairy heavy cream and the very meaty chicken stock are both listed as ingredients of a soup cited as being suitable for `Vegetarian or Vegan'. I know my favorite vegan niece would turn up her nose at this recipe.<br /><br />I am convinced that the four best ways to combine healthy interests with soup cooking are:<br /><br />1. Describe how to turn typical recipes into healthy recipes by things like replacing butter and animal fat with olive oil, replacing white bread with whole grains, and replacing meat stocks with vegetable stocks.<br /><br />2. Provide simply all around healthy recipes, as you may find in a book by Kathleen Dahlmans.<br /><br />3. Provide recipes for classic and modern vegetarian soups, with an emphasis on variety.<br /><br />4. Provide recipes for low carb soups.<br /><br />I am not an expert on dieting, but I suspect that most diet plans succeed as much or more from their reinforcing a ritual which sanctifies the effort and encourages compliance, possible by making the dishes just a tad less pleasant than unhealthy alternatives. I think that nutrition and eating for all around good health is the best approach to not gaining weight and let exercise take care of loosing excess weight.<br /><br />Now that that lecture is out of the way, I will say that this is a decent little soup book if you simply ignore all the nutritional baggage. I think the statistics on calories, calories from fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, carbohydrates, dietary fiber, sugars, proteins, vitamins, and minerals are so approximate as to be useless. Most experienced amateur cooks probably cook more like Rachael Ray or Jamie Oliver than they do like Ina Garten, who, like a true former professional caterer, has to create reproducible dishes, measures everything down to the teaspoon. Thus, the only way these measurements can make any sense whatsoever, you have to follow the measurements to a tee. And that doesn't account for variations in natural products. I am willing to bet that there is close to a 50% variation in some components in a pound of bay scallops depending on the location and season in which they were harvested, not to mention differences between wild and cultivated fish.<br /><br />The book is divided into five (5) chapters on soups plus a chapter on garnishes and a chapter on stocks. The most unusual chapter is the ten (10) pages and five recipes devoted to fruit soups, a subject not commonly covered in most other `little soup books', although James Peterson's big soup book, `Splendid Soups' devotes almost twenty-five pages with seventeen recipes to the subject. The stock recipes are well within the tolerances of an amateur home cook, although the need to collect ten pounds of uncooked chicken carcasses, wings, backs and ribs may require just a bit more obsession with soup making than most people have. The only other argument with these recipes is that it keeps the veggies in the pot for the full three hours of simmering. Most authorities I respect put the veggies in for just the last hour. The chapter does get points for including both standard and rich brown chicken stocks and a rich duck stock.<br /><br />The index confirms my growing opinion that the average cook who has at least one other good book on soups does not need this book. There is a Recipe Index organized by the five dietary concerns listed above, plus a general alphabetical index. A soup such as the Mediterranean Fish Soup with Quick Aioli appears in two different places in the Recipe Index, but does not appear in the alphabetical index.<br /><br />This book does have good, well written recipes. And, if you are a low carb, high protein or low calorie fan, this book will give you very good soups. However, while my first sin of a poor book is to not stay on message, my second is to have a weak or confused message. This book is a waste of time and money for vegans and not the best soup book for vegetarians. It is probably better than soup recipes you will get in Atkins or South Beach recipe books. And, that is probably the very best thing that can be said about this book.<br /><br />Buy this book if you are on a low carb regimen. If not, seek a good general book on soups such as the new CIA Book of Soups.last hour.

360372:US	39134375	R1ZS23OA34VYK0	0867308427	165922647	Book of Soups: More than 100 Recipes for Perfect Soups	Books	5	128	129	N	N	Best Soup Book I have reviewed. Buy this Book	`The Culinary Institute of America BOOK OF SOUPS' by, you guessed it, the staff of the Culinary Institute of America is the one book you SHOULD own on making soups. And, if there are other books on soups which you like, you should own this book as well, since it's instruction on general techniques for soup making surpass the material in the nine other recent soup books I have read. This is not to say this book can replace all other soup books. This book is strong on basic techniques and excellent recipes for classic soups such as Vichyssoise, Clam Chowder, Chicken Noodle soup, Cream of Tomato soup, Borscht, Egg Drop Soup, French Onion Soup, Stracciatella / Egg Drop Soup, Black Bean soup, and on and on and on, with the cover advertising 100 different recipes.<br /><br />This doesn't mean that if I want a special chowder, I won't go to Jasper White's book '50 Chowders', since all the recipes I have made from White's book have been simply out of this world good. It also doesn't mean I won't go to my little book of vegetarian soups by Paulette Mitchell or to other little books of soups by Michael Congdon and by the New York staff of `Daily Soup' or even the `Twelve Months of Monastery Soups', since I may be especially interested in a vegetarian soup, a thick full meal soup, or an especially light soup for July, since all of these are good soup books. I will also still go to Daniel Boulud or Tyler Florence for their chestnut soup recipes, even though the CIA includes a recipe for chestnut soup. But, I will pay very close attention to the CIA's chapter on creamed soups before I make chestnut soup again.<br /><br />The only real competition for literary soup supremacy is James Peterson's `Splendid Soups'. Peterson has several more recipes than the CIA and has a different organization based on ingredients rather than technique. And, Peterson deals in much more depth with the selection of good ingredients and their preparation than does the CIA. If you love soup, you really need both books, but if you can only afford or have the space for one, the CIA book is preferable, as it's list price is lower and its discussion of techniques is more portable to recipes in other books.<br /><br />The CIA has done several books on various subjects in addition to their main textbook, which is now in edition eight or nine. And, I generally find the titles oriented to amateur cooks such as their `Cooking at Home' and `Gourmet Food in Minutes' titles to be less friendly to amateur cooks than books from people who specialize in this subject such as Rachael Ray, Ina Garten, and Martha Stewart's staff. It seems they never quite forget to take off their toques and really see things from the home cook's point of view. None of that is true with this book. This may be due to the highly specialized subject, plus the effective scaling down of techniques the CIA authors has done. A common problem with recipes from restaurant cooks is that they are scaled to make eight to twelve servings. This book does not have this problem. No recipes except the stock recipes make more than eight servings. And, a special strength of this book is that it gives clear general suggestions on which soups and which soup ingredients will freeze well and which soups will survive long freezing or refrigeration. This explodes my mother's caution that you shouldn't freeze soups with tomato. On the other hand, potatoes and other starchy vegetables do not take well to freezing.<br /><br />The heart of this book, and the primary reason to buy it, no matter how many other soup books you may have is the very detailed, step by step description of the techniques for making six basic types of soups. These are broths; hearty soups; cream soups; pureed soups; bisques & chowders; and cold soups. The chapter on broths includes the recipes for the four most important stocks, chicken, beef, fish, and vegetable. The procedures are similar to, but just a bit less fussy than those in their textbook. I confess these recipes have been my standard against which I evaluate all other stock recipes, so I am committed to recommending them. Their primary virtues are that they are not on the burner for more than a few hours, the meat used in the chicken stock comes out as perfectly good poached chicken, useable in other recipes, and the vegetables are put in when there is but an hour to go, lowering the chance that the veggies will cloud up the broth. There are several very respectable authorities on stock making, including one of my heroes, Alton Brown, who cooks stocks for up to eight hours. I believe this is a great idea for commercial kitchens and an easier method for creating especially rich stocks than the `double stock' method, but I still think, with the authority of the CIA behind me, that the shorter recipe is better for the average home cook.<br /><br />The last chapter of the CIA's book contains recipes for `accompaniments'. These recipes for croutons, rusks, focaccia, buttermilk biscuits, crackers, gougeres, dumplings, granite, harissa, pistou, fried shallots, and vegetable chips are great to have especially the garnishes. This chapter may have been slightly closer to message if it would have limited itself to recipes for crackers and garnishes.<br /><br />This book joins the CIA volumes on Garde Manger and baking on my `best books for the kitchen' list. That doesn't mean it is not also a pleasure to read with really useful pictures for both soups and methods. I noticed the CIA changed publisher from textbook giant Wiley to Lebhar-Friedman Books, who seem to have provided a lighter touch in their editorial guidance.<br /><br />Buy this book if you like to make soups!k.

Buy it!	`1000 Italian Recipes' by Michele Scicolone is a great idea which, in other hands applied to other cuisines has produced heavy books with little or no inspiration. Ms. Scicolone has done this right. She has done it so right that it ups the ante for all new general Italian cuisine cookbooks to justify why one would want an alternate book when this excellent volume is already in your library.<br /><br />The first thing which strikes the reader is the Table of Contents, which shows that Ms. Scicolone has a chapter on virtually every major category of Italian cooking, and, the Contents are divided into detailed subjects so that we don't only have a chapter on Antipasti, we have an Antipasti chapter plus sections on Cheese, Vegetable, Egg, Meat, Seafood, Dips, Bruschetta, and Fried Antipasti.<br /><br />While this book makes no claims to being a work on regional Italian cuisine, it pays great attention to regionality. For starters, the end papers display excellent little maps of Italy and its twenty primary provinces. It is probably entirely excessive on my part, but a few more cities marked on the map would have been nice, but it is so much better than what you get in most other books that cite Italian regions that I am very pleased with this feature. The map is validated by the fact that the headnotes to most of the recipes cite the region to which the dish is native. Among other things, it fixes for certain that potato gnocchi is a speciality of Rome, and that it is the premier gnocchi recipe for Rome's Thursday menus.<br /><br />This highlights the fact that in such a large book, you get not one gnocchi recipe. You don't even get just one potato gnocchi recipe. You get it neat, with lamb ragu, gratineed, with spinach, with seafood, and Sorrento style (with marinara sauce and mozzarella). You also get gnocchi made with squash and made with semolina. I do miss a recipe for gnocchi made with ricotta. And, these are not bare bones recipes. Potato gnocchi, like an omelet, is a relatively easy recipe with simple ingredients. But, both recipes require a lot of technique and gnocchi excellence comes only with practice. I think no amount of reading gnocchi recipes or even marathon sessions watching `Molto Mario' will make you a good gnocchi cook. You need to feel the dough and experiment with it to be sure it is just right. Here we get another symptom of how good this book is. I have read a lot of gnocchi recipes, and this is the first where I recall the writer's providing a really good test to tell when the potato gnocchi is good to go. Everyone tells you to be gentle and not add too much flour. This is the first I recall seeing a method for test cooking a gnocchi dumpling to see if you are good to go.<br /><br />We see the same story with just about every type of recipe. It is no surprise to see a Pasta Puttanesca recipe. It is a surprise to see the traditional cooked Puttanesca plus an uncooked version of Puttanesca.<br /><br />Another small feature that builds on all the other good things about this book is the fact that the Italian name is given for every recipe. This may not seem very important to the person who just happens to want a single very good source of Italian recipes, but to someone who owns twenty (20) recipes of Italian cuisine, the feature becomes very important in being able to compare two different versions of the same recipe where two authors may translate the traditional Italian name in two different ways. This simple consideration extends to names of classic preparations, lead by the distinction between a ragu (a meat sauce, as in Ragu Bolognaise) and a sugo, or thinner, meatless sauce. This legitimate distinction is probably the basis of the totally inconsequential Italian-American argument over `sauce' versus `gravy'.<br /><br />The author is fairly clear that her recipes are based on Italian models, not Italian-American adaptations. This is fine, since there are plenty of excellent Italian-American cookbooks on our shelves now. She does note that she has leaned towards the modern Italian tendency to prefer olive oil to butter or lard in all recipes and she has catered to the American preference for lightly cooked vegetables, instead of hammering the green stuff the way most traditional Italians did in the past.<br /><br />While Ms. Scicolone has wisely not entitled her book `Complete Italian Recipes', there are precious few subjects she has not given some reasonable treatment, including a very instructive section on making fresh pasta and sections on traditional breads, pizzas, and calzones. I'm especially pleased that she found room for a recipe for the Sardinian `sheet music' flat bread. Something so unusual needs to be in such a complete book. But, here is where we get the gaps that are filled by the grand dames of Italian cookbook writing such as Marcella Hazan, Lydia Bastianich, and Carole Field. Marcella and Lydia both have large chapters devoted to making fresh pasta, with excellent pictures to explain the techniques. And, Ms. Scicolone does not compete with Carole Field's excellent book on Italian bread baking, since it does not even touch the subject of artisinal baking. I would have not missed the bread recipes one bit if Ms. Scicolone had devoted some of this space to more Panini recipes. As the cuisine which has contributed most to the American sandwich, a few more Panini recipes and a bit more on the Panini press would have been a great addition. I am a dunce with wines, but I think the short chapter on Italian wines adds much to the book by supplying lots of useful information into a few pages.<br /><br />While book cover blurbs are often political, I heartily agree with Mario Batali's epigram that this book is a masterpiece, easily a candidate for one of the ten cookbooks you keep in your kitchen.n cookbooks on our shelves now.

Great source.	`Twelve Months of Monastery Soups' by Brother Victor-Antoine d'Avila-Latourrette set the model for this author's later book on twelve months of salads which I have already reviewed and which has become my constant `go to' book whenever I want to make a salad.<br /><br />This book on soups is in a much more crowded field, as soups appear to be one of the most popular topics for single dish or single method cooking, probably just slightly behind grilling and baking cookies. It is certainly a more crowded field than books on salads. But, this book has two really important facts going for it in the face of this crowd of books.<br /><br />First, soups are a dish where seasonality is not only important for which ingredients are available. Seasonality is important to the recipe as well. Heavy hearty soups are great in January while clear soups and cold soups are just the thing for July. Even when a recipe such as borsht is better suited to cold weather, the recipe in this book is lightened up and served cold to suit the summer, when many of it's ingredients come into season.<br /><br />Second, Brother d'Avila-Latourrette really makes these soups on a regular basis and is dedicated to his subject in a way that journeyman cookbook writers are not. The good brother's book may not be quite a match for books from heavyweights such as James Peterson, author of `Splendid Soups' and Barbara Kafka's `Soups, A Way of Life', as these people are professionals of the highest water whose professionalism provides the quality which otherwise comes from passion and familiarity. Their professionalism will also provide the kind of recipes and background on good stock making which the good brother does not cover in depth. His recipe for chicken broth is simple, but not as clear as it could be, since it gives instructions based on burner settings, not endpoints described in terms of what is happening in the stockpot.<br /><br />I have made several soups from this book and I find the recipes every bit as good and every bit as simple as Brother Victor-Antoine's recipes for salads. And, doing a simple soup recipe is a lot harder than doing a simple salad recipe. Unlike recipes by Peterson and Kafka, not all of these recipes fall into the `gourmet' camp. Some actually use bouillon cubes. And yet, when I did such a recipe, I was totally pleased with the success with which the recipe brought out the taste of mushrooms, the headline ingredient. I was especially pleased with this as mushrooms are one of my favorite foods and the main attraction of mushrooms is to take on the taste of other ingredients with their native taste blending into the background.<br /><br />All of Brother Victor-Antoine d'Avila-Latourrette's books are decorated with Medieval and Renaissance woodcuts plus quotes from both religious and folk sources. Accouterments of this sort are a two-edged sword. I stumbled across a series of cookbooks done in rural Americana with exceedingly cute colored pencil or watercolor drawings and homey sayings which simply detracted from the book as a collection of recipes, since the relevance and the quality of the sayings was weak at best. The decorations and commentary in this book have exactly the opposite effect. They enhance the experience of reading the book and supply useful grace notes to the recipes.<br /><br />The mix of recipes is a very nice combination of the familiar and the unusual. With borsht, minestrone, and bouillabaisse, we get Brussels sprout soup, Shaker style soup, cold salmon soup, and a hermit's soup. Added to the seasonality of recipe and ingredient, there is a seasonality of tradition, as many of the recipes are specific to a particular holiday, although many saint's days may be familiar only to card carrying Catholics.<br /><br />I heartily recommend this over many more detailed but less inspired books on soup.And, unlike another reviewer, I assure you the recipes I tried were anything but bland.cipes every bit as good and every bit as simple as Brother Victor-Antoine's recipes for salads.

362763:US	39134375	R3PCMM1ZFVJZFZ	0811827593	685444418	Asian Vegetables: From Long Beans to Lemongrass, A Simple Guide to Asian Produce Plus 50 Delicious, Easy Recipes	Books	3	9	12	N	Y	An Average Book, not up to Standards on the Subject	`Asian Vegetables' by first time author, Sara Deseran is a lightweight entry into the world of books about Asian cooking. While there may not be as many heavyweight classics as there are in English for Italian, French, or Mediterranean cuisines, there are important classics against which one's efforts must be measured. The heavyweight in the area of guides to Asian ingredients is `Bruce Cost's Asian Ingredients', updated in 2000.<br /><br />For starters, for roughly the same list price in paperback, Cost's classic has twice as many pages, covers all ingredients, not just vegetables, and presents vegetables and all other products in a greater depth than Ms. Deseran's book. For starters, Deseran does not include the Latin scientific names for her vegetables, which is doubly annoying as she herself says, most of the vegetables have different names, even in different parts of China, let alone different names in Japan and Thailand. So, the only way to be sure we are talking about the same thing is to give the one name that is guaranteed to be the same across all books.<br /><br />Ms. Deseran has one opportunity to gain a march on Cost's book by providing color photographs of almost all of the plants she discusses, but this feature is, to my mind, done poorly. In an attempt to compare and contrast the appearance of related vegetables, the photographs are all `family pictures'. Thus, for example, one picture of four oriental members of the cabbage family is so small that I am very hard pressed to see the differences between the four vegetables in the photograph, and I am hard pressed to see the difference between choy sum (Chinese flowering cabbage) and the Mediterranean veggie, broccoli Rabe (rapini). This brings up another weakness with the book.<br /><br />One of the main features of the book is the recipes presented for each featured ingredient. One problem with these recipes is that relatively few of these ingredients are available outside of an Oriental market in a large city such as New York or San Francisco. My local very well stocked megamart probably carries less than a third of the ingredients in this book. One of the virtues of Bruce Cost's book is that since it covers all types of Asian products, including meat, fish, noodles, sauces, and grains, the average coverage is probably better than half, as grains, noodles, and fish are much more common than many vegetables. So, even though Ms. Deseran says that most oriental leafy greens are almost entirely interchangeable with one another, this doesn't help if you can't find any. It would have made the recipes much more useful if the author had provided substitutions, especially for the leafy green vegetables and the squashes.<br /><br />Even on the subjects on which both Deseran and Cost have articles, Cost's information is deeper and generally more useful. While Deseran has articles on `Ginger' and `Galangal and Turmeric', Cost has several pages on the `Ginger family', including individual articles on `Ginger', `Galangal', `Turmeric', `Mioga Ginger', and `Lesser Galangal'. For the ginger family, both books provide two soup recipes featuring ginger and Galangal. Deseran gives the usual short paragraph to ginger, while Cost gives two pages to ginger, including a discussion of `baby ginger' and ginger shoots. Cost also covers dried and powdered preparations made from ginger and turmeric, which are beyond the scope of Deseran's book. Deseran does cover a fairly sizable number of non-vegetable topics in her `pantry glossary', but most entries offer little substantial information. For example, there is a paragraph on chicken broth, which gives no recipe for same, and makes no mention, like Cost, that the Asian chicken broth is an entirely different preparation than it's French or Italian cousins. She simply suggests you use a commercial western style organic chicken broth. This point alone makes me question the depth to which Ms. Deseran has seriously researched her subject.<br /><br />Oddly, Ms. Deseran's bibliography is very respectable and includes `Bruce Cost's Asian Ingredients'. It almost seems she knows of this important work, but has never read it. Ms. Deseran's patron and inspiration for this book is noted Chinese cookbook author, Barbara Tropp, whose `The Modern Art of Chinese Cooking' has all the cachet and quality of a Chinese `Mastering the Art of French Cooking' by Julia Child. And, Ms. Tropp agrees with Mr. Cost in clearly distinguishing Chinese from French broth by leaving out the vegetables and adding ginger. So much for packaged supermarket stocks!<br /><br />One attraction found in Ms. Deseran's book is the anecdotes by noted chefs on Oriental ingredients. I found these contributed virtually nothing to the value of the book.<br /><br />Virtually the only situation in which it seems Ms. Deseran's book may have an edge over Bruce Cost's work is if you happen to live near a first class Asian market which stocks a good variety of fresh ingredients and the color pictures can serve as an aid in identifying the products. But then, Cost's book becomes more valuable, as it offers an excellent guide to how to make the best of Asian markets, something Ms. Deseran does not cover, except to note how to care for the vegetables once you have them.<br /><br />This is really an average book, so my three stars simply reflects that this book offers virtually nothing when compared to the standard works on the subject.t. <br /> <br />Oddly, Ms. Deseran's bibliography is very respectable and includes `Bruce Cost's Asian Ingredients'.

363698:US	39134375	RA03K18S0EJ6Y	0688164447	312903559	Retro Desserts: Totally Hip, Updated Classic Desserts from the '40s, '50s, '60s, and '70s	Books	5	6	12	N	Y	Retro Results and Humor with First Class Recipes	`Retro Desserts' by Wayne Harley Brachman, noted Bobby Flay pastry chef and colleague, is, with no great surprise to me, about as much like similarly titled kitsch books as the Stephen Spielberg movie, `Raiders of the Lost Ark' is like the 12 episode adventure serials of the 1930's it was meant to glorify.<br /><br />I recently reviewed a `Retro Baking' volume that is part of a whole series of `Retro' titles. This has all the faults you may expect in such a title, all the faults which Brachman's book avoids with great aplomb.<br /><br />As I noted in my review of Brachman's most recent work, `American Desserts', Wayne is one of only two major culinary writer / educators who successfully incorporates humor into their work, the other being Food Network colleague Alton Brown. Thankfully, their humor is so different from one another that you can enjoy both without hearing echos of one in the other. While Alton Brown emulates Stan Freberg and Ernie Kovacs, Wayne Harley Brachman takes his inspiration from Sid Caesar, Carl Reiner, and Mel Brooks. So much for the review of comedy in this book.<br /><br />The creativity with the baking is really the main attraction. This is important because Brachman is not taking from the gemutlichkeit of the past to add luster to his book, he is giving to us an understanding of past famous desserts with master class level recipes making all recipes from scratch materials rather than the baking mixes which began being marketed in the 1940s and 1950s. This is not a gimmick or a deviation from message. These recipes were, in fact, presented by the baking product companies, as is, to create markets for their base products to compete with Betty Crocker and Duncan Hines. One of the few deviations from true retro recipes is to use cooked eggs rather than raw whenever possible to eliminate any lurking salmonella from contaminated eggs. Otherwise, in the introduction, Brachman states that almost all recipes were reformulated from `authentic period recipes collected from vintage magazines,...'. Some are composites of several recipes and `in a few cases, they are actually retro fakes'. But this really doesn't matter, since except for chapter six (see below), the real attraction of these recipes is the high quality of Brachman's `from scratch' recipe and the retro presentations which will fit so well into a 50's entertaining scheme.<br /><br />The very reasonably priced book, with a list price of $30, has ten chapters, presenting ten different types of recipes. Practically the only argument I have with the book is that the sixth chapter, `The Posh Nosh - Classic Desserts of the Fancy-Pants Restaurants' should have been first, since the recipes in this chapter are by far the most recognizable to 21st century survivors of the last mid-century. The stars of this chapter are Cherries Jubilee, Bananas Foster, Strawberries Romanoff, Crepes Suzette, Baked Alaska, Peach Melba, Belgian Waffles, and Fondues. A sidebar at the end of this chapter contains my only other disappointment with this book. This blurb lists TV and Movie stars of the recent past and their famous dessert recipe names, with no mention of Danny Kaye, who was, by all accounts, a gourmet cook of the first magnitude.<br /><br />The other chapters, beginning with the first, are:<br /><br />`Perfect, Every Time You Bake. Cake...After Cake...After Cake'<br /><br />`If I Knew You Were Comin' I'd Have Baked A Dozen Cupcakes'<br /><br />`When the Moon Hits Your Eye Like...' Pies, of course.<br /><br />`Fruit Cocktails for Two'<br /><br />`I Tawt I Taw A Pudding Tat'<br /><br />`Cookie, Cookie, Lend Me Your Comb'<br /><br />`For Whom the Ice Cream Bell Tolls'<br /><br />`Willy Wonka, Eat Your Heart Out' on candies and other kids stuff.<br /><br />`Sauces and Goops', ten retro standard sweet sauces.<br /><br />Two samples of Brachman's seriously professional technique is his instruction to triple sift all dry ingredients and to butter the bottom of baking pans AND line them with buttered parchment paper. And, since Brachman is entirely self-taught, I am certain he is recommending these techniques from personal experience rather than parroting some cooking school doctrine. This is not to say that Brachman is not giving serious instruction here. He does not belabor accurate measurement, but he does strongly emphasize good organization and laying out measured ingredients in advance. While baking demands high accuracy in measuring weights and volumes, it also requires high accuracy, or at least a high level of attention to time. When you are working with hot sugar or warmed chocolate, things can go from good to bad in seconds.<br /><br />A symptom of how seriously adult these recipes are is the high incidence of alcoholic ingredients in the recipes. This book is most definitely not kids stuff, even if almost all the alcohol burns off when the desserts are baked. This is not to say there are no kid friendly recipes here. My favorites are the recipes for making marshmallow from scratch and the recipes for ice cream dishes, which do not include making ice cream from scratch.<br /><br />The success with which Brachman captures the retro spirit of these desserts easily doubles the naturally high value of the recipes in this book. Just as an expert's recipes for sandwiches (Nancy Silverton) and preserves (Christine Ferber) will come as a total surprise to entertained guests. They may expect a coq au vin recipe from Julia Child or Thomas Keller, but they will not expect A-Team effort on the sideboard dishes.<br /><br />Please take Nick Malgieri's blurb with a grain of salt, as these baking recipes are not necessarily easy. They are just as difficult as they need to be to present first rate baked goods.<br /><br />Brachman's philosophy may be summed up on page 88 where he says `Humans are the only animals that actually seek out and prefer foods that don't taste good... Here's my point: Healthy can and should be tasty. Fun is good.'<br /><br />And yes, dear reader, this book is fun and good, very, very good. Buy this book to help learn how to bake.parchment paper.

This book suffers from the fact that it deals with the same subject as a true culinary classic, 'Asian Ingredients' by Bruce Cost which has recently come out in an updated paperback version (see my Review of this book).<br /><br />The few areas where this book is a useful supplement to Cost's book are based on the fact that it covers more than Cost's venue of Japan, China, Korea, Vietnam, and Thailand and it is slightly better as a reference, being a true dictionary. Yet, in comparison to a book on Japanese ingredients, 'The Japanese Kitchen' by Kimike Barber, I found Passmore's book wanting. It's strength is in broad coverage, but you will invariably need Cost's book to really understand this subject.<br /><br />Get Cost's book first, then see if there is anything you are missing and consider this book as a supplement to cover the Phillipines, Indonesia, India, and other remote Asian venues.<br /><br />My strongest recommendation for this book is that it does include the Latin scientific names for all biological entries. It would have been worthless without these.<br /><br />I must say, however, that since I originally reviewed this book, I have reviewed several other books on Oriental ingredients and I have found this book a very decent quick reference to check on the accuracy of other books' facts. So, my opinion about this book has come up a bit in the last two weeks. Since Amazon is not letting me change my original three stars to four, I hope you, dear reader, will spot this comment and consider it well.	2005-02-01
365849:US	39134375	R1KB1YE6GPHCP	006093204X	217299619	Asian Ingredients: A Guide to the Foodstuffs of China, Japan, Korea, Thailand and Vietnam	Books	5	51	53	N	Y	Buy This Book. Superb Presentation of East Asian Foods!	`Asian Ingredients' by Bruce Cost is one of those books like Patience Gray's `Honey from a Weed' and Claudia Roden's `New Book of Middle Eastern Food' which gets cited as THE authority on its subject by culinary heavyweights such as Ruth Reichl and Alice Waters. So, in my quest for the perfect culinary library, I really need to read and review this book. I am very happy to say that the reputation of this book is not overdone. It is one of the finest books on culinary ingredients I have seen on either Oriental or Occidental cuisines. The author states from the outset that his objective was not to give us an encyclopedic work. What we get is much closer to some of the finer books on Mediterranean cuisine such as Nancy Harmon Jenkins `The Essential Mediterranean'. In many ways, Cost's book is far more practical, albeit less analytical than Jenkins' work.<br /><br />Cost deals with the fairly homogeneous food world of Japan, Korea, China, Viet Nam, and Thailand. He mentions India as an influence on Thai cuisine, but does not deal directly with Indian cuisine, as it is substantially different from the cuisine of China and the rest of the Far East. The book also does not deal with the cuisine of the Philippines or Indonesia, as the cuisines of these two nations are heavily influenced by European colonization beginning in the 16th century.<br /><br />One of the best things about Cost's book is that it is organized in such a way to make it a pleasure to read for background information. While I have never sat down to read the Larousse Gastronomique for pleasure, I read Cost's book from cover to cover with great pleasure, skipping a very few subjects on which I was very familiar. Costs book is divided into the following seven (7) major chapters:<br /><br />Fresh Ingredients including Herbs and Seasonings, Vegetables and Fungi, Meat, Poultry and Eggs, Fish<br /><br />Preserved and Processed Ingredients including Dried Ingredients, Cured Ingredients, and Soy and Coconut<br /><br />Condiments and Sauces including Soy based condiments, Fish based sauces, Chili based sauces, Vinegar and spirits, and Flavored oils<br /><br />Spices, Sugars, Nuts, and Seeds, including Spices, Sugar, Nuts and Seeds<br /><br />Rice<br /><br />Noodles and Wrappers<br /><br />Flours and Thickeners<br /><br />Cooking Fats and Oils<br /><br />One of the most dramatic lessons to be learned from this book is the fact that like the Mediterranean respect for dried and preserved ingredients such as salted cod, dried pasta, and dry beans, Asian dried ingredients such as seaweed, vegetables, fish, and mushrooms are highly regarded ingredients in their own right. They are not `second best'. By drying and concentrating their flavors, they bring something to the party that is simply beyond their fresh precursors.<br /><br />Another fairly dramatic discovery is the fact that while so many of the spices prized by Europe and so greatly desired by Renaissance Europe were grown just next door to China and Japan, these spices such as black pepper, nutmeg, cloves, and cinnamon (cassias) really did not and still do not play a big part in East Asian cuisine, except for Thailand, which is influenced by the curries and other spices of India. Northern China and Japan almost totally reject the use of the `cookie spices' except for ginger, which is used heavily throughout the region covered by the book.<br /><br />It is interesting to see both the harmony and the dissonance created when one lays Mediterranean and Far Eastern cuisine side by side. Some of the biggest parallels are the importance of garlic, pork, mushrooms, cilantro, and New World (capsicum) chilis. Some differences are in the relative importance of drying versus salt curing. As Nancy Harmon Jenkins points out, salt is much more important in the Mediterranean cuisines simply because the Mediterranean is saltier than the oceans, so it is a lot easier to acquire than on the Pacific Rim. There are some salt cured pork products,with hams very similar to Smithfield hams, but nowhere near as much of the Charcuterie / salume culture of Western Europe. The greatest differences between the two areas lies in the use of milk. There is simply no milk culture in East Asia from cows, goats, sheep, or buffalo. The Chinese and Japanese feel the same towards Europe's more aromatic cheeses as westerners may feel about fermented fish sauce, birds nests (dried bird saliva), and seaweed. Where the European uses animals' milk, the Asian uses milk refined from soy or coconut.<br /><br />An important part of this book, more important than similar samples in most other books of this type, is the recipes, especially for things such as fish and chicken stocks, which are far simpler than comparable French stocks. They are not just simpler; there is a whole rationale in the Chinese cuisine against including vegetables in chicken stock recipes.<br /><br />Two of the most useful aspects of this book are the recommendations on how to best use Asian markets and which commercial preparations are of a high quality. I had some reservations regarding a local Chinese run farmer's market with a fish counter until I read Cost's description of Asians' regard for freshness in fish. The `Iron Chef' episodes where virtually all seafood ingredients are presented live is not for the sake of show business. These people are SERIOUS about their fresh fish! Note that while this book was originally written and published in 1988, the new paperback edition was revised in 2000, so the numerous comments about which prepared brand name ingredients are the best should be fairly current.<br /><br />This book is so good you will be remiss if you buy any other book on East Asian ingredients without first reading this new edition. Other books may offer better coverage of selected aspects of this subject, but this book is certainly the gold standard against which other books should be measured!<br /><br />Very highly recommended, especially if you like to read about food as well as eat it.to Smithfield hams, but nowhere near as much of the Charcuterie / salume culture of Western Europe.

Not best for US.	`The Soup Cookbook' by Anne Sheasby is the sixth soup cookbook I have reviewed recently, and I find it the weakest of the six by a hair.<br /><br />Good soup books seem to come in two to three flavors, depending on how you count them. The `upper tier' of books by major American culinary writers and figures such as Barbara Kafka, James Peterson, and Jasper White, published by Wiley and Scribners cover all the classics and the authors' variations on classic recipes. A second tier by, for example, Paulette Mitchell, the `Daily Soup' chef/owners, and Michael Congdon, published by new, small publishers such as Hyperion, Chronicle, and Sasquatch Books present collections of soup recipes which are honed to a fine edge in small restaurants over a long time. Sheasby's work looks very much like the second class of books, without the condition that the recipes are all creations of the author(s), regardless of how deeply the recipes are based on classic soup models. Instead, this volume is distinguished by being part of a publisher's series of cookbooks written by professional cookbook writers and edited by a common editor. Some of these series, such as the Time / Life series from the 1960s, edited by noted food writer Richard Olney, deserve recognition, these series are often on a fast track to the budget bins.<br /><br />I am happy to say that this volume has more value than the usual discount fodder. Under the influence of Mortimer Adler's classic `How to Read a Book', I am a great fan of reading the minutiae of books forewords, prefaces, acknowledgments, and introductions. There is no better way to know if a book accomplishes its purpose than reading this stuff to see what their purpose was to begin with. Sometimes, this preliminary survey turns up some really interesting stuff, as it does with this book, published in the UK with both American and Australian audiences in mind. I discovered, for example, that an Australian tablespoon is 20 milliliters, not 15 milliliters, like the usual American measurement. And, the book gives a warning that while all recipes are given with both metric and imperial measurements; one should not mix them, as they are not homogeneous. This is a piece of advice that may very well apply to every recipe with dual systems of measurement, yet practically none of these other cookbooks give you this warning. The reason is simple, in that when a cup is converted to metric, it is probably rounded up to 250 milliliters and weights are probably rounded up from ounces to grams. So, there is a slight skew in the alignment of metric and imperial units. But back to our book!<br /><br />The primary objective of these series books, to my mind, is to provide a reliable source of classic recipes. This book appears to satisfy this minimal requirement by giving us recipes for many traditional soups such as Clam Chowder, Gazpacho, Bouillabaisse, Minestrone, French Onion Soup, Mulligatawny Soup, Matzo ball soup, Thai Chicken soup, and Vichyssoise, plus many more. I am a bit less enthusiastic about the quality of the recipe writing. The book gives a very nice little introduction to soup ingredients and methods, which bears all the marks of having been written in England, as Zucchini is called Courgettes and Rutabaga is called Swede. It even includes some novel information on a generally unknown class of macaroni called `soup pasta', miniature shapes most classically represented by the noodles in alphabet soup. But here, there are some hints that the author may not be totally in touch with her subject when she endorses fresh pastas over dried pasta, when these little shapes are available almost entirely in dried `macaroni' form and not as fresh noodles. And, virtually every expert in Italian cookery agrees that fresh and dried pastas are simply two different products, each with their own best uses.<br /><br />Another little annoyance is in the choice of kitchen tool to cream soups. The author generally gives a wide range of options, including a variation on the food mill called a mouli-legume. I have never seen this beast and I am assuming it is not your standard food mill, which is simply not nearly as good as a stick blender, a Waring style blender, or a food processor, especially if you want a really smooth puree. I prefer the blender, but I admire Mr. Congdon's recipes written all from the point of view of the same limited set of equipment, where he uses the food processor.<br /><br />There are other little anomalies, such as the double appearance of the recipe for dashi, once in a sidebar and once in the chapter on stocks. Speaking of stocks, I admire the short recipes, but I believe they will give less flavor than some longer cooking options (See Congdon's S.O.U.P.S., for the opposite extreme). I think the simplicity is attributable less to culinary considerations than to keeping it easy for the masses. For a happy medium, consult James Peterson's `Sauces' or his `Splendid Soups' book.<br /><br />The specific instructions for the soups are all relatively easy. And, many strike me as being too easy. They all fit the pattern of a book designed to bring classic recipes to someone who buys their cookbooks off the wire racks in their megamart. The recipe for New England (cream based) clam chowder for example is much simpler than any of Jasper White's 50 recipes and I have no faith that the product will be as good.<br /><br />Unlike all the other books mentioned above, I never quite developed a visceral interest in this book. The book never quite breaks out of its aura of being a simple commodity written by someone who collects recipes, and simplifies them a bit to attract someone who needs some familiar soup recipes.<br /><br />This is not a poor book, but others are better, especially for American readers.of options, including a variation on the food mill called a mouli-legume.

Artisinal Jams!!	`Mes Confitures', subtitled `The Jams and Jellies of Christine Ferber' is written by Ms. Ferber herself, in French, translated by Virginia Phillips, and introduced with a foreword by Alain Ducasse. In case these circumstances are not enough to clue you in to what is afoot here, let me tell you that this book is not about your grandmother's strawberry jam. It is also not about your mother's Smuckers and certainly not about your Polaner jelly. This book is about artisinal products as carefully done as French wines and cheeses. In fact, the similarity between wines and these preserves are a lot closer than almost any other comparison, as the raw material of both is very similar.<br /><br />Before going much further, I must give a word or warning that I do not consider this book a complete manual on how to make and preserve jams and jellies. In fact, it is telling that the title and subtitle DO NOT include the word `preserves'. While I am not an expert on preserves and canning, I have enough knowledge, acquired from a typically excellent episode of Alton Brown's `Good Eats' to know that successfully packing a confit in a sterile container is not the same as prepping a PRESERVE which can safely sit on an unrefrigerated shelf for up to a year. So, if you are serious about making confits and preserves, get a very good introductory book on canning, as Ms. Ferber's book is much more of a master class on the subject, which assumes you know a lot about the mechanics of canning and preserving. The book is primarily a collection of primo recipes for producing jams and jellies worthy of smearing on your artisinal breads or filling your handmade Linzer cookies.<br /><br />The book's recipes are divided by season, and there is an extreme attitude about selecting the very freshest fruits at the very best time of the season and the day. I am rarely swayed about goings on about using fresh ingredients. I will only state that there is probably a much bigger connection between the quality of your starting ingredients and your final product in the making of fruit comfits than there is in the making of a soup or braise or any other cooking method using most meats from hoofed or winged beasts and using most vegetables, even the seasonally persnickety tomato. The one condition which tempers this fact is that unlike most pedestrian recipes for fruit confits, Ms. Ferber's recipes often contain several spices and other seasonings which may buffer the impact of a less than perfect crop of apples or peaches.<br /><br />While Ms. Ferber lives and works in the fabled Alsace district of France, her seasons are not too different from temperate North America, so there should be few incongruities on the part of geography. There may be several difficulties in the fact that Ms. Ferber uses several cultivars that may simply not be available in a timely manner to us Nordamerikaners. But, we carry on with the best substitutions we can do.<br /><br />Spring recipes open with a big surprise with two recipes for comfitted carrots. Otherwise, the stars of the show in spring are cherries, strawberries, raspberries, apples, and rhubarb. Here we first encounter green apple jelly, which is the `veal stock' of the fruit confit world. Just as veal is one of the richest sources of thickening gelatin, green apples are one of the best sources of pectin for gelling the confit, while the apple taste is tame enough to stand in the background, behind stronger tasting fruits. One puzzle Ms. Ferber does not elucidate is how one gets a supply of green apple jelly, a product whose season comes in the fall, when you wish to use this ingredient in the spring.<br /><br />The stars of the summer recipes are Bergeron apricot, generic apricot, wild and generic (farm grown) blueberries, nectarines, currants, celery, zucchini, raspberry, melon, and apples. Some of the more important costars seem to shine in the summer recipes. These are vanilla, black pepper, chili peppers, anise, pinot noir, almonds, chocolate, essences of edible flowers and flower petals, and eau-de-vie. Citrus juices and zests, especially those from lemon contribute to a large number of recipes in all seasons.<br /><br />The stars of the autumn recipes are dried fruits, nuts, pears, quinces, rose hips, figs, grapes, vineyard peach, honey, ginger, cinnamon, apple, tomato, and Gewurztraminer (wine). Winter is devoted to tropical fruits such as citrus (marmalade, marmalade, marmalade), pineapple, banana, mango, and passion fruit. It is the one season where there are recipes for a particular event (Christmas). It is also no surprise to find tea as an ingredient here, as bitter orange is, itself, an ingredient in Earl Gray tea.<br /><br />The recipes are very well detailed. You should be able to do everything in every recipe if you have the tools listed at the beginning of the book. As canning is an old American rural custom, none of the equipment should be much farther than a good hardware store or good mail order or Internet source. The book gives an excellent list of American sources, although there is no guarantee you will be able to get some of the cultivars found in the Alsace.<br /><br />My mind's virtual taste buds tell me that this is one excellent collection of recipes for fruit confits, and, a fair amount of improvisation is certainly allowed.

Excellent Read	`Chocolate - A Bittersweet Saga of Dark and Light' by culinary journalist, Mort Rosenblum reads as a collection of essays on various aspects of the contemporary world of chocolate and its history, going back to pre-Columbian America.<br /><br />Anyone who has read Rosenblum's excellent book, `Olives', will recognize the style of this book, which seems to jump from one time, place, and situation to another with little rhyme or reason. The narrative is neither chronological nor in the order in which cacao is grown, harvested, refined, formed into wholesale chocolate, and used as an ingredient in truffles, bonbons, and other confections. There is actually a lot of good sense to this structure (or lack of it) in that you are much less likely to become bored with the tale.<br /><br />Rosenblum is not a culinary practitioner such as Elizabeth David, Julia Child or contemporary chocolate writer David Lebovitz (to whom Rosenblum owes a considerable debt, as Lebovitz shared information with Rosenblum, in spite of the fact that Lebovitz was writing his own book on chocolate). He is also not an observer of human gastronomic desires such as M.F.K. Fisher. He is not even a hybrid of these two breeds, the culinary columnist, such as James Villas, Jeffrey Steingarten, or John Thorne, who deal in both appetites and techniques. Rosenblum is a rather rare breed of journalist who specializes in writing about food, but seems to have no overriding passion for the subject. He simply seems to be interested in the subject, and, he is a very, very good observer and reporter of what he sees. The writers with the most similar approach seems to be Eric Schlosser (author of `Fast Food Nation') who, like Rosenblum, is as much interested in the economics of a food business as with taste. These writers are more like one another than they are like other writers I have mentioned, although Rosenblum is much less polemical than Schlosser.<br /><br />Unlike the subjects of `Olives' and `A Goose in Toulouse', where the author had an intimate connection with his subject before he began writing his book, Rosenblum was not intimately familiar with chocolate up to about two years ago. Thus, virtually all his historical information is from secondary sources, albeit, very, very good secondary sources, some dating back to the writings of the early Spanish Conquistadors. His modern information; however, is all based on interviews with primary sources, with some help from Lebovitz and a contemporary chocolate expert, Chloe Doutre-Roussel. And, just as his `Olives' book contained no recipes for sauteeing with olive oil or constructing salads or tapenades with olives, this book contains not one wit of instruction on how to do things with chocolate. For that, see Lebovitz' excellent `The Great Book of Chocolate'.<br /><br />This is not to say there is no practical information in this book. One of the biggest revelations should be no surprise to anyone who reads about food on a regular basis. That is, our familiar Hershey's chocolate is about as similar to fine chocolate from Europe and American producers such as Sharfen-Berger as a Big Mac is to an entr&eacute;e of boeuf au pauvre prepared at Thomas Keller's Bouchon or even at Tony Bourdain's Les Halles restaurant. And, this has nothing to do with European skill versus American ignorance. As a product, cacao has a lot in common with other natural products with characteristic terroir, such as olives, coffee, and grapes, leading to differences in the products made from these materials. A very high volume producer such as Hershey simply cannot deal with these variations, so they do everything needed to smooth out these differences as they use the very cheapest cacao they can get their hands on.<br /><br />The big picture which develops in the course of this book is that the world of chocolate processing is complex, and things have to be done just right at every stage along the route in order to produce world class chocolate. This world is roughly divided into those who grow cacao in the tropics, gather it, dry it, and ferment it; those who buy dried cacao nibs and process it into bar chocolate, the raw material for fine chocolatiers, the most familiar of whom to Americans is probably Jacques Torres.<br /><br />I confess that most chocolate history was less interesting to me than the shenanigans of modern chocolate businesses and chocolatiers. Just as I was surprised to have the belief about Hershey confirmed in a big way, I was also surprised to find that the widely touted Valrhona brand of French chocolate may be one of the best brands in the world, but it is by no means the largest maker of fine chocolate. That honor goes to Callebaut, also in France. But, Valrhona did present some of the most interesting stories in the book, as its representatives seem to have turned rudeness and chocolate politics into a rather gross art, in high contrast to the quality of their product.<br /><br />This, of course, is exactly the same interest of Rosenblum's earlier books, although chocolate is not as heavily embroiled in European Union politics as is olive oil, as I suspect the difference in money involved is somewhere on the order of 100 to 1. And, just as Valrhona is about 1/10 the size of Callebaut, the leading American producer of fine chocolate, Sharfen-Berger, produces but 1/100 of Valrhona.<br /><br />Near the end of the book, Rosenblum seems to remember that he is talking about a food and offers a chapter on nutritional research done on chocolate in the last hundred years or so. In a nutshell, most stories, whether ancient (as in Aztec) or modern (as in diet doctor) are somewhat mistaken. Most of the bad things attributed to chocolate are actually due to the sugar in chocolate candy. Chocolate itself has lots of things which are either good for you or make you feel good, with little or no undesirable side effects.<br /><br />Every major food deserves a book like this and one like Lebovitz' work.This world is roughly divided into those who grow cacao in the tropics, gather it, dry it, and ferment it; those who buy dried cacao nibs and process it into bar chocolate, the raw material for fine chocolatiers, the most familiar of whom to Americans is probably Jacques Torres. <br /> <br />I confess that most chocolate history was less interesting to me than the shenanigans of modern chocolate businesses and chocolatiers.

370174:US	39134375	R3J0N4ZRUGNTD4	0471292753	830432950	Sauces: Classical and Contemporary Sauce Making, 2nd Edition	Books	5	101	103	N	N	Easily the most important recipe reference for your kitchen	`Sauces, 2nd Edition ' by leading food teacher and writer James Peterson is high on my list of important, valuable single subject cookbooks which should be in the kitchen library of any serious amateur chef or professional chef in training.<br /><br />The very first impression is the very large number of named sauces listed in the table of contents. And, it should be no surprise at all that almost every one of these sauces has a French name, even if the sauce is based on a non-French ingredient such as Sauce Hongroise based on paprika and Sauce Porto based on Port (originating in Portugal). Of the chapters covering eighteen different kinds of sauce, only one, the chapter on `Salad Sauces, Vinaigrettes, Salsas, and Relishes' has even the slimmest majority of recipes with a non-French cant, with its large selection of Spanish and New World salsas, south Asian chutneys, Greek mint lamb sauce, and American cranberry sauce.<br /><br />The book opens with a short history of sauces, which becomes more interesting the more you know about Medieval and Renaissance cooking. The book even gives something missing from books on medieval cooking, the outline of an actual recipe for the ubiquitous verjuice, which was the Medieval and Renaissance source for sour tastes, which could be prepared from either grapes or apples. Just for fun, Peterson gives a few samples of Medieval and Renaissance recipes. The most interesting observation I found for culinary history was the statement that in the Middle Ages, sauces were thickened by pureeing meat, which is not at all surprising, as Medieval nobility looked down on all vegetable products (such as flour?) and preferred animal ingredients and spices in their dishes. The high point of the last three centuries for sauce making was the advent of more broadly based cookbooks for regional and bourgeois cooking and the systemization of classic sauce making by Antonin Careme, the `father of modern French cooking' (See Ian Kelly's biography of Careme, `Cooking for Kings').<br /><br />After the historical chapter and two better than average chapters on equipment and ingredients come the fifteen (15) chapters of recipes on:<br /><br />Stocks, glaces, and essences<br /><br />Liaisons: An Overview<br /><br />White Sauces for Meat and Vegetables<br /><br />Brown Sauces<br /><br />Stock-Based and NonIntegral Fish Sauces<br /><br />Integral Meat Sauces<br /><br />Integral Fish and Shellfish Sauces<br /><br />Crustacean Sauces<br /><br />Jellies and Chauds-Froids<br /><br />Hot Emulsified Egg Yolk Sauces<br /><br />Mayonnaise Based Sauces<br /><br />Butter Sauces<br /><br />Salad Sauces, Vinaigrettes, Salsas, and Relishes<br /><br />Purees and Puree Thickened Sauces<br /><br />Dessert Sauces<br /><br />The quality and authority of this book, especially with the added weight of a second enlarged and corrected edition is such that it is much more useful to state why you need this book rather than try to criticize it or find improvements.<br /><br />First, this book is the very best reference I can think of when you need a sauce and don't remember how to make it or want to improve on the last time you made it. This use is valuable even if you never make any sauces other than vinaigrettes, marinara sauce, gravies, and bechamel sauces for Mac and cheese or creamed chipped beef. This book is my standard reference for all such purposes and it has NEVER let me down! The existence of this book always makes me wonder why restaurant chefs always include a chapter of pantry recipes for stocks and sauces. Except for the really finicky writers such as Judy Rodgers (Zuni Caf&eacute;) and Thomas Keller (French Laundry, Bouchon), Peterson's recipes will be about as good as you will find in any restaurant chef's book. So, you may prefer coming to this book even when an author gives us his version, as this will mean that all your stocks and sauces will be made from a common point of view and a common palate. This book is better than any other source in that it simply has everything you can possibly need.<br /><br />Second, this book gives excellent recipes for sauce-based dishes, especially for seafood such as lobster, shrimp, salmon, clams, and scallops. For many fish dishes, the sauce is the dish, as cooking the fish is usually no more than the ten minutes it takes to poach, broil, bake, sautee, or fry the little critter(s).<br /><br />Third, the book is an excellent source when you need alternatives. You need a fancy sauce for lobster, but you don't have time to create a stock from lobster shells and go through all the other steps needed for a good shellfish sauce. If you really need to impress, consider a homemade remoulade or aioli (variations on mayonnaise), which can be done in a few minutes in a food processor with eggs, oil, and a little mustard, plus flavorings.<br /><br />Fourth, this book is simply the very best source I can think of to enlarge your repertoire of basic dishes and elements of dishes which can be swapped in to change a simple steamed vegetable into an elegant side dish. I am constantly pleased with the power of serendipity, that chance encounter with a great, easy recipe which enables you to cook up a yummy dish without having to consult a cookbook, let alone remember in which book the recipe was. My very first use of this book produced such an encounter when I was looking up the recipe for beurre blanc and discovered beurre citron (lemon butter sauce). This encounter also revealed that there is a considerable mystique connected with beurre blanc, as it is considered difficult to make. As I make it regularly as a dressing for fish, I can assure you that it is relatively easy and worth the small difficulty involved. It is also interesting to learn from this book that beurre blanc was also one of the sharpest weapons of Nouvelle Cuisine in banishing flour based sauces from restaurant sauces. So, with one fell swoop, you can be trendy, healthy, and haute cuisine with a single recipe.

370924:US	39134375	R5KC3FPKKIKYD	1888054956	831534506	Retro Baking: 100 Classic Contest Winners Updated for Today (Retro Series)	Books	4	16	19	N	Y	Buy the Book for the Kitch, not the Kitchen	`Retro Baking' by Maureen Fischer, a food columnist and editor at `women's' magazines has also been a judge at many traditional recipe contests. And, the recipes in this book are advertised, per the subtitle, to be winning recipes at these food contests, updated `for today'.<br /><br />This book is a booth in `comfort food central'. It does not contain many of the comfort food classics, even those classics which are baked such as macaroni and cheese and meat loaf, but it makes up for these with lots of other casserole recipes straight from the darkest 1950s, in the freedom which followed the lifting of World War II rationing and before the great influx of foreign food influences spearheaded by Julia Child, Alice Waters, pizza shops, Hispanic immigrations, and Asian immigrations from Southeast Asia.<br /><br />For a list price of about $17, we get:<br /><br />Breads and Rolls - 17 recipes, primarily breakfast breads and variations on white bread with cheese.<br /><br />Savory Bakery - 15 recipes of casseroles with veal, chicken, salmon, bacon, and beef.<br /><br />Cookies - 20 recipes with lots of peanut butter and a nice assortment of press, drop, and roll cookies.<br /><br />Cakes - 19 recipes with several uncommon recipes and a few old standards such as chocolate cake.<br /><br />Pies - 15 recipes with lots of apple and other fruit pies and custard pies.<br /><br />Other Desserts - 15 recipes with cobblers, crumbles, upside down cakes.<br /><br />106 decent recipes for $17 is not too bad as most cookbooks go, if the recipes fit your needs and produce good results. I believe these recipes will produce good results if you are already an accomplished cook and baker. The instructions are typical of the kind of recipes you will find in a church fundraising cookbook. Among other things, it means that lots of things are inexact and there are lots of inconsistencies from one recipe to the next. For example, yeast is sometimes specified as `one packet' and sometimes as `2 ¼ teaspoons', even though these mean exactly the same thing. All yeast is `fast acting', but sometimes it is bloomed with warm water and sometimes it is dumped into the other ingredients as you would do with `instant yeast'. The temperature of the yeast blooming water is never more precise than `warm'. My point is that an experienced cook would take all of these things in stride, but an inexperienced cook may be tripped up by, for example, making the water too hot and kill the yeast. Other imprecision's are seen in not specifying the cut of meat to be used in many recipes. Probably the worst of the instructions are in heating meat. One instruction tells us to saute until tender. Saut&eacute;ing will never tenderize meat. As it becomes more thoroughly cooked, it will become firmer to the touch. Another very odd instruction has us browning a pork chop on one side, flipping it over, and going off to spend 15 minutes to prepare a relish with no instructions to take the poor chop off the heat to prevent it from drying out.<br /><br />But then again, you will not buy this book to learn how to cook or bake. For that task, there are excellent alternatives, my favorite light but thorough ones being Wayne Harley Brachman's `American Desserts' and Judith Fertig's `All American Desserts'. For savory baking, check out Jim Villas' `Crazy for Casseroles'. All three books are high on comfort and high on sound cooking instruction.<br /><br />The illustrations in this volume really tell the story that this book is about memories of the fifties. I am simply amazed that the book designers have been able to collect so many kitchy illustrations. While these are great to look at, they can be very misleading when it comes to figuring out the associated recipe. The picture on the page with the lemon pie recipe shows a lemon meringue pie, yet there is no trace of meringue in the recipe. Oops.<br /><br />I will give the author / editor a fair amount of credit for using almost exclusively fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables, in spite of illustrations showing canned fruit pie fillings, the recipes use fresh fruits. There is a fair representation of canned soups in some recipes, but nothing overbearing.<br /><br />The biggest surprise in the book is that there is not a single credit given to the people who came up with these recipes either with the recipe, in acknowledgments, or in a credits or bibliography page. There is not even a reference to where these recipes may have been published. While this book is a `fluff piece', part of a whole series of retro themed books, this does not excuse it, in my mind for either claiming to be something it is not, or failing to provide credit if it is in fact a compilation of contest winning recipes.<br /><br />These recipes will work if you are an experienced cook and will be very successful at clogging your arteries even if you are not an experienced cook. If you are in love with instant nostalgia, buy this book.

Not Perfect	`How to Cook Without a Book' by former `Cooks Illustrated' executive editor, Pam Anderson promises to teach us all to cook the way our mothers and grandmothers cooked, from memory, without consulting a cookbook except for the most obscure pastry measurement. And, at that, they usually owned but one cookbook. I had high expectations from this book, but I was not surprised when it turned out to be just a little disappointing.<br /><br />The most illuminating statement in this book is yet another confirmation of Tom Colicchio's premise in his book `How to Think Like a Chef', where he establishes the principle that chefs do not create recipes, then search for their ingredients to make the recipe; they look to see what they have on hand and create a recipe from these materials. This is why the Iron Chef premise is really a perfect exemplar of how chefs really work. Their source of inspiration may be what is good in the market or what they happen to have on hand in their walk-in. But, this is only half of the equation. Inspiration may arise from ingredients, but you need to know what to do with those ingredients. Presentation of methods for dealing with ingredients takes up the lion's share of the book.<br /><br />But getting back to the original premise, Anderson takes this premise to the logical, but not entirely satisfactory conclusion that one basis of cooking without a book is to have a well-stocked pantry, refrigerator, and freezer. While I am in the unusual position of having all the time I need to go to the market every day to shop for the day's meals, there was a time when I worked ten to twelve hours a day, and padded my larder with lots of staples such as pastas, beans, rice, canned vegetables, frozen meats, and the like. And, most of that stuff sat in the pantry until I threw it out. Stocking a pantry is a very good idea, but it should not be done from a list given to you by a cookbook author, no matter how good her credentials or how worthy her rationale is for the list. I have it on the authority of no less than Madhur Jaffrey that the best way to build a pantry is to add to it those things that are parts of dishes you know you will make on a regular basis. Thus, being from a Pennsylvania Dutch background, I always have canned sauerkraut, canned dried corn, hot bacon dressing, and chow chow on hand, even though none of these items ever appear in a recommended pantry list.<br /><br />A second weakness with Anderson's implementation of her program is that her rationale behind cooking without a book is done in order to save time. This means that many of the recipes in the book are either simple in themselves or simplified versions of classic long cooking dishes. My favorite example of this for both its strengths and its weaknesses is her recipe for lasagna, which is certainly fast, using wonton wrappers in place of traditional Italian lasagna noodles. Her method is so far removed from the original dish that she admits that it really must be served almost immediately after cooking. This is not the lasagna I know and love, which will stoutly stand by on the sideboard or the buffet line for hours and will gladly be refrigerated to serve again another day. All of this lasagna virtue is given up in order to get a faster dish. I would sooner eat an alternative, easier baked pasta dish than have to deal with this ersatz dish.<br /><br />The concern with cooking time leads the author to violate some of the most sacred maxims of cookery, such as the recommendation to cook a pound of pasta in at least four quarts of boiling water. Ms. Anderson states that it takes a fairly long time to bring four quarts of water to a boil, and that two quarts will do the job quite nicely. All this in spite of the fact that Rachael Ray makes pasta in three out of five episodes of '30 Minute Meals' by bringing four quarts of water to a boil and still finishes the pasta dish well within her allotted half-hour.<br /><br />All these concerns do not eliminate the value of this book in presenting a wide variety of cooking methods and how to plug in different ingredients to a common method to get interesting, new results. This is exactly what Mario Batali did, for example, when presented with a lobster in one of his Iron Chef appearances. Molto Mario simply made lobster saltimbocca, a dish usually made with veal or chicken. Ms. Anderson presents 21 different methods, plus all their variations. And, many of these methods contain some genuinely useful ideas, such as the recommendation to make an omelet dinner for four by making one large eight egg omelet and cutting it into quarters rather than either buying four omelet pans or turning out an omelet every five minutes. With all this good stuff, I still have reservations, as when Ms. Anderson lumps together Broccoli, Cabbage, Squash, and Potatoes in a single category, giving the impression that these four vegetables can be cooked in the same way in a pasta dish with `firm vegetables'. This ignores another prime chef's skill in knowing the differences between ingredients and how to coax the very best out of each ingredient.<br /><br />Ms. Anderson's lesson is a very good one. I just think that while she may have given one alternative to people who have to cook and may not embrace the task, she has taken a lot of the fun and interest out of cooking for someone who relishes cooking. One may get the same lesson with fewer questionable shortcuts from either Colicchio or Alton Brown's `I'm Only Here for the Food'.<br /><br />Recommended for good ideas and techniques, as long as you know the difference between the good and the bad ideas.do not eliminate the value of this book in presenting a wide variety of cooking methods and how to plug in different ingredients to a common method to get interesting, new results.

However, there are several reasons for selecting one of these books over the other depending on your needs at the time. Two books, `Rose's Christmas Cookies' and `Field Guide to Christmas Cookies' are dedicated to Christmas cookies, so you may only want these if you bake cookies only around Christmas, except that the first of the two books by Rose Levy Beranbaum has a great introduction to baking cookies in general. One of these books, `The All American Cookie Book' by Nancy Baggett is dedicated, obviously, to American cookie recipes, including some of the very best recipes for chocolate chip cookies and the Pennsylvania Dutch specialities. The `King Arthur Cookie Companion' and Carol Walter's `Great Cookies' are both superb general cookie books, although the King Arthur writers give a much better introduction to cookie making in general. King Arthur and Rose Levy Beranbaum do the best job, in general, on the cookie tutorial at the beginning of the book. So where does Nick Malgieri's book fit in?<br /><br />For starters, while Malgieri's book does cover several famous American cookie types such as the chocolate chip and the Pennsylvania Dutch sugar cookie, he devotes much space to a lot of classic French, Austrian, and Italian cookies. If you could have but two cookie cookbooks, this book paired with Nancy Baggett's `All American' book would do a good job of covering the subject worldwide.<br /><br />Malgieri also does not give us the in-depth tutorial we get from King Arthur, Beranbaum, and Carole Walter. Instead, we get a seven (7) page no nonsense survey of ingredients, equipment, and technique which I strongly urge you to read before doing any of the recipes. As a former chemist, I am a pretty good baker, as I am expert at weighing and measuring. My downfall usually comes when I mix things, as the rule of the day in chemistry is that things be mixed thoroughly. As with biscuits and pastry dough, many cookie doughs are better mixed lightly, leaving a certain coarseness in the mix so that the baking cookies are not leavened too much by the sugar's creating little air pockets in the creamed butter. As counterintuitive as this sounds, I am taking Herr Malgieri's word on this as he is the baking instructor and I am not.<br /><br />My general experience with Malgieri's books is that except for yeast bread baking, it is to him I always look first for a particular recipe for things like cakes, pies, and quick breads. Now that I have this book, I am sure I will come to him first for cookies as well, since I have never been disappointed with my implementing any of his recipes. The only weakness I have found in any of Malgieri's books is in the misleading title `How to Bake', which is much more a collection of really good recipes than a tutorial on baking technique. Malgieri simply knows how to write a recipe that is easy to follow and which delivers satisfactory results.<br /><br />`Cookies Unlimited' is organized in the same way as Carole Walter's book, by style of baking. That is, his chapters are on:<br /><br />Bar Cookies<br /><br />Drop Cookies<br /><br />Refrigerator Cookies<br /><br />Rolled Cookies<br /><br />Piped Cookies<br /><br />Macaroons<br /><br />Molded Cookies<br /><br />Biscotti<br /><br />Fried Cookies<br /><br />Filled and Sandwich Cookies<br /><br />Wafers<br /><br />Crackers and Savory Cookies<br /><br />Fillings, Icings, and Glazes<br /><br />Decorating Projects, including a great plan for making a gingerbread house from scratch.<br /><br />Walter's book is organized around a smaller number of topics, not quite as neatly summarized. Choosing between these two books is not easy. They cost the same, they are of similar lengths, and both contain high quality recipes. Neither book gives pictures for all their recipes, but Walter's pictures are just a little better. Both books make a great virtue of giving us recipes from colleagues and friends. So much so in Malgieri's part that the book begins to look like the publication of his personal cookie recipe box. In fact, Walter's book contains a Malgieri recipe and Malgieri's book contains a Walter recipe. Malgieri gives us a very nice little page of lists of recipes by country. Oddly, this list does not include American recipes, in spite of the obviously American source for some of the recipes.<br /><br />Overall, I believe Carole Walter's book (and the King Arthur book) is superior if you are really serious about learning everything there is to know about cookie baking; however, I think Nick Malgieri's book is as good a source of a wide variety of recipes, especially from international sources. And, it gives a somewhat better coverage of some specialized topics such as Springerle cookies imprinted with a German or Swiss rolling pin or mold and his very nice little gingerbread house. The single most useful theme I found in Malgieri's book was his doing some classic cookie types in several different ways, as when he does the classic Linzer cookie as a sheet, a roll, or a traditional square.<br /><br />I also suspect that for the casual cookie baker, Malgieri's book may be slightly better as a simple collection of very good recipes from a wide variety of sources, including most of the famous cookies from around the world such as Madelaines, Arnhem cookies, Springerles, Zeppole, Linzer cookies, Pizzele, and Wiener Mandelgipferl (Almond Crescents).<br /><br />If you love cookie baking, get all of these books. If you simply want a good source of unusual cookies, Malgieri's book will do the job for you.<br /><br />Recommended.ue of giving us recipes from colleagues and friends.

Fisher was one of her last autobiographical memoirs of life in France. She may not have invented the `American in Europe' memoir exemplified by Mark Twain's \\"The Innocents Abroad\\" and Frances Mayes `Under the Tuscan Sun', but she certainly helped define the genre with this work as well as `Map of Another Town', `A Considerable Town', and parts of many of her other autobiographical works such as `The Gastronomical Me'.<br /><br />The events in this book, covering much of the first three years of Ms. Fisher's life with her first husband, Al Fisher, spent in a private boarding house in Dijon while hubby Fisher was completing his doctoral dissertation at the University in Dijon. The period of this book occupies a scant seven pages in `Poet of the Appetites', the biography of Ms. Fisher by Joan Reardon, yet the original book reveals practically nothing about the life of husband and wife Fisher. It certainly does not give any clue to why they ended up in Dijon, since their original intention was to study at the more prestigious university in Strasbourg.<br /><br />This is the first complete work of M.F.K. Fisher's I have read and I feel just a little disappointment. The word pictures of living and eating in Dijon are certainly illuminating, but there is practically none of the humor you find in the books from Mayles and Mayes. There is also less of the scintillating writing I have sampled in some of her more famous pieces. By the author's own admission, much of this material is also a reworking of material from earlier published works as much as it is new stuff mined from her journals of this period.<br /><br />The most obvious omission is a sense of the troubling times in which these events take place. The three years covered in the narrative are from 1929 through 1931, yet there is virtually no mention of the great depression as it affects Dijon, let alone how it affects the writer and her husband. Oddly, the same is true of Fisher's life as described by her biographer. Fisher's father was the editor, publisher, and owner of a small newspaper in California who did much to subsidize the student life of the young Fishers and of Mary Frances through several difficult years between marriages. Yet, there is practically no mention of this in the writings by and about Fisher.<br /><br />This book is essential reading for anyone interested in Ms. Fisher's life and the influences on her writing, as she is easily, in the twentieth century American culinary world, the Wittgenstein to Julia Child's Einstein. That is the much lesser known theorist of culinary desire matched with the incomparable practitioner of culinary technique, both of whom got their inspiration from the food and cooking of France.<br /><br />Yet, compared to similar works by probably less talented writers, this book is just a bit flat and dusty, befitting its recollections of events over sixty years before in the author's life. The stories of life are illuminating. The stories of people are a little empty, as all characters other than Mary Frances herself are long gone from the stage.ame is true of Fisher's life as described by her biographer.

Buy It.	`Kinkead's Cookbook' by executive chef / owner Bob Kinkead is a restaurant cookbook which succeeds in giving us something genuinely new, or at least new to my world of knowledge about food. This places it high in the ranks of restaurant cookbooks I have reviewed over the last year. This is not a really big surprise, as Kinkead and his restaurant get lots of exposure on the Food Network as a `best of' place to eat in Washington, DC and with coverage of sous chef Tracy O'Grady's efforts at the Bocuse D'Or competition a few years back. From what I have seen of Kinkead before opening this book is that he is a talented, no nonsense chef with a real concern for the success of independent restaurants throughout the country, not just his own establishments.<br /><br />The main contribution of this book to the amateur's understanding of seafood is the fact that the average consumer simply cannot routinely purchase the same quality of fish as are routinely bought by leading restaurants. This is simply a matter of who gives the suppliers their best business. A DC housewife may spend $50 a week at her local fishmonger. Kinkead's will spend $50,000 in that same week, with deliveries being inspected by experts in picking out fish. The housewife will buy things that may have been on ice for two to four weeks from the time the fish was caught. The restaurant has a good chance of obtaining fish that was caught about a week ago. All this makes me wonder why no one has brought this up before. It seems a lot of talk about fish buying, including the trips by such luminaries as Wolfgang Puck and Masaharu Morimoto to the docks to inspect fish are largely photo ops. These senior chefs simply do not do this on a regular basis. Aside from the straight scoop on fish buying realities, Kinkead gives all the usual advice, in a bit greater depth than most sources, on evaluating the freshness of fish at the market. His primary contribution to our practical approach to fish is to buy it whole and butcher the little beauties ourselves.<br /><br />Another of Kinkead's major contributions to our insights about high end restaurants is the fact that dozens of things contribute to the success or failure of a new restaurant, many having no connection with the quality of the food. He reels these off without giving a whole lot of advice on how to control them, but he does use these to make the pitch for supporting independent restaurants instead of going to large chain restaurants. The former is about good food. The latter is about money.<br /><br />Kinkead also gives a brief exposition on what makes a good cook. This information is not terribly new, as it identifies Taste, Mastery of Fire, Knowledge of Chemistry, and skills with Tools, especially knives as the cornerstones of good chef skills. The most notable item on this list is that Kinkead is endorsing scientific understanding as a contribution to good cooking, not just thorough practical knowledge of how food behaves.<br /><br />As far as how Kinkead expects us to approach his recipes, he states that he owns about 1200 cookbooks, and except for some pastry recipes, he has never followed any of the recipes in these books, in spite of being entirely self taught. Thus, this very candid author is not expecting a reader to pick out a specific recipe and follow it to the letter. He is also quite candid in saying that many of these recipes are difficult and require some skill in the kitchen. This is not a cookbook for the novice. This is not to say that a novice cannot learn from it. One of my favorite examples of professional wisdom is in the recipe for crab cakes, a Chesapeake Bay standard if there ever was one. Up until the moment I read this recipe, I always thought the standard method for cooking a crab cake was to pan fry it in about a half inch of oil. Kinkead says the heavily preferred methods are sautee or broiling. Who knew?<br /><br />Except for the desserts, the large majority of recipes in this book is forfish and shellfish entrees, appetizers, and amuse bouche. And, as you may expect, the catch and the traditions of the Chesapeake Bay heavily influence the seafood dishes. There is also something of an Irish influence in the vegetable and side dishes, with excellent potato recipes including a gratin, champ, Matthew potatoes, and potato, cabbage, and leek strudel. The meat entrees are evenly divided between fowl, rabbit, lamb, and beef.<br /><br />I often consider the space a restaurant cookbook dedicates to `Basics' to be a waste of space. But, like Thomas Keller's `Bouchon' book, Kinkead makes this section complete enough to make an excellent reference for other books of fish recipes. Not only does Kinkead cover a lot of preparations which others leave out, he gives details on preparations which others leave out such as the advice to remove the gills from fish heads before using them in stock cooking. While I often use an author's stock recipes as a means of judging their book, I must take Kinkead's recipes as the voice of authority; a yardstick against I would measure other books. He simply does not violate any rules I have seen on stocks, and gives me a few I didn't know.<br /><br />Kinkead offers a number of interesting sidebars on a large variety of things including wine service and types of fish. He is also an advocate of low to moderate heat when saut&eacute;ing. I add him to Tom Colicchio and others who disagree with teachers like Mario Batali who often speaks of `screeching hot' pans.<br /><br />If you like cooking fish and shellfish, you must buy this book.

381716:US	39134375	R1JEA7I5UVFT4I	0471214620	699448079	Cakes to Dream On: A Master Class in Decorating	Books	4	208	216	N	Y	Great Cake Designs. Good Book for Professionals	`Cakes to Dream On', subtitled `A Master Class in Decorating' by major American pastry artist and teacher, Colette Peters has the ambition to be an advanced class in multi-tiered cake decorating. This ambition is not to be taken lightly, as there is very little in this book for the amateur home / bake sale cook. This is not to say that the book is not chocked full of great ideas, if you already know a lot about how to work with royal icing, fondant, marzipan, and multi-layered cakes. I have made a two and three layered birthday cake in my day, but these creations are entirely out of my league.<br /><br />The book consists of four general parts. The first part is the first chapter on `How to Make a Decorated Cake', which covers materials to use as the base of a multi-layered cake, who to reinforce the layers, and how to make crooked cakes on purpose. For those few of you out there who actually make tiered cakes, this is one of the more useful topics, although I confess much of it is pretty common sensical.<br /><br />The second part of the book is the next eight (8) chapters, which are almost all alike in being simply collections of decorated cakes done by the author and her company with instructions on how to make these cakes and their decorations. The instructions assume the person making the cake has access to a lot of specialized tools, materials, and specialized training. One decorated cake chosen at random requires:<br /><br />Fondant<br /><br />Tracing Wheel<br /><br />Gumpaste Ribbon Roses and Leaves<br /><br />Royal Icing dots on wires (oh my)<br /><br />Luster dust<br /><br />Royal Icing<br /><br />Gumpaste Pearls<br /><br />Three foamboard circles<br /><br />Foamboard base<br /><br />Gumpaste curly hearts<br /><br />Lemon Extract<br /><br />Piping bag and #2 tip<br /><br />Oval shaped dragees<br /><br />Paintbrush<br /><br />Descriptions of how to construct several of the cakes include printed templates for preparing some of the designs on the cake. I find these particularly unhelpful, as they require one to have an enlarging photocopier handy to enlarge the diagrams on heavy paper from which they can be cut and used as a template. Now I am certain that a commercial pastry shop would have such a copier, so this reinforces my impression that this book is really meant primarily as an idea source for other pastry professionals.<br /><br />The third section is recipes for cakes and icings. One is likely to find as good or better recipes for these things in books by Maida Heatter, Nick Malgieri, or Rose Levy Beranbaum. If your primary interest is in baking birthday cakes or bakesale cakes, I strongly suggest you get Beranbaum's `The Cake Bible' (which happened to win best cookbook of the year from the IACP a few years back) instead of investing in this book which works much better as coffee table decoration than as a manual for cake baking. Beranbaum includes such things as candy and nut embellishments, food processor fondant, rolled fondant, chocolate fondant, pastillage, rose modeling paste, crystal flowers, as well as her extensive recipes for cake, fillings, and icings.<br /><br />The fourth section has a title suggesting that now the `master class' in techniques really begins. This chapter includes short sections on which one could easily write a whole book, such as:<br /><br />Mixing paste colors into Fondant<br /><br />Painting with Powdered Colors<br /><br />Airbrushing a cake<br /><br />Fondant Decorations<br /><br />Gumpaste Decorations<br /><br />Piping Techniques<br /><br />Run-in Sugar<br /><br />Brush Embroidery<br /><br />Making Edible Crystal Beads<br /><br />Sugar Beads<br /><br />Basic Techniques<br /><br />- Dividing a Round Cake evenly for Decorating<br /><br />- Sculpting a Cake<br /><br />- Getting Cakes from Here to There<br /><br />Quick Reference Guide to Tools and Ingredients<br /><br />Without a doubt, Ms. Peters' cakes are knockouts and her photographs and techniques are chocked full of ideas for professionals. Jacques Torres and Ewald Notter are not going to endorse just anyone's book. It is just that her book is simply not very well organized to teach people with modest skills and objectives.<br /><br />So, if your objective is to daydream or to open a professional decorated cake store, this book is for you. If you simply want to improve your cake baking and decorating skills a bit, get Beranbaum's book and an inexpensive pamphlet on cake decorating from Wilton at your nearest hobby mart.is simply not very well organized to teach people with modest skills and objectives. <br /> <br />So, if your objective is to daydream or to open a professional decorated cake store, this book is for you.

Read it all!	`the weekend baker' by baking teacher and `Fine Cooking' editor Abigail Johnson Dodge' has succeeded in the very difficult task of giving us baking recipes which can be insinuated into the busy schedules of people who still find the need to bake. Ms. Dodge has taken up the challenge and has succeeded in showing us how to bake some really very respectable desserts in a relatively short time without compromising quality. In the process, Miss Abigail has reinforced one of Rachael Ray's cardinal lessons. You simply cannot cook or bake successfully without knowing what you are doing and without some planning. In fact, to bake quickly or `intermittently' (more on this later), you actually need better planning than if you pick up a recipe from a conventional baking book and go to it.<br /><br />Ms. Dodge has really accomplished a major feat with this book in that she has simplified several major types of baking without compromising on the quality of her presentation and without leaving any pitfalls unmarked for the unsuspecting newbie. For those of you who know baking books, do not expect the kind of details on ingredients, variations, equipment, and techniques which you may find in a book by baking heavyweights such as Flo Brakker, Rose Levy Beranbaum, Nick Malgieri, Alice Medrich, or Gayle Ortiz. The author's entire focus is on presenting recipes that work under certain time constraints. The odd result of very successfully achieving this objective is that many of the recipes are even longer than their analogues that are not written to conserve time. This reinforces my statement that to cook or bake when time is of the essence, you need more knowledge and more planning than with conventional recipes.<br /><br />Thus, while almost every presentation of general advice on cooking has you read the recipe though before beginning, Ms. Dodge insists that you read through the recipe at least three times. For scatterbrain know-it-alls like me who think they know better than the recipe writer, I would up that count to at least five times. Whenever you cook or bake at home, you want to minimize time pressure, especially when you are working through a recipe for the first time.<br /><br />Like almost every cookbook with a theme I have reviewed recently, Ms. Dodge does not stick limit herself to the scenario suggested by her title; however, she has done such a good job of realizing the task set in her subtitle, `irresistible recipes, simple techniques, and stress-free strategies for busy people' that I will not carp on her straying from the weekend paradigm. But, in order for you to get the very best benefit from Ms. Dodge's book, you really must read all the introductory material and the general material that opens the recipe section from which you plan to bake a recipe. For starters, there are Ms. Dodge's guidelines on how to use the book on page 16 of the introduction, just before she describes her three types of recipes. Also, one really needs to read the notes on equipment and ingredients. These sections succeed at attaining that fine balance between what you really need to know and what may be useful to know, but won't hurt if you don't.<br /><br />The three recipe classes Ms. Dodge has worked up for time sensitive situations follow.<br /><br />First, there are `baker's express' recipes which can be prepared in a hurry. These are all recipes which can actually be done in about an hour, the time you may have between arriving home after work and the time the desserts may be needed after dinner. This chapter opens with ten tips on what makes a fast baking recipe. All these tips are concise and common sensible, but they cannot be used without some knowledge and experience. You cannot bake in shallow pans unless you have acquired these pans in advance. You cannot substitute baking on the stovetop unless your recipe has been tweaked to work in this situation. You cannot use the microwave unless you know all the dangers associated with running ittoo long with sensitive ingredients such as butter or chocolate. These tips may go a long way toward enabling you to convert a conventional recipe into an express recipe, but not without the leisure to think things through and write out the steps when you are not under time pressure.<br /><br />Second, there is `baking in stages' where the total time required to complete a baking job may be several hours or even a day or more, but the time you actually need to attend to the baking is a small fraction of this time. The paradigm of this type of baking is yeast-leavened goods. Yeast doughs just naturally have long rest periods where they rise. And, refrigerating the rising dough for part or all of this time can slow these rising times. Ms. Dodge's book is not the place for dealing with thorough discussion of bread baking, but it is ironic that slowing the dough's rise is commonly considered one of the best ways to improve the flavor of the bread.<br /><br />Third, there are `productions', where time ceases to be an issue and the primary object is to impress your audience. As these products involve more elaborate techniques, the author introduces some new equipment, but retains a lot of her focus on achieving big results with simple techniques. My favorite example is her three-layer carrot cake that requires but one baking pan, with layers created by partitioning the sheet into three parts.<br /><br />This book will not replace your favorite Maida Heatter recipes, but it will go a long way toward making you a more nimble baker when you want to impress on short notice.<br /><br />This book is highly recommended for people who really want to bake, but feel they do not have the time. Baking still requires time, knowledge, and equipment, but Ms. Dodge shows you how to get the most out of a short supply of time.

383678:US	39134375	R1XQKAQUE0MPQK	0375407219	532336785	Spice: The History of a Temptation	Books	5	15	16	N	Y	Important Explanation of the Rise and Fall of Spice Envy	`Spice - The History of a Temptation' by historian Jack Turner is a work of cultural and culinary history which is `culinary' in much the same sense as the writings of M.F.K. Fisher are not about cooking, but about hunger or desire for food. History of food is not as useful to the average amateur cook as food science, but ignorance of food history can lead to misstatements about food as easily as ignorance of food science can lead to misstatements about how cooking works. One of my most fascinating observations in my reading of several books on Medieval and Renaissance cooking was the pervasive appearance of spices in recipes from the twelfth to the fifteenth centuries. And, this prevalence was not only in the Mediterranean, but also as far north as England and Scandinavia. Conventional wisdom regarding modern cuisine says that the cookie spices (cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and ginger) are common in savory dishes of the southernmost reaches of Europe such as Sicily, Crete, and Greece plus the great Renaissance trading ports such as Venice. Yet, here we have French kings and nobles in Paris using as much of these spices as the merchant kings of Venice and Genoa.<br /><br />Our author and scholar answers this question and a lot more in this delightfully written and thoroughly researched book. Mr. Turner's writing may not be up to the level of M.F.K. Fisher, but it is every bit as good as the quality of writing in the typical journalism in depth pieces which appear regularly in The New Yorker. We can thank the wisdom of the editors at Knopf for giving us an excellent work of popular history on a subject which turns up now and then on food shows such as `Molto Mario' and Alton Brown's `Good Eats'.<br /><br />One piece of conventional wisdom that the author dispels is the claim that spices were used to mask the bad taste and odor of spoiling food. In fact, it is much more logical to believe that food preservation by drying and salting was far advanced by 1200 CE The problem was not with spoiled food as with dull, salty, dry food in the winter. And, this problem was primarily a problem of the rich. Before 1600, the diet of the wealthy landowner was based almost exclusively on meat, preferably game. Fruits were avoided except as themselves a type of spice, since they were thought to be the source of undesirable humors. Vegetables were avoided as being the food for the common folk. This happens to be an eminent confirmation of the description of modern European cuisine, especially Italian cuisine, which is heavily vegetarian, as the cuisine of poverty.<br /><br />So, the oriental spices were commonly used widely throughout Europe to liven food. And, my reading of aforementioned Medieval and Renaissance cookbooks with recipes from England and France confirms that these spices were used in virtually every dish. While much of the use was done to enliven salty, dry meats, an equal attraction of these spices, including pepper and citrus fruits was simply because they were rare and expensive. This situation is almost identical to the great interest in tulips in the 17th and 18th centuries, when people would pay the price of a comfortable house simply to own a single unusual tulip bulb. And, spices were expensive because they were almost all available from a very few south Asian islands, appropriately named the `Spice Islands'. And, as we all know, this was one of the major forces behind the Age of Discovery which opened with the voyages of Italian Christopher Columbus to the West and Portuguese Vasco da Gama to the South and East. Turner covers the relative success of these two explorers in some detail, but this book is about the spices, not about the explorers.<br /><br />While my interest is primarily culinary, the book devotes two sizable chapters to spices used as perfumes and medicines as, for example, aphrodisiacs, and spices used as aids to spiritual rituals, as spices in incense censors. Both of these chapters maintain the high levelof scholarship and readability. The author also covers in detail the roles of the Portuguese, the Dutch, the French, and the English in the struggle to control the spice trade. That the Dutch won this explains the tact that much of Indonesia was once a Dutch colony.<br /><br />So, if, as the author thoroughly explains, spices have been transplanted around the world and are now much cheaper than they once were, why are they not even more commonly used than they were 500 years ago? Two reasons for the drop in spice interest are evident in their original attraction. If spices are much less rare, they are less interesting as a medium of conspicuous consumption. This interest, along with the interests of merchants, moved on to gold, jewels, furs, tea, and coffee. Also, the rise of better methods of food preservation lowered the need for spices to perk up dull meats. This was joined by a rising interest in the nobility for vegetables in their diets, prompted by Renaissance cooking writers (see `The Art of Cooking' by Martino of Como). But, the most interesting reason for the disappearance of the infatuation in the rich with Asian spices was the arrival of foods from the New World, most especially coffee, chocolate, tobacco, and the capsicum peppers or chiles. I was immensely pleased by the author's statement that the strength of heat from these little New World lovelies simply blew Asian black, white, and green peppers clear out of the water. Their cultivation spread so fast that some Europeans even thought they originated in Asia, since they grew so well in any reasonably hospitable climate.<br /><br />If you are keen on having a good understanding of culinary history, you must read this book. If you just happen to like history, you will enjoy every page and wish there were more. I look forward to scholar Turner's next book!h level of scholarship and readability.

Buy It	'50 Chowders' by noted New England chef and writer, Jasper White may not be among my top five favorite cookbooks, but it is certainly on my list of 25 cookbooks which must be on a shelf in my kitchen. My experience with making the recipes in this book is so good, I will waive any complaint about getting only 50 chowder recipes for a list price of $30, at least twice the cost per recipe from a `name' cookbook author.<br /><br />The charm of this book extends far beyond its recipes, as it inherits an interest for the reader from its subject. Chowders easily rank as one of the great New World dishes, along with barbecue, chili and ceviche. As the author points out at the beginning of the book, a chowder is not a soup, even though it shares many similarities to some famous soups such as minestrones and bouillabaisse in being thick and being based on seafood. But, a chowder is neither a soup nor a stew, yet an exact definition is almost impossible. The meaning of `chowder', like the meaning of the word `games' is so slippery that almost every definition you can imagine may slip through your hands with a valid counterexample. This is where the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein introduced the notion of family resemblance. Each chowder example shares several similarities to a related soup which is also a chowder, but it also exhibits differences from some chowders as well as differences from non-chowder soups and stews.<br /><br />Virtually the only essential ingredient seems to me to be salt pork. The next most important ingredient is a starch from potato, biscuit, or corn. The third most definitive ingredient is probably a seafood (shell or fin) protein. Even this third element is not essential, as this book contains some chowders where the protein critter source has never willingly stuck its feet or wing into water.<br /><br />The first chapter in this book provides a really excellent set of recipes for nine (9) different stocks, including six (6) for fish stocks. These nine are in addition to the fifty chowder recipes proper and include a strong fish stock, a traditional fish stock, clam and mussel broths, lobster stock, crab stock, chicken stock, chicken broth, and beef stock or broth. The only thing I miss here is a corn broth, although White's recipes do use cleaned corncobs to add corny flavor to chicken stocks used in the corn chowders.<br /><br />The last chapter provides ten (10) recipes for `Chowder Companions', dishes commonly eaten with chowder. The only thing I would expect on this list that I miss is a recipe for crackers. But, we get lots of good quickbread recipes for garlic toast, buttermilk biscuits, cheddar cheese biscuits, Parker House rolls, anadama bread, corn bread, corn sticks, corn fritters, clam fritters, and salt cod fritters. White is true to his New England roots, as his biscuit recipe comes from Vermont native, Christopher Kimball rather than from a cook with a Southern accent such as Shirley Corriher or Edna Lewis. These ten recipes also do not count toward the fifty chowder recipes.<br /><br />Between these two `extras' there are four chapters with the fifty recipes for fish, clam, other shellfish, and `farmhouse' chowders. The scant fifty recipes suddenly becomes more like 150 when we realize that each chowder recipe is augmented with one or more variations to the basic recipe. And, each basic recipe is presented in such a way that if one central ingredient is not available, another can be substituted with virtually no loss of quality. In the recipe for New England Fish Chowder, for example, the author points out that either cod or haddock will do well as the primary fishy protein, with haddock being just a little firmer and less likely to flake, giving larger chunks of fish in the finished soup.<br /><br />I personally find the instructions for these recipes to be about as carefully written as you can imagine. This means that the procedures seem a bit long, but they are not difficult. Recall that chowders were created to be made on fishing boats with the most basic ingredients you can possibly imagine, by cooks which never saw the inside of a cooking school, long before the birth of either August Escoffier or even Antonin Careme. These were ship's cooks who needed homespun techniques to coax a good taste out of extremely simple ingredients. But, these recipes are not historical reconstructions as you may find in the writings of White's great friend and fellow chowder scholar, John Thorne. I sense that almost all of these recipes started as someone's traditional meal, but chef White has gilded each one to take advantage of fresh herbs and vegetables. And yet, I can find practically no other ingredient beyond the basic salt pork, potatoes, dairy product, basic protein, and basic vegetables such as leeks, corn, tomatoes, and celery. The book also goes out of its way to spell out in advance all he special cooking tools you will need to make each main recipe.<br /><br />The very best thing I can say about the book as a whole is that it is equally pleasant to simply read it as it is to cook from it and taste it's excellent dishes.<br /><br />Very highly recommended.ll that chowders were created to be made on fishing boats with the most basic ingredients you can possibly imagine, by cooks which never saw the inside of a cooking school, long before the birth of either August Escoffier or even Antonin Careme.

387131:US	39134375	R2IKO50RCSSIPJ	0520232712	726188706	The Art of Cooking: The First Modern Cookery Book (California Studies in Food and Culture)	Books	5	13	16	N	Y	How to Serve a Fire Breathing Dragon for Dinner. Great Read	`The Art of Cooking' was written by the fifteenth century Italian Renaissance chef identified as `The Eminent Maestro Martino of Como'. This is a truly impressive and fascinating piece of culinary scholarship published in the `California Studies in Food and Culture' by the University of California Press. For serious foodies, this book documents several trends which dozens of food writers often repeat with no historical support. The book contains four major sections by three different scholars.<br /><br />The text from Maestro Martino himself is translated by Jeremy Parzen, a food historian and musician (I will wager that his musical speciality is the Renaissance). Fifty modern versions of Maestro Martino's recipes are interpreted by Stefania Barzini, a Roman food historian and journalist for Italy's National Food Channel (Shades of Molto Mario). The Introduction, endnotes, and textual editing are done by Luigi Ballerini, a poet, translator, scholar, and instructor of medieval and modern Italian at the University of California.<br /><br />By far the most engaging part of this volume is the introduction that chronicles Maestro Martino's career and his times in Renaissance Italy. Allowing for the rather dryly scholarly presentation, this often reads like a pitch for a cinematic costume drama starring Tyrone Power or Errol Flynn, with the evil cardinal played by Orson Wells or Sydney Greenstreet. All this steps right out of the pages of Machiavelli's `The Prince'. So much so that Machiavelli even shows up as a character in the story of Martino's career. As a journeyman scholar, I can attest to the fact that the story is thoroughly documented so that anyone wishing to pick up where these authors left off will find plenty of material to establish a starting point.<br /><br />From a culinary point of view, the most interesting facts spelled out by the introduction show that modern trends in decorative plating are a faint shadow of the kinds of extravagances created by chefs to the princes of the Italian city states and the cardinals, the princes of the church, who were often as wealthy as their secular brethren. The most important contribution of Maestro Martino appears to be the introduction of vegetables from the peasants' cuisine into the meat laden dining of the nobility. This confirms all the talk from experts of contemporary Italian cuisine that this is based heavily on the food of poverty, but it does not refute the very important observation by Paula Wolfert that one of the requirements for the rise of a great cuisine is a nobility and the corps of chefs enlisted to serve them. A secondary contribution of Maestro Martino is the extent to which he standardized culinary terminology in Italy. This was an era in which no dialect on the Italian peninsula was dominant. It was hardly a few hundred years after the publication of Dante's Divine Comedy and Boccaccio's Decameron and the invention of moveable type. And, the unification of Italy was still almost 400 years off. The editor's citing this as an accomplishment reaffirms my concerns when I find culinary writers using the wrong term to describe certain cooking actions. This only reassures me that if words are not valued, the result is Babble.<br /><br />By far the most interesting experience I have in reading the recipes is in the similarities I see in these Renaissance dishes to the Medieval fare described in `The Medieval Kitchen', written originally in French by Odile Redon, Francoise Sabban, and Silvano Serventi. Both books document the love the 13th to 15th century nobility had for the `cookie spices', nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon, and sugar. These ingredients literally show up in virtually every dish. No wonder there was such an interest in finding a way to get these little darlings more cheaply. One can almost hear the echos when we read of Sicilian cooks and recipes which like to add nutmeg to their greens. This practice is not only hundreds of years old, it is `home grown'and not as much an influence from the Saracens as one may think. And, Maestro Martino's introducing local vegetables may have been one of the things which changed tastes away from Asian spices, although I suspect their rarity and the arrival of New World ingredients had a lot to do with this trend as well.<br /><br />As a source of no more than fifty recipes written so that a modern cook can follow them, this book will not be a very good practical cookbook, especially since the dishes will tend to be either too sweet or too tart for modern tastes. The modernized recipes really are best taken as a means of understanding the connection between Renaissance dishes and their modern equivalents. The only thing I would suggest to the scholars who gave us this really fascinating volume is that pairing the original recipe texts with the modern interpretation would have done much to show us what the original author said versus the modern interpretation of his recipe. I also missed a good recipe or explanation for `verjuice' which the Larousse Gastronomique describes as a sour extraction from grapes; very similar to the wine vinegars we use today.<br /><br />This book and some of the others I have read recently really fuel my interest in reading a good history of gastronomy. And, if I can't find one, this book is a totally welcome treatment of food of the nobility in Renaissance Italy.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone with scholarly interests.grown' and not as much an influence from the Saracens as one may think.

Based on the Beard / West Coast connection, the authors get a very nice blurb from senior Beard assistant Marion Cunningham.<br /><br />This is very much of a `comfort food' rather than a `gourmet' oriented book, with many of the potential weaknesses to which this kind of book can fall prey. The best thing about this book is that in spite of some weaknesses in keeping on message, this is a really nice book to have if you like cooking with cast iron cookware.<br /><br />The most obvious weakness in the book is that even though both the title and the subtitle, `Recipes for the Best Pan in Your Kitchen' suggest that the book is all about the classic ten (10) to twelve (12) inch skillet, the book actually contains recipes for a wide range of cast iron ware, including Dutch ovens, grills, griddles, popover pans, and special molds.<br /><br />The thing I miss most in this book is a clear explanation of why the seasoned cast iron skillet is better for some tasks than any other cookware material. My understanding is that well seasoned cast iron has the non-stick advantages of a Teflon coated pan without the weakness of teflon in giving a good sear or good color to saut&eacute;ed protein. Cast iron is not as responsive to heat changes as copper or aluminum, but this is its strong point when it comes to maintaining heat when you add room temperature or cold food to a hot pan. This advantage is especially good when you are cooking on an electric range, where the power to the heating coil turns on and off to maintain a particular level of heat. Thus, the heat in a pan on an electric element may fluctuate much more widely than the same pot on a gas burner. Another advantage is that cast iron is both virtually indestructible and unwarpable. So, a carefully maintained pan is good for one or more lifetimes, at least. According to Alton Brown's excellent `Gear for Your Kitchen', the down side of cast iron is that it is just a bit brittle so that it can literally shatter if dropped hard enough and it is prone to corrosion. It is also highly susceptible to rust, leading to pitting. And, if your seasoning is less than perfect, an acidic dish can easily leach iron from the pot, leading to an unpleasant taste.<br /><br />It you limit yourself to the recipes for the skillet, you may also feel that many of the recipes are not necessarily optimized in a cast iron skillet. While the cast iron pan is a real champ in saut&eacute;ing, browning, and cooking quickbreads such as pancakes, I think it's advantages really do not come into play when you are frying in oil or braising. While the authors briefly allude to enameled ware, I personally find that good enameled cast iron may be as good or better than bare cast iron for braising, especially the French `bistro pans' (flat two handled saute' pan shapes with heavy lids) and marmites (large casseroles with heavy lids). The authors' recipes clearly exceed their material when they give dishes such as a paella for which there are classic pan shapes and materials which are not cast iron.<br /><br />The recipes in this book are almost all relatively simple, with `just enough' detail to enable an experienced amateur cook to be able to execute them. These are not gourmet recipes. They are `good enough' for easy home cooking. This means the recipes include some probably mistaken cooking lore such as the notion that searing protein seals in moisture. It also includes instructions with almost comically mistaken statements such as the Pecan Sticky Buns recipe which instructs us to put the ingredients into a mixing bowl with a dough hook attachment. This will be easily understood by most to be referring to an electric mixer and attachment, but it demonstrates Sasquatch Books typical weaknesses in copy editing.<br /><br />On the positive side, I am really willing to accept the authors' opinion that a good cast iron pan is an excellent substitute for a wok for stir fried recipes. A cast iron pan will never go higher than the maximum temperature of the burner, but it will maintain a high temperature better than a thinner pan or a pan of more highly conductive material.<br /><br />The selection of recipes is wide enough so that this little book will go a long way toward filling several different cooking application niches. The two most useful applications by far are the recipes for breakfast and for outdoor cooking. In fact, the authors would have done well to devoting more space to outdoor cooking, as cooking over an open fire is where cast iron can really come into its own. And, the book does not limit itself to all the conventional classics. Some of the more interesting recipes for breakfast are the Dutch baby and the savory Dutch baby, both of which are dishes that fill the pan. Other dishes that fill the pan such as apple tarts and skillet breads are just the thing to have handy for outdoor cookery.<br /><br />There are some breads that I would not do in cast iron. I have reservations about an Irish soda bread getting the right kind of heat when baked in a pan with 3 inch high sides. The scones recipe is also a little suspect for the same reasons. The scones recipe is also suspect in that it calls for margarine instead of butter or lard and incorporates this fat with an electric mixer, where most pastry experts would call for the fat to be worked in carefully with the fingers or a pastry cutter.atch Books typical weaknesses in copy editing. <br /> <br />On the positive side, I am really willing to accept the authors' opinion that a good cast iron pan is an excellent substitute for a wok for stir fried recipes.

Too Expensive	`The Spiaggia Cookbook' by Tony and Cathy Mantuano is a Chicago Italian restaurant cookbook that aspires to be more than a souvenir of one's visit to the restaurant. The challenge to the reviewer is against what standard do we measure this book. The two which come to mind are Chicago's `Tru' by Rick Tramonto and `the Babbo Cookbook' by premier New York Italian chef / restaurateur Mario Batali.<br /><br />For starters, the Spiaggia book begins with Foreword by Chicago real estate and restaurant developer, Larry Levy who touts the Mantuanos for filling Levy's prime real estate at the head of Chicago's Golden Mile in a big new building with a classy restaurant which brings to life the Italian cuisine on the shores of Lake Michigan. This is only fitting, as `spiaggia' means `shore' in Italian. Mr. Levy celebrates the number of culinary celebrities that have dined at Spiaggia and found it good. Tony Mantuano follows with an introduction that recounts the year he and his wife spent in Italy staging at several restorantes and trattoria in preparation for the opening of Spaggia. The Intro also sings the usual hymns to fresh ingredients and authentic Italian dishes. I confess this kind of literary glad-handing never really impresses me except that it sets the stage for what the author is attempting to do with their book.<br /><br />Let me get the comparison to `Tru' out of the way quickly by saying that I would never recommend the `Tru' cookbook to anyone looking for a collection of handy recipes, as it is high end French technique with a huge dollop of Charlie Trotter / Thomas Keller innovation thrown in. In fact, I rate Tramonto's communicating his techniques superior to fellow Chicago chef Trotter. The Mantuanos, on the other hand do stay true to classic Italian techniques, if not necessarily Italian dishes. Therefore, for a lower price, `Tru' gives more high faluttin' technique for the buck, if that is what you want.<br /><br />`The Spiaggia Cookbook' and Batali's `The Babbo Cookbook' are exactly the same list price; however, Mario gives us 300 pages of recipes from the beginning of the antipasto chapter to the end of the Dolci chapter. The Mantuanos give us 150 pages for the same price. With regard to how `Italian' the recipes may be, I find it very odd to find recipes in `The Spiaggia Cookbook' calling for Japanese Kobe beef, Russian sevruga caviar, and French foie gras. In contrast, Mario strictly follows his philosophy of giving us recipes exactly as done in his restaurant, with true Italian ingredients, and, ingredients which are practically local to New York such as fiddlehead ferns from New England and New Orleans shrimp.<br /><br />`The Spiaggia Cookbook' makes much fuss over their Italian wines and local wines based on Italian grapes, yet the book gives us nothing on matching wines to the dishes. Mario also gives us no wine pairings, but then he doesn't run on about it in his book. Both books are organized according to the traditional courses in the Italian meal. These are antipasti, Primi (pasta, risotto, and soup), Secondi (main courses), Formaggi (cheese), and Dolci (desserts). I give Spiaggia extra points for giving us the titles of all their recipes in the Table of Contents at the front of the book. Regarding the layout of the recipe writing, I much prefer the Babbo style with numbered steps. It is simply much easier to follow by remembering you have finished step 4 and need to go on to step 5 rather than balancing a ruler on the page to mark your place in the text. I also found the conceit of two circles to punctuate some important sentences as a waste of printing costs. They distract more than they highlight.<br /><br />As far as the actual technique in the two books, I personally prefer Mario's recipes as I simply thing they are more genuinely Italian. As neither I nor Ruth Reichl can seem to get a reservation at Babbo, I like the idea that I can reproduce their recipes, but as an amateur student of Italian cuisine, I like it more that I can get real Italian and Italian style cooking in Babbo while I do not trust that the Mantuanos are giving us the genuine article. Spiaggia and Babbo have very few recipes in common, but both give us the recipe for potato gnocchi. Spiaggia roasts their potatoes and mixes potatoes, egg, and flour in a bowl. Babbo boils the potatoes with skins on and mixes potato, flour, and egg using the classic `well' or `fountain' method. As most Italians historically did not have ovens, I tend to believe the Babbo method is closer to the traditional method. This consideration may mean little to people who have eaten at Spiaggia and were impressed by the experience. But, for those of us who buy cookbooks and have no plans to be in Chicago in the near future, I think that for the price, this book does not measure up to the five star standard in Italian restaurant cookbooks.<br /><br />This is a good book, but there are better high-end Italian restaurant cookbooks to be had. I agree with other reviewers who praise the look of the book, but it is simply not 'best in show'.an cuisine, I like it more that I can get real Italian and Italian style cooking in Babbo while I do not trust that the Mantuanos are giving us the genuine article.

391275:US	39134375	R1NTMTHHXK7ILJ	1400050359	734440819	An Exaltation of Soups: The Soul-Satisfying Story of Soup, As Told in More Than 100 Recipes	Books	4	20	21	N	Y	Delightful Treatment of Soup Recipes and Traditions	`An Exaltation of Soups' is author Patricia Solley's published scrapbook of stories, proverbs, wit, wisdom, and recipes about soup. This is not my opinion. The author states this fact as clearly as you may please in her introduction. The author is far more of a researcher than she is a culinary professional, as she is chief of Research Communications and Public Relations for the FBI. Yes, that's the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington.<br /><br />In the spirit of being much more about the lore of soups than a culinary exploration as you will find in culinary specialists James Peterson and Barbara Kafka, the recipes are not organized by season or ingredient or thick versus thin or smooth versus chunky. They are organized by use. How do we human inventors of cooking over 10,000 years ago use this food preparation called soup?<br /><br />The first Part of four (4) is `Soup Basics'. It does not deal with soup cooking so much as with a speculative history of the origins of soup, a collection of soup proverbs and clich&eacute;s, a small collection of stories about soup, and recipes for soup stocks. This includes seven basic stock recipes plus a technique for clarifying stock and a technique for concentrating stock. While this collection has several stocks you may not easily find elsewhere such as a Hungarian chicken stock and a Japanese fish stock, all the recipes are relatively simple. Simpler, for sure, than what you may find from the CIA (Culinary Institute of America, not the foreign colleague of the FBI) textbook or cooking experts such as Jeremiah Tower or Judy Rodgers. They are much simpler than expert soup specialists such as Seattle's Michael Congdon, the author of the new recipe collection, `S.O.U.P.S'. But then, this book is not so much about cooking soups as soup's place in the goings and comings of various human communities.<br /><br />The second Part is `Soups of Passage'. Here is where the book comes into its own, as we are given recipes for various important events in our lives, or at least in the lives of members of some very important cultures. The four `passages' represented here are birth, confirmation, marriage, and death. It is no surprise that the largest selection by far are those recipes developed to celebrate marriage, including the famous Italian wedding soup with meatballs. Oddly, I seem to recall that the name of this soup with meatballs has less to do with a human wedding as it does with the wedding of ingredients.<br /><br />The third Part is `Soups of Purpose'. Here, unlike the preceding and following chapters, the soup recipes are constructed to accomplish a specific culinary objective, so that there is a connection between ingredients and cooking techniques and the soup's use other than simply tradition. The most famous of this breed is the `Les Halle Onion Soup', which I had the pleasure of sampling at a Les Halle bistro in Paris at 5:00 AM, along with the traditional glass of red wine. The author recounts a tale from Harold Pinter about the playwright's ending a night of carousing in Paris at a similar open air market bistro with fellow playwright Samuel Beckett, who was kind enough to let Pinter slip into a slumber with head on table while Beckett retrieved a large glass of water and bicarbonate of soda. Unfortunately, Ms. Solley says nothing about the tradition of red wine with the onion soup.<br /><br />The last and longest Part is `Soups of Piety and Ritual'. Unlike the second chapter, these are all soups dealing with a particular date or holiday that occurs every year. The holidays so honored are New Years Day, St. Tavy's Day (represented by a leek soup celebrating a Welsh saint), Eastertide (including soups for the carnival at the beginning of Lent, Lent, Holy Week, and Easter, Jewish Festivals (including soups for Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, Sukkot, and Passover), Islamic Festivals (Ramadan and Eid Al Fitr), Christmas, and Kwanzaa. I am really pleased to see recipes for Islamic festivals appear in an English book for general audiences. This is the second such book I have seen. The first is Nigella Lawson's new book `Feast'. It is great fun to see how important the soup borsht is, as at least two different recipes, one Russian and one Jewish, appear in the book.<br /><br />Aside from the fun to be found in reading the sidebars, headnotes, and other commentary about soup, the most useful function of this book would be as a source of recipes to fit various events in one's life. Many writers make a great deal of how food brings people together over the dinner table. This benefit is doubled if one can prepare dishes behind which there are centuries of tradition. While bread can probably outdo soup as a type of food that is most heavily wrapped in tradition, soup certainly seems to have the edge on most other types of cooking. What makes this especially useful in this context is that almost all the recipes are relatively easy. This being the case, there is some chance that these are not the very best recipes possible for these dishes. But, the book has still served its purpose if you are looking for an Italian Lenten soup and you find `Minestrone di magro'. If you are not satisfied with Ms. Solley's recipe, you can always fetch a copy of a recipe from Marcella Hazan or Lydia Bastianich. At least if you don't have a cookbook for foods of the Middle East, you at least have these five Arab influenced recipes for Ramadan.<br /><br />One feature where Ms. Solley really missed the boat was in her not including a bibliography of other books on soup recipes. The book ends with all her literary credits in place, but no citations of good books on Soup. So, only four stars for this omission and to alert potential buyers that this book is more about lore than about gourmet cooking.festivals appear in an English book for general audiences.

392188:US	39134375	R293ETFAXDC1J9	1570614261	976613380	S.O.U.P.S.: Seattle's Own Undeniably Perfect Soups	Books	5	9	10	N	Y	Excellent Soup Recipes. Less than Excellent Editing. Buy It	`S.O.U.P.S' by Michael Congdon, with a subtitle of `Seattle's Own Undeniably Perfect Soups' reinforces the picture we in less benighted metropolis that Seattle is challenging New York, New Orleans, San Francisco, and Houston as a major national presence in good food service. It must be all those Microsoft business lunches! This book is a welcome; quality addition to the literature on soup making and it is notable for both its great accomplishments and its weaknesses.<br /><br />Good soup books seem to come in two flavors. The `upper tier' of books by major American culinary writers and figures such as Barbara Kafka, James Peterson, and Jasper White, published by Wiley and Scribners cover all the classics and the authors' variations on classic recipes. The lower tier by, for example, Paulette Mitchell, the `Daily Soup' chef/owners, and our current author Conned, published by new, small publishers such as Hyperion, Chronicle, and Sasquatch Books present collections of soup recipes which are honed to a fine edge in small restaurants over a long time.<br /><br />The most obvious question is whether Herr Congdon's soups live up to their billing as `perfect soups'. My humble opinion is that the soups produced by these recipes are very, very good, at the cost of a level of effort that may be beyond most home cooks on most days of the week. Thus, what Congdon has done is to give us a collection of excellent recipes for special occasions. He has enhanced his presentation by giving us the recipes by season, and I find no violations to his suggestions for cooking seasonally. His recipes are very similar to soups done in New York's `The Daily Soup Cookbook', where every soup is meant to be the center of a complete meal. There are practically no soups like some in books by Kafka and Peterson that may be nothing more than a broth and two or three greens and a pistu garnish. Thus, most recipes except for the summer cold fruit soups have a lot of ingredients on top of the ingredients needed to produce the vegetable or chicken stock. Most of his soups also make great use of both mild and hot chiles (more on this later), which distinguish Congdon's recipes from many others. If you happen to be a chile head, then I suggest you drop what you are doing and order a copy of this book.<br /><br />In addition to the 69 soup recipes, the book gives an especially nice introduction to soup making equipment, herbs and spices used in these soup recipes, soup making methods, recipes for soup accompaniments, and recipes for the three major soup stocks, vegetable, chicken, and fish. The two books to which I am comparing this volume each give similar material. One consideration is that both `Daily Soup' and Congdon's recipes both tend to give restaurant sized batches of 12 or more cups of soup, although there are several which deliver between four and eight cup servings. When you are dealing with a dozen or more ingredients, scaling this down to half becomes quite a challenge in this non-metric world of measurements. And, unlike Ms. Mitchell's `A Beautiful Bowl of Soup', Mr. Congdon does not systematically give recommendations on refrigerator and freezer shelf life for these soups. But, as Ms. Mitchell's book is limited to vegetarian dishes, the real competition is in a comparison between Congdon and the `Daily Soup' crew.<br /><br />One thing that struck me throughout Mr. Congdon's recipes is that the length of cooking time for many recipes is longer than for many other writers. By far the most dramatic example of this is the recipe for chicken stock that calls for overnight simmering of the stockpot. I have read dozens of chicken stock recipes, and there may be only one other I can remember which takes it out to such great lengths, and, this was not from a recognized culinary expert. I really like the fact that the vegetables are cooked and removed before the marathon session, but even this step is relatively long, as I have seen expert opinions which say that vegetables in stocks should be cooked not much more than an hour or they will cloud the stock. Even more experts state that cooking fish for stocks should be limited to one hour, while Mr. Congdon recommends `no less than two hours'.<br /><br />One thing that surprises me is Mr. Congdon's use of the food processor rather than either a Waring style or immersion style blender. Most authorities recommend a blender over a food processor for soups. And, I think a glass blender beaker is a lot easier to clean than the plastic food processor chamber. It may also have been useful for the author to specify a china cap (chinois) for filtering finely pureed soups, unless he found he painted himself into a corner by criticizing Emeril Lagasse for using a lot of equipment to produce his TV Network soups.<br /><br />My biggest problem with Mr. Congdon's writing may be due to no trained copy editor at Sasquatch Press, as strange statements asking us to melt our olive oil and dissolve flour so it can coat ingredients make me worry that the final text may simply not have been adequately proofread. This probably contributed to Mr. Congdon's highly inconsistent use of the terms chile and peppers, where he goes against standard practice in the culinary world in calling fresh items `peppers' and dried items `chiles'.<br /><br />If you really only want one book for thick, high quality soups, the `Daily Soup' volume may be the better choice for its cleaner writing and typesetting, but if you really like your soup and enjoy every recipe you can get your hands on, then this book is for you. I would only suggest you consider simpler recipes for chicken and vegetable stocks. For chicken, especially, I prefer the recipes that either use carcasses or save the meat for other dishes using poached chicken.<br /><br />Highly recommended if you really like soups.h say that vegetables in stocks should be cooked not much more than an hour or they will cloud the stock.

392975:US	39134375	RJB8L7S1IHAUX	1565123921	359192030	A Thousand Days in Tuscany: A Bittersweet Adventure	Books	4	34	45	N	Y	Enchanting Memoir of Rural Tuscan Life.	`A Thousand Days in Tuscany' by American (transplanted to Italy), Marlena De Blasi is a sequel to her `A Thousand Days in Venice'. While I have not read the earlier work, I sense that both are personal memoirs of her life in Italy with her companion Fernando, with culinary grace notes and comments.<br /><br />The number of stars to be rewarded to Ms. De Blasi's work is complicated by the fact that there are several excellent works on living and eating in Tuscany, so the bar is set pretty high. Leading the pack by far is the great culinary memoir by Patience Gray, `Honey from a Weed'. Another very high quality work is `The Tuscan Year' by Elizabeth Romer. On culinary points alone, Ms. De Blasi's work is pretty weak, as the book contains a scant nine recipes for pretty routine stuff.<br /><br />Fortunately, this book should not be weighed on this score alone, even though Amazon.com conned me into buying it by having it come up in new releases of culinary titles. The book is more valuable as a picture of life through the seasons as seen by an American, with much the same tone as Frances Mayes `Under the Tuscan Sun'.<br /><br />And yet, the book is less than perfect on this score as well. I am a little puzzled by the fact that while the title of the book promises a thousand days, the text covers one calendar year. I also found some of the narrative just a bit confusing. For many pages, the writing seemed to confuse Barlozzo with the character of their ducal landlord, about whom Barlozzo often complains. I also found some of the writing just a bit inept in the use of some words, as when the author describes Barlozzo's speech as `semantic'. I quite honestly believe the author simply did not have a firm grip on the meaning of `semantic' when she used it in this context. As a former professional philosopher and student of the philosophy of language, I assure you dear reader that this word use was at least confusing.<br /><br />In spite of all those rants, this is an exceedingly pleasant book to read. It evokes Italian rural life in such a way that I an literally encouraged to get on a plane to Italy and spend a year there myself, if Madame Mayes and De Blasi and company have not already convinced half the English speaking world to do the same thing.<br /><br />I will not bore you with recounting the events of the book, as other reviews have covered this very well. I will say that this volume is much better than some other discussions of Tuscan life such as those from Mary Ann Esposito (`Chao Italia in Tuscany') and Pino Luongo (`Simply Tuscan'). While these volumes have a lot of worthy culinary material, they fail as genuine reflections of Tuscan life.<br /><br />Recommended to anyone who enjoys Frances Mayes books on living in Tuscany.exceedingly pleasant book to read.

394345:US	39134375	RWQXLF55TG5F3	0195154371	45382693	The Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America	Books	5	10	17	N	Y	Great Source on Culinary History,Business, and Lore	`The Encyclopedia of Food and Wine in America' is a great 1500 page compilation of excellently written articles on virtually every aspect of the history, education, manufacture, marketing, personalities, and writing about food in America. Practically the only thing it does not include is recipes or cooking. Even sidebars whose label suggests a proper place for a recipe such as the sidebar on shoofly pie gives not one hint about how to make this delicious dessert. Given the size of the subject, it is not at all surprising that the editors have left these out, as both recipes and kitchen science can both be considered without nationality, plus the fact that there are thousands of good cookbooks and a score of books on food science available today, so why not focus on things which are not commonly covered in these books. This means that this volume can sit beside the `Larousse Gastronomique' with only a very small amount of overlap in material. These two giant books have two entirely different objectives. While both works will have articles on potatoes, Larousse will tell you how to cook them, but Oxford will tell us were they are grown, their commercial importance, nutritional importance, and their appearance in cartoons.<br /><br />So, unlike Larousse, you are much more inclined to simply read the articles in these volumes for your own entertainment as much as for your need to know something. The articles are filled to the brim with interesting trivia about American food. One favorite item in the article about Spam is the fact that the word `Spam' became associated with junk e-mail on the strength of a Monty Python skit which did the same kind of number on Spam as the movie `Blazing Saddles' did on western films. Another discovery was the renaming of sauerkraut to `Liberty Cabbage' after World War I. In this way, the book follows the style of the Encyclopedia Britannica that leans heavily toward long, detailed articles rather than shorter articles with a greater chance of redundancy, especially with a hundred or more independent contributors.<br /><br />It would probably take the average foodie about five minutes of searching through these volumes to find something they miss. My first sense of something being missing was when there were articles about Charlie Trotter, Alice Waters, and Rick Bayless, but no articles on Thomas Keller, Jeremiah Tower, or Richard Olney. I would not feel the absence so acutely if the editors had given us biographies on Julia Child, James Beard, Craig Claiborne, and M.F.K. Fisher and stopped there, as all four of these figures are so obviously at the very top of the heap in their influence on American eating and food writing. On the other hand, Tower and Olney between them are probably as much an influence on culinary professionals in the United States as Alice Waters. While Olney spent much of his life living in France, he was born in Iowa and all of his most influential works, most notably his editorship of the Time-Life culinary series of books in the 1960s was aimed at American audiences. This series is mentioned twice in the long article on cookbooks with no mention of Olney as the editor, a position recommended to the publishers by James Beard. Regarding Keller and Trotter, for example, both have received the James Beard best chef in the country award and of the books attributed to these two chefs, I much prefer the two from Keller than the three from Trotter which I have reviewed. I suspect the difference in the eyes of the editors is Trotter's earlier ascendancy, his substantial charitable activities, and his better than average culinary instruction TV shows.<br /><br />These quibbles aside, I am genuinely impressed by the overall quality of the writing in the thousands of articles in this work. The biographical articles all begin with a crisp statement of the importance of the subject to American culinary history. In spite of the very large number of writers, all articles seem to share thissame matter of factness, with virtually no sentimentality or sensationalism. One joggling act that must have challanged the editors is how to limit the book to `American' subjects. And, they seem to have accomplished this with great good judgment. In place of any mention of French or Italian or Japanese or Korean or East Indian or Chinese subjects, the editors have given us articles on `Italian-American' food and `German-American' food. I know the German-American culinary world better than any other and I give the author of this article high marks for capturing the big picture and not limiting himself to the very easy subject of the `Pennsylvania Dutch' cuisine. Although the Amish and Mennonite communities of Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York, and the Carolinas are at the heart of the German / American food tradition, the greater German influence is much broader, overlapping, for example, the Jewish-American culinary world and even the influences from France and Italy.<br /><br />By far the best use for this work is as a starting point for serious culinary research or simply noodling around the literature of cookery for fun. In addition to the articles with their excellent bibliographies, there are appendices on general food bibliography, general wine bibliography, list of food periodicals and web sites, major food subject reference libraries, major food museums, food organizations, and food festivals.<br /><br />Be warned that in spite of the title, wine gets much less than half the volume of ink spilled in these volumes. I also detected a few minor editing mistakes and omissions. The web site for the cable `Food Network' is listed as [...] but this was changed close to two years ago to [...] This little mistake is less easy to understand since the article on Julia Child notes her death which occurred about 6 months ago. Still, this book is a great source of entertainment and information for foodies and foodie scholars.<br /><br />Expensive, but of high quality as a reference and entertainment.this same matter of factness, with virtually no sentimentality or sensationalism.

395619:US	39134375	R2VYIEZ500Q8W7	0811828255	700061864	Enoteca: Simple, Delicious Recipes in the Italian Wine Bar Tradition	Books	5	8	9	N	Y	Excellent, Inexpensive source for Italian Entertaining	`Enoteca' by noted Mediterranean culinary writer and teacher Joyce Goldstein is one of those rare books which rekindle one's interest in an area the reader believed has been almost totally burnt out by reading dozens of books on, for example, general and regional Italian cookery. The Enoteca is a Greek based word for an Italian wine bar similar to the Spanish tapas bar and the Greek and Turkish meze bars. There is a strong similarity between an osterie, an older term, and the Enoteca, as both serve wine and neither have a full trattoria style menu. The Enoteca may even not have any tables, but it will most certainly have a wide variety of wines and a selection of foods which may be made on the premises but which may as likely be brought in from nearby food stores and restaurante or trattoria kitchens. The best American model I know of is Mario Batali's Babbo `restaurant and Enoteca', where the emphasis on wine selections supported by partner Joe Bastianich supports the dual function for this establishment.<br /><br />The fact that while the term Enoteca may be old, it has been enthusiastically adapted by the Italian culinary establishment which has gone so far as to codify the requirements which allow a business to label itself an `Enoteca'. These requirements are largely based on the bar's stocking a large number and variety of Italian wines, plus a sizable stock of French and other foreign wines. The Enoteca model seems to be primarily a northern Italian thing, with strong exemplars in Venice and Milan. One of the most attractive things about this book is the number of recipes for northern Italian dishes that mimic much more famous southern dishes such as the pizza and the Calzone.<br /><br />The official model for an Enoteca does not require that the servers are qualified as master sommeliers, but they must be very well informed about wine and how their wines can be paired with food. Ms. Goldstein's co-author of this book is her son, Evan Goldstein, who is a master sommelier and who supplies all the wine to food pairings in the book. As I know virtually nothing about wine, the only evaluation I can give of these offerings is that they are better than most, in that they define both the characteristics of the wine which will go well with the dish, then recommend specific wine labels, generally at least two different wines, often from two different continents. This is about as good a source of wine to food pairings I have seen in a cookbook.<br /><br />I almost have a sense that unlike the Spanish and Greek cuisine centers cited above, the Italian wine bar menu items have been lost in the great forest of information published about Italian cuisine. To be sure, almost all recipes in this book can be found in other major works from authorities such as Marcella Hazan and Giuliano Bugialli, but this particular collection of recipes just seems to come alive as they are presented to all satisfy a single purpose, being the most interesting finger food can be had to eat with a glass of wine.<br /><br />The leading chapter points out the similarities between the Italian and the Spanish `bar food', as the subject here is fritters and frittatas, comparable to fried empanadas and the potato tortilla. Many other Italian cookbooks have lots of recipes on frittatas, but the croquettes seem to be much less easy to find.<br /><br />The second chapter is on savory pastries and breads featuring `pizza rustica', green pies, crostinis, focaccias, and an especially interesting flatbread from Romagna. These northern Italian specialities are all strong analogues to the southern Italian specialities as well as the Mexican flour tortilla.<br /><br />The third chapter on pastas and grains features fresh pasta and baked pasta dishes that are very easy to bake in advance and dish out portion by portion. So, lots of gratins and casseroles here. If you happen to be as fond of gratins as I am, you are almost certain to have the same warm reaction to this book.<br /><br />The next chapter on fish concentrates on recipes for cold salads and gratins made with fish, especially shrimp, tuna, baccala, trout, clams and mussels.<br /><br />The next chapter on meat and poultry again concentrates on make ahead dishes such as stews and braises or carpaccios (raw meats).<br /><br />The vegetable chapter has some nice little discoveries, featuring a mashed potato pie from Apulia. Other dishes, again, are cold salads or make ahead casseroles, stews, and gratins. One of the rare sautes is here, with a dish of saut&eacute;ed mushrooms. I have never heard of Hobbits in Italy, but I am sure they would love to find this dish.<br /><br />It is not surprising to find a chapter devoted to cheeses, as this is a natural accompaniment to wine. Aside from the ten (10) recipes, this chapter features a thumbnail guide to Italian cheeses.<br /><br />There are only four (4) recipes for sweets, which is not surprising as the conventional wisdom on Italian food culture is that baked desserts are not a big thing. They are largely an excuse for Noni to break out the vin santo in the afternoon. For certain, the author's description of Enotecas indicates that they will do virtually no baking on the premises, as most of them will not even have a pizza oven.<br /><br />The book includes an excellent little bibliography, including the volume from Carol Field, `Italy in Small Bites' which most closely matches the cuisine in this book.<br /><br />Almost all of the recipes in the book were supplied by Italian Enoteca owners, developed by the excellent cookbook writing of Ms. Goldstein who never fails to please me with her careful working of classic recipes.<br /><br />This extremely attractive, very reasonably priced book is a great find for planning food and wine for a party.

Not Best Science	`The New Kitchen Science' by culinary journalist Howard Hillman is a new edition of a 20 year old book which uses the question and answer format common to a lot of cooking advice books. One small problem is that this format is not the best approach to presenting `science' in that science is a body of theories and explained phenomena the understanding of which facilitates applying knowledge to understanding new situations. So, if a book just answers questions, the ability to extend the answers to new situations may not be as good as other expository approaches. That said, I have to say that like Robert L. Wolke's `What Einstein told His Chef', this book may be more accessible to many readers than other conventional writers on the subject such as Harold McGee's works and `The Science of Cooking' by Bristol University (UK) don Peter Barham.<br /><br />One thing a widely read foodie may want to consider is that they may have already seen most of the material in this book in the volumes cited above. This is not to say this book does not contain some new material, but a devoted reader of Shirley Corriher and Alton Brown may find this new material a bit sparse.<br /><br />For the reader with little experience with food science reading, I caution you that there are some statements in this book, which are scientifically incorrect. This may be a small point, since the errors are not likely to interfere with your practical cooking, but they may interfere with your ability to extend your knowledge to new situations, which is the whole point of the scientific inquiry in the first place.  The first error I noticed is the statement that when a water / alcohol mixture is boiled, the alcohol will all boil off, leaving just water. One of the first things a freshman chemistry student learns is that this is not true. It is true that more alcohol will evaporate than water, until the alcohol and water attain equilibrium. Admittedly, the alcohol will be reduced to a very small level, but it is still there. This is important if someone has physical or religious problems with any alcohol.

Grosser is easily the spiritual godfather of current impresario of culinary information, Alton Brown, in that it seeks to explain everyday cooking phenomena with a big dollop of humor.<br /><br />While this little book pales in comparison to Harold McGee's encyclopedic coverage of food science in `On Food and Cooking', this book serves its purpose by making it easy to read and to understand a few good facts about a few really important aspects of food chemistry. Oddly enough, the book also can revive interest in some backwaters of cooking technique.<br /><br />It is meet and right that the very first subject is the egg, the single most useful natural product in the kitchen. In this chapter, the author introduces a feature of his book that would make it an excellent text for a grammar school or middle school course in food science. A chemist to the end, the author offers numerous suggestions on simple experiments that may be performed with standard kitchen equipment. The first topic is the whys and wherefores of cooking a hard-boiled egg. This is my first sense that the good professor may have a few clay feet. In my great survey of cooking praxis, there are two competing methods for successfully making a hard-boiled egg. The method endorsed by this author suggests poking a hole in the blunt end of the eggshell and dropping the prepared egg into boiling water. The alternate method which my experience shows works equally well involves placing the raw eggs in cold water in a pan on the burner and bringing the water and eggs up to boiling whereupon both methods have us simmer eggs for about 12 minutes. Oddly, the second method relies on a fact of egg anatomy that the author clearly describes and uses as a justification for his recommendation. This is the presence of tiny pores in the eggshell at the blunt end. The cold start uses these by increasing heat slowly. The hot start uses the same principle, but helps its case by creating a much larger hole to let air escape from the egg rather than build up pressure and crack the shell. All of this is relatively unimportant beside the fact that the author's discussion of egg cookery is both entertaining and informative.<br /><br />One of this book's greatest services may be the author's giving us procedures on how to bake and how to coddle eggs. I have not seen such loving attention paid to egg cookery lately except in the very French `Essential Cuisine' by Chef Michel Bras. Compared to the arcane techniques needed to poach eggs or cook omelets, coddling and baking seem to be simplicity itself. And, coddling offers an enormous range of enhancements comparable in many ways to the great variety of omelet preparations.<br /><br />Aside from eggs, the author discusses:<br /><br />Vegetables, especially their colors and how colors are affected by cooking.<br /><br />Garlic, Onions, Cabbage, and Potatoes, and how these smelly veggies can be tamed<br /><br />Beast and Bird and how to keep juicy<br /><br />Fish: Food for Thought and how to fry<br /><br />A Bowl of Plastic Fruit and Thou<br /><br />Sauces, Cereal, Pasta and Other Thick Things<br /><br />Desserts: \\"It Comes with the Meal\\"<br /><br />Baking: \\"If It's Enriched, It Needs Enrichment\\"<br /><br />Beverages: The Devil's Works<br /><br />Each chapter ends with a nice little resume that is much more a collection of mottoes for improving our cooking than it is a summary of the facts presented in the chapter. These are suggestions you hear from all the `Food Network' experts for which our author has given us the explanation of why these are good things to do or to avoid. This `resume' is the basis for the book's whimsical title, as it explains this kitchen lore which cookbook writers and chefs have been following for generations, often with no thought to why the practices work.<br /><br />I did find a few other nits to pick. The authorwas curiously obtuse in explaining the origin of the term `Maillard reactions', as if this former professor was quite satisfied in passing on what may be no more than hearsay. These phenomenons, along with caramelization, are two cornerstones of our understanding of what happens when high heat encounters sugars and protein. This tells me that while the good professor was a chemist, he was not a professional `food chemist'. Another small lapse is in his explanation of why it is important to have a high oil temperature when putting fish in to fry. Grosser states that this is needed to form a crust to keep the oil from entering the flesh and creating a greasy dish. A much more likely explanation from both Alton Brown and Shirley Corriher is that the high heat turns water in the food into steam and the outward pressure of the steam bars the oil from entering the food. While it may seem to be a small point, as both explanations recommend a high oil heat, the steam explanation means that food should be removed from the hot oil as soon as the flesh is cooked, while the crust explanation suggests the food could stay in the oil indefinitely without becoming greasy. So, the correct explanation is important for practical cooking.<br /><br />As mentioned at the outset, this book makes excellent use of humor to make this subject entertaining. Other virtues that distinguish this book from some others are the very nice little experiments and the practical summaries. Even if you have memorized your McGee and have read other good food science books such as `The Science of Cooking' by Bristol University (UK) don Peter Barham, I recommend Dr. Grosser's inexpensive little volume, especially if you have budding adolescent cooks under your wing.explaining the origin of the term `Maillard reactions', as if this former professor was quite satisfied in passing on what may be no more than hearsay.

400434:US	39134375	R2RTW9RUI4Y4VA	1576300447	495745476	The Complete Italian Vegetarian Cookbook: 350 Essential Recipes for Inspired Everyday Eating	Books	5	63	82	N	N	Excellent book for no meat Italian. Highly Recommended	`The Complete Italian Vegetarian Cookbook' by Jack Bishop is the third of Mr. Bishop's vegetable cookbooks I have reviewed and I have adopted the two earlier reviewed books as part of my regular `go to' cookbooks when I am looking for a recipe. This volume will join the others, as its recipes are excellent and its organization make it an excellent source for finding meatless dishes with an Italian accent.<br /><br />The term `vegetarian' in the title is being used in its most liberal sense. While there is not a trace of chicken, ham, hare, or halibut in these recipes, the recipes contain lots of eggs and cheese. Most people interpret 'vegetarian' as permitting eggs and cheese, but there may be some who consider 'vegetarian' to mean what others mean by vegan. Just so you know. It is a mistake to assume that the calorie count for these recipes will be lower than normal. The recipes are really faithful to Italian cuisine in their heavy use of either olive oil or butter, so you may need to read the recipes carefully if you are looking for low fat recipes. Speaking of butter and olive oil, I did find a minor misstatement about these ingredients. In the recipe for a low fat bechamel, he states that substituting olive oil for butter will reduce the fat in a recipe. The error is that a tablespoon of olive oil is 100% fat while a tablespoon of American unsalted butter is about 80% fat by law. While olive oil may be a healthier, mono-unsaturated fat, gram for gram, it has more fat calories than butter. And, you may be loosing some emulsifying properties of butter if you substitute olive oil for butter. This has no reflection on the quality of Mr. Bishop's recipes. If you can afford the fat calories, go for whatever turns you on.<br /><br />But, there is a lot of value in this book. If you are a vegetarian who eats eggs and milk products, and you like Italian food, then you simply cannot find a better cookbook for your lifestyle. This is especially true since the Italian cuisines have done an especially good job of creating a really broad range of vegetable dishes. The `complete' in the title may be a stretch, as I simply refuse to believe that a complete cookbook is possible for any cooking subject as big as Italian cooking, even Italian cooking which excludes fish, fowl, meat, and game. But, this book gives the objective an honest treatment.<br /><br />One's first impression upon looking at the Table of Contents is that there are a lot of subjects which do not sound like vegetable dishes, such as pastas, breads, risottos, polenta, frittatas (Italian omelets), Crespelle (Italian crepes), and desserts. This is all part of the complete treatment to which Bishop strives. And, although I recommend you run to Hazan or Bastianich or Batalli if you want good instructions on making fresh pasta and to Reinhart or Beranbaum or Ortiz or Field if you want to make Italian bread, Bishop has a lot of sound ideas about making some classic Italian preparations such as polenta and risotto.<br /><br />The thing I liked best about this book aside were the large number of egg, gnocchi, risotto, and panini recipes plus the very nice collection of salads and vegetable side dishes. (One symptom of the mistaken `complete' in the title is that the book does not include a recipe for a Caprese salad (basil, mozzarella, and tomato)). While I have close to a hundred books loaded with recipes for fresh and dried pastas, there are few good collections which include Crespelle or as big a selection of frittatas. And, the selections of meatless sandwich recipes (Panini) are a real find.<br /><br />This may seem like a small thing, but I also give Mr. Bishop and his publisher high marks for the book's layout, with each recipe typically taking a single page. I am also very fond of his recipe for a vegetable stock, as it reduces the simmer time to a very convenient hour by chopping the vegetables rather than by simply halving them and simmering for three or more hours. Theother pantry recipes are similarly first rate, although I think I would replace his quick sauce with my favorite basic sauce from Mario Batali that is sweetened with carrot and leaves out the parsley or basil.<br /><br />I have mixed feelings about the photographs in this book. They are well done, but for a 550 page book costing over $37, the number is a bit thin and the placement in a single rotogravure section is more typical of less expensive volumes.<br /><br />If you want meatless Italian recipes, this is the book for you. At the very least, it will save you from sorting through recipes in other books that may be heavy with pancetta, salami, Parma ham, and anchovies. Mr. Bishop gives us real Italian without giving us the feeling that something has been left out.t rate, although I think I would replace his quick sauce with my favorite basic sauce from Mario Batali that is sweetened with carrot and leaves out the parsley or basil.

Cheap.	`The Best of Amish Cooking' by Phyllis Pellman Good is one of the high points of a cottage industry devoted to writing about Pennsylvania Dutch cookery. It is so much of an industry that Good is not only the author of this book, but its publisher as well. And, `Good Books', based in darkest Lancaster County, Pennsylvania publishes several other books on `Pennsylvania Dutch' (Amish and Mennonite) subjects. For the very few of you who may not be familiar with this fact, I quote `Dutch' and the phrase `Pennsylvania Dutch' since the term is actually a corruption of the name for German natives, or `Deutch'. Of course, the `Pennsylvania Dutch' return the favor and label all non-Amish / Mennonites as `English', including French, Poles, Italians, Russians, and Spanish. So there.<br /><br />As someone who grew up in the bosom of the `Pennsylvania Dutch' cuisine, I have a closer connection to this cooking than to any other. That prejudice aside, I think it is safe to say that the `Pennsylvania Dutch' cuisine is much more coherent, that is, easier to understand from a few paradigms than, for example, Southern cooking, Tex-Mex, or California Cuisine, as the Amish and Mennonite traditions all came from not only from a single European country, but from a single region (North Central Germany). There is a small New World influence in the importance of corn (maize) in `Dutch' cookery. A second condition leading to continuity in this cuisine over time is that roles in the Amish household are clearly defined in that women do virtually all cooking. Men may handle butchering and preserving meats, but women handle everything else connected with food.<br /><br />The foods for which `American' cuisine owes most to the `Dutch' cuisine would be pretzels, sweet and savory pies (Wayne Harley Brachman calls Lancaster County the American `dessert central' in his excellent book, `American Desserts), sugar cookies, corn relishes, and potato salad. I judge this book's claim to be the `Best', by looking to see if it has recipes for the most common dishes from my past which are associated with the Pennsylvania Dutch cuisine. And, I am not disappointed.<br /><br />The touchstone dishes are stuffed pig stomach, corn pie, chow chow (corn relish), hot bacon dressing, and apple dumplings. I am happy to report that not only are all these recipes in place in this volume, but that they are as good or better than our `family' recipes. Yet, these are not what you would consider gourmet recipes. The recipe for pork and sauerkraut is an excellent case in point. In classic terms, this is a braise, yet Ms. Good's recipe does not do the classic braise drill of browning the pork and deglazing before simmering the meat with the kraut. Ever since I took over cooking for my household, I follow a much more French influenced recipe than a classic Pennsylvania Dutch procedure, so I add the sear, onions, wine, and Juniper Berries (a James Beard addition to braised cabbage) to my recipe. I also use a professional pastry chef's recipe for piecrusts instead of the author's crust that includes chicken fat and baking powder. Yet another departure is the recipe for chicken potpie. While I make this often, I follow James Beard's more sophisticated recipe which includes directions for creating the chicken broth and more elaborate instructions for creating the thickened sauce.<br /><br />Thus, like a lot of books on Southern cooking and lots of other books on Pennsylvania Dutch cooking, this volume is more of an historical document for foodies than it is a source of fine cooking. The irony is that for a select few recipes, this book in fact does have the best recipes for distinctively Dutch preparations. In neither `The Joy of Cooking, `James Beard's American Cookery', or my three books on salads is there a decent recipe for the Pennsylvania Dutch hot bacon dressing. This is a staple on the shelves of Pennsylvania supermarkets, costing close to three dollars for enough to serve two to four people. So, there is much to be gained by learning how to make it fresh. It is a bit more difficult than your typical vinaigrette (and a bit harder on the waistline as well), but for a once a month treat, it's something you really should know. And, with cheap bacon ends, you can make it for half the price of `Wos-Wit' bacon dressing that may have been sitting on the shelves for a month.<br /><br />This book does have a lot of contemporary value as a source of recipes for sour salads. While Italy and Province have their share of these antipasto dishes, the Dutch have their own twist on the technique, which they developed for exactly the same reason as their Latin cousins. It was the method they used to preserve a lot of produce for the winter.<br /><br />I have seen many Pennsylvania Dutch cookbooks and, for its size and price, this is clearly one of the best.four people.

The list of the author's other works and the imprimatur of the Accademia Italiana Della Cucina demonstrates that this is no quickie knock-off by publisher, Barnes and Noble. An examination of the book's contents confirms this first impression with a very nice collection of information for the foodie, the scholar, and the traveler.<br /><br />The first chapter on the `development of Italian Gastronomy' is too short to compete with full length books on the subject, but it does give some interesting perspective in twelve (12) pages, with the claim that Italians owned the leadership in European cuisine through the Renaissance, only to let it slip away to the French with the political disintegration of the late seventeenth century. By far the most interesting content of this chapter is the account of major culinary works by Italians from the fifteenth century to the present. It is a revelation to hear writers of 400 years ago advising their readers to concentrate on fresh, seasonal produce. So this was not an idea invented by Alice Waters!<br /><br />The second chapter on the Italian food culture fills out the picture we get from watching `Molto Mario'. It gives a very nice little list of major Italian food markets, which is a useful guide for someone wishing to create a culinary tour of Italy. The only thing I missed was a description of `Enoteca', the name of an Italian wine bar. The chapter on the culinary regions of Italy gets down to serious business. This profile is a great introduction, but again, it cannot compete with complete books written on the subject such as Claudia Roden's `The Food of Italy', Erica DeMane's `The Flavors of Southern Italy', and Micol Negrin's `Rustico' or the classic `The Foods of Italy' by Waverley Root. But, if you just want a quick look around, this will do the job, as long as you realize there is much this chapter is leaving out.<br /><br />The next two chapters are the heart of the book and the primary reason you will want to buy it. First, there are 130 pages of recipes organized by ingredient or course, with headnotes that often indicate the geographical source of the recipe. Surprisingly, several recipes also come from American and English sources such as Marcella Hazan and Alan Davidson. It is a pleasant surprise to find the recipes in such an omnibus volume written with a keen eye to guiding the amateur to getting things right. A lot of cautions and advice which could easily be taken for granted are carefully spelled out, as when the recipe for polenta describes the delicate task of slowly streaming the corn meal into the pot with one hand while constantly stirring the pot with the other. Well done Anna! The only oddity with this selection of recipes is in the fact that the meat chapter is larger than the vegetable section, with lots of space being given to veal and beef recipes. While not even close to being a `complete' selection, the choice of recipes is very representative of classic Italian dishes.<br /><br />The next chapter is probably the basis for which most people will buy this book. It is a dictionary of Italian ingredients. The entries are much more than what you will find in a dictionary, but a bit less than you may find in the `Larousse Gastronomique' for French preparations. For basic ingredients such as vinegars, the entries describe how to identify good samples of the product plus a brief idea of how the ingredients are produced. For compound ingredients such as agrodolce (sweet and sour sauce), the entry gives an outline of how the product is made and how it is used, but no complete recipe (as you might find in Larousse, except that Larousse has no entry for agrodolce). Thus, this book is an admirable supplement, filling in for the French classic when it ignores an Italian ingredient. Like Larousse, the entries are written in such a way thatit is easy to just start with the A's and read it as if you were reading a memoir or a novel. Well, maybe not a novel, but you get the idea. Some of the more interesting things you will find are the facts that Italy has a name for strudel as made in Venice and a name for the bouillabaisse ingredient, Racasse, which is used in Italian fish stews as a thickener. The separate section on descriptions of Italian food preparation techniques is equally interesting. It is well known that Italian bacon, pancetta, is generally not smoked, yet there is a variety of smoked `pancetta afumicatta'.<br /><br />The next section on wines will not replace a good book on Italian wines, but it is an excellent resource for finding the terroir of specific wines. It confirmed something I had heard in passing that the first major Italian wines to make an impression on American taste (after the Tuscan clich&eacute;, Chianti) were Bardolino and Valpolicello from the lands around Venice. If nothing else, this chapter will impress upon you the great variety of Italian wines and how they are typically used.<br /><br />My personal favorite section in this and most other books is the bibliography. And, this book has a great one, with lots of entries from both classic and modern Italian sources. Like Germany and France, but unlike the United States, Italian scholarship has produced encyclopedic volumes on regional gastronomy which, if you knew Italian, would make writing this kind of book for American audiences very easy.

Buy It.	`Chez Panisse Fruit' by Alice Waters and her staff is the companion volume to a similarly formatted and illustrated `Chez Panisse Vegetables'. While I gave the latter volume only four stars, I can give this very similar volume five stars simply because, to my knowledge, there are not many good cookbooks around for fruits alone. And, this is a very valuable type of book to have on hand.<br /><br />I am constantly reminded of the central insight of Tom Colicchio's book `How to Think Like a Chef' where he points out that chefs do not create recipes then go looking for ingredients. The creative process is exactly the opposite. They look to see what they have on hand and create something based on this. Tony Bourdain reminds us about this in his book, `Kitchen Confidential', when he warns us about the specials of the day, as they are probably built out of ingredients which are becoming a bit long in the tooth to hold much longer in the walk-in refrigerator. This principle becomes writ large with every chef / author crowing about their using fresh, seasonal ingredients. They mention this far less often, but I'm sure they also create recipes and menus based on what is cheap as much as on what is fresh. Since seasonal generally coincides with less expensive, they can tout seasonal and hide their economical self-interest at work. This principle of using what you have also makes me skeptical of really how difficult the old `Iron Chef' premise is for first class chefs, as they really do this kind of thing every day of their working lives, if they are still working in the kitchen. This competition is stressful, but it is simply taking what they every day do to it's extreme.<br /><br />But I ramble. The whole point of this digression was that cookbooks organized by raw ingredient are a really great resource for the cook who likes to work economically. What can be better in the Fall when apples and pears come into season than to have a book with a nice selection of interesting things to do with apples and pears. The book is divided into thirty-eight chapters, with each giving recipes on a major fruit available in the United States, with the number of recipes corresponding roughly to the popularity of the fruit. Some few chapters cover a family of fruits, as when the Bananas chapter includes a recipe for plantains.<br /><br />While the larger number of recipes are for desserts, provided I suspect primarily by Ms. Waters' partner, Lindsey Shere and her pastry staff at Chez Panisse, there are also several hot savory recipes and salad recipes using fruit. Two very common uses of fruit with meat, for example, are apples in poulet a la Normandie (Normandy apples with chicken) and grilled duck breast with pickled peaches.<br /><br />Like the `Vegetables' volume, this book is as comfortable in the armchair as it is in the kitchen. It has the same stylish design and the same delightfully Art Nouveau colored woodcut prints of the principal fruits. The introductions to each ingredient, aside from a terse statement about the fruit's seasonality, are `free form' essays about those things that are most interesting about the fruit. This is entirely fair, as lemons are a far, far more important ingredient to all types of cooking than rhubarb. As Ms. Waters explains, even though rhubarb is a vegetable, at Chez Panisse (and lots of other places as well), it is used in the same manner as sour fruits and it bridges the gap in the seasons between the winter and summer tree fruits.<br /><br />Unlike the vegetable book, this volume ends with a chapter of general procedures useable with many different fruit recipes. These recipes include galette and sweet pie doughs, biscuits, puff pastry, sabayon, frangipane, sponge cake, and pastry cream. While these recipes are great to have on hand in a book of pie ingredients, you may prefer to go to a book from a pastry specialist such as Rose Levy Beranbaum, Nick Malgieri, or Wayne Harley Brachman for expert advice on crusts. I take Miss Alice's claim that her pate sucree recipe will never get tough and will not shrink when baked. I will not even test this statement, as I am quite happy with the piecrust I am used to. I doubt the claims for this recipe in that it is almost identical to the one I use, which does get tough and does shrink unless I take special care in handling it.<br /><br />If I were editing this book and had but one suggestion by which it could be improved, I would make the selection of recipes across fruits just a bit more uniform. For example, there is a recipe for blackberry jelly, but no recipe for orange marmalade. On the other hand, almost all the classics are here, such as applesauce, Moroccan preserved lemons, and pears poached in wine. What would be the value of a book on fruits if you could not go to it for the standards?<br /><br />I would buy both volumes simply because they look very nice on my shelf. The fact that they come with the Chez Panisse imprimatur doesn't hurt. And, rest assured that not only are the recipes in this book worth having, they are very accessible though an excellent table of contents and a description of the procedure which is easy to read, easy to follow, and informative. Like all of Ms. Waters' cookbooks I have reviewed, they may not be the best for the total novice.

I will not even test this statement, as I am quite happy with the piecrust I am used to. I doubt the claims for this recipe in that it is almost identical to the one I use, which does get tough and does shrink unless I take special care in handling it. <br /> <br />If I were editing this book and had but one suggestion by which it could be improved, I would make the selection of recipes across fruits just a bit more uniform. For example, there is a recipe for blackberry jelly, but no recipe for orange marmalade. On the other hand, almost all the classics are here, such as applesauce, Moroccan preserved lemons, and pears poached in wine. What would be the value of a book on fruits if you could not go to it for the standards? <br /> <br />I would buy both volumes simply because they look very nice on my shelf. The fact that they come with the Chez Panisse imprimatur doesn't hurt. And, rest assured that not only are the recipes in this book worth having, they are very accessible though an excellent table of contents and a description of the procedure which is easy to read, easy to follow, and informative. Like all of Ms. Waters' cookbooks I have reviewed, they may not be the best for the total novice.

405675:US	39134375	R3PA5BK0UG49QI	0060171472	901498681	Chez Panisse Vegetables	Books	4	59	80	N	N	Excellent Source for Vegetable Dishes, But Not the Best.	`Chez Panisse Vegetables' by Alice Waters is a book you will want to seriously consider for your library in general, and especially if you are very fond of cooking vegetable dishes. This is not to say this is the best book on the veggie bookshelf, as there are several, both vegetarian and non that are as good or better. The most similar volume is `Vegetables Every Day' by Jack Bishop which, like Waters' volume is organized by vegetable. And, in most easily measurable regards, Bishop's book is superior if you simply cannot have more than one veggie book on your shelves.<br /><br />For starters, Bishop's book weights in at 388 pages for a list price of $30 while Ms. Waters has 336 pages for a list price of $35. Bishop covers 68 named vegetables in his table of contents while Waters covers only 44; however, some of her 44 chapters cover two similar veggies, as in the chapter on broccoli and broccoli raab. Yet, while Waters gives us five recipes on these two products, Bishop gives us eleven (11) recipes on broccoli and four recipes for broccoli raab.<br /><br />Bishop also gives a lot more routine information on each vegetable. Every article, regardless of how many recipes may be given, has the same seven (7) paragraphs in the introductory article. The first paragraph simply introduces you to the vegetable and gives you a general idea of the appeal and usability of the vegetable. The next paragraph on availability gives the best season for the produce and whether or not the vegetable is currently available year round in American markets. The third paragraph on selection gives us criteria for whether we want to pick up today's selection of a species or let it alone. The paragraph on storage is especially useful, as there is probably very little wisdom handed down from your Eastern European grandma on storing tomatillos, taro, or jicama or from your Mexican mom on dealing with arugula, bok choy, or burdock. The basic preparation paragraph can be simple for leafy greens or very complicated for artichokes. The very short section on best cooking methods is primarily useful for totally unfamiliar vegetables. A very useful last entry gives recipes on other vegetables in which the titular ingredient appears.<br /><br />But then, this review is about Waters' book, so let's get back to it. From the point of view of a book lover, there are a few things that recommend this book. First, like all of the Chez Panisse cookbooks, this one is very attractively illustrated in a vaguely French Art Nouveau style with what appear to be color pencil drawings for each vegetable. The table of contents also has the complete title of every recipe in the front of the book, which is a great help if you happen to be doing a quick search for a particular carrot or sweet potato recipe. Ms. Waters' volume also includes recipes for some vegetables not covered in Mr. Bishop's book such as Amaranth Greens, but Mr. Bishop returns the favor by covering several not highlighted by Ms. Waters.<br /><br />Even though Ms. Waters dedicates more pages to mushrooms than does Mr. Bishop, Bishop offers fourteen (14) mushroom recipes to Ms. Waters twelve (12). And, Mr. Bishop tends to give more basic and more traditional recipes. Among his mushroom recipes, for example, he has a recipe for duxelles and for duxelles with scrambled eggs. Bishop also includes more recipes that include meat; but neither book should be considered a vegan or vegetarian book, as both make heavy use of dairy products in their recipes.<br /><br />The two most positive things I can say about Ms. Waters book are that there is very little overlap of recipes between her book and Mr. Bishop's book and her comments are much more fun to read between commercials while watching Rachael Ray or Alton Brown on the Food Network. The introductory text is less formal, but more interesting.<br /><br />While I have had Ms. Waters' book longer than I have had Mr. Bishop's volume, I still go to Chez Panisse first over allmy other vegetable books, as Waters' recipes are simple, elegant, and very well explained. I go to Bishop second if I can't find anything that appeals to me from Miss Alice.<br /><br />If you can, get both of these books over any other vegetable cookbook I have seen (although I have certainly not seen all). But do not get them if you need strictly vegetarian recipes. For those, see Deborah Madison's books, `The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen' by Peter Berley, or Crescent Dragonwagon's encyclopedic `Passionate Vegetarian'.<br /><br />Highly recommended for foodies and cookbook collectors.st over all my other vegetable books, as Waters' recipes are simple, elegant, and very well explained.

Buy it and Read it Now!	`Honey from a Weed' by Patience Gray, by my very informal survey of approximately 400 cookbooks over the last year is probably the single most cited culinary book after Harold McGee's `On Food and Cooking' and Julia Child's `Mastering the Art of French Cooking. And, I have been trying to place this most distinctive work in the world of culinary writing for about the same time. I think I am finally able to identify its niche in a way that will assist potential readers to know what it is they can look forward to.<br /><br />It is no whim to the publishers, Lyons & Burford, tagging the work as `Cooking/Literature'. The quality of the writing is easily on a par with the greatest food writers in English and this talent is directed to producing an almost unique genre that can be approximated by combining at least three common genres of culinary writing. First, take 40% from culinary diarists such as Amanda Hesser's `The Cook and the Gardener' and Elizabeth Romer's `The Tuscan Year'. Then, leaven with John Thorne's brand of culinary reporting and bake in the oven of Elizabeth David's culinary sophistication and cosmopolitan outlook.<br /><br />Like Hesser in `The Cook and the Gardener', Ms. Gray is `embedded' within the milieu's on which she reports. But like Hesser of `Cooking for Mr. Latte', Ms. Gray is also participating in these cultures of Tuscany (Beantown central), Catalonia (Spain on the Mediterranean coast just south of France), the Cyclades (Greek islands in the Aegean), and Apulia (the heel of Italy). She is living and working in these worlds in a way very uncommon for a typical journalist or scholar.<br /><br />The events driving the book's backstory are the travels of Ms. Gray with her partner, never identified more exactly than by the references `the sculptor' and `a stone carver' to various sites around the Mediterranean which are homes to marble quarries for giving up raw materials for statuary. A sample of the poetic imagery in the book describes this fact as `A vein of marble runs through this book. Marble determined where, how, and among whom we lived; always in primitive conditions.' These primitive conditions place Ms. Gray and her companion smack into the heart of environments which well-fed culinary commentators such as Mario Batali have been describing as the wellspring of great cuisine in Italy and other parts of the Mediterranean. Making do with local seasonal ingredients is not an ideological position for Ms. Gray; it is a daily fact of life!<br /><br />I am generally not impressed with authors' lists of kitchen equipment offered as suggestions for your kitchen in order to pad out an extra ten pages in their books, when whole volumes cannot deal with this subject. Ms. Gray's recitation of her kitchen gear is not to teach, it is to aid us in understanding her kitchen environment in these rocky corners of the world.<br /><br />The text is divided fairly evenly between chapters that deal with the author's experiences in these places with chapters dealing with a class of recipes typical of the local folk. This means one can pick up the thread of Ms. Gray's dialogue with her environment at just about any page and follow it's thread through the Mediterranean labyrinth of cuisine, as suggested by John Thorne in his Foreword. Just now, I open the book at random to a description of the rural Tuscan method for preserving `lardo', the fat from the pig's rump which is rubbed with salt, sprinkled with some dried thyme and bay, and sealed in an earthenware jar, where it stays as sweet as the day it was stored. The finer fat from around the pig's organs, `lardo strutto', is saved separately and used for yeast cakes and pastry. In a single paragraph there is information which some authors have used to fill whole articles in `Saveur'.<br /><br />One especially delightful confluence of the book's themes is the chapter on mushrooms found near the marble quarry used by Michelangelo. Having read more than one book on mushroomsby such experts as Antonio Carluccio and Patricia Grigson, I find Ms. Gray's writing on these mycological treasures to be as entertaining and as informative as some of the best known works on the subject by other culinary writers.<br /><br />While virtually all of the recipes can be done in a modern American kitchen, Ms. Gray typically describes them as they are done `in situ' on the campfires and coal burning ovens available to her. This enhances her work as a study of primitive cookery, leaving it to us to translate the primitive to our electric All-Clad kitchens. The book is also a feast of words. Everything is labeled with its proper Italian, Spanish, or Greek names, with complete translations. This is, after all, a work of scholarship where names in the original language are needed to be certain that references in Italian, Spanish, or Greek books are matched up correctly.<br /><br />While this is a book of scholarship as much as it is a literary effort, I am delighted that Ms. Gray has included two items that I consider essential to good culinary studies. The first is not one but an entire set of excellent maps identifying the locations that are the subject of her writing. The second is an excellent bibliography arranged by site that cites not just the usual sources such as Elizabeth David and Alan Davidson. It includes both ancient and modern sources in English and Spanish, Italian, and Greek. But, we are not left to our own devices with ancient Latin or Greek, as classical works are cited in good English translations. The author has also been so considerate as to provide a list of Corinna Sargood's line drawings that contribute much to the charm of the book.<br /><br />I must encourage you to seek this book out if you love reading about food. The author lives and paints the culinary environment most other writers simply report. Very highly recommended.n mushrooms by such experts as Antonio Carluccio and Patricia Grigson, I find Ms. Gray's writing on these mycological treasures to be as entertaining and as informative as some of the best known works on the subject by other culinary writers. <br /> <br />While virtually all of the recipes can be done in a modern American kitchen, Ms. Gray typically describes them as they are done `in situ' on the campfires and coal burning ovens available to her.

Good Look and Read	`Mrs. Wilkes' Boardinghouse Cookbook' is a collection of recipes attributed to Sema Wilkes of dishes served at her famous Savannah boarding house (which no longer takes in boarders). The recipes are augmented by a series of articles on the history of the Wilkes family and the restaurant by John T. Edge, a widely and favorably recognized writer on southern culinary matters.<br /><br />The most interesting aspect of the recipes in this book is that they are as much an interest as an historical record as they are a basis of culinary inspiration. The most interesting books with which to compare this work may be, for example, `Rome, at Home' by Suzanne Dunaway and the books on Sicilian cookery by writer/actor Vincent Schiavelli. The most similar book I have seen is Ms. Sally Ann Robinson's charming little book, `Gullah Home Cooking the Daufuskie Way'. A non-culinary comparison may be to a manual on how to do decorative painting in the style of the Pennsylvania Dutch hex signs. I say this only to enhance the value you can anticipate from this notable book.<br /><br />This volume contains recipes for `Comfort Food Central'. Ask a hundred second generation Americans to name their top five favorite dishes and recipes for virtually all these dishes will be in this book. Main dishes include fried chicken, chicken cacciatore, roast beef, beef bourguignonne, meatballs, meatloaf, chop suey, corned beef and cabbage, and chili. This is the typical collection of both classic Southern dishes mixed with Americanizations of famous foreign dishes. All other types of dishes show a similar selection of favorites. The dessert chapter stays just a bit closer to home by featuring primarily cakes, such as pound cake, red velvet cake, carrot cake, and fruitcake and pies (and cobblers) such as lemon meringue pie, sweet potato pie, pecan pie, peach pie, and blackberry pie.<br /><br />Many of the savory recipes are simply `dump and heat', where the procedure could hardly be any simpler. Recipes for chili and beef bourguignonne which in some hands take on epic dimensions are so simple in this book that you need to look twice to be sure this is the dish being made. This simplicity is achieved in many cases by using one or more classic darlings of 1950's cooking, canned, condensed soup, canned mushrooms, bouillon cubes, French dressing, and bottled mayonnaise. This doesn't mean the results of these recipes are not tasty, it only means the dishes may be a lot different than what you may be expecting. This is definitely not Julia Child's beef bourguignonne. Even such staples of Southern cooking such as fried chicken are done in a highly abbreviated way with no brining and no buttermilk marinade.<br /><br />Another caution with these recipes is that many have not been scaled down from boarding room proportions to suit a family of four. Still another concern is that like a lot of recipes in `Gullah Home Cooking the Daufuskie Way', there is a certain sameness in a lot of recipes. All the potato and macaroni and chicken and egg salads are about the same except for the star ingredient. Again, this doesn't mean they are poor recipes, it just means they all reflect a time when supermarkets didn't have radicchio, fennel, Belgian endive, celery root, and leeks. So, lots of recipes had to depend on celery, onions, and carrots.<br /><br />Since this oversized book with lots of excellent pictures and really interesting text lists at only $29.95, the quality of these pictures and text and the `archeological' interest of the recipes is more than enough to make this book a worthy addition to your cookbook collection. If you want to make pies, read Nick Malgieri. If you want to bake cakes, read Maida Heatter. If you want to make meatballs, read Marcella Hazan. If you want to make barbecue, read Steve Raichlen. If you want classic Southern cooking, read Edna Lewis. If you want to make beef bourguignonne, for heavens sake, read Julia Child, Tony Bourdain, or Thomas Keller. But, if you want a taste of Savannah boardinghouse cooking, this is your book.<br /><br />Aside from supporting recipes for preparations such as meringue, sauces, dressings, and piecrusts, there are virtually no cooking instructions here. Even the index fails now and then in that there are prepared ingredients mentioned in some recipes for which there are no entries in the index. So, I have no clue to how to make a `Kitchen Bouquet' mentioned as an ingredient in several recipes. And, I suspect a great part of the quality of the food at Mrs. Wilkes boardinghouse can be attributed to the skill of the staff and to the quality of the ingredients rather than to the excellence of the recipes.<br /><br />As long as you buy this book for the right reasons, you will not be disappointed.er.

Buy It!	`From a Baker's Kitchen' by poet, teacher, and writer Gail Sher is easily one of the very best books on bread baking I have seen, out of the dozen or so I have reviewed in the last year. This is not to say that the many volumes by Peter Reinhart, Joe Ortiz, Nancy Silverton, Bernard Clayton, and Rose Levy Beranbaum are not some of the very best cookery books I have seen overall. It is just that in this classic tutorial on breadbaking, Ms. Sher has presented this material in a way which is more accessible to more home bakers than the more technical works of Reinhart and company.<br /><br />One of the most liberating statements early in this book is Ms. Sher's claim that the home bread baker is actually in a better position to bake quality bread than the commercial baker, who is constantly encumbered by pressures to produce a correct number to match sales, use materials and labor economically, and make a backbreaking schedule while maintaining a reasonable quality in their product. Within reason, the home baker should not have any time pressure and the cost of a small quantity of good ingredients should be of no concern. The home cook does need to be aware of things that are no problem for the professional. These typically are using fresh ingredients and sensing baking endpoints simply by sight. The professional baker gets fresh ingredients in daily or weekly and does the same thing daily, so these come naturally.<br /><br />One of the first things, which convinced me that this is a really great introduction to baking, is when the author gives an overview of all leavening methods, giving each one equal attention. When I started baking, I was fully aware of the importance of yeast and only aware of chemical leaveners in passing. It was almost two years of baking and reading before I realized the importance of aerating leaveners, epitomized by foams of egg whites in, for example, angel food cake, but also accomplished with other ingredients such as butter layers in puff pastry.<br /><br />The first section of the book deals with `bread ingredients'. While Ms. Sher does not go into as much detail on the chemistry of gluten formation and the biology of the wheat berry as, for example, Rose Beranbaum, this book covers the whole range of flours, including such odd bodkins as triticale, potato flour, and millet. The triticale flour has a combination of properties of wheat and rye, with a light sweetness from the contribution of rye genes.<br /><br />The second section deals with the `methods and principles of bread baking'. The motto for this book is the first paragraph in the chapter on dough where it says:<br /><br /> `The Point cannot be stressed enough that bread baking is an art replete with choices. You can slow it down or hurry it up, overbake for a crunchy crust or overrise for a chewy loaf with big holes. The correct thing is what you want. You are in control and, if you understand what bread is about, you can tailor any dough to suit your exact specifications.'<br /><br />What a liberating notion. This whole book, of course, is dedicated to telling you what bread is about.<br /><br />There are many small things about this book that I love, but the one big thing that will make this book eminently useful to the amateur as an introduction to yeast breads is the fourth section of the book on `the sponge method'. For those of you who are familiar with artisinal bread baking, I should point out that this book simply does not cover this topic. It's strength is in a broad survey of bread baking techniques suitable for the home plus an in depth tutorial on the steps involved in the sponge method using commercially packaged yeast. The main advantages of using a sponge are that it gives the yeast free rein to grow in the absence of inhibitors such as salt and fats. Once the sponge has got a good head start at developing the gluten, other ingredients can be added much more easily than with a conventional dough where the yeast is simply bloomed and added to all the flour and water, followed by salt and fat(s).<br /><br />Building all the following yeast bread recipes on this one method enhances the careful exposition of the sponge method. This means that the making of each recipe builds on a single skill whereby you become more familiar with all the choices you can make to branch off from one common technique.<br /><br />Following the exposition of the sponge method and its recipes, the book deals with many different recipes for non-yeast quickbreads such as corn breads, spoonbreads, biscuits, teacakes, batter breads, gingerbreads and muffins. For its size, my favorite section by far is the selection of recipes for leftover bread. You can find dozens of these techniques spread across hundreds of cookbooks on French and Italian cuisine, but here we have all the best ones in one place.<br /><br />While the book does not go into as much detail as some more recent titles, there is still a lot here I did not know. For example, while many writers have touted instant dried yeast over `active dry yeast', the author points out a few drawbacks of this product. The author also gives an excellent overview of the many different ways bread can be rolled and laid in baking pans and the many different ways in which bread can be scored. I have seen most of these techniques in other places, but this is the only book that pulls all of these things together in one place.<br /><br />Ms. Sher gives much credit for her inspiration to Elizabeth David's book on English baking.

411521:US	39134375	R22FRF06U7J7TI	0767917464	116546695	Bringing Tuscany Home: Sensuous Style From the Heart of Italy	Books	5	52	60	N	Y	First Class Writing and Photography Great Price. Buy It.	`Bringing Tuscany Home' by Frances Mayes has several different faces, but it's title tells it's primary objective, which is importing to one's American home the furniture, style, feel, and `Zeitgeist' of Tuscany, where the authors Mayes have a `summer' home. For readers who are familiar with my concentration on culinary works, I was lead to buy this book for review by Amazon's bringing it up in a list of culinary titles, so I bought it largely on the strength of Ms. Mayes' reputation as the author of `Under the Tuscan Sun'. While the book does contain a few recipes, the most interesting one being an Italian plum tart borrowed from Tuscan summer neighbor Nancy Silverton of La Brea Bakery fame, it is not really a culinary title. Edward Mayes appears to be the cook of the family and most recipes are attributed to him, including a soffrito, a tomato sauce, oven roasted tomatoes, artichoke pesto, olive salsa, Tuscan beans, grilled radicchio, farro salad, fried zucchini flowers, shrimp in pasta shells, pici with fresh fava beans, potato gnocchi and sauce, pasta with pancetta, black cabbage soup, vegetable soup, eggplant parmesan, chicken with olives, rolled veal scallops, rolled sole, white peaches with almonds, and tulip shells with berries. Aside from the very last recipe, everything is pretty standard stuff.<br /><br />The basis of the Mayes' expertise in Tuscan style is their ownership and renovation of a middle-sized villa just outside the village of Cortona in Tuscany for the last fourteen (14) years and their furnishing a Marin County, California home after the Tuscan style. This, more than anything else, is the meaning of the title. If this book were written by a journeyman travel writer and if it were priced above its very modest $29.95, this volume would be on a very short trip to the discount piles near the cash registers at Borders and Barnes & Noble. But, the authors are not ordinary writers. Their `day job' is being successful poets. Travel non-fiction and even novel writing appears to be more of a sidelight to their business of writing poetry. And, based on the rather grand appearance of their two homes and their antique Italian furnishings, poetry must be paying pretty well, as a supplement to income from Frances' best-selling novel and movie adaptation.<br /><br />The modest list price is especially surprising when you see the quality of the photography, not only in the technical skill, but also in the careful choice of subjects and the simple consideration of providing a caption to all photographs. The captions are especially important in being able to distinguish scenes from their Tuscan house, `Bramasole' from shots of their new Marin County home which has been decorated to appear as if it were furnished by the Medici's.<br /><br />One can wonder when they have time to write poetry, as their story is that their Tuscan house was at death's door when it was bought with sagging floors and numerous colonies of mice in residence. But, the house probably more than paid its keep by serving as material for poetry, fiction, and non-fiction works, some of which, as already mentioned, have been very rewarding. And, behind all the renaissance antiques and really grand decorative wall paintings, one can see very modern electrical wall switches and the latest in vinyl baseboards above the ancient Italian tiles on the floor.<br /><br />The modest price is also surprising given the quality of the text. While the best reason to buy this book may be to embark on an interior-decorating project aimed at emulating Italian decorative style; the real value of the book is for the reader. How many travel writers make references to the philosophy of Edmund Husserl, the founder of Phenomenology which is best known as the theoretical underpinning of Existentialism, even though it is primarily a doctrine of epistemology, which is a study of what we can know. And, the Mayes are expert at crafting words to bring the experience of both ancientand modern Tuscany about as close to us as possible without an airline ticket to Florence. I even found a little error in medieval sociology interesting as Ms. Mayes was speculating on the closeness of houses in the Tuscan villages, speculating that the Italians rejoiced in simply being close to one another. My college history professor had a much more probable explanation in stating that this was done to conserve arable land for farming, where every square food of soil was valuable for the food it could produce.<br /><br />I was pleased to discover that while Ms. Mayes is involved in a business partnership with an American furniture company in cooperation to design a line of Tuscan inspired products, there is but one small reference to this arrangement and no evidence of any commercial inducements benefiting this relationship anywhere else in the book. This is not to say there are no commercial references at all. The appendices to the book contain references to numerous Tuscan sources for wine, antiques, furniture, sculpture, scagliola (a form of mosaic using shards of gypsum ground and embedded into stone tabletops, bound, and waxed), ceramics, prints and frames, terra cotta, textiles, crystal, and tableware. True to the title of the book, all sources are of merchants or workshops in Italy. For a brief moment, I thought it would have been better to cite American sources, but then, these are easy to find for yourself in this time of the Internet.<br /><br />One product for which an American source may have been nice is the Mayes' own olive oil, produced from the 500 some trees on their Tuscan property. They do give a web site for the product, so I imagine that will give sources. For the traveler, the appendices end with a selection of Tuscan hotels and eateries recommended by the authors.<br /><br />This is a distinctly better than average `lifestyle' book and a worthy companion to Elizabeth Romer's `The Tuscan Year'. Highly recommended for price and words!ancient and modern Tuscany about as close to us as possible without an airline ticket to Florence.

My college history professor had a much more probable explanation in stating that this was done to conserve arable land for farming, where every square food of soil was valuable for the food it could produce. <br /> <br />I was pleased to discover that while Ms. Mayes is involved in a business partnership with an American furniture company in cooperation to design a line of Tuscan inspired products, there is but one small reference to this arrangement and no evidence of any commercial inducements benefiting this relationship anywhere else in the book. This is not to say there are no commercial references at all. The appendices to the book contain references to numerous Tuscan sources for wine, antiques, furniture, sculpture, scagliola (a form of mosaic using shards of gypsum ground and embedded into stone tabletops, bound, and waxed), ceramics, prints and frames, terra cotta, textiles, crystal, and tableware. True to the title of the book, all sources are of merchants or workshops in Italy. For a brief moment, I thought it would have been better to cite American sources, but then, these are easy to find for yourself in this time of the Internet. <br /> <br />One product for which an American source may have been nice is the Mayes' own olive oil, produced from the 500 some trees on their Tuscan property. They do give a web site for the product, so I imagine that will give sources. For the traveler, the appendices end with a selection of Tuscan hotels and eateries recommended by the authors. <br /> <br />This is a distinctly better than average `lifestyle' book and a worthy companion to Elizabeth Romer's `The Tuscan Year'. Highly recommended for price andwords! <br />	2004-12-27

Lots Great Some dumb	`Chef's Secrets' is a cleverly edited book by caterer and writer Francine Maroukian, subtitled `Insider Techniques from Today's Culinary Masters' which has much to offer, some old chestnuts, and a few misguided suggestions.<br /><br />The most important aspect of the book is how much you can take away from it upon a single cover to cover reading. I say this because like similar question and answer books, the text is not well organized for hunting down the answer to a particular question, as all sections are more anecdotal than they are systematic in content. Thus, the greatest advantage is gained by reading the book from cover to cover, from front to back, and absorbing a few new, useful techniques.<br /><br />In doing this, I found much that was interesting in a `by the way' fashion. The first thing that struck me was the large number of contributors who have graduated from the CIA (Culinary Institute of America) and Johnson and Wales. I believe over half graduated from an American culinary educational program, with these two institutions leading the list. I am certain this is a really major change in the culinary scene over the last 50 years. The second interesting observation was the number of times Wolfgang Puck was mentioned as a model of American culinary innovation and inspiration. This may come as quite a blow to the egos of Jeremiah Tower and the opinions of Jim Villas who tend to minimize Puck's serious contribution to the American culinary scene. That Alice Waters is mentioned once is no surprise. That Wolfgang is mentioned twice, more than any other living chef, is notable. The third interesting observation is the number of people who seem to have apprenticed with either Ducasse or Boulud. These two staging sponsors lead the list by a wide margin. All of this makes reading the contributors' thumbnail biographies and `More Secrets' sidebars interesting, but this is not the main show.<br /><br />The primary point of the book is the eighty-two chapters, contain 82 culinary `tips' from 82 recognized experts among the American culinary elite. While the seven (7) `culinary masters' named on the cover are well known, the remaining 75 contributors are no slouches. All are serious master chefs or thoroughly vetted writers active today. And, it appears that all of these tips were solicited from the contributors directly by the editor. They are not extracted from the contributors' printed works. The tips are also laid out in great detail. Many are supported by illustrations; however, several of illustrations in these storyboards are less revealing than they might be.<br /><br />One of the first problems I found with the book is that many of the `insider techniques' are pretty common knowledge to any foodie who has read a few good cookbooks and who dotes on the better Food Network shows such as `Good Eats', `Molto Mario', and `Sara's Secrets' by contributor Sara Moulton. Some good examples of this are the tips on how to peel ginger with a teaspoon, how to defrost meat, how to joint a chicken, how to crisp greens, and how to quickly ripen fruit. Some other tips are just a bit too specialized to be useful to a lot of people. One misleadingly titled example is a tip on how to perfectly roast a chicken that has relatively little to do with what everyone thinks of as `roast chicken'. What the author actually shows us is the classic Italian technique of roasting a deboned chicken under a weight. The following tip by Charlie Palmer on how to roast fowl comes much closer to what the average cook would expect from instructions on roasting birds. Another misguided suggestion is a technique for making an omelet by finishing it in a broiler, in much the same way as you may finish a frittata. I have read at least twenty different techniques for making an omelet, and not one of them finishes the dish in the broiler! This tip is one for the professional short order cook who has a constantly hot salamander at eye level. It is simply a waste of time and gas or electricity to start an omelet on the range and fire up the broiler to finish, especially since every expert on the face of the earth, from Julia Child to Elizabeth David to Jacques Pepin does their omelet on the range from start to finish.<br /><br />This still leaves a lot of good tips to go around. Out of the 82 sections, I suggest that at least twenty will be of some value to the average foodie amateur. A professional cook may find more useful material, but they may also be already familiar with most of the tips. My favorite sections are on creating dried shrimp flakes to use as a seasoning; how to check the salinity of a curing solution; how to sear a fish in a stainless steel pan; how to turn out tender shrimp; how to use bacon to its best advantage while cooking beans; and how to re-establish a non-stick surface on a stainless steel or aluminum pan.<br /><br />Just as I am especially fond of single subject cookbooks such as those dedicated to eggs or potatoes or biscuits or cupcakes or salmon, I especially enjoy these `tip' books; however, I find them less useful than the single subject books or the general giants such as `The Joy of Cooking' or `James Beard's American Cookery'. This book is fun, but it is not quite as good as Perla Meyers' `How to Peel a Peach' or Raymond Sokolov's `How to Cook'. Neither of these two books is perfect, but they are more sound as day to day counselors on important techniques.<br /><br />Recommended as a foodie fun read for a weekend, with some good tips along the way.waste of time and gas or electricity to start an omelet on the range and fire up the broiler to finish, especially since every expert on the face of the earth, from Julia Child to Elizabeth David to Jacques Pepin does their omelet on the range from start to finish. <br /> <br />This still leaves a lot of good tips to go around.

Good Read A bit disconnected	`The Pat Conroy Cookbook' is something of a literary / culinary scrapbook by widely read and filmed Southern novelist, Pat Conroy, who moonlights as a culinary columnist in journals such as `Gourmet', `House Beautiful', and `Southern Living'. I have seen his `Gourmet' essays in passing and first became aware of his active interest in food when I read his Preface to Ms. Sally Ann Robinson's charming little book, `Gullah Home Cooking the Daufuskie Way', although I probably misread the signs, as it was much more likely to me that the honor of the Conroy contribution was due more to Ms. Robinson's once having been a student of Mr. Conroy when he as teaching school near Daufuskie Island. Mr. Conroy mentions Ms. Robinson's book but oddly, neither `Robinson' nor `Daufuskie' appear in the index of this book, even though there is a recipe entitled `Baked Fish Daufuskie'.<br /><br />In many ways, this book is less than the sum of its parts, which are an equal serving of memoir essays followed by a selection of recipes, most of which are offered as Mr. Conroy's invention or adaptation and some of which are attributed to professional chefs such as Frank Stitt and Emeril Lagasse. As a person who is interested in both food and writing, I found much to like in this book, but it just does not hang together as well as similar works, most especially the light diary `Cooking for Mr. Latte' by Amanda Hesser. Neither the essays nor the recipes fill out a coherent picture. Six out of the twenty-two essays are reprinted from another publication, by my count, thirteen (13) of the essays are on culinary topics. The remaining nine (9) are biographical, primarily a part of Mr. Conroy's literary biography.<br /><br />I found the culinary essays, except for the one on Frank Stitt, which I have already read in the preface to Frank Stitt's book, to be very enjoyable, and pretty revealing about a particular grown man's encounters with food and the need to cook. The very first essay explains why Frank Conroy, literary light, had to take up cooking and how this need brought him to a cookbook by Escoffier. It strikes me that on the one hand, starting with Escoffier feels like embarking on the study of Philosophy by reading Emanuel Kant. But, in preparation for writing this review, I did some browsing in Escoffier and I am convinced that Mr. Conroy was extremely lucky to have been directed to the writings that are the fountainhead of Western cuisine for the last century. I found myself in similar circumstances once, and, I believe, share Mr. Conroy's disposition to not try anything unless I can master the task. And, there is simply no better source for mastering modern cooking than the writings of August Escoffier. Oddly enough, I compared Mr. Conroy's recipes for stock with those of Escoffier and found they were substantially different. But, based on my reading of such authorities as Jeremiah Tower and Thomas Keller, I believe Mr. Conroy's stock recipes are right on the money. Vegetables are not cut too finely, scum is skimmed at the right times, and the mix is cooked for just the right time. Mr. Conroy even does most chefs one better in retrieving the meat from the bones while it retains taste, so you have poached chicken for some other application while you continue to cook the bones to strengthen the stock. James Beard would approve.<br /><br />In many ways, the most revealing essay about the culinary world at large was Mr. Conroy's encounter with a young Emeril Lagasse who had just opened his first New Orleans restaurant. In defense of Emeril in this story, I know he opened `Emeril's' on a shoestring and several maxed out credit cards, so money for the restaurateur was very tight. The non-culinary essays have their moments, but about I found that about a third of the essays lost my interest, as I could not tell immediately where the story was going. This is a failure in the book's cohesiveness. While Ms. Hesser's volume relates entirely to her courtship ofMr. Latte, Mr. Conroy picks and chooses material to fill out a book with a certain page count in mind.<br /><br />The selection of recipes is similarly all over the map, ranging from pantry staples such as stocks to Carolina tidewater seafood to Italian sausage and broccoli Rabe to sole en papillote. Like Ms. Hesser's book and like most shows on both the Food Network and PBS, I would treat the recipes in this book to be less a reference for recipes than a source of inspiration to new styles of dishes to be cooked. If I want a Carolina barbecue, I will consult with Steve Raichlen. If I want a French roast chicken, I will check out Julia Child. If I want a broccoli Rabe dish, I will open Marcella Hazan or Lydia Bastianich. But then, there are those who do not own books by Raichlen or Child or Bastianich.<br /><br />For those people, I assure you that Mr. Conroy is not peddling wooden nickels here. The recipes work, there is a very broad range of topics (an advantage in a journalistic approach, a disadvantage as a reference cookbook), and Mr. Conroy's writing about them is engaging. It makes you want to try these dishes to see if you can reproduce his experience.<br /><br />This is neither the best culinary memoir I have read (Ruth Reichl still holds my heart on that subject) nor does it rank in the same class as Jim Villas for culinary writing in general, but it is A GOOD READ. For those familiar with Jan Karon's Mitford Cookbook, be aware that this book makes no connection between recipes and Mr. Conroy's fiction.<br /><br />If you like culinary and literary stories, you will enjoy the essays in this book. Mr. Conroy is a very good writer. You will also find a few pleasing new culinary horizons.ip of Mr. Latte, Mr. Conroy picks and chooses material to fill out a book with a certain page count in mind. <br /> <br />The selection of recipes is similarly all over the map, ranging from pantry staples such as stocks to Carolina tidewater seafood to Italian sausage and broccoli Rabe to sole en papillote.

413760:US	39134375	R2ZTX69ULG08XI	0670032395	769995223	Jan Karon's Mitford Cookbook and Kitchen Reader	Books	5	20	31	N	N	Recipes get same loving attention as the characters. Buy It.	`Jan Karon's Mitford Cookbook & Kitchen Reader', as clearly stated by the title, is a hybrid work of extracts from the fiction of Jan Karon interspersed with recipes inspired by the stories copied from Jan Karon's novels and, in one case, a short story. All fiction is based on the inhabitants of a small Southern town, Mitford. The recipes do not actually appear in the fiction. The stories only contain names of or brief descriptions of dishes. The recipes for these dishes have been brought to life by culinary collaborator, Martha McIntosh, who is credited as the book's editor. <br /> <br />As I am far more expert at reviewing cookbooks than I am at reviewing fiction, and as the fiction in this book is almost all taken out of the context of the novels in which it was first published, I will not review Ms. Karon's writing except as it provides the context for the recipes. <br /> <br />As I constantly state in many of my reviews, cookbooks can be written to many different purposes. Just as Thomas Keller epitomizes `haute cuisine' and Rachael Ray spins out great advice on fast cooking, and it is simply not fair to judge the two by the same standard, this work by Ms. Karon and Ms. McIntosh must be judged by the correct standard. What makes it worse is that this standard is not entirely culinary. The recipes themselves have a strong affinity for traditional Southern cuisine as exemplified by Edna Lewis, James Villas and mother, and Charleston's Mrs. Wilkes and Paula Deen. On one end of this standard are professional culinary writers Villas and Lewis who are attuned to foodie interests. The other end of the spectrum has Mrs. Wilkes and Ms. Deen catering to the average experienced home cook who may have little or no interest in the history of Carolina barbecue or Brunswick stew, and who can interpolate over lapses in instructions in fundraising cookbooks. <br /> <br />And yet, while the recipes can be judged by these standards, the book as a whole is not trying to emulate Lewis or Deen or Wilkes, even though Edna Lewis and co-author Scott Peacock are cited in the book. In a nutshell, this book is primarily food for the spirit by enhancing the experience by readers of Ms. Karon's fictional accounts of a town populated by uncomplicated god-fearing folk, spiritually lead by a Father Tim, whose character appears to have been the spark of inspiration for the whole series of novels. For those of you who may not be familiar with Ms. Karon's fiction, it will also be warm affirmation of anyone who believes that God is actively at work in the world today. <br /> <br />As the recipes' primary function is to support this objective, their culinary merit is secondary, but let me address this before taking the measure of the whole book. <br /> <br />All recipes are arranged as they are mentioned in eight different Karon works plus a final chapter of her grandmother's recipes, `Mama's Miracles'. The title of most recipes attributes it to one of the fictional characters and the text in which the dish is introduced to readers is included to provide context. This immediately makes the book less than typically useful as a culinary reference and much more a book to be read from front to back. Fortunately, the index is excellent so a trip back to the book to find a particularly attractive biscuit recipe should be trouble free. <br /> <br />This raises another point that for certain kinds of dishes, there are often several different, but very similar recipes for the same dish. Biscuits are a perfect example, as there are seven (7) different biscuit recipes, although the last is simply the name of a recipe with the notation that the author's mother, Wanda Setzer, prepares her biscuits `ad lib', with no written directions at hand. There is redundancy for several other such dishes such as stews and fried chicken. <br /> <br />Regarding the quality of recipes such as fried chicken, for which some Southerners (Jim Villas, for one), I can say that they are very, very good. The one I examined closely does all the right things which such culinary exemplars as Edna Lewis, Shirley Corriher, and Alton Brown, all good southerners, heartily endorse. This includes an overnight brining followed by a marinade in buttermilk. As you may expect, buttermilk appears in many recipes, and your license to bake `Southern' would probably be revoked if the food police ever found your refrigerator devoid of a carton of buttermilk. <br /> <br />I also heartily endorse the palette of ingredients such as buttermilk, White Lily Flour, and bacon; however, I am surprised that the culinary editor did not go with purely `all purpose' flour or purely `all purpose self rising flour'. The way the book is written, you need to stock both. But why go to the very commendable trouble of giving a recipe for homemade baking powder, yet try to avoid just a little effort by doubling the pantry requirements for flour sacks? Other small quibbles are the fact that the recipes require `dry yeast', without distinguishing between traditional `Fast Acting' and newer `Instant' yeast. The recipes appear to assume you are using the older `Fast Acting' type that is typically bloomed in warm water with a bit of sweetener. <br /> <br />Being a fictional representation of how real people eat, I was tickled to find recipes for a few very Italian dishes such as Osso Buco sprinkled here and there in the book. I was also tickled to find a paean to the Lodge cast iron skillet and the allowance that if care and feeding of this icon is beyond you, to get a Le Cruset enameled skillet. Even Julia Child is smiling down on that little grace note. <br /> <br />Fans of Ms. Karon's fiction will find this somewhere between a comfort and a hoot, depending on your disposition. The recipes are as good or better than most you will find, but some `shorthand' may require an experienced hand here and there. <br />	2004-12-24
414598:US	39134375	RENRK6IT9XC6N	0393325598	766399010	Cooking for Mr. Latte: A Food Lover's Courtship, with Recipes	Books	4	8	15	N	N	Skillful Writing with Personal Insights about Food and Life	`Cooking for Mr. Latte' is a culinary journal by New York Times culinary columnist, Amanda Hesser which I would not have even noticed except that Ms. Hesser is also the author of a really exceptional culinary and horticultural diary of a year spent in a French country house, `The Cook and the Gardener'. As I gave a very favorable review to the `French book', I felt compelled to taste the quality of Ms. Hesser's writing about something much, much closer to home for both of us.<br /><br />For starters, this volume is much lighter than `The Cook and the Gardener' and does little to support comparisons of Ms. Hesser's writing with that of M.F.K. Fisher. This does not mean this book is not entertaining. It most certainly is, as it has a very light touch in making interesting a life which has relatively little of the `Sturm und Drang' of, say, the self-reported personal life of Ruth Reichl.<br /><br />It's odd to even come close to describing the events Ms. Hesser recounts as `ordinary', as she does prep cooking for Anne Willan, chauffeur's Julia Child to and from Orly airport in Paris, dines with Jeffrey Steingarten, and trades high signs with Bobby Flay at some of New York's more interesting eateries. This is enough to make the life of any daydreaming foodie. But, I guess even lunch at leading Manhattan restaurants can become ordinary after a while. But, a quick check of the book's index reminds me that there is practically no mention of leading culinary landmarks. The book is much more about the culinary side of the romance between Ms. Hesser and `Mr. Latte', beginning with the first blind date and ending with a very successful marriage.<br /><br />What is totally reassuring about the book is in how totally normal a course this relationship plays out, with little awkwardness, occasional discomforts, and growing affections. The picture of Ms. Hesser's personal culinary life may even be more interesting to her foodie readers. For example, I strongly identify with her attitudes on time spent in the kitchen. Like her, I am often very uncomfortable with a second person with me in my relatively small kitchen while I am cooking. I also sympathize with her discomfort when cooking in someone else's kitchen, where you have trouble finding things and are wary of moving anything out of its rightful place.<br /><br />One confession, which is very satisfying, is Ms. Hesser's confession that even though she has attended cooking school and writes about food professionally, she occasionally makes some serious mistakes in the kitchen.<br /><br />About a third of the text in the book consists of recipes, and most of these recipes are not original with the author. Many are copied from published sources such as Julia Child's `Mastering the Art of French Cooking' and `Cooks Illustrated' magazine. Many others are recipes of friends, relatives, future relatives, and restaurants. Their interest is less as a source from which you may wish to cook as it is an illustration supporting the narrative of the events in Ms. Hesser's day. One very nice thing about the book is that while the index says nothing of Le Bernardin, Babbo, or Craft, there are extensive pointers to interesting recipes. What this means is that a recollection of an interesting recipe can take you to the text of that recipe by a simple consult with the index.<br /><br />I was surprised at her take on `Cooks Illustrated', as this journal is commonly very well regarded among many food writers. It was odd that she said it contains no pictures, as it commonly has many. However, I confess to agreeing with her that their writing can often be pretty dour, as they seem to take very seriously their discovery of techniques that have been well known to practicing chefs for generations.<br /><br />As the book is really dedicated to the courtship between Ms. Hesser and her future husband, please don't expect a lot of `New York Times' gossip. There is no mention of leading Times food columnists such as Mark Bittman, Nigella Lawson, or R. W. Appel, although a relatively large chunk of the foodie writing establishment is mentioned in the acknowledgments.<br /><br />In spite of some parallels in the cadences of the two titles, I could find no similarities in content between this book and the novel `Looking for Mr. Goodbar'.<br /><br />Hesser is a genuinely talented writer and while I think M.F.K. Fisher's reputation is not yet in any danger, I agree with the perceptive Ms. Lawson who describes the writing as `Tender, wry, passionate, truthful...' A very charming read. It will encourage me to look up Ms. Hesser's cookbook reviews and hope I find a bit more honesty than I find in the reviews in `Gourmet', `Saveur', and `Bon Appetit'. It actually gives me a little thrill to be reviewing the work of a cookbook reviewer. I look forward to learning something from Ms. Hesser's reviews.<br /><br />Oh, and I thought the drawings by illustrator Izak Zenau matched the tone of the text perfectly. Nothing great, just complementary.elatively large chunk of the foodie writing establishment is mentioned in the acknowledgments.

Buy It.	`Lidia's Family Table' is Lidia Matticchio Bastianich' fourth book and probably the 826th book on Italian cuisine published in English in the last 50 years. The book fully comes up to expectations of quality, given the very experienced team of Bastianich, editor Judith Jones, and publisher Alfred A. Knopf. So, why do we want to add another book on Italian cuisine, this book, to our collection?<br /><br />The first part of the answer is that the book follows in the footsteps of Jacques Pepin's latest book where a prominent culinary writer / educator is writing about what they cook at home. And, they write about it in a way that makes it exceptionally useful for the amateur home cook. This means the book may be more useful to us than the first, a study of the cooking heritage of northeastern Italy based in Bastianich' homeland of Istria, near Trieste and Venice. Or the second, which is Lidia's survey of Italian cooking in general, or her third, which is her survey of `Italian-American' cuisine. Since reviewing this third book, I have read and reviewed several other books on `Italian-American' cuisine and I find Bastianich' work to easily lead the pack in overall quality of recipes.<br /><br />Our current subject does not bill itself as `easy' or `fast' cooking, only as 'everyday cooking at home'. This seems to be a much more satisfying and realistic target for an author of good recipes. Since the fast cooking cookbook field is so crowded and so well dominated by Rachael Ray, why not do what you know best rather than trying to buy into a trend. This book is also not billed as being authentic anything. While a really excellent implementation of Italian cooking principles, there is no claim that these recipes come from anywhere but Ms. Bastianich' own imagination. And, I have absolutely no problem with this. The quality of a recipe is not in its pedigree as it is in the quality of the preparation and in the presentation of the technique. While this is all `home cooking', I suspect from the description of the work which went into the creation of the book that many of the dishes were created for the book or were borrowings from traditional recipes. But, this also doesn't matter.<br /><br />One background fact about the book that may matter is that Ms. Bastianich is very true to her roots in both her creations and in her borrowings. That means that most of the recipes in this book are closer to the northeastern Italian terroir than they are to Rome, Naples, Apulia, or Sicily, the fountainhead of most `Italian-American' cuisine. This immediately makes the book more interesting than other recent offerings from southern Italian scions, Frank Pellegrino and Rocco DeSpirito. This means that Lidia's recipes are very heavily into meals based on rice, corn and fresh pasta than on dry pasta and tomato sauces. The most striking evidence of the influence from central Europe and Vienna is the excellent section on strudel recipes. This is the real deal, as Ms. B. gives us an excellent recipe and photo demonstration on how to make homemade strudel dough. Before you gasp in dismay, let me say that strudel dough as she describes it has more in common with thin pizza dough than the daunting thought of phyllo dough, which is often used as a substitute for strudel dough. I have used phyllo to make strudel and I am not happy with the result. So, I am tickled to find an expert presentation of strudel making for amateurs. The recipes are not even limited to apple strudel. The book covers strudel made from squash and cranberries plus a strudel purse done with prune and ricotta filling.<br /><br />The blurb under the title on the dust jacket makes a point of saying that a major feature of the book is in `ideas for variations and improvisations'. I am very happy to say that this book does an excellent job of providing these suggestions where they are appropriate without straining the style as may have been done in the generally very good book, `Nightly Specials' is written by Michael Lomonaco. The notion of variations takes several different shapes in Lidia's book. The simplest and most obvious is in the discussion of a sauce which follows up with a list of all the types of pasta or other applications to which the sauce can be applied. A second kind of variation is demonstrated in the very first series of recipes for mackerel cured in olive oil. The series begins with a simple recipe for the cured mackerel, followed by applications of cured mackerel in a red onion salad, a bruschetta of cured mackerel and beans, and a mackerel and tomato salad. Leftovers, anyone?<br /><br />In addition to the tutorial on strudel, the book contains an excellent lesson on making fresh pasta, including a large number of variations on the shapes of the finished noodles. The lessons on the strudel and the fresh pasta alone are worth the price of the book.

The simplest and most obvious is in the discussion of a sauce which follows up with a list of all the types of pasta or other applications to which the sauce can be applied. A second kind of variation is demonstrated in the very first series of recipes for mackerel cured in olive oil. The series begins with a simple recipe for the cured mackerel, followed by applications of cured mackerel in a red onion salad, a bruschetta of cured mackerel and beans, and a mackerel and tomato salad.

Highly Recommended	Reviewing `The Science of Cooking' by Bristol University (UK) don Peter Barham gives me the pleasure of commenting on a book with differential equations, a subject for which I received my all time lowest grade (a D) in school. Luckily you, dear reader, these equations are no more than window dressing in a sidebar on thermodynamics which, if nothing else, convince us that Dr. Barham knows what he is talking about. And yes, dear reader, Dr. Barham most certainly knows of what he speaks. And, he does an excellent job of communicating this information to the layman.<br /><br />This excellent book can be evaluated on at least three different levels. On the highest level, where Barham talks about the relevance of science to cooking, the author is just a bit weak. Early in the book, he compares a cook's following a recipe to the conduct of an experiment, and I think this metaphor simply does not work, and, I think the author repudiates this notion later in the book when he does a true description of how a recipe would be written if it were an experiment. A second major weakness in his talking about science is where he describes both a recipe (experiment) and a theory as a model. Philosophers of science clearly distinguish experiment from explanation (theory) and while `model' is a good word for theory, it is definitely not a good word for experiment. Oddly enough, there are important roles for experiment in cookery, but only when one is truly developing recipes and examining the properties of a new foodstuff product. Thankfully, the author gets on to the important business at hand of actually describing science and applying it to cooking, two tasks he does with great skill.<br /><br />Unlike Harold McGee, Barham correctly puts his introduction to basic chemistry in the front of the book. I am sure that thousands of people will stumble over this with unprintable mutterings in an effort to get to the writing about pots and potatoes, but you must gives serendipity a fighting chance. A fair number of readers will pick up on this stuff and it will clearly improve their understanding of what follows. This is especially true as Dr. Barham or his book design team has done an excellent job of selecting illustrations of the basic organic molecules of which he speaks. There is a risk here that since I studied organic chemistry I may not have the same eye of a chemical innocent, but I think not. I believe reasonably intelligent people prefer the straight skinny rather than explanations tailored for 12 year olds. In addition to basic chemistry, Dr. Barham opens the subject of cooking with an overview of the science of food and heat and food and the senses. Here begins what is Dr. Barham's greatest single contribution to food science writing, and the thing that would make this book a superb textbook on food science. In each chapter, Barham supplies two or more experiments on food science that can easily be done at home or in a standard school chemistry lab with no expensive special equipment.<br /><br />I must also note that Dr. Barham is crystal clear on methods of heat distribution. This is important, as Alton Brown's first book has a major error in its opening discussion of heat transfer methods in that he does not rate convection with as much importance as conduction and radiation. Dr. Barham corrects this error by citing that in fact, convection is the most important means of heat transfer in ovens.<br /><br />The next chapter deals with cooking tools and the materials from which they are made. While this chapter is no match for the detail in Alton Brown's book on kitchen equipment, it does include a few cautions that I do not recall Alton's having mentioned. The most interesting is the warning against the very expensive stainless steel sheathed pots with copper or aluminum cores that extend all the way up the sides of the pot. While others have recommended this, the author warns this may cause hot spots high up on the wall of the saucepan that may have undesirable consequences if hot liquid splashes against the even hotter metal high in the pan. Unfortunately, the good doctor does not back this observation up with a demonstration, so it is no better than an anecdotal observation, but I will feel a bit more respectful to the cookware lines with only a disk of high conducting metal in the bottom.<br /><br />The first real foody subject is `Meat and Poultry'. I find it a bit odd that the author says that meat cookery is the one place where an understanding of science can make the biggest difference in cooking results. I can say with confidence that a scientific view of things is probably at least as important, if not more so in baking, where the effect of errors in measuring ingredients can be truly disastrous (or inventive, depending on how you look at it).<br /><br />This chapter is the first appearance of actual recipes and the second great contribution to food science writing (first being the experiments). Here, Dr. Barham not only gives excellently explained recipes; he also gives great little tables of problems that may arise with various cooking methods and how to solve the problems. There is little that is new here except that the presentation gets a lot of the ideas across more effectively than simple narrative. Shirley Corriher uses a similar tabular presentation, although her information is more proactive than diagnostic in that it explains the reasons for steps in the procedure rather than giving solutions for problems.<br /><br />Be warned that all units are metric and there are some unexplained English references here and there, such as the term `A4' for letter paper. I recommend this book very highly. It doesn't have Alton Brown's humor or Shirley Corriher's southern charm, but it is a very, very sound book, once you get past the first three pages.cepan that may have undesirable consequences if hot liquid splashes against the even hotter metal high in the pan.

417940:US	39134375	R3V7PEXD9COAJR	0060392959	975851968	The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen	Books	5	45	56	N	N	Great Source for Vegans and Vegetarians. Highly Recommended	`The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen' is the first cookbook by Peter Berley, the author of a follow-up book, `Fresh Food Fast' to which I gave a somewhat poor review. As I am always a bit self-conscious about giving poor reviews to well-received authors, I always like to check out other works to verify that the book I reviewed poorly is a genuine fall from a level of quality which garnered their recognition.<br /><br />I am resoundingly reassured in reading this multiple award winner (James Beard Foundation and IACP cookbook awards) that chef Berley has written what will easily be a leading candidate in my cookbook hall of fame for vegetarian cooking.<br /><br />One of the most important distinctions to be made about this book is that it is not simply a good book of recipes for vegetables, although it does this job quite well. As the title indicates, this is a thorough coverage of many aspects of modern vegetarian cooking, without going to the extremes represented by complete lacto-ovo-vegans and `Raw' food advocates such as Juliano Brotman. At the same time, low-carb extremists may also be disappointed with Berley's cuisine as he is quite in love with artisinal bread baking, and, good yeast bread baking is simply not possible without white flour.<br /><br />As befits a general book on cooking, the author gives us a very nice introduction to kitchen tools which, to my taste, touches all the right notes. This chapter will never replace Alton Brown's definitive book on kitchen equipment, but it does give much-needed plugs to the use of wooden cutting boards, food mills, mortar and pestle, and sieves. I am not as fond as Berley of the classic box grater and am happy to replace it with a cylindrical Mouli grater and the carpenter's rasp.<br /><br />The book really comes into its own when it discusses pantry items, as it covers some of the vegetarian's best-kept secrets. Mirin and miso are old hat by now, but I highly endorse checking out kombu, a `sea vegetable' from Asia and Umeboshi, a fermented plum paste used as a substitute for anchovies or fish paste. A real boon as a substitute for very important Mediterranean and East Asian staples. Other important little secrets appear later in the chapter on tofu, tempeh, and seitan. Tofu and tempeh are also very familiar to foodies nowadays, but seitan is quite new to me. Briefly, it is gluten from wheat flour, freed from all soluble starch. Since this is not a supermarket staple and since I don't expect Alton Brown to be doing a `Good Eats' show on it any time soon, the author very astutely provides us with a method for making the stuff. It is at least as difficult as making artisinal bread and I suspect I am more interested in making bread than in making Seitan, especially as its production removes nothing that is anathema to a vegan diet. It is basically another animal protein substitute that may be used like tofu. I was pretty intrigued, although, in the seitan recipes which replace classic meat dishes such as pork and sauerkraut and shepherd's pie.<br /><br />While Berley's book is not oriented throughout to seasonal cooking, much of his writing about vegetables does celebrate the seasonality of certain fruits and vegetables. The first chapter of recipes covers stocks and broths, beginning with a utility `All Season Vegetable Stock'. One of the very nice things about vegetable stocks is that they are done a lot faster than meat stocks, and Berley is quite correct in simmering his vegetables for no more than an hour. The next recipe introduces another exotic Asian ingredient, Kombu, for producing a dashi broth, a staple ingredient of Japanese soups. This chapter also includes a roasted vegetable stock plus a summer, autumn, and winter miso soup. As corn chowder is one of my favorite dishes, I was especially happy to see his recipe for a summertime corn and vegetable chowder.<br /><br />Reproducing classic carnivorous favorites with vegan ingredients is a major theme in the book. One of the most interesting examples is a Seitan Bourguignon replacement for beef that, to my eyes, has all the attraction of the original, including the 2 cups of Burgundy wine, mushrooms, orange zest, and tomato paste. All you need is a source for the 1½ pounds of seitan.<br /><br />The author gives all the attention you would expect from a vegetarian chef to cooking with grains and beans. But, I was very pleasantly surprised to see the attention the author paid to bread making. And, he does not limit himself to quickbreads and the standard yeast white country bread. He surveys virtually the whole range of bread making, including unleavened flatbreads from India and artisinal breads based on wild yeasts collected from the must on grapes.<br /><br />As the author freely admits, bread baking is much to big a subject to be covered adequately in a single chapter, but he is very wise to include a reference to his bread making inspiration, Nancy Silverton, whose book `Breads From the La Brea Bakery' were a revelation which changed his whole way of looking at breadmaking. As interest in artisinal bread making is on the rise, I think the author's take on bread making in America was just a bit too dour. On the other hand, I applaud his attention to the subject as a source of inspiration for vegetarian bread bakers.<br /><br />While I try to suppress my subjective reaction to a book until I have surveyed it from beginning to end, I confess the `gut reaction' is often the best clue to whether other people will like the book. And, my gut reaction is as favorable to this book as it was unfavorable to his second book. Like the books which inspired him, Berley's book is a great jumping off point for vegetarians and a great source of recipes and ingredients for enriching a vegetarian cuisine.<br /><br />Very highly recommended.ook.

Highly Recommended	`Hey There, Cupcake!' by culinary writer, Clare Crespo answers the burning question of where can I find a good cupcake recipe when I need one. This is actually the second cupcake book I am reviewing and I am happy to have both; however, if asked, I will definitely recommend Ms. Crespo's opus over `The Artful Cupcake' by Marcianne Miller.<br /><br />First and foremost is the fact that Ms. Crespo's book is simply more fun, and I suspect that is what cupcakes are all about, aside from being, in Ina Garten's words `a delivery system for icing'. Both books are a bit light on recipes for the `cake' half of the cupcake team. Neither has a recipe of, for example, a carrot cake cupcake. I have also just noticed that neither has an index, although you will probably not really miss it, unless you happen to be looking for a carrot cake cupcake recipe.<br /><br />Ms. Miller is less a culinary writer than a `crafts' writer, as I pointed out in detail in my review of her book. Oddly, `The Artful Cupcake' has a lot more general information on cupcake tools, general techniques, and ingredients. Ms. Miller handles the writing on baking and the cupcake designs are actually done by visiting crafts people. So, Ms. Miller is more of an editor than a true author. Ms. Crespo, on the other hand, seems to have done all the writing and cupcake designing chores on her book. As proclaimed by her subtitle, '35 Yummy Fun Cupcake Recipes for All Occasions', I repeat that Ms. Crespo's book is simply more fun. Among other things, this means it is a much better book for younger bakers. In fact, while Clare does not push this point too much, there is a sense about the book that it was written for a young audience, without actually talking down to the reader.<br /><br />Aside from fun, one excellent advantage of Ms. Crespo's book is the fact that it does offer a lot of designs for specific occasions, especially specific occasions not generally covered by other pastry design books such as a knitting party (Ball of Yarn, Needle and Thread), New Years Eve (Clocks), atypical Halloween (Brain, Buried Alive, Eyeball, Brain), graduation (Brain, Coin), Superbowl (play-off) and so on.<br /><br />Unlike some of Ms. Miller's designs, most of the decorations by Ms. Crespo are relatively easy, making excellent use of the kind of props you will find in a well-stocked craft store. I got the sense that these designs are very similar to the kind of skill and sense of humor we find behind some of Thomas Keller's more famous dishes where one kind of dish is made out to look like another, as with his famous doughnuts and coffee dish. Speaking of which, there is even a cupcake here that does an excellent job of masquerading as a cup of coffee, if served in a plausibly heavy white diner mug.<br /><br />The book begins with a simple recipe for THE classic cupcake with white crumb and a vanilla butter cream icing, tinted pink, with a cherry on top. If I were teaching from this book, I would definitely encourage students to do this first. All cupcakes in the book are based on ten (10) cake recipes and six frosting recipes. This means that if you master a fair number of these sixteen recipes, you are well on your way to impressing friends and family with great cupcake improvisations.<br /><br />My only reservation about the instructions in the book are that some directions for the decorating schemes would have been greatly improved by a few simple diagrams, especially if the book is to be tackled by young adults. It took me at least two or three tries to adequately visualize how one was to accomplish the design from the words in the directions. Compliments to Ms. Miller for providing such illustrations on a few of her more difficult designs.<br /><br />As both of these books are relatively inexpensive, especially with a reasonable discount, I recommend them both. Ms. Miller's designs are much more suitable for grown-up occasions while Ms. Crespo's designs work much better for kids as bothaudience and sous chef to an adult who knows their way around a bag of King Arthur.<br /><br />Highly recommended for original, entertaining cupcake designs.r kids as both audience and sous chef to an adult who knows their way around a bag of King Arthur. <br /> <br />Highly recommended for original, entertaining cupcake designs. <br />	2004-12-19
419794:US	39134375	R66K70Y3BFJ0O	0679457496	556183328	Rao's Cookbook: Over 100 Years of Italian Home Cooking	Books	5	41	44	N	N	Italian-American Home Cooking. Great Sentiment. Pricy	`Rao's Cookbook' by restaurateur / chef / actor Frank Pellegrino is the restaurant cookbook of what may be considered Manhattan's premier corner bar. The story is that the restaurant is only open five days a week, has but eight tables and each and every one of them is booked solid, like corporate boxes at the Astrodome. So, virtually the only way to get a sitting at Rao's is to be invited by a person with a permanent table reservation, or have such a benefactor lend you their reservation or, for a single evening, have the table revert to the discretion of Rao's matre'd.<br /><br />The attraction of Rao's is not the same as that for Mario Batali's `Babbo' down in the village. Rao has no celebrity chef and its cuisine is simple Italian-American fare. There are no pilgrimages to the Union Square market for superfresh artisinal provisions. All their goods are bought at local shops in what is left of `Little Italy North' on the corner of Pleasant Avenue and 113th street in East Harlem.<br /><br />This book is much more a celebration of place and of a very simple cuisine than it is any attempt at haute cuisine. At less than 180 pages of text, with lots of those pages taken up by Rao family snapshots, the book lists for a hefty $40, possibly to support the stipend to Dick Schapp and Nicholas Pileggi, who contributed a Preface and an Introduction respectively.<br /><br />As chance would have it, I reviewed author Pellegrino's newer book before opening this volume, and I discover that there is a lot of overlap in the titles of recipes between the two books. That may not be an entirely bad thing for owning the two volumes, as the earlier one presents restaurant recipes while the later book presents personal `Italian-American' cuisine. This means that the earlier book's recipes may be more elaborate, but in general they are not. There are some few differences in the way a lot of the recipes are written, but few of these differences are likely to make a big difference in taste. Both books share the same attention to simplicity and the same pantry. Both books, for example, consistently use canned San Marsano tomatoes in all recipes. The restaurant book does make a point of manually removing any hard flesh in the tomato while mashing up its pulp. There are also instructions with several recipes on how to prep a dish so that it is ready to be served after just a last minute saute.<br /><br />The recipe chapter's names are virtually identical to the newer `Neighborhood' book. In general, the newer book is much more consistent in its presentation of an English dish title with an Italian subtitle. The `Neighborhood' book is also much better in consistently providing captions for all photographs, contemporary or historical. I would also rate the recipes in this book a bit better than Rocco DiSprito's latest effort, and equal to recipes in John Mariani's excellent book on Italian-American cuisine and recipes. Neither book's recipes are quite as good as Lydia Bastianich's much longer book on Italian-American cuisine.<br /><br />The numerous quotes sprinkled throughout the book range from cute to interesting, and contribute nothing to the culinary value of the book. The selection of desserts is nothing special. The ultimate reason for buying this book may be to taste the dishes you simply cannot get from Rao, because it is impossible to get a table there.<br /><br />I am happy to have read this book and I will refer to it and its partner, the `Neighborhood' book when I am looking for good, simple, pasta or chicken recipes, but I will continue to rely on Hazan, Bastianich, and other professional writers for my staple source of Italian recipes.<br /><br />This is a good book of recipes, albeit a bit overpriced. If you need to choose, I recommend the newer book, as it has more recipes and less fluff for the same price. If the discount is deeper on this earlier book, get it instead.<br /><br />Recommended source for good Italian-American recipes and southern Italian sentiments.n recipes and southern Italian sentiments. <br />	2004-12-18

Pricy	`Rao's Recipes From the Neighborhood' appears to be a publication by restaurateur / actor Frank Pellegrino of his family's scant 196 page cooking scrapbook from the last two generations of the Rao / Pellegrino family which have lived in New York City, for a list price of $40 bucks a pop.<br /><br />Before you get the notion that this is a cranky review of negatives and hit the `Not Influenced' button, let me say that this book really succeeds in giving us something interesting and useful, if not entirely new. It is certainly good enough to give it four stars, and the only thing keeping it from five is its relatively high price.<br /><br />On the face of it, this appears to be a brand name rip-off, cashing in on the success of the restaurant, the original cookbook of restaurant recipes, and the Rao line of supermarket products. However, this book is not similar to other culinary publishing rip-offs such as the Alton Brown blank book and the Mark Bittman subdivision of his book into three booklets.<br /><br />I will say that St. Martin's Press has used the lucre they expect to get for this price to good effect. The design of the book is crisp, the photography is good, all photographs are CAPTIONED and appear at an appropriate place in the text, and not much of the precious 196 pages are taken up with poorly written family stories.<br /><br />The first thing to notice is that these are NOT recipes from the restaurant, Rao. They are recipes from Frank Pellegrino's friends and family labeled in a 72-point font with the name of the famous restaurant and forwarded by family friend and restaurant reviewer Mimi Sheraton, who put Rao's on the map with a three star rating in a New York Times restaurant review. So, this book is borrowing luster from the restaurant rather than serving as a promotion for same restaurant. The restaurant doesn't need the business, as I suspect not even Donald Trump or Bill Clinton could get a reservation at one of their eight (8) tables.<br /><br />And, the recipes are really very good and most are exceptionally simple, but many are sophisticated when they have to be. This simplicity is all to a good cause, since the heart of the Italian genius with food is to create a pantry of exceptional ingredients, then don't mess them up. (Pellegrino does an homage to this principle in his introductory section on pantry items.) Sometimes, you can only appreciate this quality when you look at non-Italian interpreters such as London's River Caf&eacute; and Jamie Oliver. The simplicity really shines in recipes such as the Puttanesca sauce where the constant problem of not burning the garlic is solved simply with nary a need for a cautionary note by simply not adding the garlic until after the anchovies and olives have been added. As no ingredient is left out, I am hard pressed to believe this will taste any worse than the very fussy (but very good) version from `Cooks Illustrated' magazine.<br /><br />When a cookbook is good, that quality usually shows itself on the first or second recipe and this book proves this rule. Even though this is a book of `Italian-American' recipes, the very first recipe is a perfect implementation of a classic unfussy Italian `Brodo di Pollo' which is made with coarsely chunked vegetables, is simmered for a scant hour and 15 minutes, and retains the poached chicken meat for some other purpose. The recipe even includes an optional enhancement I do not recall seeing elsewhere, with a thickening of the stock by adding a puree of the cooked carrots, leeks, and celery.<br /><br />Another application of pure Italian culinary tradition is in the recipe for the wedding soup, where each green is carefully blanched separately, blanching water is saved as a later ingredient, cannellini beans are carefully pureed, and savories are gently saut&eacute;ed, all before making the final assembly. Marcella Hazan could not have done it better. Aside from the opening chapter on soups, there are chapters on Salads;Egg Dishes; Pizza, Calzone, and Bread; Pasta, Rice, Polenta, and Sauces; Seafood; Chicken; Meats; Vegetables; and Desserts. While the bread chapter does not match the depth of understanding provided by a specialist's book by, for example, Peter Reinhart or Carol Field, it is really pretty good.<br /><br />The biggest question one faces when considering getting this book is `Do I really need another Italian or Italian-American cookbook?' There is simply very little here which is new. I would definitely recommend this book in preference to Rocco DiSpirito's book he did with his mom. A perfect example is their Puttanesca recipes which Pellegrino does in 15 minutes with basic ingredients and which Rocco does in 20 minutes, needing a prepared sauce that takes additional time to make.<br /><br />And, I would consider this book the equal to John Mariani's book as a source for `Italian-American' recipes (but without Mariani's excellent historical perspective and wine notes). It is also as good as `Eleanora's Kitchen' by Eleanora Scarpetta, and maybe just a touch better, as it is a choral work rather than just a solo effort. As a definitive presentation of `Italian-American' cuisine, it is not quite as good as Lydia Bastianich's excellent PBS series tie-in book. When I compare the Italian-American classic sausage and peppers from all books, I find Bastianich' version to be by far the most tasty (although I have a sneaky suspicion that her recipe has more to do with her northern Italian origin than it has to do with Mulberry street in Manhattan).<br /><br />If you have no `Italian-American' cookbooks, this volume is an excellent purchase, especially if you can get a good discount.Egg Dishes; Pizza, Calzone, and Bread; Pasta, Rice, Polenta, and Sauces; Seafood; Chicken; Meats; Vegetables; and Desserts.

While I am sure there are some like yours truly who actually open `The Joy of Cooking' or `Mastering the Art of French Cooking' or `Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking' and read it from front to back, but around 99% of all cookbooks are, after an initial scan to get a sense of what's in them, meant to be consulted on a recipe by recipe basis.<br /><br />Some books such as `Cookwise' and Alton Brown's three books are meant to be read from cover to cover and you can do this by skipping all the recipes and get a good foundation in the science of cooking. But, cooking is not really about Science, it's about learning basic recipes and mastering a fairly wide variety of techniques. Thousands of professional cooks do exceptionally well by following the kind of advice given by Daniel Boulud without ever cracking the covers of Harold McGee's `On Food and Cooking'.<br /><br />The leading volumes in this important field of culinary textbook aside from Willan's works are the Culinary Institute of America's `The New Professional Chef' and Madeleine Kamman's `The New Making of a Cook'. As the titles of these works indicate, they are especially valuable works in that they have been around for a long time and have gone through major revisions as a result of actually using them in culinary classrooms. To further distinguish these select volumes, I will point out that they are different from the excellent books of techniques by Jacques Pepin and James Peterson, in that these works are reference books of techniques rather than the far more common reference books of recipes.<br /><br />Willan's book is a careful blend of both recipes and techniques illustrated by excellent supporting photography which could easily be both read and cooked from cover to cover. In fact, while the techniques are excellently presented, this book may not be as good a reference as Pepin's classic, but it is far better than virtually every other work I have seen as a TEXTBOOK! And, my reason for saying this is based on more than Willan's skill as a teacher and the quality of her material. It is also based on the fact that the book is easy to read. It's presentation is not too different from taking lessons in cooking from a very wise and experienced aunt who has a grown and married daughter who is also an accomplished cook. References to recipes contributed from Willan's daughter, Emma, are often used as clever devices for introducing shortcuts and modernization of classics as when Willan presents Emma's take on Coq au Vin which can be done in a single day rather than in the traditional three days. For any who are unfamiliar with Willan's credentials, I will point out that she is the founder and one of the principle instructors at a highly respected cooking school based in France which also gives sessions at the Greenbriar Hotel in West Virginia.<br /><br />The book's contents are organized in a very friendly way which ease you into useful techniques very quickly, unlike the CIA text which starts off with a seemingly endless chapter on the details of making excellent classic French stocks. While this follows the CIA course schedule, it is not suited to maintaining your interest when you need to get a meal on the table tonight.<br /><br />The principle chapters are:<br /><br />Essential Flavors which deals with basic pantry recipes such as Persillade, vinaigrettes, gremolata, and garlic bread, with techniques on using a chef's knife and a mandoline, plus recipes for basic salads such as potato salad and cole slaw. After a good deal of such immediately useful recipes and techniques is the obligatory section on stocks that is less fussy than the CIA, but quite correct, thank you.<br /><br />Tips From the Pros is a grab bag of tips on modern mixing equipment, marinates, brines, and frying.<br /><br />Saucery will cover just aboutall your everyday needs with more vinaigrettes, mayonnaise, hollandaise, b&eacute;arnaise, butter sauces, gravies, and pestos.<br /><br />Eggscetera covers boiled, deviled, curried, stuffed, scrambled, and coddled eggs as well as omelets, crepes, souffles and mousselines.<br /><br />Fabulous Fish and Seafood is a bit short for a school based on the French coastline, but it does cover the basics for shrimp, mussels, scallops, and generic fin fish.<br /><br />From the Farmyard covers poultry<br /><br />Mastering Meats covers roasting, braising, stewing, steaking, grilling, and medallioning (sic).<br /><br />Perfect Pasta and Rice covers basic dry pasta dishes plus making fresh pasta featuring daughter Emma. You could do much worse than to learn Risotto making from this chapter.<br /><br />The Vegetable Story covers lots of new knife skills plus blanching, saut&eacute;ing, salads and grilling.<br /><br />Pastry Fundamentals covers exactly those things which the average home cook needs to know, such as a standard pastry crust (pate brisee), biscuits (baking powder and butter, not buttermilk) quiches, phyllo dough (how to work with it, not to make it) and savory pies.<br /><br />This is just about as good a sophomore level textbook you are likely to find on cooking techniques and basic recipes. It not only teaches, it gives the reader a journeyman's lay of the land for French and Italian cuisine. There are no distractions for wine or name-dropping or storied suppliers or dish histories. This is `Just the Facts, Madam' with a wee bit of leavening with family stories, not too different from what you may hear among your favorite aunt's stories.<br /><br />Not the least feature of the book is the fact that the author gives tips on the proper serving time for dishes, as when she compares a roast (serve immediately) with a braise (improves with age).<br /><br />If you know everything there is to know about cooking, this book may bore you.

On the face of it, this makes the book an obvious advertisement for the butcher shop, or, more exactly, for their Internet ordering service.<br /><br />This doesn't mean the book is not good. Emeril has put his name to some pretty good books that are really shameful advertisements for his restaurants and retail products. He has especially managed to corner the market on pretty good books for kids' cooking. So, does the Lobel's expertise in butchery translate to expertise in cookbook writing?<br /><br />My overall impression is that this is an average cookbook with a decent collection of somewhat poorly written recipes and only a small amount of inside information on how to deal with good meat. The value of the book is just barely saved by a lower than average price which befits its primary role as a promotion for their retail business.<br /><br />The few tips I learned from this book about handling meat are that:<br /><br />- One should freeze or refrigerate meat in the packaging in which it was sold at the store.<br /><br />- Duck is one meat which is best bought frozen. Almost all else should be bought fresh.<br /><br />- Meat holds its freshness in the freezer a much shorter time in summer due to the high humidity.<br /><br />- Don't try to catch a knife if it falls to the floor. Let it come to rest before picking it up.<br /><br />- There are three levels of coarseness in sharpening stones. The middle level is the most commonly used.<br /><br />This isn't much from a book by meat experts. It is amazing to discover that there is not a single diagram of primals from butchering beef, pork, or lamb. The book spends a fair amount of time with the care and sharpening of knives, without a single picture on how to sharpen knives. They would have done a whole lot better to simply recommend, as Alton Brown does, that you should not sharpen a knife yourself, but give the job to a professional. Dear Alton is mistaken when he says professionals do this. I know very well that professional chefs sharpen their own knives and the CIA even has a whole book dedicated to the subject, `The Professional Chef's Knife Kit' which I heartily recommend to anyone willing to develop knife sharpening skills.<br /><br />My initial take on the recipes was that they were pretty good until I started encountering some with pretty serious omissions such as the recipe for the Cuban sandwich which neglects to tell the cook how and when to cut the pork loin before putting the slices on the bread. I also had serious reservations about their pork and sauerkraut recipe that used pork loin. This recipe is basically a braise, so meat on the bone with a fair amount of cartilage is better than the very lean loin. The book in general seems to lean heavily toward the more expensive cuts of meat. There is also virtually no notice of some of the more interesting methods for dealing with Porky. One recipe gives a technique for brining thick pork chops, yet the word brining doesn't even appear in the index. If you have a special interest in pork, definitely pass this book by and get yourself a copy of `Bruce Aidells's Complete Book of Pork'. This excellent book gives you everything you may have expected in the Lobel's book. On the plus side, the few recipes for stocks at the end of the book are very simple with little chance of producing an excessively cloudy stock.<br /><br />If you want a very good book on cooking meat, get the volume `How to Cook Meat' by cooking experts Chris Schlesinger and John Willoughby. This work is not limited to grilling for which these authors are so justly famous.<br /><br />Aside from some good comments on buying meat and selecting it for particular recipes, the Lobel's book practically nothing you might expect from a book by professional butchers. My three stars means that it is simply an average book which is saved from two stars by a less than average list price. I predict this volume will quickly find its way to the discount piles.it is simply an average book which is saved from two stars by a less than average list price.

Buy it.	`The Professional Chef's Knife Kit' by `The Culinary Institute of America' contains absolutely everything you ever wanted to know about things in the kitchen with sharp edges and things that maintain those sharp edges.<br /><br />The book actually goes far beyond the care and honing of knives, as it is also an advanced course on knife skills. The chapters are:<br /><br />Knife Basics covering history and the range of kitchen tools for cutting.<br /><br />Knife Care, or how to keep the knife sharp without shedding any blood.<br /><br />Basic Cuts, possibly the most important and interesting chapter in the book.<br /><br />Vegetables and Fruits, or how to wrangle onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, and other veggies to the pot.<br /><br />Meat and Poultry<br /><br />Fish and Shellfish<br /><br />Summary<br /><br />Glossary<br /><br />As a former Boy Scout who took his knife skills very seriously and knew all about Arkansas stones and the proper angle with which to hone a knife, I am really impressed by the level of detail in this book. The Basic Cuts chapter is a wonderful example of how valuable this book can be. Hundreds of hours on the Food Network will cover most of this stuff eventually, but this brings it all together and adds things Emeril never even mentions. Section of this chapter is `Preliminary Cuts', which is roughly comparable to removing the bark from a tree and squaring it off before cutting it into marketable lumber. `Shredding and Grating' shows you how to do the same operation with either a knife or a box grater. The sections on `Slicing Cuts' gives equal time to the chef's knife, the paring knife, and the mandoline, covering both the simple and the exquisite such as the crinkle cut done with a mandoline and the roll cut done on cylindrical veggies done with a knife. Of great value is the instruction on how to do the most basic of cuts such as the Julienne, the Batonnet, and the various dices. You probably have no real sense of the level of detail to which French cooking doctrine goes until you have read the section on decorative cuts of potatoes.<br /><br />This book is an excellent supplement to Jacques Pepin's `Complete Techniques'. Pepin describes a dozen or so different cuts of a potato, the CIA tells you how to do them.<br /><br />This book is hands down the best argument I can think of for relegating your food processor to making doughs and bread crumbs and laying out the cash for a really sharp knife and a few hours of practice.<br /><br />This book is a must for serious amateur and professional cooks.until you have read the section on decorative cuts of potatoes. <br /> <br />This book is an excellent supplement to Jacques Pepin's `Complete Techniques'.

Super	`Fagioli' by professional cookbook writer Judith Barrett is quite clearly subtitled `The Bean Cuisine of Italy', as it is all about cooking with Italian beans.<br /><br />This book immediately succeeds at the first and most important task of a special purpose cookbook in that it has made be really care about and be interested in its subject. It accomplishes this feat first by being a very attractively designed hardcover book with a very well sewn binding which nicely lays flat where you want it to. Next, it's modest artwork and typography complements its presentation so that it is simply a pleasure to read. No eye strain here. Congratulations to the Rodale Press for packaging a very nice volume. Finally, the all the introductory material is accurate to the best of my knowledge. There are no lingering myths about the risks of salting cooking beans, there is no doctrinaire approach to having to soak beans, and there is a tolerance, with warnings, about using a pressure cooker to cook beans, as the sine qua non of bean cookery is like barbecue, `low and slow'. The only hint of elitism I detected was the statement that somehow, the Italians have mastered a secret to a tasty cooking of beans which is beyond we poor New World neophytes who have been cooking beans for less than 400 years. I will concede that the knowledge of good bean cooking is probably a bit harder to find outside of Boston, but I think we have the hang of it.<br /><br />One of the most liberating revelations was the fact that Italians actually cook a lot with dried beans imported from the New World, as North America exports much more than it consumes, and Italy consumes all it produces, so no dried Italian beans sit on the grocery shelves beyond a year of harvest, especially as date of production is stamped on the bean packages just as we do for bread and milk.<br /><br />While my hero, Alton Brown has remarked that bean cooking is remarkably uniform, far more consistent across species than with grains, he certainly did not take into account the variety of beans covered by this book, which deals with at least fifteen (15) different species of beans, some of which have no substitutes if the real thing is not available. Fortunately, the unique varieties of beans, the chickpea and the fava are commonly available in the United States. Every other type of bean has more than one commonly available substitution, which is important since there are some beans which are available only in Italy and which do not travel well.<br /><br />The recipes are organized in exactly the way one would expect from an Italian cookery subject, with chapters on:<br /><br /> Primi Piatti, divided into sections on Antipasti, Insalate, and Contorni (Side Dishes)<br /><br />Zuppa di Fagioli, divided into sections on Minestre, Zuppe (Thick Soups), and Passali (Creamy Soups)<br /><br />Pasta e Fagioli, of course<br /><br />Secondi Piatti, divided into Fagioli e Farinacci (Grains), Fagioli con Carne (Meat), Fagioli con Selvaggina (Poultry), and Fagioli con Pesce (Seafood)<br /><br />I have never, up until today, been quite clear on the difference between Minestre and Zuppa. I always thought of Minestre as a relatively thick soup, especially as prepared in Florence, for example, but the Tuscan bean soup recipe trumps all visions of soupy thickness by including six different varieties of beans.<br /><br />This division of recipes does not mean there is no seafood in the salads or antipasti. In fact, the salads include tuna, shrimp, and octopus as co-conspirators in the salad recipes.<br /><br />This book gives an excellent discussion of non-bean ingredients for its size and does the especially good service of telling us where we can get these ingredients at the same place where their use is discussed. This may not be the best arrangement when we pick up the book later as a reference, but it gives a very good sense of how easy or how hard it is to get some of these things such as bottarga, guanciale,and porcinis.<br /><br />One could argue that if you have a library full of books by Marcella Hazan, Lydia Bastianich, and a platoon of other Italian cooking writers, what do you need with this book? My first answer is that unlike most general works written for Americans, it tells you what kind of beans are actually used in these recipes. Next, like every special subject book, it is simply a lot easier to find a recipe to fit your need for beans than rummaging through the index of six other books.<br /><br />As expected from a professional cookbook writer, all the recipes are exceptionally well written and there is a delightful variety in the selection. I cannot guarantee that this book will remove the pasty flavor of beans from your preparations (especially since we have no way of knowing how old our dried beans are), but it will make every effort to do so. The rest is up to you.<br /><br />Very pleasant, very informative, and very tasty read.

424992:US	39134375	R2BO62496NJIL3	1894663667	291934163	Cupboard Love: A Dictionary Of Culinary Curiosities	Books	4	3	3	N	Y	Great Foodie Fun with Word Origins. Not Complete.	`Cupboard Love' by Canadian linguist and professor of English Mark Morton is in a Second Revised Edition, based on a volume that was in its original edition nominated for a Julia Child award in 1997. The author makes it very clear in his original preface that this is a work of etymology, which is a study of word origins, not, like CSI Gil Grissom's subject, the study of insects. This rather trivial distinction is not nearly as important as the difference between etymology (word origins and transformations) and the meaning of words. My Merriam-Webster 3rd Edition clearly distinguishes the two by saying that a dictionary commonly provides both types of information. Even though this book is subtitled `A Dictionary of Culinary Curiosities', it is not truly a work of a lexicographer like Samuel Johnson or Noah Webster. It is much more a work of philology as done by the Brothers Grimm (when they weren't writing fairy tales) and H. L. Menchen (when he wasn't scorching the boobiesee with his newspaper columns and other writings).<br /><br />What all of this means in practical terms is that while the book does an excellent job of explaining the origins of words such as `barbecue', `chowder', and `Caesar Salad', it says very little about what these things are. As such, the book is much more something to be read for entertainment than as a kitchen reference like the great `Larousse Gastronomique' or Alan Davidson's `The Oxford Companion to Food'. Aside from being a pleasure to read, the book is primarily a source for writers of cookbooks who wish to provide entertaining headnotes to recipes for aubergines, rocket, and ramps. But wait, `rocket', the UK name for arugula, and `ramps', the name of a wild garlic does not appear in this book. The work `ramps' does appear, but with a reference to a different word which has nothing to do with wild garlic.<br /><br />I am never quite sure what to think about reference books that happen to overlook a subject I expect to find in the book. The thing which makes this issue doubly vexing is that there are simply no other books on this subject in print in English, that I know of. Therefore, I pretty much have to use my best judgment on whether or not this book should have included an entry. On balance, I think that rocket / arugula is such an interesting word pair that I believe leaving it out is a significant oversight.<br /><br />In fact, I think this book's primary weakness is that it falls into a crack between trying to be a scholarly work and trying to be an embassy from the academic world of language study to the layman foodie and reader. If the book were intent on academic content, it would have cited its sources for its histories so that the interested reader or, more likely, the interested writer using the book as a source, could get more information on the subject. The author cites many scholarly works in his introduction, but no systematic reference to sources is made in the individual articles.<br /><br />To redeem the book, I will say that I found nothing in the book that I could counter with any authority, which is no surprise as my linguistic training is more in the study of meaning than in the study of history. I am, however, aware of some dissenting opinions on some important topics. John Thorne, for example, has written extensively on chowder, its origins, and the origin of the word `chowder'. And, although he repeats Morton's etymology based on the French name for a big pot, he does cite a very different and equally plausible origin from the Cornish work `jowter', an itinerant fish hawker. This was published in Thorne's `Serious Pig' in 1996. So, since Thorne is one of the most respected writers on the history of food preparations, I'm surprised that Morton did not take Thorne's finding into account.<br /><br />This is a specific symptom of the fact that the culinary content of this book is very light. The book gives the generally recognized origin of the word `barbecue' from a cooking method of a tribe of Caribbean natives, but the article on this word says virtually nothing about the technique of barbecue. It makes no mention whatsoever of the fact that strictly speaking, it should be applied to a technique that involves very long exposure to low heat plus smoke. Similarly, I found the culinary content of the entry for `Caesar Salad' to be very light. Instead, the author spends a page on the story of the name `Caesar' and its influence on the German `Kaiser' and Russian `Czar'. This article, for example, makes no reference to the use of egg or anchovies in the recipe. Thus, anyone looking for either culinary substance or reliable synonyms for unfamiliar words will probably be disappointed.<br /><br />I was also just a bit disappointed at the absence of certain important culinary terms such as `ceviche', `carpaccio', or `ragu', even though the words `sushi' and `ragout' are covered.<br /><br />I sense that I have probably been a bit hard on this book. In spite of all my nit-picking, the book is very entertaining to read. My only concern is that people see the word `Dictionary' in the title and mistake it for something it is not. This is purely and simply a collection of entertaining stories about the origins of some culinary terms. So, if you love words or you love food or you love both, this book will be a delight to read.<br /><br />Highly recommended as an entertaining read for foodies.om a cooking method of a tribe of Caribbean natives, but the article on this word says virtually nothing about the technique of barbecue.

426703:US	39134375	R24HV1I02AU1K5	0811833798	493097197	The Pleasures of Slow Food: Celebrating Authentic Traditions, Flavors, and Recipes	Books	4	33	33	N	Y	Very Good Essay on Slow Food. Little use as a cookbook	`The Pleasures of Slow Food' is edited by Atlantic Monthly editor Corby Kummer in that the half of the book contains recipes collected from European and American chefs prominent in the Slow Food movement. The first thirty pages of the book are taken up by a preface written by the founder of the Slow Food movement, Carlo Petrini, a Foreword written by Atlantic Monthly colleague (and author of the best-selling `Fast Food Nation') Eric Schlosser, and with an essay by the author on a description of the history and activities of the Slow Food organization. Eleven (11) essays take up the next fifty pages on various artisinal food producers. After the recipes is a very nice two-page table of contacts for the Slow Food movement in Europe and the United States and for contributors to this book.<br /><br />The most important question to a prospective purchaser of this volume is `Do I want to shell out $40 for a collection of recipes by Rick Bayless, Deborah Madison, Alice Waters, Judy Rodgers, Paul Bertolli, Daniel Boulud and ten other notable American and European chefs'. The question becomes more acute if you, like me, already own twenty cookbooks by these contributors. I will soon point out some observations that make this decision even easier.<br /><br />The `Slow Food' moniker for Carlo Petrini's movement is really a serious misnomer, as the primary objective of the movement is not as an adversary to MacDonalds, even though the projected startup of a MacDonalds at the base of Rome's Spanish steps was the precipitating act which set the movement in motion. As Allison Janney's character C. J. Craig said in a `West Wing' episode, `We need an enemy on this issue'. Fast food restaurants are not so much evil in themselves as, like Gresham's law, they threaten to drive out the things which this movement wishes to preserve. These valuables are artisinal foods and methods, most of which have been used and practiced for centuries, and are in danger of disappearing as much through the action of large food processors and government regulations as they are by the presence of a McDonald's in Rome. This is not to say Fast Food is not evil in its own right, as Schlosser points out, a typical fast food hamburger is a virtual soup of overprocessed, underflavored, artificial ingredients with an unpleasant aftertaste. But this is really a different battle than the preservation of valuable food traditions.<br /><br />The Slow Food movement was founded in Italy, which still has the largest participation. In the early years of the movement, the leading country outside of Italy was Germany. France came to the table very late, and in the last few years, membership in the United States has been leading the charge alongside the Italians. This is largely due to the synergy between the movement's objectives and the vision of American culinary leaders such as Rick Bayless, Deborah Madison, Alice Waters, and Waters' apostles Judy Rodgers and Paul Bertolli.<br /><br />The movement has three principle initiatives. These are the Ark, a directory of endangered foods around the world, the Presidia or local organizations which work at preserving Ark foods, and the Slow Food Award which brings attention and assistance to agricultural activists who work with Ark foods. The most visible activity of the movement is the Salone del Gusto, a multi-day conference on the activities of the movement. But back to the book.<br /><br />As an introduction to the Slow Food movement, this book is much better than the two earlier books I have reviewed on this subject by prominent authors Paula Wolfert and Joyce Goldstein. Had I known of the information in this book before I reviewed Wolfert and Goldstein, I would have had a much better take on their books. Still, this book may be less valuable in the long run than the cookbooks by Wolfert and Goldstein. My first reason for saying this is that for $40, you are getting nothing more than 80 pages of recipes from a very wide variety of different voices. Since almost all cookbooks are, by their nature, reference books to which one goes when you need a recipe to fit a particular situation, this book is poor, as there is no central theme to the recipes. There is no question I can think of which would make me pull this book from my shelves in preference over any one of a dozen other books.<br /><br />But wait a minute. Isn't this book supposed to be all about slow food? Yes, but the recipes in this book do not really exemplify the slow food objectives, as they simply do not focus on artisinal ingredients and techniques. And, unlike Wolfert's and Goldstein's books, the recipes range in style from Germany to Mexico. So, while a lust for something Italian may take me to Goldstein's book, nothing will suggest I go to this book.

Since almost all cookbooks are, by their nature, reference books to which one goes when you need a recipe to fit a particular situation, this book is poor, as there is no central theme to the recipes. There is no question I can think of which would make me pull this book from my shelves in preference over any one of a dozen other books. <br /> <br />But wait a minute. Isn't this book supposed to be all about slow food? Yes, but the recipes in this book do not really exemplify the slow food objectives, as they simply do not focus on artisinal ingredients and techniques. And, unlike Wolfert's and Goldstein's books, the recipes range in style from Germany to Mexico. So, while a lust for something Italian may take me to Goldstein's book, nothing will suggest I go to this book.

427766:US	39134375	R3N5RSEH8K49OR	081184238X	195058483	Italian Slow and Savory	Books	4	27	30	N	Y	Excellent Recipes, Wine Tips, and Background. Pricy	`Italian Slow and Savory' is subtitled `A Cookbook by Joyce Goldstein' almost as if Joyce Goldstein were an easily recognized brand name on the level of Wolfgang Puck or Emeril Lagasse. Joyce is a very successful cookbook author and I have already given the highest ratings to two of her earlier books, `Saffron Shores' dealing with Shepardim cooking and `Mediterranean Shores', covering all the cuisines of the Mediterranean. Thus, Goldstein is well established in the community of writers on Mediterranean food lead by Paula Wolfert, Claudia Roden, Nancy Harmon Jenkins, Clifford Wright, and others. What Goldstein aims at doing here is combining the themes of Paula Wolfert's most recent book, `Slow Mediterranean Kitchen' with a coffee table sized, formatted, and priced book similar to recent volumes from a gaggle of famous restaurant chefs lead by Thomas Keller, Eric Rippert, Frank Stitt, and Rick Tramonto.<br /><br />I can usually pick up on a very good or a very bad book after reading no more than one or two pages. I can see that this book goes to neither extreme. Its quota of photographs is relatively small for an oversize volume and the quality of the photography does not impress me (slight negative). The book's contents show that it is true to its title in that there are no dessert recipes, but it does seem to stray just a bit when it provides a few `fast' recipes in sidebars to slow recipes (slight negative). The book opens with a six-page overview of the culinary specialities of the major Italian provinces. There are many good books that cover this ground, but Goldstein manages to summarize a lot of stuff into these six pages, so I give a nice plus for this. The book also has a very generous bibliography that always scores points with me. It is large enough so that the fact that most of the entries are in Italian still gives us many good references in English. The value of the Italian references is based on the fact that the slow food movement started in Italy; so most of it's leading writers would be writing in Italian. Almost makes me want to enroll in Berlitz to learn Italian. It at least validates the value of my library on regional Italian cooking. But, are these points together really worth the premium $40 list price?<br /><br />My take on Goldstein's recipes in `The Mediterranean Kitchen' is that since she is much more the chef then she is the scholar like Roden and Wolfert, her recipes tend to be better written and more kitchen savvy, especially when compared to journalist Roden. So, are her recipes still better than average? Good enough for a premium price tag?<br /><br />Looking at her selection of recipes, I am very happy with the offerings. The chapter on sauces for pasta and polenta includes nineteen (19) recipes, most of which are unfamiliar to me. The familiar recipes are very nice to have around, as this makes the book a nice reference for both familiar and new sauces. I compared Goldstein's `Ragu alla Bolognese' recipe with that from Marcella Hazan's `Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking' and I found several differences, but one which struck me as especially notable. Hazan adds her wine only after adding the milk and reducing it's liquid before adding the wine, specifically to avoid the meat's being infused with an acidic bite from the wine and tomatoes. Goldstein adds wine and tomato paste before adding the milk. I am inclined to prefer Hazan on this recipe based on both the fact that it makes a lot of sense and her position as THE leading authority on Italian recipes. Goldstein does add one interesting note by adding some chopped prosciutto and chopped pancetta to the recipe. This is worth a try.<br /><br />Otherwise, I had some trouble finding recipes in Hazan to match Goldstein dishes. I consider this a good thing, as it means there is little overlap and you can cheerfully own both books. You will find a lot of overlap in very general categories of recipes. Both books, for example, contain several southern Italian Braciole recipes (rolled meats), but none that duplicate location and primary ingredients. In general, Hazan's recipes are more detailed with more hints. Goldstein's recipes are just a bit less fussy and a bit more modern.<br /><br />I very much like Goldstein's chapter on vegetable recipes, especially as the modern take on vegetables is to pass them quickly over the heat to just barely remove the edge of rawness before serving. The Italians were never big on raw or undercooked veggies, and Goldstein has given us lots of well cooked and stuffed reds and greens and yellow goodies.<br /><br />I find it very odd that Goldstein includes no separate recipes for `brodo', no recipes for fresh pasta, and no recipes for bread. These would have fit the premise of her book perfectly. The other side of the coin is that since these things are covered so well in other books, why dilute a book of purely savory recipes with these starches. I still miss the `brodo' recipe. She does provide a perfunctory one as part of a recipe for risotto.<br /><br />Like `The Mediterranean Kitchen', this book contains wine suggestions which are based heavily on the notion of `terroir' which is an old standard supported by everyone from Wolfert to Mario Batali. Knowing absolutely nothing about wine, I can still recommend these suggestions as they are clear, offer several options including both good, available Italian labels and parallel California offerings. No hoity toity factor at work here!<br /><br />This is a good book. There are lots of good recipes, very nice wine recommendations, and excellent quick resources on Italian cooking. Whether or not you buy it depends a lot on whether you want to pay the price when you can get Marcella Hazan's authoritative volume for about half with a good discount.

Very Highly recommended.	The author's name is not only above the title, but part of the title of `Bruce Aidells's Complete Book of Pork'. And, the book fully lives up to its title and subtitle, `A Guide to Buying, Storing, and Cooking the World's Favorite Meat'. The book includes absolutely every subject on pork I can think of, including several I did not even expect because I thought they may be too obscure for even a 320 page book on this single subject. Not only do the authors cover their territory; they do it very, very well.<br /><br />As Aidells states early in the book, this work is for people who like to create their own recipes with pork. While pork may be the world's favorite meat, it may also be one of the most difficult, especially today in the United States, where so much fat has been bread out of our porkers that older James Beard and Joy of Cooking recipes for pork may simply not even work any more, in that there is not enough fat moisture in some cuts to support exposure to high heat for the time needed to get the inside of the meat up to the old standard temperature to insure that chance of trichinosis or botulism is removed. One of the greater ironies of meat cooking is that if you cook pork loin or pork tenderloin with wet heat over 160 degrees Fahrenheit for very long, you will end up with dry, stringy meat in spite of the cooking in water.<br /><br />So, one of the first and most important parts of the book is how to select cuts of pork and match them to the appropriate cooking method. Regarding selecting meat, I must have been incredibly lucky or terribly inattentive, as I have never seen many of the pathologies against which Aidells warns us. Still, it is very rewarding to know of these things and feel much better prepared to select meat at unfamiliar location such as the new farmer's market or warehouse store.<br /><br />One surprise in the matching of meat to method is Aidells's counting leg and shin meat among the more tender cuts. The usual rule is that the further from the hoof or the horn, the more tender the meat. Well, I guess this doesn't work for pigs, as they have no horns. But, the principle of cooking tender meat by dry methods (grilling, roasting, saut&eacute;ing, frying and broiling) and tough meat by wet methods (braising, stewing, poaching and steaming) is as true for pork as it is for beef. One thing that is true of pork and other `white meat' and not true of beef is the efficacy of brining in making the final cooked product moister. Brining pork is a very popular subject which has been explored by all the usual authorities such as Shirley Corriher and Harold McGee. The virtue of Aidells's book is that the technique is discussed in great detail, in connection with all the appropriate recipes.<br /><br />Aidells's range of recipes for pork is not only broad, it is also of a very high quality. One of the first recipes I examined was for a strata made from sausage meat. As I just finished making a strata recipe from Wolfgang Puck's new book, I was really unhappy that I had not seen Aidells's recipe first, as it appears to be a much more interesting preparation. I was also very pleasantly surprised to see a recipe for a Philippine pork adobo recipe that was better than the one in my Philippine cookbook. The book does not cover every conceivable recipe. There are several famous dishes such as Chinese pork Dim Sum style steamed dumplings that are not in the book, but then, this recipe is more about the technique involved in the dumpling than it is with the pork.<br /><br />The very best thing I found with this book is that all recipes use relatively simple techniques and equipment. One can spend tens of thousands of dollars on expert smoking equipment, but Aidells shows us how to do it with nothing more than a $100 Weber dome grill. I definitely approve of this. Also, he gives us instructions on how to make fresh sausage using a manual meat grinder, a KitchenAid meat grinding attachment, or a food processor. While Iwould not want to go through the difficulties of this technique, he even describes how to stuff sausage using a piping bag. I draw the line here and I have no difficulty in investing in the proper KitchenAid apparatus.<br /><br />In addition to fresh sausage, the authors cover virtually every other pork processing and preserving technique such as making bacon, hams, and cured sausage such as salami. I was especially pleased to see the authors open the chapter on terrines by associating this technique with meatloaf. This association should immediately make pate and Terrine techniques friendlier to a reader who may associate them with old school French cuisine, done by no one who is not wearing a toque. My favorite recipe in this chapter is for a Polpettone Napoletano. I have seen Mario Batali make a polpettone (Italian for large meatball), but it has never quite inspired me as well as Aidells' dish. As written, it serves 12 to 16, so it is a super entertaining dish for delivering protein economically to a buffet crowd of unknown size.<br /><br />As pork curing products are not standard items even at good local butcher shops, the author provides an excellent list of suppliers including both familiar (Nieman ranch, Dean and Delucca, Penzey's) and unfamiliar sources for speciality meats and materials.<br /><br />The best thing I can say about this book is that it is every bit as good as expected. And, as this is one of the most useful kinds of books for the creative chef or wannabe creative chef, I say buy it now. You will find what you need and a lot of pleasant surprises as well.I would not want to go through the difficulties of this technique, he even describes how to stuff sausage using a piping bag.

Recommended	This `A Baker's Field Guide to Christmas Cookies' by Dede Wilson is a perfect example of how the same subject can be served well in two very different ways. The obvious touchstone against which to proof this volume may be Rose Levy Beranbaum's book on Christmas cookies. But, this would be an unfair comparison. Beranbaum's work covers the very high end of Cookie making, ending with a truly glorious creation of a gingerbread cathedral of Notre Dame. Beranbaum also covers just about every little issue you may possibly encounter in baking cookies and provides us with lots of unusual recipes.<br /><br />Dede Wilson, on the other hand, has given us a very practical kitchen reference for lots and lots of common cookie recipes baked for Christmas, including several ethnic favorites such as the relatively difficult Moravian Ginger Cookies.<br /><br />My favorite thing about Ms. Wilson's contribution aside from its spiral binding which lays flat on the table is the fact that you often have more than one recipe for a particular type of cookie. For a rolled gingerbread / spice cookie recipe, there are at least three alternatives, not even including the difficult Moravian cookie. That generally means that if you want to make a particular kind of cookie, you have your choice between an easy, intermediate, and hard recipe.<br /><br />Other very nice features are the fact that every recipe falls on two facing pages, begins with a very clear picture of one or two of the cookies, states the type and (very cute here) habitat, gives a description of the cookie and alternatives, gives the shelf life under proper storage conditions, and gives appropriate tips on making this and similar cookies. I think the recipes are well written and leave little room for error, although I was just a bit confused by the instructions to form rolled gingerbread dough into a disk. This sounded more like instructions for a freezer cookie than a rolled cookie.<br /><br />The introductory material to the book gives nothing near the detail of Beranbaum, but gives enough to avoid any egregious errors. It also does not give lessons on using piping bags and other decorating techniques, but none of the cookies require elaborate methods.<br /><br />The book does include an appendix on sources, most of that are probably familiar to regular bakers such as King Arthur, KitchenAid, and Wilton. Several are unfamiliar and welcome to me, especially New York Cake and Baking Distributors and The House on the Hill.<br /><br />If I were the author, I may have included a bibliography of major works on cookies such as by Malgieri, Heatter, and Beranbaum, especially for help on decorating, but the book does a pretty good job of standing on its own as a great reference for common cookie recipes. It really fits its `Field Guide' metaphor well.the book gives nothing near the detail of Beranbaum, but gives enough to avoid any egregious errors.

430058:US	39134375	R2PSVABBKTGL1S	1580084117	44433468	Girardet: Recipes from a Master of French Cuisine	Books	5	19	22	N	Y	Great exemplars of haute cuisine recipes. Highly recommended	`girardet, Recipes From a Master of French Cuisine' written by retired Swiss master Fredy Girardet is this renowned chef's second book, being published eight years after he retired from professional cooking and more than twenty years after his first publication, `Spontaneous Cooking'. In a totally uncharacteristic show of unity, Girardet is lauded as the foremost master of French cooking by both Paul Bocuse and Joel Robuchon.<br /><br />In evaluating this book, I felt the weight of having given Charlie Trotter's latest book on fine dining recipes a poor rating, in spite of the obvious quality of the recipes in this `Workin' volume. Ultimately, Girardet's book validated my rating of Trotter's effort in showing how fine dining recipes should be written, thereby earning my high praise.<br /><br />For starters, Trotter's recipes are touted as being improvisations, while Girardet's recipes have probably been prepared for years in exactly the same way at his restaurant. Among other things, that means they have been thoroughly tested by years of practice by dozens of line chefs. Girardet also has a distinct way of writing recipes, which is great for both restaurant practice and for entertaining. All of his procedures are divided into at least three sections, Preparation, Cooking, and Presentation. Preparation is everything that can be done hours or even days in advance, with intermediate results stored in the fridge. Unlike virtually every other cookbook I have seen, Girardet specifies exactly how to best store these intermediate preparations, citing which need to be covered and refrigerated if they are not used immediately. This simple addition literally doubles the value of the recipes for entertaining. Although Girardet does not tout this aspect of his recipe writing, he actually embodies the very good practice demonstrated in Wolfgang Puck's new book of laying out all the techniques needed for each recipe within that recipe. For example, everywhere it is needed, the recipe repeats the technique for skinning tomatoes by cutting a cross in the bottom and blanching.<br /><br />Like most cookbooks for major restaurants, this one includes a large section on pantry preparations. This selection is as larger than Trotter's offering and, to my eyes, much better in that veggies are not chopped, but simply `cut large' and simmered for no more than three hours rather than Trotter's six. In only one stock recipe is the mirepoix diced, suggesting a ¼ inch dice. At the same time, Girardet is not overly fussy. I have seen more detailed recipes for exactly the same product from the CIA, Judy Rodgers, and Thomas Keller. Of all chapters I have seen on pantry preparations, I think Keller's work in `Bouchon' is the best, but Girardet comes close. He especially offers recipes for three different gelees; close relatives to stocks where veal shins and feet are added to extract their gelatin.<br /><br />The organization of recipes is very conventional, which is quite reassuring. One is not disoriented as you encounter all the familiar subjects of Cold Appetizers; Hot Appetizers; Fish; Shellfish; Poultry, Rabbit, and Feathered Game; Meat and Furred Game; Variety Meats; Cold Desserts; and Hot Desserts. The first thing you may notice is that there are no meze, tapas, sandwiches, or other species of finger food evident in this list. This is FINE DINING! There are also no easily recognizable classic Bistro salads here. Most of the appetizers are soups or small dishes of fine shellfish.<br /><br />One of the most difficult aspects of these recipes is that many use a principle ingredient that may be difficult to find in the average supermarket. There are many recipes involving rabbit, venison, boar, langoustines, scallops in the shell, cockles, crayfish, frogs legs, skate, and sweetmeats. And, there are no suggestions for substitutions. The scallops in the shell are not simply a conceit or a decoration. The leftovers after excising the scallop from the shell are used to create a broth, in much the same way as lobster shells are used to create a stock for bisques and other seafoody stuff.<br /><br />And yet, there were still lots of recipes which not only impressed me with their quality, but which I actually looked forward to making in my own kitchen. A recipe for tuna fish tournedos with Ratatouille and green peppercorn vinaigrette may sound daunting, but the instructions are so straightforward and the result looks so delicious that I am certain I will try this little gem very soon. While all the photographs are expertly done, and there is a full-page photograph for practically every dish, I did detect a few where the photographed dish did not exactly match the description in the recipe. I rarely weigh this against a book, as I generally pay little attention to fancy plating or to using the pics to pick a dish to make, but you may feel differently, so I'm compelled to mention this.<br /><br />The author claims he will avoid technical cooking terms as much as possible, but I sense he put this objective out at the beginning of the book and quickly forgot it. I forgive him on this, because I would be annoyed to see words such as Aiguillettes, Gelee, Veloute, Chartreuse, Chaud-Froid, Galantine, Terrine and Frivolity replaced with any circumlocutions. And that is just from the names of the recipes in the hot appetizers.<br /><br />I have seen English translations of books by both Bocuse and Robuchon and this volume joins them as evidence that the leading Europeans really know how to do cookbooks. The binding is of a very high quality, the book lays flat where you open it, and an integrated ribbon bookmark is added for good measure.<br /><br />This book may only appeal to professionals and foodies, but it is a very, very good embassy to this interest indeed.

Highly Recommended	`Kitchen Life' is personal chef Art Smith's second book, having won a James Beard award for his first, `Back to the Table'. The most important feature of this book is that it is about much more than just recipes. It would not be at all inappropriate to call this `Knowing Your Kitchen for Dummies', as it touches a bit on just about every aspect of ingredients, kitchen management, cooking equipment, pantries, techniques, and recipes. An experienced cook may easily find much in this book a little too basic, but for the average person who wants to improve their return their investment in refrigerator, oven, range, sink, and tableware in their kitchen, this is the book for them!<br /><br />A paragraph on this book in a `New York Times' article on new cookbooks attracted me to the work in that it said the author wrote that you really don't need dumbed down recipes for cooking with kids. I had just finished reviewing some books on cooking with kids where I was put off by the cutsey tone adapted to appeal to kids. So, I suspected that Art Smith had something to say to me.<br /><br />It turns out that people with a lot of culinary experience will probably find little that is new in this book, but a newbie in the kitchen will find a whole lot to orient them to what is essential and what is fluff. I can find no statements in this book with which I would argue; although there are several small differences in opinion which should have no impact on the value of the book to its best audience. For example, Smith does the novice a great service by providing a lot of very useful top five lists for pantry items. A symptom of how good these lists are is the fact that I have almost all these items in my pantry. Their biggest weakness is that his lists violate one of his best principles, which is to always shop with a shopping list based on recipes you will actually cook that week. For small households, there is a lot of potential waste in stocking up on things like bell peppers, fresh thyme, frozen shrimp, sweet potatoes, chocolate chips, and ice cream. Bell peppers are a really common ingredient but if they languish for a week in the crisper, you may end up with slime. I really find the cost of fresh thyme to be not worth the money, as dried thyme is an excellent product with a very long shelf life. As I buy a new bottle of dried thyme every three months, I have no problems with the herb's loosing its potency. And so on with the rest of these ingredients. Smith is not suggesting we run out and buy all these ingredients, but he is not warning against it either.<br /><br />On kitchen equipment, the same rule should apply. Don't buy anything, no matter how strongly recommended, unless you actually plan to use the stuff. To those who will benefit from this book, I would amend Smith's recommendations with the recommendation to get BIG pots and pans. It is less of a problem to have a cook pot that is too big than to have one which is too small. Where Smith recommends both a skillet and a saute pan, I would trade in the skillet for an 8-quart Dutch oven and use sure to get the 10 or 12 inch saute pan. Get an 8-inch saute pan only if you definitely plan to make omelets or crepes.<br /><br />On almost every point, I believe Smith is on the side of the angels. He warns against buying sets of pans, recommends washing prewashed produce, and makes excellent suggestions on when to use and when not to use the microwave oven. If I were to suggest any one thing he should be including would be a primer on knife skills. I believe good knife skills and a $100 premium quality knife will outperform a $300 food processor for every operation that uses a knife. And, it is so incredibly easier to clean a knife than to clean a food processor.<br /><br />Smith's very best and most unusual suggestion is to keep a journal for menus, recipes, running shopping lists, and references to interesting cooking tidbits. While most of the audience for this book may be hard pressed to just bring their family together for a meal, let alone have the time to write things down, I really think this is a good idea, especially if it can be done on a laptop. Tying this into access to recipes from Internet sources creates a great synergy. The local newspaper simply cannot compete with the 50,000 recipes available from web sites such as foodnetwork.com and epicurious.com. Another good but uncommon suggestion is to simply label one's pantry shelves, so it is easier to see what you need and where your bottles and cans go when you get home from the grocery.<br /><br />Until I saw the blurb in the `New York Times', I avoided Smith's books for the same reason I avoid books by Patty LaBelle, Al Roker, and Pat Conroy.

Tying this into access to recipes from Internet sources creates a great synergy. The local newspaper simply cannot compete with the 50,000 recipes available from web sites such as foodnetwork.com and epicurious.com. Another good but uncommon suggestion is to simply label one's pantry shelves, so it is easier to see what you need and where your bottles and cans go when you get home from the grocery. <br /> <br />Until I saw the blurb in the `New York Times', I avoided Smith's books for the same reason I avoid books by Patty LaBelle, Al Roker, and Pat Conroy.

Small Practical Value	`Workin' More Kitchen Sessions With Charlie Trotter' is based on Charlie Trotter's latest PBS series where, according to Trotter `friend and colleague' Rochelle Smith, Trotter imitates Jazz greats by improvising savory dishes based on twelve (12) central ingredients, plus a series on desserts. Like so many celebrity chef cookbooks, the chef whose name is on the cover generally provides the ideas and may actually create the dishes in the kitchen, but it is the support team which actually writes the recipes, edits copy, tests, the recipes, and does just about every other activity involved in creating a book. As Trotter himself prepared these recipes on TV, we can be certain that he certainly had a lot to do with actually coming up with the recipes, so his creative contribution to the book is assured.<br /><br />Trotter is easily one of the most creative and influential writing chefs in the country, along with Thomas Keller, Alfred Portale, Daniel Boulud, and Tom Colicchio. Unlike culinary businessmen such as Wolfgang Puck and trendsetter restaurateurs such as Alice Waters, these chefs create new cuisine and explain to all of us less talented what it is really like to be a creative chef in a fine dining establishment. With all of that, why am I so disappointed with this book?<br /><br />For starters, it is important for me to say that I am convinced that virtually all the recipes in this book are about as original as they come and I am sure that they are about as tasty as the finest ingredients and the best culinary minds and hands can make them. There is not a single conventional spaghetti, paella, risotto, roasted chicken, crepe, omelet, Panini, or crostini recipe in the book. Virtually the only recognized name dish in the book is a cassoulet, but this is done in a very unconventional way. There are some souffl&eacute;s and a paella inspired recipe here and there but nothing you will find in Tony Bourdain's excellent send off of bistro dishes. Thus, like John Coltrane's famous renditions of `My Favorite Things', these dishes simply have never been seen before, and it is quite possible Trotter will never make them again.<br /><br />Here lies the germ of the problem. If these dishes are one off improvisations by a world class chef, what in the world give us any assurance that these dishes have any value whatsoever to the practical home cook? The problem is compounded by a few very pedestrian problems with the design of the book. For starters, the headnotes to each dish are in a small type with a very light ink. It was literally difficult for me to read these paragraphs. Second, the very imaginative organization of the recipes by a principle ingredient was largely meaningless, as almost every dish could have been made a set piece for any one of half a dozen ingredients. My favorite example is a truly fantastic looking dish made of a lamb tenderloin with a peanut sauce, ginger, scallions, onion, carrot, parsnip, bell peppers, and so on, with a touch of mizuna, tatsoi, and basil. If I were looking for something to do with a head of frisee or romaine or Boston lettuce and I was paging through the section on greens, this recipe would do absolutely nothing for me. Third, while the photographs of the completed dishes were as good or better than I've seen in most books, the `atmosphere' snaps were done in a very dark green shade where one's eyesight would have to be a lot better than mine to make the effort to appreciate what Herr Trotter was doing when the picture was taken. Fourth, this is obviously a book meant more for the coffee table than for laying open on the kitchen table. This may not be a serious complaint, as Thomas Keller has given us an even larger `Bouchon'; however, Keller's book is literally packed with familiar recipes which virtually all of us can reproduce to good effect. Trotter's book has no such recipes. Fifth, I think the author(s) really short-changed us in the pantry recipes. I am very suspicious of the stock recipes as their procedures are very short and they instruct us to chop vegetables and simmer these for up to six hours. Virtually every other expert I have seen puts whole or simply peeled and halved vegetables in a stock pot and simmers vegetables from one to three hours. I think Trotter's stock recipes in the hands of an amateur who does not have $100 chinois strainers on hand are recipes for very cloudy stocks.<br /><br />Some of the clues that tell me that these are not recipes for mere mortals are the instructions to do a brunoise dice of seeded tomatoes. According to my trusty Larousse Gastronomique, a brunoise is a `minute dice'; generally giving cubes an eighth of an inch on a side. I challenge you to successfully brunoise the flesh of a tomato! A second case is when the instructions ask you to do a chiffonade of onions that have been baked for an hour. Trotter may be able to do this without a lot of thought but I am simply not up to these prep tasks.<br /><br />These are simply not practical recipes for amateurs. There is a lot of inspiration here and there is a lot of very good use of American ingredients. This is purely a book for professionals and serious foodies. I will come back to this book for inspiration when I have the urge to create a recipe for artichokes, corn, fennel, greens, legumes, mushrooms, onions, potatoes, root vegetables, squash, tomatoes, or cheese, but I will pass on it when I want to do my next 100 family meals.<br /><br />Like Trotter's book `Raw', I give this three stars not for the lack of great culinary skill behind the recipes but as a warning to look twice before laying out $40 for this book. Keller's `Bouchon' is a much better value for the money.ipes as their procedures are very short and they instruct us to chop vegetables and simmer these for up to six hours.

433206:US	39134375	R3OG27T9KR5TTB	0060555629	53784685	Nightly Specials: 125 Recipes for Spontaneous, Creative Cooking at Home	Books	5	26	28	N	Y	Very Good Book for Frequent Cook. Lots of Variety	`Nightly Specials' is written by Michael Lomonaco with an assist by ace New York City celebrity chef co-writer Andrew Friedman and with photographs by the Rothstein husband and wife team who also did Eric Ripert's `Return to Cooking' opus. Michael Lomonaco was the head chef at the Windows on the World recipe on September 9, 2001. By pure chance, he was not in the World Trade Center when the terrorist attacks occurred.<br /><br />The premise of this book is clear made clear in the title, as it focuses on the restaurant chef's practice of constructing daily specials from either what is especially good in the market today or ingredients which may be left over from a dish yesterday which did not move as well as expected. While this is a great lesson for home cooks, Lomonaco cannot take a lot of credit for revealing and elaborating on this practice, as Tom Colicchio did it brilliantly in his first book, `How to Think Like a Chef'. Colicchio's book did not impress me greatly when I first read it, but constant repetition of this principle by countless other chefs have revealed exactly how important this technique is to the professional chef. And, as my skill in cooking grows, I find myself going more and more to this way of thinking in deciding what to make for dinner today.<br /><br />Almost all celebrity chef books strive to either present the very best techniques from their fine dining restaurant or make a genuine attempt to adapt their favorite home and restaurant recipes to the skills and budget of a home kitchen. The very best of the first type are, for example, `The French Laundry Cookbook' by Keller and Ruhlman and `Tru' by Rick Tramonto. These books make no pretense that you will be able to duplicate their dishes. The purpose of these books is to show you how it is done in first class restaurants and possibly give you some ideas in general for improving home cooking. This is not to say that none of these recipes are possible at home, it is just that the author does nothing to simplify them, and makes no apologies for that fact. The very best of the second type of book are, for example, `Wolfgang Puck Makes it Easy' and `Charlie Trotter Cooks at Home'.<br /><br />Lomonaco's book is much closer to the second type than to the first, as he is teaching a common professional practice to the amateur cook with recipes they should have no difficulty in doing in the home kitchen. Lomonaco adds to the utility of the book to the home chef by providing several recipes for `Snacks, Sandwiches, and Pizzas'. This seems to be a trend, as Wolfgang's new book does exactly the same thing.<br /><br />When I was an information systems professional and just as much an inveterate book buyer as I am now, I would consider a $50 book on a programming language, database system, or design technique worth the cost if it had but a single technique capable of improving what I did in some systematic way. My attitude towards cookbooks is very similar in that all it takes to turn my opinion from `ho hum' to `oh boy' is one unfamiliar and interesting recipe which is easy to make, yet can make a big impression on fellow diners. Recipes for risotto or polenta or spaghetti or ceviche or braises or chowders or roast chicken or gratins or pizzas or paellas or even sandwiches really don't make a big impression, as I have whole books devoted to each of these subjects. In some cases, I have a whole shelf of books which covers the subject. So, what can chef Michael tell me which is new under my personal sun. As I am a sucker for both new cookware and for squid recipes, the thing which caught my eye was a squid casserole in a Spanish cazuela, a low porcelain dish with a strong family resemblance to a Tart Tatin pan, except that it's sides seem to be a bit lower.<br /><br />So what about this book will turn on those of you who do not have 300 cookbooks? First, the chapters cover the full range of dishes from salads, soups, and sandwiches to shellfish, fin fish, birds, and beasts and berry desserts. So, this book touches all the bases, with lots of stops at traditional stations with recipes for all those risottos, polentas, and pastas I cited above. Then, there are the variations Lomonaco gives to each of his 125 recipes, so that, in practice, the author is really giving suggestions for up to three times this many dishes. So, if you find one you like, you get two or three ways of changing it around to fit the market or your pantry on any particular day.<br /><br />My hunch is that this aspect of the book will be more valuable to a home cook who cooks often, at least three times a week, but who still does not have an extensive cookbook library. I cite experienced cooks because the `Nightly Special' variations given by chef Lomonaco do not say a lot about how much of the substitute ingredient to use, so there is some danger of overdoing it. And, as Mario Batali reminded me last night on his Christmas special, it's all about the balance of ingredients.<br /><br />Another aspect of the book's offering is that it offers substitutions for ingredients that may not appeal to everyone. If, by chance, you happen to dislike scallops, yet you like shrimp, the book will tell you how to make the dish with both. This is how the book will be valuable to the occasional cook. While I have not read Pam Anderson's book, I suggest Lomonaco's volume would be a great companion to `How to Cook Without a Book'.<br /><br />Recommended professional recipes and a big lesson in the use of the pantry for the home cook.birds, and beasts and berry desserts.

Very Good	`Wolfgang Puck Makes It Easy' by, you guessed it, Wolfgang Puck, is easy to mistake for a fast cooking recipe book in the style of Jacques Pepin's `Fast Food My Way'. If you make that mistake, you will be very disappointed with this book. It is definitely not a Rachael Ray wannabe book. Rather, it is much more like books such as `Charlie Trotter Cooks at Home', Guy Savoy's `Simple French Recipes for the Home Cook', `Daniel's Dish' by Daniel Boulud and `Simple Pleasures by Alfred Portale. While not famous restaurant chefs, it is also similar to books by Food Network colleagues Sara Moulton and Tyler Florence. The odd thing is that although this book is not a quick cooking text, it will potentially appeal to the Rachael Ray audience for those occasions when they really want to impress dining guests with a Wolfgang Puck pizza, homemade fresh pasta, or braised lamb shanks.<br /><br />Wolfgang's technique for making these recipes easy (not necessarily quick or short in description) is to avoid the use of a lot of supplementary preparations. As much as possible, virtually all the steps for a dish are given within the recipe for that recipe. There are definitely some major exceptions, but in general, Wolf is taking exactly the opposite tack from Ming Tsai's second book, `Simply Ming', where every dish is described as an elaboration on some primary recipe. In Herr Puck's work virtually the only pantry recipes you really need to be concerned chicken stock, fresh pasta, and pizza dough. One thing that always impressed me about Wolfgang is his ability to stay on message, and this is the name of the game when it comes to evaluating books. In the recent new American Iron Chef episode where Wolfgang was battling Masaharu Morimoto with the theme of eggs, Morimoto was all over the map with his dishes while Wolfgang, with great help from his terrific pastry chef Sherry Yard, was dead on target with his use of eggs as the featured ingredient in his dishes. Sherry Yard is back, providing Wolfgang another assist with some of the pastry recipes in this book.<br /><br />As Wolfgang points out, one should not be put off by the relatively long procedure recipes, as he is doing this to avoid a lot of page turning, enabling the amateur cook to follow a recipe from top to bottom. A lot of other cookbooks, especially one from Emeril on recipes from his various restaurants, seemed to make a point of creating modular recipes with lots of intermediate preparations. Reading his book felt like sitting through an Advent church service where the liturgy required changing pages about once every three minutes. Modular recipes are great for the professional or the amateur who cooks every day for a large family, but it is a waste for the busy person who enjoys putting their hair up in the kitchen now and then.<br /><br />Wolfgang also comes through on his promise to avoid a lot of esoteric ingredients. This is not to say that one will have a much easier time with his recipes if you live near a megamart or gourmet store, but Wolf does avoid dependence on foie gras, truffles, porcini and other wild mushrooms, lemon grass, Aleppo pepper, and Kaffir lime leaves. Where exotic ingredients such as porcinis are specified, Wolf always gives a more common substitute such as cultivated shiitakes. Some ingredients may be viewed as `hard to get' by some such as duck legs, but these are really relatively uncommon in the book. On his relatively long pantry list of `kitchen helpers', I see nothing I have not found at my local megamart, although true Italian Fontina cheese took a little prodding before my Wegmans got it in stock.<br /><br />Wolfgang also manages to keep unusual equipment to a minimum, but there is a chance he strays a bit here. Many of his recipes are described with an option to use a pressure cooker, which, I believe, is no longer a standard item in American kitchens. Wolfgang also gives lots of great recipes for paninis which require either a panini press or a double sided grill (read George Forman products). While I suspect a fairly sizable number of households have George Forman grills; I have read dim reviews of these products so I am not surprised that Wolfgang does not mention them by name. To Wolf's credit, as always, he provides an alternative with a common saute pan or indoor grill.<br /><br />One of the very best things I found in this book is the number of unusual recipes for breakfast, brunch, and lunch, especially with the several Panini recipes. He also includes several relatively easy recipes for making bread from scratch, including a brioche recipe that does not require the overnight rise step you will find in most recipes from bread specialists. This is not to say Wolfgang's recipe is just as good, only that it will give you a really decent brioche you can brag came from a Wolfgang Puck / Sherry Yard recipe.<br /><br />The thing which appealed most to me about this book is that Wolfgang took very few shortcuts in his exposition and included excellent series of photographs to explain more difficult procedures such as omelet and pasta making. Another aspect of the book I found very appealing was that his definitely minor publisher would support printing a book which was especially easy to read. You expect this treatment from Alfred A. Knopf. You are pleasantly surprised when a virtually unknown publisher delivers high quality book design. Makes you wonder how they slipped up on the yellow type in the big Gourmet book.<br /><br />The appendix on kitchen equipment will not replace a book devoted to this topic, but it is better by far than most cookbook sections devoted to the topic.<br /><br />Highly recommended for amateur cooks who like to cook well, but who don't do it too often.or a double sided grill (read George Forman products).

434948:US	39134375	R1QF5TFSDQ5RCS	0881506591	871342489	The King Arthur Flour Cookie Companion: The Essential Cookie Cookbook (King Arthur Flour Cookbooks)	Books	5	119	127	N	N	Best General Purpose Cookie Cookbook So Far	`The King Arthur Flour Cookie Companion' by King Arthur staff bakers and recipe testers, with a major assist from Laura Brody and the usual platoon of editors and designers from W. W. Norton and The Courtryman Press of Woodstock, Vermont is certainly the very best general purpose cookie book I have reviewed to date. I say this with the important caveat that I have yet to review major cookie books by baking heavyweights Nick Malgieri, Maida Heatter, and Carol Walter.<br /><br />It is important to say that the value of the book is not based on its exhaustive coverage of cookie recipes, although in over 500 pages, the book certainly covers all but a few corners of the far flung land of cookie baking. While it does leave out some important recipes, such as the famous thin Moravian ginger cookies of North Carolina, its real value is in its meticulous description of all those factors that influence great cookie baking.<br /><br />While a lot of cookie baking is a lot more forgiving than, say, pastry or biscuits or cheesecake, it is still baking, which means that a change in ingredients which would mean nothing to a sautee or a braise will mean the difference between a great cookie and a disappointment. The clearest example of this sensitivity is in the selection of shortening, where the major choices are butter, lard, margarine, or vegetable shortenings such as Crisco. Each option has a significant effect on taste and the degree that a drop cookie will rise or spread. And, that's before you even take nutritional aspects into account with tradeoffs between the saturated fats of butter and the transfats of margarine. Add in the effects of different sugars and different flours and you start to wonder how a cookie ever manages to get made. Oddly enough, the most complicated ingredient, the egg, seems to be the least finicky. All you do is be sure you use large eggs and bring them to room temperature before mixing them into other ingredients.<br /><br />The fact is, as long as you are good at following directions, you have in this book a terrific collection of recipes for an incredibly modest list price of less than $30 which I am virtually certain will work for you every time. I repeat, this assumes you follow directions and don't do any substituting unless you really know what you are doing.<br /><br />A perfect example of how this book can improve your cookie baking is the case of my favorite Snickerdoodle recipe from Nancy Baggett's `The All American Cookie Book'. I have been quite pleased with my results from this recipe ever since it became my standard, except that I would like them to spread out a bit less. Nancy's recipe calls for all butter and I happen to be using White Lily flour, which is relatively low in protein (a great pie crust flour, to be sure). It turns out that butter, low protein flour, and high sugar content all contribute to spreading, not to mention dropping the cookie dough onto a warm sheet. And here I thought it was all due to the corn syrup in Nancy's recipe.<br /><br />My most interesting items in this book are where the authors disagree with statements in super baker Rose Levy Beranbaum's Christmas Cookie book. One is where King Arthur warns against using oil sprays containing lecithin (an emulsifier found in eggs) while Ms. Beranbaum recommends them. Also, King Arthur warns that while you can rework leftovers from cookie cutout margins, the cutouts from reworked dough will be a bit tougher than the originals. Miss Rose suggests there is no problem with reworking cookie dough. Last, Beranbaum warns against using sheets with high edges (such as jellyroll pans) to bake cookies, as this will inhibit cookie browning. King Arthur gives no such warning and recommends jellyroll pans along with no sided or low sided cookie sheets. On these issues, I give King Author two out of three, as I believe I have seen Rose's adverse effect of high-sided pans on cookie baking.<br /><br />After the exquisitely presented discussion of what makes cookies work, the best feature of this book is its organization of recipes by type, with all of the most important styles grouped into a chapter of `The Essentials'. These are your chocolate chip cookies, sugar cookies, oatmeal cookies, molasses cookies, peanut butter cookies, shortbread, Biscotti, brownies, and decorated cookies. While I suspect the book dedicated to chocolate chip cookies may do a better job of it, I have seen no better treatment of chocolate chip cookies than what you get here. Also, in the chapter on decorated cookies you get all the basics you need to make gingerbread houses. Ms. Beranbaum's Christmas Cookies book gives a much more elaborate presentation of the subject, but this is more than enough to get you started. The remaining cookie types, each with their own chapter are bars and squares (hermits); drop cookies (thumbprint cookies); roll-out cookies (classic spice cookies and cutouts); shaped cookies (molded cookies such as springerles); batter cookies (such as Madeleines); and no-bake cookies (rum balls).<br /><br />The low price and the terrific coverage of all basic cookie types make this by far one of the best general-purpose cookie books. There are others which are very, very good and there are special subject books such as Beranbaum's Christmas cookie book which offer things not in this volume, but you simply cannot go wrong if you get this book and follow its advice carefully.<br /><br />I thing this is a better cookie book than King Arthur's earlier `All Purpose Baking Book'. Very highly recommended.ented discussion of what makes cookies work, the best feature of this book is its organization of recipes by type, with all of the most important styles grouped into a chapter of `The Essentials'.

This red `On Food and Cooking, The Science and Lore of the Kitchen' by Harold McGee is a new edition of what is the most widely quoted culinary work in English. It may be almost as influential on the thinking of culinary professionals as Julia Child's `Mastering the Art of French Cooking' was on attitudes of American home cooking. The testimonials from the likes of Thomas Keller, Paula Wolfert, Jacques Pepin, and Rose Levy Beranbaum just begins to tell you how important McGee's volume has become. I was immensely pleased to see the exchange of acknowledgments between McGee and Keller to see how much the academic can learn from the professional chef.<br /><br />I can devote my thousand words on how good this book has been to the culinary world, but most of you already know that. What I will do is to list all the reasons one may wish to read this book.<br /><br />First, the book is simply interesting to amateur foodies and culinary professionals. This is the serendipity principle. If you prospect in a rich land, you will invariably find something of value. The `lore' in the subtitle is not an afterthought. The book includes history, linguistics and cooking practice in addition to simple science. In over 800 pages of densely packed narrative, one will invariably find something of interest, especially since the book covers such a broad range of topics, including:<br /><br />Milk and Dairy<br /><br />Eggs<br /><br />Meat<br /><br />Fish and Shellfish<br /><br />Fruits and Vegetables<br /><br />Seeds, Cereals, and Doughs<br /><br />Sauces<br /><br />Sugars and Chocolate<br /><br />Alcohol (Wine, Beer, and Distilled Spirits)<br /><br />Cooking Methods<br /><br />Cooking Utensil Materials<br /><br />`The Four Basic Food Molecules'<br /><br />Basic Chemistry<br /><br />This is the perfect book in which to jump around to those subjects that interest you. I just wish the author would have put the last two subjects first so that more readers would stumble across them to gain a better understanding of what appears in the chapters on specific foods. A quick example of how this would help in practical terms is that the characteristics of alcohol, which stand halfway between water and oils explains why vodka is such a great flavor enhancing addition to pasta sauces.<br /><br />Second, professional and amateur bakers should read all of the chapters on grains, doughs, chocolate, alcohol, basic molecules, and the chemistry primer, as this is the one area of culinary practice where knowledge of science can make the biggest difference between good and great results. Both Shirley Corriher and Alton Brown have books which include baking science and Rose Levy Beranbaum's books all cover practical baking science in depth, but McGee puts all of this is a broader context which, to use Alton Brown's great metaphor about science and cooking, gives a roadmap covering a much broader area, to a finer scale of detail.<br /><br />Third, all culinary professionals who have anything whatsoever to do with teaching should read this book from cover to cover, twice. There is absolutely nothing more annoying than having a person in the role of teacher make a patently false statement in their area of expertise. The number of times a Food Network culinary celeb misuses the term `dissolve' when they really mean `emulsify' or simply `mix' would fill volumes. It is still a common mistake to say that searing protein seals in juices. There are many good reasons for searing. Preventing the escape of liquid is not one of them. Even Brown himself has made some gaffs in print and on `Good Eats' such as when he described a very corrosive compound as a strong acid rather than a strong base. He confused one end of the pH scale with the other.<br /><br />Fourth, anyone who has ambitions to develop their own recipes should read those chapters which deal with the major foods such as dairy, meats, fish, fruits, and vegetables, with a premium on the material on milk and eggs. Two defining characteristics of science are that it explains things and it predicts things. Most people understand the first but may not appreciate the second. One can predict, for example, that if you use too little fat in a milk or cream based gratin, the dairy will curdle, so, if you are playing around with your favorite mac and cheese recipe, do not be so quick to reach for that skim milk, as you are likely to be very disappointed with the result. Similarly, if you crave some Saturday morning buttermilk biscuits and the nearest carton of buttermilk is a 30 minute drive away, AND, you have no vinegar, AND you have no citrus, there is just a chance that your aging cream of tartar dissolved in milk will save the day, since this is an acidic salt which will stand in for the acidity in the buttermilk. As a former professional chemist, I can assure you that pure inorganic salts like cream of tartar simply do not go bad.<br /><br />I would have loved to hear the exchanges between author McGee and Thomas Keller, as Keller is probably the contemporary epitome of how the culinary professional uses experimental techniques in cooking. The constant tasting which every cook does is nothing more than a practical application of the chemical technique of titration, where materials are combined slowly until the desired result is achieved. What separates good from great cooks is using this technique to test raw materials. This is the truest marriage of science and cooking, following the maxim of Daniel Boulud who stated that to be really great, the journeyman cook must repeat the same procedure thousands of times to the point where the result is utterly reproducible and the cook can detect the desired endpoint easily by eye, nose, and mouth. Sounds like science to me.<br /><br />The author's introduction presents an excellent case for rereading the book in its second edition as he cites the great changes in food culture over the last twenty years. This is also a great case for anyone who is interested in any aspect of food.<br /><br />A very important book indeed.ains things and it predicts things.

Great!	`Rose's Christmas Cookies' by Rose Levy Beranbaum is a cookie baking book you should have if you enjoy baking cookies, even if you have one or a dozen other books on cookie baking. She gives the same lovingly detailed tutorial on virtually every aspect of cookie baking which you may want to know. I have reviewed two other major cookie books and have skimmed several other books I plan to review and Beranbaum's book stands alone in the amount of detail she gives on cookie baking technique.<br /><br />Anyone familiar with her `Bibles' on bread, pastry, and cakes will be familiar with the depth to which she goes in explaining the secrets of this little corner of baking. There are several reasons that make this book stand out from the pack.<br /><br />First, there is the detailed coverage of cookie baking ingredients and tools. The most important tool aside from the oven is the cookie sheet. I am chastised by reading that my pricy Calphalon jelly roll pans plus Silpat silicone lining is not the best platform for baking cookies. Also, there are great sections on how to deal with some of the more fussy nuts such as hazelnuts and how to tell the difference between unblanched, blanched, slivers, sliced, chopped, medium coarse chop, fine course chopped, and powdered nuts. Also, there is excellent coverage of virtually every other ingredient. Beranbaum, for example, explains the differences between butters and imitation butters and why the imitations simply don't work as well as the real thing. This treatment is especially good in giving formulas for substituting one combination of ingredients for another. The most useful is how to replace brown sugar with granulated sugar plus molasses. This is so easy, I wonder why I bother to stock brown sugar at all.<br /><br />Second, there are the instructions on cookie decorating techniques including very careful pictorial demonstrations on how to use a standard piping bag, an improvised zip top plastic bag piping bag, and a parchment cone piping tool.<br /><br />Third, all recipe amounts are given in both English and Metric units. This may seem unimportant until you get the urge to contribute cookies to a Boy Scout bake sale and want to multiply a recipe by four. As long as you have the proper measuring devices, this is much, much easier to do with metric units.<br /><br />Fourth, almost all recipe procedures are described for both a food processor and a stand mixer. I am genuinely surprised that professional baker Beranbaum prefers the food processor, as the stand mixer technique is very easy to multiply using commercial sized Hobart mixers. But then, this book is about Miss Rose's family recipes, and, while Beranbaum is a professional, her speciality is in writing, teaching, and trying out new ideas rather than grinding out thousands of cookies for a posh Manhattan patisserie. The author is very careful to point out that the two techniques do not give identical results. The food processor will give better results in creating a `Bakers sugar' size from standard granulated sugar and it saves one the trouble of bringing the butter to room temperature. But, there is the danger that your food processor will turn a batch of nuts into nut butter if you run it for too long.<br /><br />Fifth, Miss Beranbaum reserves her precious space for some of the more difficult types of cookies, up to and including a gingerbread replica of the Notre Dame cathedral in Paris. No, I am not kidding. It is really in the book with templates and everything. Most of the other recipes in the book are also just a bit less common than average. Where the author does touch on a standard that you will find in other books such as the very thin Moravian spice cookies, you will find tips about handling these extremely delicate cutouts.<br /><br />Sixth, the book gives excellent advice on how to store dough before baking, how to store baked cookies, and how to get cookies through the US Postal Service or your carrier of choice without excessive breakage. I was especially tickled when she said many of these lessons came from her experiences shipping mercury thermometers here and there. Having had an up close and professional relation with precision thermometers as a chemist, I can really appreciate how Miss B learned her lessons.<br /><br />Seventh, the book is divided into unusual but very useful categories such as:<br /><br />Tree and Mantelpiece Cookies<br /><br />Cookies for Giving<br /><br />Cookies to Make for or With Kids<br /><br />Cookies for an Open House<br /><br />Cookies for Sending<br /><br />Cookies for Holiday Dinner Parties (including the scale model of the Notre Dame cathedral).<br /><br />Eighth, in spite of all the professional technical advice, this is still a very personal book with lots of endearing stories about how Miss Rose came upon many of these recipes.<br /><br />Since this book does not cover many of the simpler traditional cookie types, you will actually gain by combining this book with other volumes whose main strength is coverage of the standards. In fact, as good as this book is, it does not preclude a high rating to other cookie books, even other Christmas cookie books, as they may be more suitable for a person who is simply too busy to walk through all the material here and simply wants a reliable Toll House cookie recipe or spice cookie cutout recipe.<br /><br />The most useful advice in a book loaded with advice is the permission to rework cookie doughs as much as you want. They are simply a lot more forgiving than, for example, pastry or biscuit doughs. Cookies are easy baking tasks and you don't really need Ms. Beranbaum's exacting treatment, but if you are not happy unless you know everything you need to know, this book is definitely for you.<br /><br />Very highly recommended for all amateur cookie bakers.choice without excessive breakage.

438267:US	39134375	R1P8BTY6C2N6F1	1891105167	771256582	Cooking 'Round the Clock: Rachael Ray's 30-Minute Meals	Books	5	311	336	N	Y	Rachael Conquers Breakfast, Lunch, and Midnight Snacks	`Cooking `Round the Clock' is by Rachael Ray, who is seeming more and more like an old friend, as this is the fourth of her books I am reviewing on top of watching her an average of 90 minutes a day on the Food Network and twice that on Fridays when her travelogue / celebrity interview shows air in the evening.<br /><br />For those of you who really live the 30 Minute lifestyle and can't wade through my usual 1000 words, I will say that this volume is as good or better than it's `30 minute' precursors because it gives recipes for those times of the day which simply are not well covered by most cookbooks. And, Miss Rachael continues her previous style of easily available ingredients, very few `convenience' prepared foods, lots of fresh meats and vegetables, and no preaching about prowling local farmers' markets for the stuff which was in the ground two hours ago.<br /><br /> I continue to be impressed by the fact that both her '30 Minute Meals' and `$40 a Day' concepts were all hers before she started with the Food Network. And, after six cookbooks in about four years, I also like to think that all her recipes are also her own creations, although from the evidence of her acknowledgments and other chef / writers' practices (such as Jamie Oliver), I suspect a lot of Rachael's contributions to these books are rough drafts on TV scripts, cocktail napkins, and Dictaphones, all assembled and tightened up by a copy editor. My mother, for one, wonders how she can manage three shows AND cookbook writing all at the same time.<br /><br />But, most of this is idle speculation and the real issue is how useful is Rachael's latest work to her core audience of busy young family members who like to cook but have no time to read Julia Child or Marcella Hazan or Paula Wolfert, or even `The Joy of Cooking' for that matter. One cannot discount the fact that looking for a recipe and shopping for ingredients may take as long as the time in front of the range. In this regard, Miss Rachael's recipes maintain the fast cooking lifestyle by not requiring any Internet shopping or trips to distant big city specialty markets.<br /><br />This book gives lots of recipes for the neglected meals of the day, a hearty breakfast, a fast but tasty lunch, evenings in front of the TV watching a movie, and late night snacks. Among the more than 300 cookbooks I have reviewed, I have seen but two on breakfasts and one on sandwiches. Rachael fills this gap for people who want good, interesting food the other 23 hours of the day and don't have time to track down uncommon books by authors whose names they don't know. Nancy Silverton and Marian Cunningham may be foodie heroes, but the average 10 hour a day young professional does not know who these people are and whether or not they can trust their sandwich and breakfast books respectively. Rachael's `brand name' is a lot like that of Howard Johnson's in the 1950's. You know you are not getting gourmet fare, but you also will not get an unexpectedly poor meal.<br /><br />In spite of the non-primetime dishes, these recipes still require a modicum of kitchen skills. Rachael's familiar aversion to measuring is not something you can acquire by reading. It takes practice and attention to what you are doing. Rachael's recipes also do not require a lot of kitchen equipment, but prep work and cooking will go faster if you have the right skills and a few pieces of high quality equipment. Topping the list of `not cheap' equipment is her Santoku knife, rangetop grill, two very good large (12 inch) saute pans, one or two large good Dutch ovens (8 quarts), an 8 quart pasta pot with pasta insert. A very good relationship with your oven's broiler is also necessary. I constantly envy her for her very retro range on her '30 Minute Meals' set. It is a much more convenient broiler than the floor level gas grill in most ovens. It is almost as convenient as a professional salamander.<br /><br />Like most of her books, recipes are arranged by meal in the same style as her shows. This means that instructions for each meal show you how to organize the whole meal, not just a recipe at a time. The meals include:<br /><br />Rise and Shiners (breakfast) with lots of scrambled eggs, French toast, scones, and hot cereals.<br /><br />Let's Do Lunch with pasta salads, sandwiches, crudites, wraps, burgers, and did I say sandwiches.<br /><br />Early Bird Specials with easy suppers based on chicken, thin pork chops, fast steaks, soups, and casseroles.<br /><br />Sit Down Suppers with hearty retro recipes for slaws, grilled cheese sammies, linguini, and more burgers.<br /><br />TV Dinners & Snacks with recreations of classic takeout dishes and finger foods.<br /><br />Bistro Meals, or `Tony Bourdain without the swear words'.<br /><br />Late-Nite Bites This chapter alone will have you keeping this book in your kitchen.<br /><br />If all this were not enough to convince you, I offer the opinion that Rachael's procedure descriptions are quite good in that all prep instructions are given with the list of ingredients and each short paragraph begins with the most important verb. There is not a lot of instruction going on here. This is the recipe, the whole recipe, and nothing but the recipe. That's why you need to expect to make the most of Rachel's recipes only when you are comfortable in the kitchen with a very sharp knife and very hot oil.<br /><br />One small caveat is that the pastel colored print can be hard on older eyes. I ran into more than one person who genuinely had trouble reading the instructions.<br /><br />Rachael delivers the goods again to her core audience. Highly recommended if you like her show or her earlier books.anged by meal in the same style as her shows.

In this piece, I said Villas' writing might not have quite the durability of similar writers such as John Thorne and Edward Behr. While I find in `Villas at Table' the same interest in the contemporary culinary scene as we see in his other collections of essays, I wish to loudly proclaim that Villas has something most other food columnists do not have. This is, I believe, the kind of strong opinions based on a thorough knowledge of his subject that provokes thought and discourse.<br /><br />This is not to say I always agree with Villas or that there are no statements in his writing which are dated. But, even the dated material that has been proven wrong by the course of time is an interesting basis for discussion. One favorite discovery in this book is in Villas interview with M.F.K. Fisher where they opine that buying fast food will make home cooking extinct. Since this was said in 1978, we have had the success of the Food Network and its roster of popular shows on cooking at home, the Slow Food movement, the success of supermarkets specializing in organic and seasonal produce, and a strong interest in healthy eating which can only be done within a reasonable budget by cooking and eating at home. The irony is that a similar culinary apocalypse was predicted in the late 1950s. This trend was simply not as deep as pictured by its critics and it was reversed by the appearance of Julia Child and the rise of interest in things culinary typified by Villas himself.<br /><br />But there is much, much more here than aging `causus bellum' statements. I experienced a minor epiphany upon reading the reaction of restaurateur Pearl Byrd Foster upon receiving a Virginia ham. In order to evaluate this seemingly magnificent cured thigh of pig, she proceeded to prepare it in her jambalaya recipe to see how it tasted when so cooked. This may seem to be an utterly simple act, yet the numerous references in `Cooks Illustrated' to testers doing similar experiments to evaluate a product never made an impression on me in the way it did when a very practical professional cook did the same thing.<br /><br />One of Villas' favorite complaints about modern celebrity chefs is that they spend so little time in their own kitchens actually preparing the food of which they speak on interview shows and on which they write in cookbooks based on their restaurant cuisine. In the abstract, I really discredit a chef for spending little time in his restaurant kitchen IF his staff faithfully recreates his recipes daily. If I ever happened to be so lucky as to actually get a reservation at Babbo, I would probably have a much more memorable experience if I ran into Mario Batali and had a few words with him than if Mario and not sous chef Andy Nusser were doing the cooking or manning the expediter's station. Mario and his book writing colleagues such as Charlie Trotter, Tom Colicchio, Alice Waters, Alfred Portale, and Jamie Oliver are reaching more people with their suggestions on good cooking than they ever would if they were working the saute station at their restaurants. I have no problem giving a greater respect to those chefs who do work their own kitchen, but I will not necessarily fault Wolfgang Puck for not working the line at Spago.<br /><br />One mystery this book does not solve is Villas' admiration for Emeril Lagasse and the dislike he commonly expresses of Wolfgang Puck. The closest I can come to figuring this out is that Lagasse is an important student of the great New Orleans cuisine, while Puck offends Villas' love of the traditional with his California pizzas and his concentration on business rather than food.<br /><br />One of Villas' major contributions to an appreciation of culinary pleasures is to give equal time to the pleasures of liqueur and mixed drinks against the tide of talk about wine. A similarly important contribution is his celebrating the pleasures of a long sit-down restaurant dinner. I simply have no interest in going to a local Italian or Chinese restaurant of small distinction when I could have much more fun teaching myself how to make semolina gnocchi or lo mein at home. The opportunity to select a mediocre meal from a large selection of dishes without the work of shopping for ingredients, doing all the prep work, having all the right pots and pans on hand, and doing the cleanup simply does not counter the joyless encounter with the modestly skilled restaurant staff. Having a meal at a French or French influenced restaurant with an ample wine list and a wait staff which does not address us as `You guys' and which caters to your occupying a table for up to three hours is a very uncommon pleasure. Villas reminds us of how fine an experience this can be.<br /><br />Villas is definitely `old school' culinary journalism. His heroes are James Beard, Craig Claiborne, and M.F.K. Fisher. Not once does the name of current stars, Shirley Corriher, Jeffrey Steingarten, John Thorne, or Tony Bourdain, leave his pen. This is a bit unfortunate, as I would really like to know what Villas thinks of contemporary culinary stars such as Thomas Keller, Frank Stitt, and Patrick O'Connell. Villas' main contribution to contemporary culinary thought may be that he gives us a picture of the way things used to be and from where we have come. The modern culinary scene may not be in as much of a change as the revolution happening in the music distribution world, but things are changing, and Villas is a fine gauge of what has changed.<br /><br />Highly recommended to foodie readers.of talk about wine.

440904:US	39134375	RC58508TDJ02M	1558215727	110066369	American Taste	Books	5	8	8	N	Y	Great Read on what makes American Food. Recommended	`American Taste' is the first book of culinary writer extraordinare, James Villas, who has served the exposition of American eating by producing cookbooks of Southern cuisine with his mother, major books of great American comfort foods such as casseroles and biscuits, essays on American cuisine such as this work, and a better than average book of memoir essays entitled `Between Bites'. While not as dominant a figure as either James Beard or Julia Child, he has thereby succeeded at just about every recognized form of culinary writing, especially when you add his food column which ran for decades in `Town and Country' magazine.<br /><br />By covering so many culinary bases, Villas has created a niche for himself in American culinary writing which is not as scholarly as John Thorne, Jeffrey Steingarten, or Paula Wolfert, less personal than Jim Harrison, better informed and more involved than Alan Richman, but with certainly the strong opinions of Harrison and Richman, with the authority of having worked full time in the field for over thirty years now. For readers just discovering this book, it is important to recognize that the essays were published over 20 years ago and were probably written in the ten (10) years before that. Therefore, they represent something of a time capsule where one can read about the culinary world of almost a generation ago when Julia Child was important but not yet deified, James Beard was the biggest influence in writing about American food, Alice Waters was still getting her bearings at Chez Panisse, Paul Prudhomme had just left Commander's Palace in New Orleans and Emeril Lagasse was still a very minor player indeed. This is also a time just before the iron grip of the culinary police grasped our food conscience and made us fearful of all things tasty due to fats, eggs, or carbs. At least, that is how Villas makes us feel, with his rapture over good French fries, pates, terrines, gumbos, and Brunswick stew.<br /><br />It is no surprise that Villas, a North Carolina Tarheel to his core, largely equates American cooking with Southern cooking. His very first essay deals with that paragon of Southern cuisine, fried chicken. He here claims that no one except a native Southern cook can do true justice to fried chicken and proceeds to give the gospel on how it is done. It is notable that his recipe disagrees on some important points with many other experts on Southern fried chicken I have audited, especially those with such heady credentials as Edna Lewis, James Beard, and `Cooks Illustrated' magazine. What is interesting however is not the differences, but the similarities. While Villas calls for a marinade in sour milk, acidulated with lemon juice, Lewis and `Cooks' use buttermilk, which is simply a natural sour milk. Beard also uses mild, but no acid, and all agree on the importance of cutting whole chickens rather than using precut parts and using a cast iron frying pan. I am certain that Villas' recipe will produce primo fried chicken, but I am also certain that his approach is not the ONLY way to achieve Southern fried perfection.<br /><br />Villas takes a similarly strong position when it comes to that quintessentially American technique, barbecue. From many hours in front of the TV watching Al Roker, Bobby Flay, and Steve Raichlen, I know that the centers of the barbecue religion are North Carolina, Memphis, Texas, and Kansas City. Needless to say, Villas elevates back country Tarheel techniques to the level of gospel and, in his first essay on the subject, relegates all that stuff they do in Texas to the footnotes of culinary consideration. To be fair, in a later essay, he visits some prime Texas barbecue eateries and recants, allowing that beef can approach the great taste achieved from a well barbecued piece of pork.<br /><br />To also be fair about his regionalism, Villas does give a fair amount of time to non-Southern specialities such as native American cheeses and true caviar, harvested fromAmerican bred sturgeon. He is especially fond of the national love and creativity with the lowly sandwich, most especially the hamburger; the bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwich; and the glorious club sandwich. In spite of how important the sandwich is to American eating, Villas bemoans how poorly the hamburger is served in so many fast food outlets. If I were to cite one aspect of this book with which to encourage you to buy and read it, it would be for Villas' advice on sandwiches. Like so many of his opinions, I cannot follow him to create an inch and a half-thick burger with close to half a pound of carefully ground meat. I am much fonder of Julia Child's recipe using five ounces and a liberal enhancement from encapsulated saut&eacute;ed shallots. But again, Villas strong opinions are always sound, especially with his advice on how to acquire the best meat for his tasty burger.<br /><br />The very best thing about Villas' essays is the fact that he pokes his discriminating nose into some of the more obscure corners of American gastronomy. I found his essay on Bourbon especially interesting, as he reveals that the rules for distilling and aging Bourbon are about as strict as any French, German, or Italian rules on crafting beer, cheese, and wine. Among other things, it explains why Jack Daniels product is not really Bourbon, but simply a `sour mash whiskey'.<br /><br />Unlike Bourbon, these essays are Villas without the effects of aging which may have mellowed his writing in his later books. Villas' writing is entertaining for his strong opinions. These opinions may shorten the shelf life of his writing, but I personally find his thoughts as nourishing as more moderate writers such as Thorne, Colwin, and M.F.K.

Great Read.	`Rustico' by Italian food journalist Micol Negrin is a better than average book of regional Italian recipes in a world filled with good books on regional Italian recipes. The book's subtitle specifies that the book concentrates on `Country' cooking. And, although the book is very nicely done by region, it has no pretensions to being a scholarly work such as Waverley Root's `The Foods of Italy' or even a journalistic coverage of the subject as in Claudia Roden's very worthy `The Food of Italy'. In fact, the absence of pretension adds to the pleasant satisfaction one gets in reading the book, as it is not without merit as an introduction to the culinary world of Italy.<br /><br />In my mind, the book is immediately superior to Susan Herrmann Loomis' very good book `Italian Farmhouse Cookbook' in that it does deal with recipes by region with an introduction that explains the geographical, historical, and climactic reasons for the prevailing cuisine in each region. Rome (Latium), for example, is all about sheep (as the city was founded by a tribe of nomadic sheepherders) and pigs (since from the time of the Roman Empire, the city of Rome was the center of hog butchering for the region. Similarly, Genoa and its region, Liguria, is shown to have a cuisine which is very similar to southern Italy due to the role of Genoa as a major medieval port and source of imported foods.<br /><br />In addition to recipes and culinary history, the book gives an excellent overview of the wines and cheeses of each region. The coverage of cheeses is especially interesting to someone who knows a lot more about cheeses and the differences between cows and sheep than he does about grapes. The book makes clear, for example, why a cheese like Fontina is a distinctive product of the alpine region of Val d'Aosta, tucked in the seam between France and German speaking Switzerland. Good Italian Fontina is a great cross between the semihard Swiss Gruyeres and Emmentalers and the soft French bries. The book also gives some sidebar coverage to the types of breads native to the regions. These comments are a bit frustrating, as it seems it would have been almost as easy to give us the recipe for Grissini (Piedmontese breadsticks) as to tell us the historical origin of these little lovelies. But, bread is a very big subject and Carol Field's superb `The Italian Baker' has five pages devoted to Grissini recipes.<br /><br />All of Negrin's other virtues would still leave us with a rather thin book if she had chosen to give us recipes for the well-known specialities of each region. Another book with spaghetti Carbonara, artichokes ala Judica, saltimbocca, and potato gnocchi in the chapter on Latium would have been very dull indeed, as these four recipes show up in every book I have seen on the cooking of Rome, and there are many of these books already available. Some well-known regional classics are here, such as Campania's (Naples) Pizza Margherita and Venice's Risi e Bisi (rice and peas), but many of the dishes are not only unfamiliar, but break some rules I learned at Mario Batali's knee, such as the fact that cooks in Campania, Sicily, and Sardinia have no qualms about combining fish and cheese, although the excellent recipe to which this observation is a headnote combines a very mild cheese, Mozzarella, with a very strong tasting fish, salted anchovies. In any case, this recipe is a great variation on the quick Spaghetti Puttanesca style of dish.<br /><br />The selection of dishes in the book as a whole is a very nice mix of pasta, breads, soups, braises, salads, roasts and frys. As the book is organized by geography rather than by course or type of dish, a supplementary table of contents organizing all dishes by type of dish would have been a very nice addition. This is not a book from which you will want to learn how to make bread or pasta. For those, I suggest you go to Carol Field and Marcella Hazan respectively, but the bread and pizza recipes in this book arepretty good. It's just that if things don't work out, you have no guidance on how to correct your mistakes.<br /><br />The recipes end with an excellent little chapter on basic Italian recipes for broths, sauces and doughs. The veggies in the chicken broth are cooked a bit too long for my taste. I am pretty sure you have sucked all the goodness out of your carrots, celery, and onions in three hours, so why go stew them for six. The book ends with a very nice list of American sources, most of which are located in New York City.<br /><br />The introduction to each region includes the addresses of restaurants, shops, and culinary schools in that region. If you are a foodie and are planning a trip to Italy, this information can be invaluable. Even if you simply want to access these establishments over the phone and can trust your Italian, this is useful, as telephone numbers for each establishment are given. No web sites, unfortunately.<br /><br />I notice that almost all acknowledgments are to Italian sources. This inspires a lot of confidence in me, as does the facing bibliography which lists many Italian language sources plus many English language sources, all of which I recognize as important culinary authorities such as Clifford Wright, Alan Davidson, Fred Plotkin, and my favorite Claudia Roden.<br /><br />My knowledge of Italian is not up to the task of knowing whether this is correct, but I am puzzled by the fact that every other writer I know refers to the modern region around Rome as Lazio, while Ms. Negrin uses Latium, which sounds very archaic.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this as a first book on Italian regional cuisine, to be read before taking on Roden's or Root's classic works.book are pretty good.

443306:US	39134375	R6AUMM36EFV8I	080213937X	997542726	The Raw and the Cooked: Adventures of a Roving Gourmand	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Very Personal and Very Erudite Amateur's take on Food	`The Raw and the Cooked' by poet, playwright, and novelist Jim Harrison is quite properly subtitled `Adventures of a Roving Gourmand'. The author makes a very careful point of saying that he is not a very good cook, and his involvement in writing about cooking is definitely not his primary occupation. His `day job' is creative writing of poetry, drama, and narrative fiction, so his choice of words can be expected to be especially careful. His role as `roving gourmand' is a case in point. The first meaning of `gourmand' in my Merriam-Webster unabridged dictionary is `a greedy and ravenous eater'. This is definitely not the same as `gourmet', a secondary meaning of the word, and it is much more appropriate to the author's style than the more genteel `gourmet'.<br /><br />As a writer on culinary matters, Harrison seems to be in a class by himself. He is quite definitely not in the same class as the students of cookery such as Jeffrey Steingarten, John Thorne, and Jim Villas. He is also not in the same class as professional observers of the culinary world such as Calvin Trillin, Robb Walsh, and Alan Richman. The most similar writer who comes to mind is R. W. Appel whose culinary writing is secondary to his news writing at the New York Times. But, even Appel is more of a professional journalist, so his food writing is part and parcel of his `day job'.<br /><br />As an amateur writer on eating, Harrison has a deep respect for all these writers plus the great cookbook authors of the day such as Paula Wolfert, Marcella Hazan, and Julia Child, upon whom he depends for his recipes. His greatest respect seems to be reserved for M.F.K. Fisher, who also seems to earn the respect of every other major culinary journalist.<br /><br />In a nutshell then, Harrison writes about less about food and food preparation than he does about eating and the enjoyment of food, wine, spirits, and hunting. And, he spends a lot of time writing about the writing about food, with a level of reflection you do not find in any writer I have read (with the caveat that I have not yet spend a reasonable amount of time with the writings of M.F.K. Fisher to compare Harrison and Fisher). This writing is done with an eye to the careful selection of words that may be unmatched among modern food writers. One example of this circumspection is his questioning the description of a pork chop with superlatives. The problem with this practice is that if the chop is praised with effusive adjectives, what is left to describe Bach or Rembrant or Shakespeare. Can a pork chop really measure up to `Hamlet'?<br /><br />One of the consequences of this careful language is that Harrison may be difficult to read when he uses unfamiliar locutions. Contrary to an anti-intellectual complaint about erudite discourse, it is not the `big words' on which one may choke, but the statements which are so packed with meaning that we actually have to stop reading and take some time to parse the words to be sure we have gotten the full sense of the writer's words.<br /><br />This means that Harrison may not be for everyone. As a writer who is entirely aware of his amateur status, his writing is almost entirely based on his personal experiences and his own choices and reactions to food, and his relating reactions of others to specific culinary situations. This has the advantage of avoiding making false generalizations about the food world. It has the weakness of being essays that are much closer to fiction than they are to journalism.<br /><br />As almost all essays in this book have been published elsewhere in major periodicals, major editors with a good knowledge of their audience's taste have vetted almost all essays in this book. Therefore, I personally have found almost all essays quite enjoyable to read. It is no accident that the only pieces I found wanting were previously unpublished.<br /><br />If you simply enjoy reading about food, especially writings by Fisher, Trillin, and Walsh, the chancesare very good that you will find this book very entertaining. To all of you with these tastes in words, I heartily recommend this book.h, the chances are very good that you will find this book very entertaining.

Yawn.	`Inspired by Ingredients' is by a wannabe New York City celebrity chef Bill Telepan, assisted by major culinary assistant writer Andrew Friedman. The author extols fresh seasonal cooking, graduated from the Culinary Institute of America, has staged with major American and French star chefs, and organizes his dishes by season. Alert the media! My hackneyed sarcasm here is based on the fact that this book is so much about nothing new. On top of these tired assets, there is the fact that Telepan assisted in restaurants under both Daniel Boulud and Albert Portale. As I already own a half dozen books by these major chefs who are known for both the skill and innovation in their recipes, so why do I want a book by one of their apostles? I will be really happy when restaurant chefs gild their books with praise for using fresh ingredients and for extolling their illustrious career path and success with important reviewers such as Ruth Reichl or the Michelin guide. Both of these are legally purely circumstantial when it comes to how good their cookbook may be.<br /><br />There are some things in Telepan's book which redeem the picture of mediocre copycat painted in the previous paragraph. The first evidence of quality is co-author Andrew Friedman. Friedman is credited with assisting in the writing of Albert Portale's books, but he was also co-author on Tom Valenti's two books, both of which I found to be of a high quality in writing and recipe composition. The second is the fact that Telepan's family background is Hungarian and several of his recipes are interpretations of classic Hungarian dishes. This may not mean much to a person with an Italian or French or Spanish, or even German or English heritage, but to us poor scions of Hungarian grandparents, this means a lot. The index to this book cites four (4) Hungarian influenced dishes. These are an apple pie with caramel sauce, a cabbage and potato soup with kielbasa, cabbage and noodles, and lemon-poppy seed bars. After my initial anticipation upon reading about the Hungarian influence, I was really disappointed to find but four Hungarian influenced dishes, two of which are desserts and one of which is not really a recipe from an accomplished chef, but just a contrived interview between chef and Hungarian mother about how she makes the dish. In contrast, there are ten (10) recipes based on Italian influences. I really don't need another book by a New York chef with Italian influenced recipes. I can get all I want on this theme from Mario Batali, Rocco DiSpirito, and Tom Colicchio. At least they are Italian.<br /><br />I did find one other thing to interest me, in that the chef-author includes a lot of recipes for fresh peas, which happens to be one of my favorite vegetables, and, he has several good tips on getting the best from this ingredient. Otherwise, most of his tips, such as how to find the best point at which to trim asparagus and how to do a perfect hard-boiled egg seem pretty tired to anyone who dotes on the Food Network or has read more than two good general cookbooks. Note that the author makes heavy use of some very uncommon ingredients such as ramps, fresh morels, and purslane. My generally very well stocked megamart has never carried any of these ingredients, and since I live 90 miles from the Union Square market, I have a hard time determining where I may find these ingredients. Also, the book's design and photography have nothing whatsoever to distinguish it from a good buy from the discount stacks. As even Alfred Portale's books have found their way to the discount lists, I do not expect much from this book. I am inclined to believe Simon & Schuster simply decided not to commit many resources to this project.<br /><br />My final comment is that these recipes are well written, quite obviously tasty (the amount of heavy cream in play alone will guarantee this), and are well chosen for anyone who does not already own 300 cookbooks. If you are especially fond of cookbooks by New York chefs and already own the collected works of Eric Rippert, Alfred Portale, Tom Colicchio, Daniel Boulud, David Bouley, and Tony Bourdain, this book will fit right in.okbooks by New York chefs and already own the collected works of Eric Rippert, Alfred Portale, Tom Colicchio, Daniel Boulud, David Bouley, and Tony Bourdain, this book will fit right in. <br />	2004-11-25
445796:US	39134375	R38KTWUJJ1KX9G	0761105271	554758032	Italian Farmhouse Cookbook	Books	4	22	23	N	N	An Excellent Foodie Read on Italian Country Cuisine	The `Italian Farmhouse Cookbook' by Susan Hermann Loomis is part of a three (3) book series of farmhouse recipe books covering France and the US as well as Italy. My first and most important caution to the prospective buyer is that if all you want is a book of Italian recipes, there are easily a hundred or more books that would better fill that need. Ms. Loomis books are very good, but they are as much or more for readers and foodies as they are for cooks. At least a third of the text in this book gives background on Italian farmers, their life, and their produce. A second reason for this caution is based on an observation I saw in `The Medieval Kitchen' which points out that in the 15th century, city cooking was much more interesting than country cooking, as major urban trading centers had both access to foreign products and a nobility which encouraged creative cooking. Lest you think much has probably changed in the last 500 years, Ms. Loomis' book itself states that Italian country cooking was, until very recently, limited by poor roads and limited trade.<br /><br />This is not to say this is not a good book. In fact, for travelers who may have an interest in visiting rural Italy, it is an excellent book. It is also excellent in giving a picture of rural agriculture in Italy over the last 100 years. It is quite surprising how recently the Italian peasant has been freed from a crippling economic serfdom by both the national Italian government and the European Economic Community centered in Brussels. All sorts of things that new foodies assume have been around for centuries such as fine Italian wines, dried pasta, high quality olive oil, and grappa comparable to French cognac are actually very recent developments. One can easily get the wrong impression from the age of other products such as Parmesano-Reggiano and prosciutto de Parma that Italy has always been the culinary dynamo it is today.<br /><br />I must say the recipes in this book are very good and very typically Italian. The surest symptom of an Italian style recipe is when one wonders that you need a recipe at all to make the dish. Just as I marvel at the utter simplicity of Italian influenced recipes from London's River Caf&eacute; and Jamie Oliver, most of the recipes in this book are based on simplicity itself. Even better, there is very little use of premium ingredients such as truffles and balsamic vinegar. On the other hand, I am a little puzzled at how few recipes there are featuring wild mushrooms and wild greens such as dandelion and nettles. There are a fair number of recipes for game such as guinea hens and wild boar. This is great for the accuracy of the book's picture of Italian rural cuisine, but it does not add a lot to the count of recipes useable by a foodie in suburban Newark.<br /><br />I am especially pleased that the book covers the full range of Italian regions from Friuli to Sicily to Sardinia. I am especially pleased to see a recipe for the traditional Sardinian flatbread. This recipe plus a few others may be worth the price of admission, as it is an easy preparation that requires no fussing with yeast or any other leaveners.<br /><br />The subjects of the recipe chapters follow a very traditional Italian model based on courses. The chapter titles are:<br /><br />Appetizers and Snacks, including sidebars on Buffalo mozzarella and Italian organic farming.<br /><br />Salads, including sidebars on Balsamic Vinegar and capers.<br /><br />Soups, both Minestre and zuppa.<br /><br />First Courses, including sidebars on Parmigiano-Reggiano and rice farming.<br /><br />Second courses, primarily lamb, pork, poultry, rabbit, and boar.<br /><br />The Vegetable Garden, including sidebars on grappa, organic farming, and peppers.<br /><br />From the Bread Oven. Not a lot, as the Italians, like the French, typically bought bread from the baker.<br /><br />Sweet, Sweet, with fruit, nut cakes, fruit tarts, and marmalades.<br /><br />The Pantry, or what to keepon hand to whip up fast meals.<br /><br />The basics, or how to make brodo and doughs.<br /><br />This is the kind of cookbook you read in bed at night to better understand a major world cuisine and get ideas for improvisations based on the Italian style of cooking. The paperback is simply not up to the rigors of standing open on the kitchen table.<br /><br />This is an excellent background book to accompany more systematic treatments of Italian cuisine such as the excellent books by Marcella Hazan, Lydia Bastianich, and Giuliano Bugialli.>The basics, or how to make brodo and doughs. <br /> <br />This is the kind of cookbook you read in bed at night to better understand a major world cuisine and get ideas for improvisations based on the Italian style of cooking.

In the rich and varied world of Italian cookbooks, this offering joins `Lydia's Italian-American Kitchen' in the very select niche of works on how Americans, whether transplanted from Italy or from other sources, cook recipes inspired by one of the cuisines of Italy.<br /><br />Both of these books stand apart and above volumes such as `Eleanora's Kitchen' by Eleanora Scarpetta, a Bronx housewife and `Rocco's Italian American' by Rocco and Mama of the meatballs made famous on `The Restaurant' miniseries. These latter volumes contain many good recipes, but they are a record of a personal cuisine built on their family's Italian-American recipes. Bastianich and Mariani have a much more scholarly goal of presenting a general picture of Italian-American recipes.<br /><br />Appropriate to Mariani's vocation as a professional writer, his book has a much more scholarly tone than chef and culinary teacher Bastianish. This emphasis is set by a truly erudite 22 page opening essay on the origins of the Italian American cuisine from the political fragmentation of the Italian peninsula after the fall of the Western Roman empire to the flowering of the Italian American restaurant epitomized by Manhattan's famous `Mama Leone's' restaurant. Mariani immediately earned my respect when he pointed out that such classic American dishes as Philly's cheese steak and Kraft's `Mac and Cheese' are both sucker branches from the great Italian stem of cuisines. Very early on, Mariani shows a lot of respect for Italian-American cuisine as a distinct culinary genre which deserves to stand on its own rather than to be belittled as a pale shadow of `true' Italian cooking. As the book progresses; however, Mariani seems to loose his bearings and appears to be presenting purely Italian dishes as the ideal and American takes on these dishes as derivatives, rather than as true evolutions, just as Homo Sapiens is a distinct evolution from Homo Erectus and an improvement over Homo Neanderthalis. The clearest evidence of this is his recitation of Italian wines rather than coverage of American wines that originated with native Italian grapes. He does point out that many of the early California vintners were Italians such as Mondavi and Gallo, but nothing is said of their wines. So, on the issue of scholarship and `keeping on message', I come away just a little disappointed with this otherwise excellent embassy on Italian American cooking to the lay foodies.<br /><br />So what about the recipes? Starting from my impression stated in the previous paragraph, I feel that the best description of the recipes in this book is that it presents those Italian recipes which are most commonly cooked in American households and in `Italian' restaurants in the United States rather than being a rigorous examination of the transformation of recipes from Italy to America. The first implication of this selection is that it is heavily weighed toward recipes whose origins lie in Southern Italian provinces of Campagnia (Naples), Apulia, Sicily, and Lazio (Rome). One sure symptom of this emphasis is in Mariani's including fourteen (14) recipes for spaghetti, including the Italian classics `alla Carbonara' and `Puttanesca'. A telling comment in the headnote on spaghetti and cauliflower is Mariani's stating that cauliflower is a much more common ingredient on the Italian table than it is in the Italian American restaurant. Why is this cauliflower recipe then in a book about distinctively Italian American recipes? By contrast, Bastianich has only four (4) recipes for spaghetti in her index and the Carbonara and Puttanesca are missing. On the other hand, Mariani has only six (6) recipes with spinach while northerner Bastianich gives us fourteen (14) recipes with spinach. For recipes on veal, especially veal scaloppine, the two books are very close in both the number and selection of recipes. Both include the classic recipes for `Scaloppine alla Marsala', `Saltimbocca alla Romana', and `Scaloppine Piccata' (with lemon-caper sauce).<br /><br />Since `What is Italian-American cuisine' may be only slightly more interesting than the number of angels jigging on a pinhead, the real value of Mariani's book may simply be the quality of his recipes. On this point, my summary judgment is that his recipes are better than Rocco DiSpirito's traditional family recipes, and they are not quite as good as teacher and chef Lydia Bastianich's recipes in her work on Italian-American cooking. Part of this difference is that Ms. Bastianich simply explains things better. A small example of this is their respective instructions on combining the sage and prosciutto with the scallopine to create the saltimbocca. I have done Bastianich's instructions several times with no problems. Mariani's instructions leave me scratching my head trying to figure out exactly how he meant me to apply the toothpick and fold the results of this marriage of ingredients. Another point in Ms. Bastianich's favor is that her recipes are a bit more respectful of ingredients in the manner so well explained by Marcella Hazan. In Bastianich's recipe for sausage and peppers, the meat and the peppers are saut&eacute;ed separately before being roasted together to complete the dish. She also does not drown the meat and peppers in canned tomatoes or gild the lily with oregano or dried pepper flakes. Instead, she adds fresh mushrooms and whole cherry peppers. I do not know which recipe is more authentically `Italian-American' but I know I prefer eating Ms. Lydia's dish. On this basis, it is no surprise that Bastianich won an IACP award and Mariani was a runner-up.<br /><br />The list of suppliers at the back of Mariani's book is just a bit weak and out of date. Balducci's in New York City has gone out of business and his list does not list DePalo's cheese shop, one of the best sources of homemade mozzarella and ricotta in Manhattan.<br /><br />I recommend Mariani's book especially for his excellent wine and food pairings, but suggest you get both Mariani and Bastianich.c recipes for `Scaloppine alla Marsala', `Saltimbocca alla Romana', and `Scaloppine Piccata' (with lemon-caper sauce).<br /><br />Since `What is Italian-American cuisine' may be only slightly more interesting than the number of angels jigging on a pinhead, the real value of Mariani's book may simply be the quality of his recipes.

One also gets the impression that a professional writer such as Ms. Sheraton can bang out a book like this in a couple of days. I get this impression because while the stories are excellent and the quality of the writing is high, the book is simply journalism. There is little art. By this, there is nothing here which grabs your attention and holds it by the nose, enthralled to see what happens next. Ms. Sheraton has had an interesting, successful life with a few dramas, a lot of success, and a lot of satisfaction. At least, there is very little in the way of fireworks relayed in this volume. Ms. Sheraton's family and early life was about as typical as you can imagine for someone with first generation Jews in America and a woman's college experience shortly after World War II. There are some very coy hints of amorous connections, but `nothing to write home about'.<br /><br />This is not to say there is nothing of interest to be learned from a book written by a skillful writer who had an important position in culinary journalism at `The New York Times'. Especially with all of it's other eminence, this journal is one of the major venues of culinary journalism in the United States, a condition created by the service of Craig Claiborne Pierre Franey at the paper in the `60s and `70s. Ms. Sheraton's service at the paper overlapped Claiborne's by a few years; however it was John Canaday and not Claiborne which Sheraton replaced as restaurant critic.<br /><br />The most interesting and most practical information in this book is the stories on the politics of journalism, advertising, and review writing at `The New York Times'. In the light of the recent failure of the `Times' editorial review of political reporting, it is interesting to read of the depth to which material is routinely edited by the paper's copy and senior editors. The most interesting stories surrounded the reaction of restaurants to the presence of celebrity or reviewer diners in comparison to how some restaurants treated average customers.<br /><br />Another interesting aspect of the book is the presence (or absence) of politics in determining what is printed about a restaurant or a product and what is edited out for reasons other than simple quality of writing. On the whole, `The New York Times' and other periodicals for which Ms. Sheraton wrote rarely censored anything for anything other than writing quality. In fact, `The New York Times' was probably better in this regard than other periodicals such as the magazine `New York'.<br /><br />What I missed most in this book were stories about Craig Claiborne, Pierre Franey, R.W. Appel, and other luminaries of culinary journalism who worked at the `Times'.<br /><br />Recommended to all foodies who like to read about restaurants. Just a bit light on Ms. Sheraton's colleagues and other personalities in the world of culinary journalism.

The most interesting stories surrounded the reaction of restaurants to the presence of celebrity or reviewer diners in comparison to how some restaurants treated average customers. <br /> <br />Another interesting aspect of the book is the presence (or absence) of politics in determining what is printed about a restaurant or a product and what is edited out for reasons other than simple quality of writing. On the whole, `The New York Times' and other periodicals for which Ms. Sheraton wrote rarely censored anything for anything other than writing quality. In fact, `The New York Times' was probably better in this regard than other periodicals such as the magazine `New York'. <br /> <br />What I missed most in this book were stories about Craig Claiborne, Pierre Franey, R.W. Appel, and other luminaries of culinary journalism who worked at the `Times'. <br /> <br />Recommended to all foodies who like to read about restaurants. Just a bit light on Ms. Sheraton's colleagues and other personalities in the world of culinary journalism. Another reviewer who happened to edit Ms. Sheraton's copy says her writing is crisp, to the point, and free of 'showing off'. I agree completely, but she also seems to have not included quite enough spice in this otherwise crisp, cleanly written memoir. <br /> <br />Recommended. <br />	2004-11-22
449172:US	39134375	R1FFTQVSNTBCHQ	0226706850	543831409	The Medieval Kitchen: Recipes from France and Italy	Books	5	67	68	N	Y	Saffron, Almonds and Blackbirds in Pies, oh my! Great Read	`The Medieval Kitchen', written originally in French by Odile Redon, Francoise Sabban, and Silvano Serventi, is the best of the three books I have reviewed so far on the cuisines of Europe before the arrival of New World produce. This volume surpasses both `The Medieval Cookbook' by Maggie Black and `Pleyn Delit' by Constance B. Hieatt, Brenda Hosington, and Sharon Butler in technical scholarship and in it's interest to the non-professional foodie, historian, or general reader.<br /><br />The book is organized by chapters which are very similar to a contemporary cookbook, covering Soups and Pastas; Porees and Vegetables; Meats cooked in Sauces; Roasted Meats; Fish; Pies and Tarts; Sauces; Eggs; Fritters and Breads; and Sweetmeats. The selection of recipes is much more interesting than in `The Medieval Cookbook' and the `arrangement' is as good or better than `Pleyn Delit', with much more background given for each individual recipe than either of the other two books. See my review of `Pleyn Delit' for a complete list of interesting things to do with these books.<br /><br />The most impressive contribution of `The Medieval Kitchen' is its generalizations about medieval cooking in 50 pages of introductory essays on aspects of these 600-year old French and Italian cuisines. The highlight of this overview is the observation that 14th and 15th century European cooking was in love with spices in general and the `cookie spices', cinnamon and cloves, in particular. One may think that this is due to the influence of contact with the Moslem world, especially as the use of these spices is still strong in Sicily and Spain, but the authors state that this influence is overstated. Interest in spices was home bred. My other reviewed works show the very common use of saffron in recipes, but does not explain the broad use of a very expensive ingredient. `The Medieval Kitchen' clearly explains that while little attention was paid to odors directly, the color of food was given an important place in the preparation of medieval recipes. One can almost predict the great interest Europeans would have in the bright red of tomatoes and chiles from the New World.<br /><br />Unlike today, where so many provisions are prepared and prepackaged by national or international companies, it is surprising to see that the medieval city had lots of shops run by foodstuff specialists, the only trace in today's France may be the boulanger for bread, patisserie for pastries, and the chocolatier for chocolate candies. The spice merchant, in particular, was a very important food specialist. A pale shadow in Europe of this merchant's work is the quatre epices and herbes de Provence. In the last 10 years, there seems to be a great growth in prepared seasoning mixes. I wonder if Paul Prudhomme and Emeril Lagasse and McCormick's and Durkee are simply reviving a 600-year-old practice by bottling and marketing spice mixes.<br /><br />While the authors do not elaborate on this point, as it deals with a period after their chosen subject, they state that the emphasis on spices was replaced (except for pepper) by an emphasis on the use of local herbs such as lavender, mint, thyme and marjoram and by use of a broader range of cooking fats and oils in the seventeenth century.<br /><br />As the Medieval period is quite rightly pictured as a period when progress in science some fine arts may have slipped from highs achieved in the ancient Roman and Greek worlds, this does not mean medieval domestic arts and crafts were not unsophisticated. In fact, one may be impressed by exactly how sophisticated their cooking techniques were, especially in the absence of convection ovens and electric ranges. Their emphasis on constantly processing and straining to achieve an especially smooth preparation reminds me of a description of Thomas Keller's kitchen at the French Laundry. On top of routinely elaborate techniques performed by a great range of specialists rivaling Escoffier's famous brigadesystem, there are also the very special preparations headlined by the entirely historical feat of baking `four and 20 blackbirds' into a pie. Not only was this actually done, the book tells us that it was common for banquets of the nobility, and it tells us how it was done.<br /><br />As readable and as informative this book is for the casual foodie, it is a very serious work of scholarship which gets everything right, even those things which my two previous subjects did poorly. The method for citing sources is much better and, even though the book as a whole is translated from the French, all the original recipes in their original Latin, Medieval French or Italian, or Old English are supplied, along with modern English translations of these texts, followed by modern culinary interpretations of the recipes. Even on so small a matter as the selection of color prints, this volume picks much more interesting plates than `The Medieval Cookbook'.<br /><br />The translator, the authors, or the publisher (University of Chicago Press) also did an excellent job of making the work available to an American audience. All measurements are in both metric and English units and many solids amounts are given by both weight and volume. Culinary unit conversions are typically very gross, as, for example, it is much easier to measure 1 liter for 4 cups rather than 946 milliliters, which is a much more accurate conversion. Even the sources are up to date American companies such as Dean & Delucca, Penzey's Spices, D'Artagnan, and King Arthur Flour.<br /><br />While this book is superior in every way to the other two works cited, they are not superseded by this work, as they concentrate on English dishes while `The Medieval Kitchen' concentrates on France and Italy. In fact, it is useful to compare recipes in the three books to see how much they had in common.<br /><br />Highly recommended as a source for a medieval theme entertainment, historical interest, and an understanding of realities of medieval life.us brigade system, there are also the very special preparations headlined by the entirely historical feat of baking `four and 20 blackbirds' into a pie.

Weaker on Recipes.	`The Medieval Cookbook' by Maggie Black is very similar to the slightly older book, `Pleyn Delit' by Constance B. Hieatt, Brenda Hosington, and Sharon Butler. It even cites this book and other works by these authors as references. Aside from the fact that the two books deal with almost exactly the same subject, English and French recipes from the late Middle Ages, and both are serious, scholarly works, there are two important differences.<br /><br />The positive differences in Ms. Black's book is that it is organized by source and that it has many more pictures, both black and white and color photographs of scenes from medieval sources, and line drawings or etchings of food plants and other botanicals. `Pleyn Delit' has virtually no pictures.<br /><br />The two books share several major sources. Dominating the sources and background of both books is Geoffrey Chaucer's `Canterbury Tales'. While this work contains no recipes itself, if has numerous references to food and beverages, and Ms. Black devotes an entire chapter to recipes cited in this great literary work. The second major work cited in Ms. Black's volume is a pedagogical volume by an upper middle class member of the gentry identified as `The Goodman of Paris'. The narrative identifies him as probably a civil servant, with houses in both the city and the country. After chapters on proper moral deportment, the author gives both menus and recipes for the training of his staff of servants. The book also gives several directions to wife and staff on proper kitchen economics and the care of domestic and captured animals. The third primary source is documents associated with the very sybaritic court of the English king Richard II, whose death started the War of the Roses. I am green with envy at my image of the author's working on this book among the stacks of Oxford's Bodleian Library and at the British Museum, two shrines of English language scholarship for sure. I have seen both as a tourist and my most persistent fantasy career is one of a scholar.<br /><br />The pictures in the book are very well chosen to illustrate the literary sources. Pictures of medieval life are taken largely from tapestries such as the famous Bayeux tapestry and similar sources. They are very well selected and, unlike so many other incidental pictures in books on cookery, they are actually given meaningful captions.<br /><br />Ms. Black and the authors of  `Pleyn Delit' take almost exactly the same approach to translating their recipes from old English and identifying the sources of the original text. The recipe translations are equally fine in both books while the scholarly method of citing sources is equally dismal. I simply do not understand these authors use of a plainly obscure method for connecting source in the bibliography to the text in the main part of the book. I am certain these Brits and Canadians use the same scholarly conventions as we Yanks as codified in things like the `Chicago Manual of Style'. This little quibble is for the scholars among us.<br /><br />The most serious lapse in Ms. Black's book compared to `Pleyn Delit' is in the fact that the latter book has a much more interesting collection of recipes that a modern amateur cook would really find interesting. The very first recipe in `The Medieval Cookbook' is for Frumenty, a simple porridge of cracked wheat, water, stock, and salt with an optional addition of eggs and saffron. The second is Girdle `Breads' which is an unleavened, saffron coloured biscuit of flower, lard, and salt with no leavening. The third recipe is for grilled steaks brushed with either verjuice (an ur-vinegar made from specially grown grapes) or juice from Seville oranges. The fourth recipe is for rabbit. While these four recipes, taking up seven pages of the book are all very interesting from an historical point of view, it makes the book less valuable as a source for modern cooks who may want a good source for a medieval theme menu. To be sure, thereare recipes in this book that are worth making today, but `Pleyn Delit' is a better source for actual cooking.<br /><br />I am very happy to see that the two books agree almost exactly on the use of ingredients and techniques. If you have an interest in history in general and culinary scholarship in particular, get both books. If you are only interested in a source for recipes, get `Pleyn Delit'. It is authentic and a richer source of interesting recipes.are recipes in this book that are worth making today, but `Pleyn Delit' is a better source for actual cooking.<br /><br />I am very happy to see that the two books agree almost exactly on the use of ingredients and techniques.

Suspect Generalizations	`Fork It Over' by Alan Richman, with his eleven times winning a James Beard Foundation award and his new position as Dean of Culinary Journalism, struck me as a likely addition to the great works of culinary essays from the likes of Jeffrey Steingarten or James Villas, especially as Richman, like Steingarten and Villas, is a culinary columnist at a national magazine. Unfortunately, the subtitle of the volume, `The Intrepid Adventures of a Professional Eater' pretty much tell it all. Richman's book is almost entirely about eating both at home and in restaurants.<br /><br />Richman is almost proud of the fact that he does not cook and doesn't really know how to cook. This means, among other things, that he does no articles like Steingarten's investigation into the techniques of tender and flaky pie crust or like Villas' surveys of major Southern dishes such as Brunswick stew, cheese straws, or pimento cheese spread. This, in itself, is not enough to consider Richman's essays inferior. Authoritative evaluation of appeals to the senses such as sculpture, song, and spaghetti sauce requires a critical experience of many, many different examples of these products and knowledge of the opinions of many other people who have acquired similar experiences. Mozart's operas are great, far greater than his contemporary Salieri, because thousands of richly experienced ears and minds have heard and thought about these works and have found them great when compared to all other operas. So, while mathematician and musician and chess master all do their best work at an early age because their intellectual engine needs an athlete's stamina, an artist and a philosopher and a critic does their best work later in life because their intellectual mill needs lots of experiences and the time to rank and compare these experiences.<br /><br />Richman has the years of experience and the years spent thinking about food, although unlike Villas, his professional involvement with food does not go back to his college years. Rather it began about 14 years ago when sportswriter Richman took on a culinary assignment around 1990 and turned this into a full time column for his Montreal paper. Of course, as with every other living breathing person on this planet, he has food experiences and memories that go back to early childhood, where he was blessed with a traditional Jewish mother who was passionate about food and cooking. Unfortunately, unlike Jim Villas' mother, Richman's mother specifically avoided teaching little Alan anything about cooking.<br /><br />Richman's experience with food and restaurants lead to many acutely perceptive and interesting observations about specific restaurants. I am especially pleased that as a native of Philadelphia, he has much to say about the two ends of Philadelphia's culinary spectrum, cheese steaks and `Le Bec-Fin'. With the reputation of this restaurant's chef, Georges Perrier in Philly, I am always surprised he receives so little attention in the national culinary press that dotes on Charlie Trotter, Eric Ripert, Frank Stitt, Patrick O'Connell, and Rick Tramonto. I am especially interested in his opinions of the very famous international culinary figures such as Paul Bocuse. According to Richman, the Michelin guide seems to be treating the great Bocuse in much the same way the Golf press treats Tiger Woods long after his game has fallen from it's glorious heights. And, as culinary quality is an aesthetic evaluation rather than a numeric golf score, Bocuse has probably been getting away with this for a much longer time. Richman's picture of Bocuse's Lyon restaurant is clearly a portrait of a venue running on its laurels rather than on consistently high quality. The surprise of the piece is that unlike Emeril Lagasse, who probably spends less than a week in any one of his far flung restaurant kitchens, Paul Bocuse was actually present at his restaurant and appeared to be playing the traditional role of expediter now and again inthe course of Richman's meal. A similar very interesting observation was when Richman was instructed by a French culinary teacher that it was perfectly OK to wash mushrooms in water instead of carefully rubbing them with a towel or brushing them with a cute little brush. Every Richman observation of this sort is worth its weight in gold, as we, dear reader, simply do not have access to the venues Richman visits on a regular basis.<br /><br />Like Villas and Steingarten (most especially like Villas), Richman has strong opinions about his subject. This is not a bad thing in an essayist. In fact, if a writer of opinion did not have strong opinions, it is hard to see why we would bother spending any time reading their stuff. One often does not realize what their opinions on a subject may be until they encounter the contrary opinion.<br /><br />Where Richman gets into trouble is when he offers us generalizations. One generalization which I felt was especially suspect was his claim that the most influential chef in the United states was not James Beard, Andre Soltner, Alice Waters, Wolfgang Puck, Charley Trotter or... Jean-Louis Palladin, but `Le Bernardin' founder Gilbert Le Coze. This statement has two problems. One is that I thing a major case could be made for Alice Waters or several others on Richman's list over Le Coze. Another is that James Beard was not a chef. He was much more like Julia Child who Richman specifically identifies as a very influential non-chef. Another example of a doubtful generalization is the claim that chef's mothers do not cook at the stove at the back of the restaurant. I will only partially excuse Richman, as I suspect the statement is over two years old, before we all met Mama DeSpirito in Rocco's `The Restaurant'.<br /><br />I would give Mr. Richman five stars if I had never read Villas or Steingarten or Behr or Thorne or even Robb Walsh, but I'm afraid I have to warn you, dear reader, that Mr. Richman's generalizations need to be taken with a pinch of salt.<br /><br />Entertaining read with useful information.in in the course of Richman's meal.

Great Read and Eats	`Rick & Lanie's Excellent Kitchen Adventures' by Rick Bayless and his daughter is the third kids oriented cookbook I have reviewed and I am very pleased that I gave the earlier two books by Emeril Lagasse and Rachael Ray only four stars, as this volume by Bayless and daughter has really shown us how such a book should be done.<br /><br />To be sure, Bayless and daughter have done the book where the child is a mid-teenaged daughter who has been around the cooking all her life of a world-class teaching chef. Therefore, the book does not address all the important safety issues involved when you put kids into the most dangerous room in the house. But, this is definitely a book with which a cooking minded teenager could connect. That is, if the kid is a good reader, this is the book you want to give them.<br /><br />The book is made doubly interesting in that the Bayless family are great travelers and have a long and interesting history of family in the food service industry. This sets up one of the two main themes of the book by setting each chapter in a different location around the world, some of which are very familiar to the Bayless clan and some of which are being seen for the first time.<br /><br />The five venues are a combination of the obvious and the unexpected. The first is (big surprise) a trip to the southern highlands of Mexico and the Oaxaca valley which is one of Bayless' favorite parts of his favorite country. This chapter is spiced up by a side trip to Peru and an essay in ceviche recipes. The second location, small town Oklahoma may be a big surprise to most of us until Bayless tells us the story of his parents who ran a very successful barbecue restaurant in Capitol Hill, Oklahoma. The highlight of this chapter is Bayless' attempt to write out his parents' recipes from the `Hickory House' restaurant with very mixed results when his family gathered together to make the recipes from paper rather than from memory. The third destination is France, almost as predictable as the trip to Mexico. This chapter is spiced up with culinary side trips to Italy and Ireland. The fourth venue, Morocco and southern Spain is not to surprising to foodies, as the Moroccan cuisine is one of the most distinctive centers of Mediterranean cuisine next to Italy and Provence, especially after the attention paid to it by Paula Wolfert's books. The fifth venue, Thailand, with side trips to Japan and Hong Kong are only a surprise in that Thai cuisine is about as different from Mexico as you can get. There is not even the distant connection in play between Japan and the West Coast of Latin America that fertilized the development of ceviche.<br /><br />The main format of each chapter is that Rick introduces each locale with a relatively long narrative of why this venue was chosen and the family's general reaction to both the familiar and the unfamiliar. This is followed by a similarly long take on the same location and events by Lanie. And, Lanie provides a very clear counterpoint to her father's take on things. She clearly did not show the same enthusiasm for raw fish and goat barbacoa, a classic dish of southern Mexico. Both speakers do a great favor to the reader in picturing all the ups AND downs of their travels. One of the most surprising events was the failure of a world class chef and his food experienced family to recreate his parents' recipes from Bayless interpretations of these dishes. On the other hand, one of the most gratifying experiences is when Lanie makes a very difficult mole with no help from dad, and the result is very successful.<br /><br />Each recipe is also presented with a headnote from Rick, followed by Lanie's take on the same recipe. An important aspect of all these recipes is that, on the one hand, none of the recipes are simplified for the adolescent amateur. On the other hand, the recipes are not pictured as the very best exemplar of the dish. The `Hickory House' cole slaw recipes are a perfect case in point.The recipes are not important because they are the greatest cole slaw recipes around, they are important to a family which produced a great chef who writes about them as part of his legacy. Therefore, this is a cookbook that is meant as much or more for reading as for cooking. But that doesn't mean the recipes here are not worth your effort.<br /><br />There are a lot of recipes for classic comfort food here. In addition to the cole slaws, there are great recipes for biscuits, chocolate cake, guacamole, pasta with both marinara sauce and pasta with a pesto sauce, crepes, truffles, gazpacho, paella, potstickers, poached salmon, and potato leek soup.<br /><br />This is by far my first choice for a first cookbook to be given to a teenager or near teenager with an interest and a talent for cooking. Bayless and clan are far more successful in conveying a passion for cooking than most of the cute moves by other writers. I think Lagasse and Ray are just a little less successful in that they are writing with a voice for very young readers, except that this material will be interpreted by adults for the youngsters. Thus, the material will not hold the adult's interest long enough to involve the kids. Ray and Lagasse have done good books, but Bayless has done something better.<br /><br />Highly recommended for all foodies, teenage and above.in point.

Hieatt, Brenda Hosington, and Sharon Butler, all Canadian Ph.D. professional historians, is a scholarly book of very old Western European recipes translated into modern English, modern measurements, and readily available ingredients. Unlike several recent books by Francine Segan on recipes of Shakespeare's time and recipes of ancient Greece and Rome, this is a genuinely scholarly book with much less flash and much more exposition on how recipes were translated from an old English more familiar to Chaucer's pilgrims than 21st century foodies.<br /><br />One can easily wonder what possible use such a book would be to members of the Food Network generation who do not happen to have any interest in medieval studies. How can one possibly appreciate a cuisine with no tomatoes, potatoes, chilis, corn, or string beans? Well, there are a few things a nonscholar foodie can get from this book.<br /><br />First, it is an excellent source of recipes for entertaining to a Middle Ages theme. I can easily imagine that after a few years of running through food themes from Provence, Tuscany, Asian Georgia, Lebanon, New Delhi, Saigon, Kyoto, Hong Kong, and Kiev, one can suddenly find themselves at a loss for something new.<br /><br />Second, for the somewhat more adventurous, who happen to have a green thumb or some nearby friendly greengrocers with an eye to the unusual, there is the opportunity to try unusual herbs and greens, some of which the authors cannot imagine why they have fallen out of favor. In an environment where foodies are searching out nettles and pig's jowls, people will be more than happy to find new scavenger hunt targets such as borage and sorrel.<br /><br />Third, these recipes are generally very easy, which is not too hard to understand, as the job of collecting the ingredients required a lot more work than a quick trip to the local megamart.<br /><br />Fourth, these recipes are great for people who are very fond of eggs, nuts, old grains, game meats, and `garbage'. `Garbage' happens to mean odd pieces of flesh that are perfectly edible, but with only a small amount of edible meat such as chicken heads and giblets.<br /><br />Lastly, the old English vocabulary is really funny to modern eyes. The use of `garbage' is just a sample of the fun one can find in the shifts in word meanings that pop up in these recipe and ingredient names.<br /><br />All of these delights are available in a very nicely inexpensive paperback from the University of Toronto.<br /><br />Be aware that the recipe translations are not literal, and the authors make no claim to doing literal translations, as they have clearly proclaimed in their subtitle. They often reverse steps, as when vegetables are diced before being cooked rather than after, as specified in the original recipe. And, recipes are written in a modern style in that prep instructions are given with the ingredients rather than in the procedure.<br /><br />My only objection to this book is in their technique for citing the sources of their recipes. There is no explanation for the method of citing sources, so I assume it is a commonly accepted English / Canadian scholarly tradition, but, as this is a scholarly book with value to non-scholars, I found the method very annoying. Once I caught onto the method, it was still difficult for me, a person trained in various academic arcana, to track down many of the references. If the authors do a third edition, creating a foodie friendly method of references would be a big improvement.<br /><br />A very nice and very fresh foodie resource for a very reasonable price.

If you are willing to slog through a little old English and some scholarly garnishes, you will enjoy this book. <br />	2004-11-17

Good, not Great	`Rocco's Italian American' by Rocco DiSpirito, his mother, Nicolina DiSpirito, and freelance writer Nina Lalli screams CELEBRITY CHEF Cookbook with the number of pages dedicated to current and historical snapshots of the principle authors, Rocco and Mama. This book was also almost a certainty after the featured role of Mama's meatballs in the two Mark Burnett `The Restaurant' reality shows. You just knew that there was a book in the works that featured a recipe for these meatballs.<br /><br />Rocco's principle premise for these recipes is that `Italian-American' cuisine is no less genuine and involves no compromises of `genuine' Italian cooking because it is not exactly the same as that done in Campagnia or Apulia or Lazio or Tuscany or the Veneto. In fact, Rocco claims to have very little knowledge of native Italian cuisine compared to Marcella Hazan or Food Network colleague Mario Batali. I really have no difficulty whatsoever accepting Rocco's position here, and, neither to a lot of respected cookbook authors, as such leading names as Lydia Bastianich and John Mariani have written important books on Italian-American cuisine.<br /><br />Before the book gets to the recipes, it spends the better part of seventy pages giving us brief memoirs from both Mamma and Rocco. As Nicolina can write neither English nor Italian, I am sure that one of Ms. Lalli's principle jobs was to transcribe and edit Mamma's oral history. While Mamma concentrates on the truly difficult childhood due to poverty of their family in 1930's Italy, followed by the premature death of her father, Rocco's story concentrates on his experiences and enthusiasm for food starting at a very early age. Both stories are interesting, but they lack the kind of spark that enlivens the best memoirs of childhood and the struggle to survive in difficult circumstances. Unlike tales of childhood memories of Jacques Pepin in `The Apprentice' and of Gennaro Contaldo in `Passione', there is practically no art and little intellectual interest in these stories. Rocco has done very little to repair the opinion I formed of him in the course of viewing the two `The Restaurant' shows where he was seen as a self-absorbed, inept manager who probably lied and certainly acted petty in dealings with his financial backer. Not that his backer was a model of probity, Rocco did more to create drama for the camera than he did to rescue the fate of his `Rocco's on 22nd' restaurant. He tried to play to the house like Emeril or Wolfgang without the business sense both of these men seem to maintain.<br /><br />Since there are several important books out on the `Italian-American' cuisine, it is very easy to evaluate Rocco and Mama's recipes against an independent standard. The obvious place to start is with Mamma's meatballs. But, to make this recipe, you need `Mamma's sauce' made primarily with Red Pack tomato puree, sugar, chicken stock, garlic, onions, and tomato paste. I confess I find this sauce a weak entry compared to Mario Batali's basic sauce which uses whole tomatoes, carrots instead of sugar, and no stock, and can be completed in about half the time, 45 instead of 90 minutes. Mamma's meatballs themselves are very similar to my favorite recipe in `Italian Classics' by `Cooks Illustrated' except that instead of chicken stock, it uses buttermilk or yogurt and instead of bread crumbs, it uses torn white bread. Against this standard, I find nothing special in Mamma's recipe. Rocco's Puttanesca recipe is also nothing special when measured against `Cooks Illustrated' and other models I've seen. It's weakest point is that Rocco requires that you use 2 cups of Mama's Marinara which takes 90 minutes to make plus 20 minutes of cooking for the Puttanesca itself. All other recipes are self-contained, starting from pantry ingredients and often taking little more than 15 minutes from prep to finish instead of Rocco's 20 minutes of cooking. Rocco's spaghetti Carbonara is an odd mixture of influences. He is cooking Italian-AMERICAN, but he is insisting on pancetta that I suspect was hard to get even by most poor Italian-Americans in a Queens Latino neighborhood. On the other hand, this is a Roman dish and Rocco is using Parmigiano-Reggiano instead of including the more traditional Pecorino Romano.<br /><br />On the other hand, Rocco's recipe for Caesar Salad is about as true to tradition as you can get with raw egg and anchovies and all. I especially liked Rocco's recipe for Mama's everyday bread prepared using the well technique in much the same way as one may make fresh pasta. This yeast recipe is both very simple and economical with the use of yeast, unlike Jamie Oliver's recipe using three packets of yeast. Both are good, Rocco's is simpler.<br /><br />Rocco and his designers at publisher Hyperion have chosen a very odd arrangement for the color pictures depicting various cooking techniques, in that they have put them all together in a single `rotogravure' section in the back of the book. I'm sure this was done to maintain a very nicely modest list price, but it doesn't help the cook who is trying to follow a procedure and must switch back and forth to make any sense of the text and the pictures together.<br /><br />The final section on `The Italian-American Pantry' is pretty good. I did find it odd that there are no stock recipes in the book, and no comment about using canned stock. Especially missing is a recipe for a mushroom stock, although several recipes call for this ingredient and I have never seen this ingredient in my local megamart.<br /><br />Aside from the inconvenient picture layout, this is a very good autobiographical cookbook by a very talented professional chef, but if I were to want a reference on `Italian-American' cuisine, I might prefer Lydia Bastianich's much larger and more professional offering on the subject. If I wanted Italian home cooking, I think `Eleanora's Kitchen' by Eleanora Scarpetta may be just as good.<br /><br />Interesting and worthwhile if you don't already own a lot of Italian cookbooks..

455604:US	39134375	R3IVZM770CQV3A	0375702024	537031843	The Man Who Ate Everything	Books	5	57	64	N	Y	A Leading Contemporary Culinary Essayist. Great Read	`The Man Who Ate Everything' is written by Jeffrey Steingarten, credited with being the food critic for `Vogue' magazine, belongs to a very exclusive club of American culinary columnists whose present leading light is James Villas and whose biggest star was M.F.K. Fisher. Oddly, I always had trouble appreciating Fisher's writing, while I simply can't get enough of either Villas or Steingarten. And, of these two, I am leaning to Steingarten if anyone asked me for a `good book on food'.<br /><br />Steingarten's greatest strength as a writer to the amateur foodie is his ability to put himself in our position vis-&agrave;-vis the experts. He never pictures himself as an expert like Harold McGee on food science or Mario Batali on Italian cuisine or Nick Malgieri on baking or even like gifted neophyte Alton Brown on cooking technique. Unlike these professionals and teachers, Steingarten's shtick is how he gets there, not what he as learned after arriving. He is the culinary everyman's surrogate who can travel to Venice to visit Marcella Hazan for an education in cooking and eating Venetian seafood and have cooking expert Marian Cunningham fly in to teach him how to make a perfect piecrust.<br /><br />Steingarten's introduction which gives an explanation of the book's title makes one seriously wonder what our dear reporter did before he was tapped to write on food for `Vogue'. His list of culinary aversions could fill several major cookbooks, and have. One wonders if Steingarten had any food related assignment before he embarked on reforming his tastes to fit his `Vogue' assignment. While I sometimes fear that my sense of taste is remarkably dull compared to those of talented chefs, my compensation is that there is literally nothing I will not eat and there are very few things I will avoid. In contrast, pre-Vogue Steingarten had aversions to kimchi, dill, swordfish, anchovies, miso, falafel, clams, and all Greek food. The introductory essay is the story of how Steingarten overcame all of these aversions except to the one for eating insects.<br /><br />This first essay is a perfect exemplary of Steingarten's style. It may have been easier to say these are the aversions he overcame, but it is much more fun to describe how he overcame them. This is not to say that the book is all about the tourist to the banal. Steingarten is well prepared for most of these trips and we, along with the author, learn much in the course of his trials and errors.<br /><br />While this is not a book about food science a la Robert Wolke's `What Einstein Told His Chef', there is a lot of scientific method afoot in many of the essays. My favorite is Steingarten's excursion into the world of the perfect piecrust. As dedicated `Good Eats' fans know from Alton's episode on pie crusts, the building of the perfect pie crust involves resolving two contrary properties, flakiness and tenderness while doing battle with properties of wheat flour gluten which work so well when creating bread, but which, it is said, cause all sorts of undesirable characteristics in pie crusts, known to the French as `pate brisee'. Before expert Cunningham flies in from California, Steingarten surveys the entire body of writing in English on what makes a good pie crust and comes up with a perfect procedure involving a whiz of the flour in a food processor with half the shortening followed by a careful folding in of the remaining shortening and a hint of water to bring everything together. The result is a disaster.<br /><br />The lesson from this attempt is that that villain gluten is not so irrelevant to a pastry crust as some writers would have you believe. When Madame Cunningham arrives on the scene, she whips up a dandy piecrust in about as much time as it may take you to write about it. Ms. Cunningham then flies off before Herr Steingarten has gotten everything about her technique down on paper. This leads to many transcontinental telephone calls while our Jeffrey perfects his fingering with the dough and gets everything down in black and white. The really ironic outcome of this exercise and the resulting essay is that Steingarten's description of the complete procedure takes SEVEN (7) full pages. And, that is with a recipe using shortening rather than my preferred butter. I may not follow his procedure, but I certainly enjoyed his journey needed to get him to that result.<br /><br />Like Villas, it is quite likely that you will find much in Steingarten's writing with which to disagree. This is part of the fun. For example, he can find little to like about roasted turkey, the national American holiday meal. Since `Gourmet' and `Bon Appetit' and Nigella Lawson (among others) are still cooking up new recipes for the maligned bird, I suspect Steingarten has not talked anyone out of eating their gigantic poultry, but it is certainly fun listening to him rant about it and, as Ms. Lawson so aptly points out, tradition may be as much or more important than the turkey's culinary virtues.<br /><br />As we are approaching the dark evenings of winter, I definitely recommend this book as a classic of American culinary writing. It is our Yankee answer to B'rer Villas' writing about food from the Southern perspective. As an essayist, Steingarten has the eye and mind of Stephen Jay Gould and the wit and wordsmithing (and similarly strong prejudices) of H. L. Menchen, my two favorite American essayists.<br /><br />Highly recommended.ring with the dough and gets everything down in black and white.

456359:US	39134375	R1XD29B6O3F1WM	1400060613	328329726	Tru: A Cookbook from the Legendary Chicago Restaurant	Books	5	41	45	N	Y	Excellent Restaurant Book for Foodies and Pros	`Tru' by Rick Tramonto, pastry partner Gale Gand and writer Mary Goodbody is a book purely for foodies and professionals. The sure signs of this are the fact that the recipes are presented almost exactly as they are done in the restaurant, with all the special ingredients and equipment a home cook is not likely to have available such as foaming canisters, caviar, truffles, and presentation dishes which are custom made for the Tru restaurant.<br /><br />This does not mean this is a poor book. It only means that its audience is limited. It is more limited than even Thomas Keller's two restaurant books in that the `French Laundry' cookbook gives more insights into the phenomenology of eating and very high end food handling and preparation techniques. The new `Bouchon' cookbook gives a similar master class in technique along with a nearly definitive reference on Bistro dishes.<br /><br />Tramonto's book is primarily a biography of his five (5) year old restaurant in Chicago and a synopsis of Tramonto and Gand's professional career together. As Gale Gand is actually the more famous of the two due to her Food Network show `Sweet Dreams' and her light, very accessible small books on simple desserts, it is genuinely interesting to us Food Network junkies to know the background behind some of her TV recipe stories. In the course of the authors' acknowledgments, background chapters, and recipe headnotes, Tramonto seems to mention just about every major culinary figure on the planet if they in any way contributed to his business plan, culinary inspiration, or specific recipe. While this may seem like gratuitous name dropping, I actually find this a definite asset to an essay on culinary excellence. This is also just another sign that this book is written for professionals and foodies. Two years ago, references to the Troisgras brothers and to Michel Bras would leave me cold. Now, I can take Tramonto's Michel Bras inspired recipe and compare it with Bras' recipes in his own book. There is some subtly gratuitous selfbackpatting as when the author cites instructions to the wait staff to inhibit breakage, as a single broken piece of dishware will incur a sizable replacement cost.<br /><br />Tramonto is clearly aiming for the kind of recognition given to a very small group of American chefs headed by Thomas Keller and Charlie Trotter. A quick look at the recipe chapters tells you this at a glance. These are Hors d'oeuvres'; `Amuse-Bouche'; Cold Appetizers; Hot Appetizers; Foie Gras; Soups; Fish and Seafood; Meat and Poultry; Game; The Cheese Course; Dessert Amuse Bouche; Desserts; Petits Fours; and Basic Recipes. This selection is a clear indication that the name of the game at Tru is `Tasting Menus', a relatively large number of small dishes all chosen to go together by the chefs.<br /><br />I assure you Tramonto's recipes have a richer, more distinctive taste than preparations of similar dishes at your local country club dining room. If I had any doubt that this was possible, I lost those doubts when I made Thomas Keller's recipe for Mac and Cheese with wild mushrooms from `Bouchon'. There was actually subtlety in the taste of the Bechamel sauce carefully infused with onion, pepper, and nutmeg before being strained to smoothness and enriched with Emmentaler cheese. Similarly, Tramonto takes a normally complicated preparation such as lobster bisque and garnishes it with a rather complicated ceviche and prepares it with brandy and sherry in addition to the normal white wine ingredient.<br /><br />Dessert recipes by Ms. Gand are consistent with the savory chapters in that many ingredients are unusual and procedures are fairly involved. These are not you typical Gale Gand `short + sweet' recipes. One simple amuse-bouche recipe calls for `Perfection' tangerines and basil blossoms. You can substitute clementines or pedestrian tangerines and do without the basil blossoms, but that is not how they do it at Tru.<br /><br />Unlike celebrated culinarybooks by Tom Colicchio and John Ash, `Tru' does not go out of its way to highlight pedagogically interesting portions of recipes where new techniques are revealed. Yet, the book is a treasure chest of culinary techniques and unusual ingredients. You just have to read carefully to locate them. One general technique hidden in a recipe is Gand's method for roasting lemons to be used in a `lemonade shooter'. This is also the very first book I have read which uses the foaming technique pioneered by Spanish chef Ferran Adria. The book also makes use of a juicer to produce smooth fruit and vegetable juices in several recipes. The book is also the very first mention I have seen of the ingredient truffle flour.<br /><br />Every savory entr&eacute;e includes a detailed wine recommendation supplied by Tru's sommelier. While I am not a wine aficionado, I believe these suggestions are better than average, as they always are explaining the selection and often give an `everyday' choice plus a premium choice. Almost everything I said about the book in general is not true of the `Basic Recipes' chapter. Here we have detailed recipes for thirty-eight pantry items including twelve (12) stocks, five (5) glaces, and eleven (11) sweet and savory flavored oils. If one does not already own Keller's `Bouchon', this chapter makes this book worth its price to an amateur cook. There are some very common items such as beef, chicken, and fish stock and simple syrup and brioche, but there are also some uncommon items such as mushroom stock, lobster oil, and Beurre Monte. If you have ever made chestnut soup with a vegetarian guest, you can see the value of a mushroom stock.<br /><br />This is a book of excellent recipes that I believe only amateur foodies and professionals will fully appreciate. The book's photography is sound, but not out of the ordinary. I found it odd that the author discusses his custom kitchen design at length and gives us no photos of this facility. The average list price of $35 is just about right for this good but not great book.ted culinary books by Tom Colicchio and John Ash, `Tru' does not go out of its way to highlight pedagogically interesting portions of recipes where new techniques are revealed.

Nigella Lawson's `Feast' is as much a feast for the mind as it is a resource for feasts of the body. Ms. Lawson loves to write about cooking and she does it very, very well. Even without knowing that she does weekly columns for the very well written New York Times, one can tell that unlike her equally famous Anglo culinarian Jamie Oliver, she does not dictate her books into a recorder to be transcribed by an editor.<br /><br />I got Ms. Lawson's latest volume to both review it and to expect that it will provide a good resource for Thanksgiving and Christmas meals, a resource which will survive more holiday winters than the molding stack of `Gourmet', `Bon Appetit', and `Martha Stewart Living' issues from holidays past. My slight hesitation based on a relatively poor opinion of her `Forever Summer' volume was overcome by Ms. Lawson's cheeky appearance on the David Letterman show where she upstaged Dave with a quip which I suspect will appear in best of collections for years to come.<br /><br />Speaking of Ms. Stewart, many have been nominated as successors to Martha's mantle of domestic arbiter of taste, but I think Ms. Lawson should be considered clearly ahead of the pack as an improvement over Ms. Stewart's take on food and cooking. In lieu of a clever metaphor, I will simply state that while Martha Stewart and staff gives solid advice on the basics and are almost always sound on the facts, very little real personality and passion shines through the slightly make believe feeling one gets from Martha's persona. Nigella Lawson is both a very real, very genuine intellect who takes us beyond competence to really caring about making a good meal for friends and family.<br /><br />Ms. Lawson's chatter and recipes for Thanksgiving are a perfect case in point. After noting that as a Brit, Thanksgiving is `not her party, but she is always happy to be invited'. And, to clearly justify her invitation, she states that Thanksgiving, Christmas, and other holiday meals are very much about tradition, and it would be foolish to deal with recipes that do not follow these traditions. So, she gives us two recipes for roasted turkey (one traditional and one with a brined bird), two recipes for turkey gravy, three recipes for poultry stuffing, a recipe for baked ham, a recipe for goose with a mashed potato stuffing, a `bohemian' roast goose, and a red cabbage recipe. The side dishes include pancetta wrapped sausages; maple roasted parsnips; perfect roast potatoes; sweet potatoes with marshmallows (oh my); Brussels sprouts with chestnuts, pancetta, and parsley; green bean and lemon casserole; bread sauce and cranberry sauce.<br /><br />All this goodness would be wasted if the recipes are not good, and I believe they are very, very good. The attention to cooking details surpasses virtually all other works I have seen on this subject. About a year ago, a Sheila Lukins book, `Celebrate' with a very similar agenda was published with menus covering over thirty celebratory events with lots of recipes, drink recommendations, and listening recommendations, but the book was primarily a good, easy reference for people who simply wanted to get a few easy tips for fleshing out events for family and friends. The recipes were sound, but simply not very deep. Ms. Lawson, on the other hand, gives us turkey-roasting instructions which look like they were copied from a book by Thomas Keller. The procedure for Lawson's turkey is almost identical to Keller's instructions for roasting a chicken in his new book `Bouchon'. Similarly, her instructions for the `perfect roast potatoes' are both careful and distinctive, from the very specific instructions on parboiling the spuds to the method for cutting them to get the best crunchy outside and pillowy inside. The goose fat for the roasting is a nice touch too.<br /><br />While Ms. Lawson only covers 22 occasions to Ms. Lukins' 35, Nigella pretty much covers just about every common event you can imagine. Joining Thanksgivingand Christmas are menus and recipes for New Year, Vegetarian celebrations, Valentine's Day, Easter, Passover, Breakfast celebrations, `Kitchen Feasts', `Kiddiefeast', celebratory cookies, chocolate birthday cakes, `A Georgian Feast', EID (Eid-ul-Fitr, a Muslim breaking of fasting feast), Ultimate Feasts (read `Last Supper'), Halloween, Rosh Hashanah, `A Venetian Feast', Festival of Lights, Partytime, Midnight Feast, and Funeral Feast. In addition to digging deeper into culinary wisdom than Ms. Lukins or Ms. Stewart, Lawson is much more ecumenical in covering Christian, Jewish, and Moslem celebrations not to mention coverage of menus from Russia and Venice.<br /><br />I should also say that while Ms. Lawson makes no compromises with culinary excellence, her recipes require very few difficult or unusual methods or ingredients. Comparing her Georgian recipe for walnut crescents with a Rick Rodgers essay from Austrian coffee houses shows that Lawson gives us a much simpler method to reach a very similar result.<br /><br />Nigella Lawson and Jamie Oliver share a passion for food and for communicating with food, which have few if any peers among us Yanks. Ms. Lawson says `I believe absolutely that the only way to live is to throw yourself right at it'. No holding back here, I'd say. She is a culinary Al Franken to Oliver's Robin Williams. Just as Franken is a very intellectual humorist, Ms. Lawson warms the scholar in my soul by giving full credit to those people from whom she has borrowed. Food talk is invariably a discussion and not a monologue.

460204:US	39134375	R22ICPDHJ6UM1J	1580083250	536460828	The Great Ceviche Book	Books	4	15	17	N	Y	Excellent Book on a Subject which Deserves a better format	`the great CEVICHE book' by Douglas Rodriguez presents what may be the second great native American food style, after barbecue. While both styles of cooking have serious non-American influences, both are also certifiably born and raised in the New World.<br /><br />Ceviche is a method of `finishing' seafood with citrus or other edible acid such as vinegar. Language leaves me at a loss here, as I am not fond of saying the acidic marinade `cooks' the fish as no heat is involved, yet there is no other word which quite seems to fit.<br /><br />Douglas Rodriguez is an experienced cookbook author, as this is his third book, appearing in the 10 Speed Press' series of tall and skinny books on culinary topics. I have seen three of these titles and this is better than Mark Miller's book on salsa, but not as good as David Lebovitz' book on chocolate. I confess the relative quality has a lot to do with how much interesting history there is to give about each subject. My opinion of the chocolate book also has a lot to do with the fact that of the three, it has the most background material meant for the easy chair rather than the kitchen counter. I simply do not see what 10 Speed Press was trying to do with this long, skinny format with a binding which works against propping it open and following a recipe on one of its pages. The publisher would have been much more intelligent to put the material in a squarish volume with spiral or plastic rib binding similar to what Random House did with Paula Deen's `The Lady and Sons' cookbooks.<br /><br />In spite of all that grousing about the format and binding, I must recommend Rodriguez' book because there are simply very few books on this most interesting subject, and even fewer good books. And, Rodriguez' material in this book is very good. As with Lebovitz' book on chocolate, there is a lot of introductory material on the origin and homeland of this culinary technique. In a nutshell, modern ceviche seems to have been developed by a meeting of Peruvian and Ecuadorian fishermen's techniques with fish and citrus with Japanese immigrants' overlaying Japanese raw fish techniques.<br /><br />The book divides the world of ceviche dishes very neatly into the simple `tiraditos', dishes made with only one raw seafood protein and `mixtos', dishes made with two or more raw seafood proteins. To these two styles, the author adds recipes for side dishes that complement ceviche dishes. The author does not dwell on this aspect of this cuisine, but it should be evident that ceviche is very healthy, very easy, and relatively cheap. The hardest thing about this cuisine is finding a trustworthy source of fresh fish. Once you have that, virtually the entire cuisine reduces to variations on the fish plus five ingredient types. These are citrus, onion, salt, herbs, and chiles.

To these two styles, the author adds recipes for side dishes that complement ceviche dishes. The author does not dwell on this aspect of this cuisine, but it should be evident that ceviche is very healthy, very easy, and relatively cheap. The hardest thing about this cuisine is finding a trustworthy source of fresh fish. Once you have that, virtually the entire cuisine reduces to variations on the fish plus five ingredient types. These are citrus, onion, salt, herbs, and chiles.

Virtually the only other published practitioner of this discipline I know of is John Thorne. Both Thorne and Behr publish culinary newsletters and books from both contain enriched articles from their periodicals.  While Thorne typically deals with the anthropology and history of classic recipes, `The Artful Eater' material from Behr, subtitled `A Gourmet Investigates the Ingredients of Great Food', is a study of eighteen basic ingredients.<br /><br />In these articles, Behr investigates things that almost the entire culinary world either takes for granted or gets wrong. One of my favorite `unexamined principles' of the modern culinary liturgy is that the best way to shop is to buy produce in season at local farmers' markets. The problem with this statement is that the reasons why this is good idea are few and far between. It is common knowledge that corn on the cob starts turning sugar to starch the moment it is picked and that out of season tomatoes imported from the sunny south or from greenhouses are pale imitations of homegrown crops, but that is about it. Behr adds a third documented reason to buy locally with his essay on carrots. He points out that carrots grown in a warm climate such as Florida never develops the kind of sweetness so desirable in most recipes because the warm nights cause the stuff to be metabolized into sugar to pass into the warm night air. On top of this intelligence, he adds that carrots with the greens lopped off are actually more likely to retain moisture, as the plant may continue to respire moisture out of its green tops with no way to replenish the moisture from the root once the vegetable is out of the ground. Behr makes the warning doubly useful in cautioning us to investigate from where the farmers' market produce stand actually gets its goods. I am entirely with him on this point, as I am sure that my local large farmers' market gets many of their vegetables from Florida or California.<br /><br />The other seventeen subjects of Behr's articles are salt, tomatoes, mint, mussels, sorrel, Atlantic salmon, black pepper, country ham, bay leaves, traditional mustard preparations, roast beef, eggs, apples, cream, vanilla, English walnuts, and coffee.<br /><br />The article on mussels contains an example of the author's correcting a common misunderstanding. One belief about mussels is that they should be bought with their beards intact. Behr demonstrates that the presence or absence of the beard has nothing to do with the food quality of the mussel.<br /><br />The article on black pepper brings a great deal of knowledge about a very common but very commonly misunderstood family of spices. Only black and white and green pepper are related. The many other varieties of `pepper' such as red or pink are actually from an entirely different plant. Behr adds information about a wide range of other spices related to the pepper whose use has fallen into obscurity. Articles like this in the book are rich jumping off points for budding culinary scholars.<br /><br />The book contains very few recipes. There are 11 pages of them in all, in the back of the book, supplied more as a simple illustration of things in the main article rather than as a true `cookbook'. This book is primarily meant to be read. And, like Thorne and unlike that oracle of food scholarship, Harold McGee, Behr's articles are both informative AND enjoyable to read. While much of his information requires a fair amount of research to uncover, it is truly useful like the facts about carrots and mussels quoted above. This is entirely to be expected, as Behr makes his living selling his writing to non-professionals about food while McGee is primarily a source for professionals.<br /><br />While I am not in a position to check any of Behr's facts, as a former chemist, worker in pharmaceutical research, and a reasonably well read foodie, I found not a single statement in this book with which I had any grounds to disagree. I recommend this book to all fellow foodie readers out there. This is not `pseudoscholarly' work you will find in flashy books on the food of Shakespeare's era or of the ancients. This is the real deal. I also strongly recommend the updated list of sources. The book was revised in 2004, so all sources should be alive and kicking, just like you want your mussels.<br /><br />Very highly recommended.nd a reasonably well read foodie, I found not a single statement in this book with which I had any grounds to disagree.

463573:US	39134375	R3B4F99XSOTALG	0060192216	942609833	Vegetables Every Day: The Definitive Guide to Buying and Cooking Today's Produce With More Than 350 Recipes	Books	5	73	79	N	N	Great Reference for Vegetarians and Everyday Cooks	`Vegetables Every Day' is by Jack Bishop, a very intelligent craftsman of cookbooks similar to James Peterson, Molly Katzen, Rose Levy Beranbaum, and Pam Anderson. Each is skillful at creating very useful reference books on various aspects of cooking. And, it should be no surprise that both Bishop and Pam Anderson are current or past senior staffers at `Cooks Illustrated' magazine.<br /><br />It is a great treat to have two of these skillful authors both do excellent books on vegetables, and to have the two books done from two so different points of view that one will feel no pangs of waste by owning both. Bishop's book is certainly the more accessible of the two, as the material is presented in a very straightforwardly encyclopedic presentation. There are uniform articles on 66 different vegetables, a veritable celebration of the variety of vegetables available through part or all of the year round. Among these 66, there are the old favorites such as broccoli, carrots, celery, mushrooms, potatoes, tomatoes, and onions. Alongside these there are new favorites brought to our attention by hours of watching Mario Batali, Bobby Flay, and Jaime Oliver such as Artichokes, Broccoli Rabe, Cardoons, Celery Root, Dandelion Greens, Fava Beans, Fennel, Soybeans, Turnips, and Zucchini. At the far end of familiarity are Boniato, Burdock, Calabaza, Chayote, Jerusalem Artichokes, Kohlrabi, Malanga, Sorrel, Taro, and Yuca. These are the veggies which should be approached with one of my favorite Alton Brown `Good Eats' moments when he recommends that you walk into your megamart with fresh eyes on the lookout for unfamiliar products and investigate what can be done with these little gems.<br /><br />Bishop is not only intent on providing things to do with newly available produce, he is intent on making cooking all vegetables, especially the old standards with a new set of recipes to make them more interesting and to make cooking them more fun. One excellent case in point is asparagus that everyone either boils or steams and dresses with some creamy sauce. Since everyone already knows how to do this, Bishop doesn't bother to give recipes for these. Rather, his nine asparagus recipes include three roasting methods, a grilling recipe, two sautee recipes, a recipe with Chinese noodles, a recipe with a vinaigrette, and an asparagus frittata.<br /><br />Every article, regardless of how many recipes may be given, has the same seven (7) paragraphs in the introductory article. The first paragraph simply introduces you to the vegetable and gives you a general idea of the appeal and usability of the vegetable. The next paragraph on availability gives the best season for the produce and whether or not the vegetable is currently available year round in American markets. The third paragraph on selection gives us criteria for whether we want to pick up today's selection of a species or let it alone. The paragraph on storage is especially useful, as there is probably very little wisdom handed down from your Eastern European grandma on storing tomatillos, taro, or jicama or from your Mexican mom on dealing with arugula, bok choy, or burdock. The basic preparation paragraph can be simple for leafy greens or very complicated for artichokes. The very short section on best cooking methods is primarily useful for totally unfamiliar vegetables. A very useful last entry gives recipes on other vegetables in which the titular ingredient appears.<br /><br />One may not think there is anything controversial about vegetables, but you may be surprised, especially if you read Bishop's and Peterson's books side by side. On the matter of asparagus, Bishop prefers thin to medium thickness stalks and prefers not to peel them. Peterson prefers medium to thick stalks and strongly recommends peeling the stalks. To a certain extent, this is a matter of personal preference, but much of this difference comes from the fact that Peterson is a former restaurant chef / owner while there isno record in Bishop's biographical information that he ever worked in a restaurant kitchen. If time is less important than money, then Peterson's position is definitely the better. If time is at a premium, Bishop's position may be preferable. On almost all other issues, the two authors agree.<br /><br />One corollary of Bishop's objective in preparing this book is that this is not a reference for the most commonly prepared recipes. But, this is not universally true. While the traditional steaming or poaching methods for asparagus is absent, classic mashed potatoes and the traditional Greek salad with tomatoes are here. Bishop is certainly on the side of the gourmet when it comes to discussing tomatoes. He is in love with fresh homegrown tomatoes in July and August, but recommends canned `maters all other times of the year.<br /><br />One of the most enjoyable discoveries in Bishop's book is to find ways to treat certain vegetables in totally unexpected ways. Two cases are shallots and garlic. Both are most commonly thought of as herbs to enliven dishes where some other vegetable or protein is the main ingredient, but if you are willing to pay the price, shallots make a great main ingredient, not really much different in cost from, for example cippolini or wild mushrooms.<br /><br />In choosing between Bishop and Peterson, I find that Bishop is much better for the average cook who does not spend a lot of time reading cookbooks. The organization is much better for finding a good recipe for the veg that happened to be on special today. Peterson's book is much more oriented toward the foodie and the professional. It is organized more by method than by ingredient and it is much better at presenting instructions on difficult techniques such as cleaning an artichoke. Peterson has the one thing I miss the most in Bishop's book, which are good pictures of vegetables. Neither comes with the lyrics of Frank Zappa's `Ask Any Vegetable'.<br /><br />Very highly recommended as a vegetarian and general cook's reference for recipes and buying advice.there is no record in Bishop's biographical information that he ever worked in a restaurant kitchen.

465681:US	39134375	R37FYXENM1D5RS	0870113992	14984625	Japanese Cooking: A Simple Art	Books	5	40	43	N	N	Excellent Manual of Japanese Techniques	`Japanese Cooking A Simple Art' by prominent Japanese culinary educator Shizuo Tsuji belongs to a very select group of excellent national / regional cookbooks such as `Mastering the Art of French Cooking' by Julia Child, `Elements of Classic Italian Cuisine' by Marcella Hazan, and `From My Mexican Kitchen' by Diana Kennedy. The distinguishing feature of all four of these books plus a select few others is that they give an authoritative and relatively complete survey of provisions, equipment, principles, and techniques of their selected cuisine.<br /><br />In fact, Mr. Tsuji fits this archetype even better than some of the other titles in this group, especially since Diana Kennedy, for one, has written several volumes on Mexican cuisine, so the volume I cite is only her most recent and the one most dedicated to Mexican cooking techniques rather than simply recipes and regionality. In presenting the underlying principles of Japanese cooking, Mr. Tsuji's closest western writer is Ms. Hazan.<br /><br />Although the Japanese have gone much further in wrapping their cuisine and culinary techniques with the doctrines of religion, a student of Italian cuisine will tell you that the Abbruzis and the Sicilians and the Tuscans among others are no slouches when it comes to using food to celebrate life and spirituality. Mr. Tsuji tells us of the Japanese practice of formal dinners with as many as a dozen small dishes, yet the Abbruzis pull out even more stops when they call for at least thirty dishes for major celebratory banquets and the Sicilians who must have seven fishes in their Christmas Eve dinners.<br /><br />Western culinary experts have even put a lot of thought into the Japanese practice of small portions. A quick read of Thomas Keller's `The French Laundry Cookbook' will show that the Japanese have no monopoly on deep reflection on cooking.<br /><br />All of these comparisons are meant to show the prospective reader that as different as Japanese cuisine is from those of Western Europe and the New World, they both deal with the same act of preparing and eating food, and one can celebrate the similarities as much as one marvels at the differences.<br /><br />The author very cleverly ties together East and West by recruiting the great American culinary essayist M.F. K. Fisher to write the introduction. And, to insure that Ms. Fisher knew of what she spoke, he treated her to two weeks of eating the very best food Japan had to offer.<br /><br />This excellent book is divided into four sections. The first is the introduction by Ms. Fisher and the author's preface. The second section of 270 pages is comprised of expositions on the major equipment, ingredients, and techniques of Japanese cooking. The third section of 135 pages is a collection of recipes which the author says can be treated exactly like a Western cookbook where you can select a recipe according to your interest or whim and have fun with it. The fourth section is the appendices of American sources for Japanese provisions, a table of seasonal Japanese fish and substitution possibilities, and weights and measures. The color plates in the first section gives an excellent picture of Japanese provisions and plating illustrations.<br /><br />In the second section, `Part One', there is a chapter on `The Japanese Meal' which lays out the composition of the formal courses of a classic meal. This is followed by an excellent 50-page guide to Japanese ingredients. This is superior to any similar presentation I have seen in either number of foodstuffs discussed or in the depth of information given about each provision. Chapters follow this on Utensils and Knives. The chapter on knives is essential to Western novices to Japanese cooking, as Japanese knife styles are very different from our familiar French archetypes. In fact, one can probably divide the culinary world into those cuisines that use the Japanese style of knife versus those who use the French arsenal. I suspect truly expert knife skills can only be learned by observing and copying an expert. In fact, Mr. Tsuji says the teaching practice of `old school' Japanese master chefs is not to describe technique to apprentices, but to simply demonstrate and have the student imitate. Very Zen. Mr. Tsuji does give line drawings of many techniques, including ways to handle the major types of Japanese kitchen knives. This alone sets him apart from most other manuals and puts him in the company of the very best such as Ms. Child and Ms. Kennedy.<br /><br />Based on my very limited knowledge of Japanese cooking before reading this book, I believe the author has covered the whole spectrum of dishes, including stock making (dashi), soups, sashimi, grilling and pan frying, steaming, simmering, deep frying, salads, one pot cooking (hot pot), rice, sushi, noodles, pickling, sweets, tea, and sake.<br /><br />Given the size of the book, my guess is that the author just skims the surface of the full range of recipes, although I do believe he has covered the full range of Japanese techniques. There are excellent line drawings covering the dismemberment of just about every type of fish you may imagine. My only surprise was that the wok did not even make an appearance in this book. This book is authoritative enough for me to believe that the wok is much more a completely Chinese invention than it is a pan-Asian utensil.<br /><br />Very highly recommended to all students of world food.ect truly expert knife skills can only be learned by observing and copying an expert.

Recommended	`Last Chance to Eat' by Toronto culinary journalist Gina Mallet is an uncommon mix of memoir, culinary history, and polemic against the march of agribusiness and the resulting loss of important artisinal foods in the name of hygiene, often masking the interests of big businesses. It's an odd mix of Ruth Reichl's memoirs with Eric Schlosser's `Fast Food Nation' and Mort Rosenbloom's `A Goose in Toulouse'.<br /><br />First of all, the book is very engaging to read. Like Reichl, the author has had an interesting family and life, so her childhood stories are entertaining.<br /><br />Then, the book covers the history of several major food sources. These stories often amaze me when they show how recent (or how old) many major food developments have been. One interesting story is the breeding of beef cattle to yield an animal that would reach full market size in the shortest time. This is not a 20th century agribusiness development. It was done in the early 18th century in Scotland, before the American Revolution. A parallel development was the breeding of a cow that will produce a lot of milk. This story is directly connected to endangering a classic artisinal product, Normandy butter, produced from cows that give a very high butter fat milk. Unfortunately, these cows produce a very low volume of milk, so they are not profitable except to produce a high priced product.<br /><br />Finally, it pokes its nose into corners of international food business in politics that most people probably don't even know exist. Most food channel junkies know about the wards against importing raw milk products into the United States. The current often ignored law limits import of raw milk cheeses to those that have been aged for at least 60 days. While there is bootleg cheese importing and small family run raw milk cheese operations in the united states which violate this regulation, the prospect which is not well known is that there is an interest in changing the ban to prohibit all raw milk cheeses. I felt a distinct jolt when the author stated that that would ban the import into the US of Parmesano-Reggiano! I felt a distinct discomfort in the pit of my stomach over that one.<br /><br />The biggest surprise comes with the author's stories about the development of a food Codex that codifies how all food products are to be made worldwide. Although proceedings take place in Brussels, this is not just a European Union party. American representatives play a big part in the deliberations and the American reps are primarily representatives such as Kraft Foods employees who have a vested interest in putting down anything which will compete with American products.<br /><br />Other stories are equally dismal, such as the deep drop in the egg business in the 1970s when the awareness of cholesterol dawned on us and superficial studies gave the egg a bad rap because its role in the good cholesterol / bad cholesterol picture was not well understood. In the same essay, the author repeats many of Eric Schlosser's muckraking descriptions of production henhouses. The author's egg story is leavened with a great tale of her family's attempt to raise chickens in food rationed England just after World War II.<br /><br />Each of the five major essays on eggs, milk and cheese, beef, vegetable gardens, and fish combine personal observations with current and historical trends in food business. My only reservation about Ms. Mallet's polemical content is that unlike Schlosser's writing and the famous Rachel Carson book `Silent Spring', both of which Ms. Mallet quote, all of her warnings and charges are undocumented except by secondary sources rather than primary sources with notes giving chapter and verse on the sources. I believe Ms. Mallet is on the side of the angels and nothing she says disagrees with anything I have read elsewhere, but please note that her essays are more informed opinion than they are research.<br /><br />This is a highly engaging read for all foodies and anyone else who enjoys good memoir writing.

Great	This is Alton Brown's third major culinary book, and it is, I believe, the best of the three. Alton successfully apples his scientific approach to baking, but he has done the ultimate scientific task of illuminating great explanations of baking techniques by classifying them by mixing method. Alton has compounded this insight with a novel device in the design of his book that prints the `master recipe' for the eight mixing methods on flyleaves that can be folded over pages to appear beside the details of the individual recipes. Many major cookbook writers, most notably Julia Child, have employed the `master recipe' device to good effect. So, this device is not totally new, but the flyleaf I have simply never seen in any other cookbook, so I give full credit to Alton and his Stewart Tabori & Chang publishers for creating something new under the culinary sun.<br /><br />Just as the master recipe technique is not new, the proper classification of baking techniques is also not entirely new. Good writers on baking have been grouping quick breads with pastry crusts and cheesecake with custard pies for a generation. What Alton has done is similar to Mendeleev's achievement in building the periodic table of the elements. Before Mendeleev, chemists were all very familiar with families of elements corresponding to horizontal and vertical clusters in the full table. It was obvious that fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine had a lot in common. Mendeleev gave us the organization that brought out all those similarities. This was a stepping stone to the early atomic theories which identified electron rings that went on to explain periodic table behavior. This explanation of why different mixing methods give different end products is at the heart of Brown's contribution to the literature on baking. None of this is new. Great baking writers such as Flo Braker, Nick Malgieri, Sheri Yard, Peter Reinhart, Joe and Gayle Ortiz, and Shirley Corriher have been writing about this stuff for years. Alton does the true scientist's job of tying it all together.<br /><br />I am just a bit suspicious of the fact that there is no bibliography and there are no acknowledgments to baking writers in the book, as I sense a strong family resemblance between Alton's book and Sherry Yard's recent excellent book `The Secrets of Baking'. The difference is that Sherry is a world class baker who happens to have a knack for explaining. Alton is a journeyman baker who has a genius for classification. If science and AB's jabbering about using a food processor to sift flour doesn't interest you, you can do much worse than to get Yard's work.<br /><br />The eight mixing methods which are the heart of the book are for muffins (soft chemically leavened quickbreads), biscuits (scones, grunts, dumplings, crackers, streusel), pie crusts (a variation on the biscuit method), creaming (cakes, cookies, brownies, bran muffins), straight dough (yeast breads, including pizza, brioche, focaccia, and all those other things the French and Italians do so well), egg foam (meringues, souffles, angel food cake), custards (quiches, caramels, zabaglione, mousse, cheesecake), and miscellaneous (mostly pate a choux). The high point in all these chapters for me is the exercise that shows the underlying similarity between pizza dough and brioche. On the surface, they seem quite different, but by a series of demonstrations, AB shows how they really use the same basic method and differ only by the change of a few major ingredients such as butter, eggs, and milk.<br /><br />In practical terms, the most valuable part of the book is the excellent illustrations of really great techniques, done with well-chosen words and very effective line drawings. I have seen AB do his rolling a pie crust in a plastic bag trick and the next procedure of fitting a crust to a 9 inch pie tin, but I have never had the guts to try it using nothing but my memory of a scene from `Good Eats'. Seeing it all in black and whiteand color gives me the courage to try it now.<br /><br />Alton is a great exponent of both metric measurements and of weighing in place of volumetric measurements. I cannot agree with him more completely. In spite of being a klutz around most things manual, I am a very good novice baker because I was a professional chemist and can sling kilograms and milliliters with the best of them, and, I have great practical experience with making accurate measurements. So, if you are unfamiliar with metric measurements and weights, I can testify to their efficacy. Once you get used to them, they are really easier and give a greater chance of good results.<br /><br />I was also pleasantly surprised to see recipe amounts written in the form of formulas, as a professional baker may use. If you are familiar with Joe Ortiz' `The Village Baker' or Peter Reinhart's `Crust & Crumb', these should be very familiar to you. The best part of these recipes is they give all major components measured by volume and both metric and English weights.<br /><br />I must say that many people will not bother to read this book unless I assure you that all of AB's classic humor is here to be enjoyed. This mix of self-deprecation, scorning ignorance, and obscure pop culture references is eminently entertaining. I challenge you to find the rather cleverly hidden reference to the movie `Blade Runner' hidden among the Star Wars references and Waffle Iron recommendations.<br /><br />If I were to take issue with anything in the book, it would be the analogy between baking and architecture and the elevation of classification as the ultimate role of science. Baking in theory is much more like chemistry than it is like taxonomy and baking in practice is much more like metallurgy than like architecture.<br /><br />Otherwise, this book is a hoot I will check out Nick Malgieri or Flo Brakker for a new baking recipe, but I wouldn't miss this book for the world to help me make sense of it all.nd white and color gives me the courage to try it now. <br /> <br />Alton is a great exponent of both metric measurements and of weighing in place of volumetric measurements.

Two `master class' books by teachers would be Julia Child's `Mastering the Art of French Cooking' and Marcella Hazan's `Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking'. Two modern `master class' books by great American chefs would be Thomas Keller's very new `Bouchon' and Paul Bertolli's `Cooking By Hand'. I point out two kinds of authors for `master class books because Ms. Kazuko's book is neither.<br /><br />Ms. Kazuko is not a chef. She is a Japanese journalist transplanted to the United Kingdom, where this book was written and printed. Although I am sure she is well trained in Japanese cookery, I sense she does not have the depth of knowledge as Ms. Child and Ms. Hazan. Her role in this book is that of editor or anthologist. All the true culinary writing is done by twenty (20) chefs, twelve (2) based in Japan, two (2) based in the United Kingdom, one (1) from Germany, three (3) from the United States, one (1) from Australia, and one (1) from Hong Kong. Each of these chefs has contributed one or more classic Japanese recipes in eleven different chapters. Ms. Kazuko has contributed the introduction, and chapters on the tea ceremony, the culinary regions of Japan, and `the Japanese store cupboard'. These contributions are brief and serve no better purpose than to familiarize a non-Japanese reader with some of the highlights of Japanese culinary landscape. This is a sure giveaway that the book is far more a survey for foreigners than it is a monograph on advanced techniques. But, even as an introductory text these chapters fall short in that there are virtually no pictures of a very visual tea ceremony, no helpful map for people to whom the geography of Japan is an almost complete mystery, and no pictures accompanying almost all of the descriptions of Japanese staple foods and condiments.<br /><br />Most of the individual recipes appear to be in a classic Japanese style, although some have been metamorphosed by a transplantation to Hawaii or other distant lands still under the sway of Japanese culture. There are few French or Italian methods, although some classic French ingredients such as Foie gras do make an appearance. Most recipes fill a page with four sections. A brief paragraph by the editor introduces the `master chef'. A second headnote paragraph by the chef discusses some of the finer points they feel you should know about the recipe. The list of ingredients is neatly divided into sections when the recipe has separate preparations such as sauce and main preparation. Most ingredient measurements are given in both metric and English units. When only one unit is present, it is the English unit. Most unit conversions are very good, although some may be off by as much as 20%, which is no major crime, as I have seen Patricia Wells be off by that much on occasion. A few ingredient descriptions may be a bit vague, as in the specification for `1 salad lettuce'. This may be perfectly clear to a reader in London, but I think a Yank may be scratching their head trying to decide between iceberg, leaf lettuce, Romaine, of Boston lettuce. The irony is that the editor's headnote says the chef believes there are too many ambiguous words in classic Japanese recipes.<br /><br />If this were a true `master class' book for non-Japanese, I would expect it to be divided more by technique such as knife skills, sushi, tempura, broths, and hibachi than by the traditional western chapters with tofu replacing polenta and nori and raman replacing semolina pasta. There is no discussion whatsoever about the style of knife unique to Japanese cuisine. This is odd, because whether or not they use the French or the Japanese styles of knife can generally define all the world's cuisines. This is especially odd since so much is made in western presentations of Japanese culinary practice about the great knife skills of the sushi chef.<br/><br />The individual recipes, I believe, are generally quite good, even though the arrangement of recipes really runs counter to a book on classic techniques. The very first recipe in the first chapter on appetizers is a sashimi recipe requiring fairly advanced knife skills about which the book says nothing. The recipe refers to the katsura-muki technique for creating thinly shaved sheets of daikon and refers to another page which provides nothing so much as a picture of what these thinly shaved sheets will look like. There is nothing on how to properly hold knife or hand or vegetable, or what knife is best to use for this technique. The chapter on stocks and soups contains not a single recipe on stocks. A book on French cuisine with such a chapter would begin with no fewer than three and as many as eight different stock recipes. It is obvious from this book that the Japanese are much closer to Italian thinking about stock than to French. Just as Italian cuisine is based on a simple brodo, Japanese cooking seems to be based almost entirely on a fish stock (dashi). Rather than giving us one recipe and using it in all soup dishes, each author gives his own dashi recipe. When Jeremiah Tower did an omnibus book cooking with many major American chefs, he provided pantry recipes for all his colleagues. But then, Jeremiah Tower is a major culinary talent.<br /><br />This is not a bad book but it suffers by the less than proficient writing style of editor Kazuko and her publisher's copy editing resources were a little thin in putting together this book.<br /><br />If you want a true class on Japanese cooking, try `Japanese Cooking A Simple Art' by Shizuo Tsuji. I have not read the book yet, but a quick skim tells me it has everything I find missing in Ms. Kazuko's compilation.ef. <br /> <br />The individual recipes, I believe, are generally quite good, even though the arrangement of recipes really runs counter to a book on classic techniques.

Highly Recommended	Expectations for Thomas Keller's new book `Bouchon' are very high, and I firmly believe he has exceeded them. The book sets new standards for the foodie coffee table fare as well as confirming Keller's reputation as one of the country's foremost culinary artists. The book is larger, heavier, and better than his first cookbook on the cuisine of his flagship French Laundry. There are several things that make this an excellent book for all people who love to cook.<br /><br />First, the book is a superior reference work of bistro dishes and how to prepare them. It is certainly not complete, but then I think no cookbook in the world will ever be a complete reference to any subject, as every culinary subject changes daily due to changes in provisions, historical research, and the enormous variety in how even one dish is made from place to place. For example, both `Bouchon' and Tony Bourdain's recent book on bistro recipes from Les Halle has five (5) dishes containing mussels, yet no two are the same dish. For all of the virtues of Bourdain's book, Keller's book is superior as a reference to the overall style of cooking if only because he and his editors rigorously give both French and English names to all dishes.<br /><br />Second, as amazing as it is to say this, lots of dishes in `Bouchon' are actually easy to make. The initial roast chicken recipe is literally not much more complicated than carefully prepping the carcass and sticking it into the oven. Keller does not even baste the beast and it is done within an hour (for a 3-pound bird). And, all this with the cachet of making a Thomas Keller recipe. Almost all the salads and `openers' dishes are equally as simple, as long as you have high quality ingredients.<br /><br />Third, the pantry chapter of recipes is a more complete reference for making stocks and other sauce bases than I have seen anywhere else. My former gold standard for stockmaking recipes was in `The Zuni Caf&eacute; Cookbook' by Judy Rodgers. This is better by giving recipes that are just as good, better written, and a more complete collection of stocks than I have seen anywhere else. The only thing I would possibly add to this chapter would be a recipe for a court bouillon. But, the recipe does appear in the book as a part of the recipe for a shellfish platter. Other sauces such as a mignonette sauce and a cocktail sauce also appear `in situ' along with appropriate dishes with which they are used.<br /><br />Fourth, the book is simply packed with important culinary techniques. Most of these are not the sort of thing which will find their way to the quick tips pages of `Cooks Illustrated' or `Gourmet' as they are not shortcuts, but more painstaking ways to improve what is probably already an excellent dish. One dramatic example is Keller's twist on braising where he segregates his flavoring vegetables at the bottom of the Dutch oven under a layer of cheesecloth before adding the meat and the broth. In this way, it becomes very easy to remove the finished meat from the veg and retrieve the broth with little or no odd floating bits of celery leaf or thyme branch. A more simple technique is the recommendation to transfer finished stock to the filtering device with a ladle rather than simply pouring the stuff into the chinois. The force of the uncontrolled flow will force some unwanted particles into the filtered stock. It is all about little details piled up upon one another, which separates good from great cooking.<br /><br />Fifth, Keller's interpretation of bistro cooking is uncompromising. One dramatic example of this is his claim that America has forgotten how to make a proper quiche, if it ever did know in the first place. The cardinal sin is to make a quiche in a pie pan. This is no surprise, as Julia Child in `Mastering the Art of French Cooking' gives the same warning. What is more surprising is that while most Americans probably use a tart pan with sides of no more than an inch and Child recommends a flanor cake pan with sides up to 11/2 inches, Keller states that you need a 2 inch tall pan to make a proper quiche. A more subtle difference is in his technique for preparing his pate brisee. Virtually every pie crust recipes I have ever seen calls for cutting in butter to leave lentil-sized bits of butter in the mix. Keller insists this is a mistake for a quiche with a wet custard filling, as the pockets of butter create weaknesses in the dough that may break through before the custard filling has firmed up.<br /><br />Although the book contains many simple recipes, there are also many classic recipes such as boeuf bourguignon, which are literally essays in classic French cooking. Tony Bourdain's recipe for boeuf bourguignon requires 10 ingredients and two concise paragraphs to describe the method. Keller's recipe calls for 43 ingredients in 5 different component preparations, not including the veal stock preparation. This recipe is the poster boy for Keller's take on bistro cooking, which is technique and constant refinement by filtering, skimming, and straining. While the authors have been painstaking in translating the professional's practiced eye and nose into English, this cooking is still about constant attention to the state of the dish as it cooks, and of recognizing the right time to move from one stage to the other. It is this dish where if Bourdain did it at the French Laundry his way, he would be fired on the spot.<br /><br />This book is so large that it will probably be unwieldy to cook from in the kitchen. Open, it is large than two of my cutting boards together. Still, I cannot overstate how valuable this book is to someone who loves to cook and to read about cooking.<br /><br />Very highly recommended.or cake pan with sides up to 11/2 inches, Keller states that you need a 2 inch tall pan to make a proper quiche.

Excellent for Virtual Tourist	Ina Garten has given us a new book on `cuisine bourgeois', and one immediately wonders if the world really needs another book on everyday French cooking, since we already have great works from Julia Child and Elizabeth David, excellent works from Patricia Wells and Richard Olney, and hundreds of others, including an excellent volume from Garten's mentor, teacher Lydie Marshall, author of the excellent book `A Passion for My Provence'. The questions become doubly appropriate with the recent appearance of Food Network colleague Tony Bourdain's really excellent book of bistro recipes, `Anthony Bourdain's Les Halles Cookbook'. To complete the picture of my general skepticism about book is the fact that Ms. Garten's book lists at a higher price than Bourdain's book, yet it has substantially fewer recipes and none of Monsieur Bourdain's really excellent tutorials on cooking technique. Yet, here is the key to Ms. Garten's enterprise and audience.<br /><br />Ina Garten has no intention of emulating Julia Child in her writing or even in her TV shows. She is squarely in the tradition and style of Martha Stewart. Like Stewart, she started in the culinary business as a caterer and she was, for many years, a major contributor of culinary material to Martha Stewart's magazine. All you need to do is compare the design of Garten's books with either Bourdain's book or even Julia Child's books, and the difference is evident. Bourdain limits himself to pictures of dishes and series of pictures illustrating culinary techniques. Garten pictures lots of dishes, but she also pictures lots of pottery, table settings, and flowers as well. Each chapter has a prelude on marginally culinary matters. The brief chapter on wine is excellent, but it could have been lifted straight out of `Martha Stewart Living' as `Wine and Food Pairings 101'. Other prefatory essays cover flower arranging, table settings, cooking schools in Paris, and cooking equipment stores in Paris.<br /><br />All this means is that Ina Garten's books are as much about lifestyle as they are about cooking, and Ina will probably be the very first person to agree with this statement. And, this is a perfectly legitimate enterprise. In fact, although Jamie Oliver is an exceptionally talented chef (whose passion and skill with food may even put Bourdain in the shade) writes books that are as much about lifestyle as they are about cooking. It's just that it is a different lifestyle than the one being celebrated by Ms. Garten.<br /><br />I believe the recipes in all of Ms. Garten's books are very good for the home cook. As she says in many of her books, these recipes were done for 60 servings a day at her shop, `Barefoot Contessa' so they had to be simple and they had to be good. This doesn't mean I didn't find a few oddities here and there, especially in her headnotes to some recipes. One puzzling comment was her apologizing for using cremini mushrooms as an unusual ingredient in a recipe, when I can find cremini mushrooms in every larger food store in the Lehigh Valley, including ones which make no pretense to carrying gourmet ingredients. A few pages later, she uses celery root, fennel, morels, and Belgian endive in recipes. All of these ingredients are either hard to find or expensive. Another puzzle is her blanching thinly sliced fennel bulb for a fennel salad. Neither Marcella Hazan nor mentor Lydie Marshall blanches fennel for their several salads that use this ingredient. I know exactly why Garten does it, because I considered doing the same thing when making Mme. Hazan's fennel salads, but I just couldn't bear giving up the fine crunch of raw fennel. The solution is to slice very, very thinly and possibly to salt the fennel and let set as you do for cabbage in making cole slaw.<br /><br />Another oddity with Ms. Garten's recipes is that although she emphasizes easy recipes, her Moules Marinieres (Mussels in White Wine) recipe has many more ingredients and a slightly more complicated procedure than Tony Bourdain's recipe for a dish of exactly the same name. Personally, I would go with Bourdain's recipe as it adds the wine right after cooking the shallots in butter in order that the wine will deglace the pot and almost all alcohol will cook off before more ingredients are added to the pot. Ms. Garten uses the very understandable technique of mixing olive oil with the butter for the initial sautee, and the wine is added mixed with water, tomato, and spices. Bourdain's recipe is simpler, but requires just a little more attention and skill to attend to the hot butter and add the wine before it gets too dark. An even more interesting comparison between Garten and Bourdain is with their boeuf bourguignon recipes. Garten complains that traditional recipes that keep the dish in the Dutch oven on the stove for three hours, the meat comes out dry and the veggies mushy. I have seen this happen and it doesn't surprise me that Garten is wary of it, as her instructions are to barely cover the meat with liquid and bring to a boil, then into the oven for 75 minutes. Thus, she is treating the dish like a braise while Bourdain, who simmers the dish gently on the stovetop for 120 minutes, treats the dish more like a stew, with strong admonishments to check the dish every 20 minutes for sticking. Again, Bourdain's recipe has fewer ingredients and is somewhat simpler, as it doesn't require the oven or a step to burn off the alcohol.<br /><br />This is not to say Garten's recipes are not as good as Bourdain's. Only that the two authors have two different audiences. Garten is writing for the virtual tourist in Paris and the seeker of advice for entertaining in the Parisian style. Bourdain is writing for cooks. I have done several recipes from Garten's books, including this one, and I have never been disappointed.<br /><br />Highly recommended for a virtual taste of the Parisian lifestyle.ted procedure than Tony Bourdain's recipe for a dish of exactly the same name.

476127:US	39134375	R2U2DLW6A2HNNQ	0821228455	409147376	Patrick O'Connell's Refined American Cuisine: The Inn at Little Washington	Books	5	43	47	N	N	Excellent on every reason for buying Restaurant Cookbook.	Patrick O'Connell's second book, `Refined American Cuisine' does everything that a great restaurant cookbook should do, which are present really good recipes of dishes people like to eat. Chef O'Connell won my mind over early in the book when he writes that he was self-taught and that restaurant praxis has a lot to teach the home amateur cook. When I began my home schooling on cooking, this was one of the first principles I adapted and one reason I continue to buy and read cookbooks associated with good restaurants, even though some, like Emeril Lagasse's recent books, are advertisements for the restaurant(s).<br /><br />Most cookbooks written by celebrity chefs generally include a sizable dollop of memoir or insights into culinary technique. As this Bulfinch Press book is both oversized and overpriced and has much the same appearance of Artisan publisher's books by Thomas Keller and Frank Stitt, I would expect one or the other or both, but this work rests its pricy quality squarely on the recipes, with just a few pages on the author's journey to cooking and the origins of his venue, The Inn at Little Washington in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, 67 miles from `big Washington' on the Potomac.<br /><br />The recipes can bear the weight. They are exactly what recipes from a highly acclaimed restaurant in a book for amateur cooks and foodies should be. Tasty, interesting, and relatively easy to make with few if any unusual ingredients. The crowning touch is a recipe for a potato, parsnip, and carrot gratin. How can I give anything less than five (5) stars to a book with a good recipe for a potato, parsnip, and carrot gratin made with butter?<br /><br />I will even forgive the author for including several distinctively European classic dishes in a book about American cuisine. The appearance of most of these dishes shows how deeply American cooking is rooted in Western Europe. The very first recipe is for Rosti potatoes, which I understand is a traditionally Swiss dish. The headnotes quite honestly point this lineage out and proceed to give a recipe that would make the burgers of Geneva envious. The recipe is a combination of the crisp potato pancake, scrambled eggs, and smoked salmon. Yummy. Since the recipe calls for cooking the eggs very slowly in a double boiler, I wonder if the staff makes the eggs to order or cooks up a big bunch of scrambled eggs kept in holding on the steam table. This recipe appears in a very welcome chapter on breakfast dishes and is followed by a very original recipe for an oatmeal souffle. Chef O'Connell finally lands squarely in America with a cottage cheese and buttermilk pancake recipe which, along with the gratin, may be worth the price of the book. The waffles and grits in following brekkie recipes pale in comparison. I should note at this time that I am not a big fan of spending a lot of money for lots of pictures in cookbooks, but in this book, they work as well or better than I have seen elsewhere. As one major function of a good restaurant cookbook is to provide recipes for entertaining, the pictures do an especially good job here to show how to best present these dishes to guests.<br /><br />The `Snacks and Canapes' chapter has the same mix of classic Americana such as miniature ham biscuits and Lilliputian bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwiches with imported influences such as Green Bean tempura and wild mushroom pizza.<br /><br />The `Soups' chapter is relatively short and is heavily influenced by French practice, as two recipes are for creamed and pureed soups while two others out of six (6) are cold soups. The `Cold First Courses' is also a melange of influences with carpaccios, Virginia ham with Italian Parmesan, Maine Lobster with Russian caviar, and tuna with daikon radish.<br /><br />The much larger chapter `Hot First Courses' seems to have a distinctively American center of gravity with just two risottos among the eleven (11) American seafood classics and the archetypal macaroni and cheese with Virginia country ham.<br /><br />The exceptional chapter on `Salads, Cheeses, And Intermezzos' is introduced by a delightful picture of mottled goats and very attractive goatherd. Something about the price of admission comes to mind.<br /><br />The `Main Dishes' chapter rightfully has the largest number of recipes with a mix of French, Italian, and American techniques and ingredients which characterizes the whole book. Several of the dishes juxtapose traditional presentations with very untraditional ingredients as in the scaloppini of chicken with a grapefruit sauce. This recipe keeps company with traditional dishes for turkey, chicken and dumplings, lamb chops on rosti, beef tenderloin and braised duck legs.<br /><br />The side dishes are pure gold. Here we have my lovely gratin with grits souffles, corn relish, peas and pearl onions, cranberry salsa, and cabbage braised in CHAMPAGNE!<br /><br />The desserts cap a great collection of recipes with a table of sweets that may match Thomas Keller's famous cigarettes and coffee dish for whimsy. The featured joke here is `Human Dog Biscuits' made with shortbread. Other more serious desserts include a rhubarb sorbet, rosemary shortbread, eggnog souffle, sweet corn ice cream, and a classic brioche French Toast with strawberries.<br /><br />The Pantry chapter has an excellent collection of all the usual stocks, doughs, vinaigrettes, syrups, and chipped veggies. Some classic southern preparations are here with red pepper coulis, pickled okra, and tomato vinaigrette. The recipes are all easier than you may expect.<br /><br />O'Connell plays the local ingredients card, but trumps it on a regular basis with French, Italian, and Asian ingredients prominent in many dishes. Yet, he is true in spirit to this ideal by preferring Virginia ham to procuitto in lots of dishes.<br /><br />I am really happy to have found this book and I recommend it strongly to everyone who likes such works.etypal macaroni and cheese with Virginia country ham. <br /> <br />The exceptional chapter on `Salads, Cheeses, And Intermezzos' is introduced by a delightful picture of mottled goats and very attractive goatherd.

477087:US	39134375	R14IXRKKRGW9YM	4770029497	227755793	The Breakaway Japanese Kitchen: Inspired New Tastes	Books	4	7	12	N	Y	Very Good Fusion of Japanese Tastes and Western Wines	`The Breakaway Japanese Kitchen' is a very nice little book by private chef Eric Gower of San Francisco. It should appeal to anyone who has an ongoing interest in Oriental tastes or has a serious commitment to opening an investigation of Oriental, specifically Japanese, tastes and techniques. While the book involves very few unfamiliar Oriental cooking techniques such as stir-frying or tempura or sushi rolling, the recipes do involve access to some very serious oriental ingredients such as Kabocha (Japanese pumpkin), Kabosu (Japanese green citrus), Konbu (dried kelp), Meyer lemons, Shiso (perilla, or beefsteak plant), Sudachi (Japanese limes), Togarashi (red chilis), Umeboshi (Pickled salty plums), and Yuzu (small Oriental citrus). And this doesn't include things like dashi broth, edamame (fresh or frozen), miso, nam pla, sake, soba noodles, and udon noodles which I know are available in a good megamart. Naturally, you can imagine relatively easy substitutions of lemons or limes for the esoteric citrus and sweet pumpkins for the Kabocha and southwestern chilis for Togarashi. But this doesn't entirely satisfy the reader when the author says that the tofu available in the United States is a poor cousin to the type available in Japan. The author is based in San Francisco, where the best Japanese versions of many of these products are probably available, but I suspect that many of these things are available only on the West Coast, and this annoys me a bit. I welcome any entree to Japanese tastes for the average American, but since the author is doing fusion recipes in the first place, why not make the effort to prepare recipes freely accessible to the housewife in Topeka.<br /><br />I typically give five stars to books which inspire me or which I believe will inspire the average foodie and amateur cook such as books by Jamie Oliver and Jacques Pepin, or, which I believe should be read by the average foodie / amateur cook such as works by Shirley Corriher, Marcella Hazan, or Paula Wolfert. I will also give five stars to cooks which surprise me or do an exceptionally good job of serving a special audience, such as Rachael Ray (fast cooking) or Flo Brakker (desserts) or Peter Reinhart (bread). I will give only three stars if a book is good, but the average prospective buyer may not easily be aware that the book is aimed at a very special audience, and the buyer is not a member of that audience. The best example of this case is Charlie Trotter's book, `Raw'.<br /><br />In the end, this book did not inspire me to run out in search of the perfect miso or the elusive Meyer lemon. But, the book does contain several recipes with few or no ingredients for which you cannot find suitable substitutions. And, several of these recipes interested me enough to make them, and I found them as good as promised. I was especially pleased to find the author do interesting things with very common ingredients such as potatoes in a book where rice is king. As the book is quite obviously for people who like or are disposed to like Japanese food, I give it four stars rather than the cautionary three stars.<br /><br />As Mr. Gower has a very Occidental culinary background before he took up Japanese cuisine, he does us the rare service of pairing his Japanese dishes with very European / California wines. I am not a big fan of wines, but I believe this feature significantly increases the value of the book, especially joined with the relatively easy recipes. This makes the book a better than average source for entertaining if you have average chops in the kitchen and a good nearby megamart or good nearby oriental food market.<br /><br />The author and his publishers have done a better than average job of food styling and culinary photography. The photographer performed the same service for `Nobu, The Cookbook' and the talent with the camera shows. Many dishes are plated and visually garnished with Japanese art objects. The effort pays off.<br /><br />The book isa good introduction to Japanese tastes with largely western cooking techniques and wine pairings. A bit pricy for the size, but I'm sure you can find Amazon do it's usual discounting.he book is a good introduction to Japanese tastes with largely western cooking techniques and wine pairings.

Profesional Fare	The most important thing to mention about this book is that it is not a notebook. It is composed of dessert recipes, equipment tips, and sidebars on fruit ingredients made up to look like a notebook. In fact, the sidebars on fruits, however informative they happen to be, are very incongruous matched up with the `notebook' appearance of the recipes and theme of the book.<br /><br />The most famous notebooks I know are those of philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, where his notebooks are composed of many aphorisms. I can imagine similar notebooks of literary figures, historians, naturalists, graphic artists and journalists, and I can imagine finding these musings interesting. On the other hand, I cannot imagine finding the notebooks of scientists or cooks very interesting. Having been a practicing chemist, I can attest to the fact that the great bulk of scientific notes are simply columns of numbers and formulas. I can imagine a culinary notebook, being very similar to scientific research in that it simply repeats the same procedure over and over again varying a single aspect each time can be pretty dull. Witness the articles in `Cooks Illustrated' where we are not presented with all the details, only the summary of dozens of attempts at achieving the best recipe. But then, I am pretty sure that only professional philosophers read Wittgenstein's notebooks.<br /><br />In this book and in his more conventional book, `Essential Cuisine', the author makes much of his wanderings through the countryside of his native region of France, Aubrac, which is in the southwestern hills, about a hundred miles inland from the Bay of Biscay and Bayonne and Bordeaux. At least it is voice from a new region, neither Lyon nor Provence. The introduction cites how the author Michal Bras roams about the countryside noting flavors and scents. But there is the rub. How do you put scents of acacia flowers, chicory roots and white pine needles in a notebook. I guess this is the opening which make room for the little monographs on fruits. Believe it or not, the author actually does give recipes including acacia and chicory. Oddly enough, there are no little monographs on these two ingredients. And, the order of the ingredients monographs seem to show very little rhyme or reason. It would seem to make sense to put all the citrus monographs together, but they are not. The monographs are also a very odd mix of information, certainly different from a naturalist's observations of the fruits in situ as you may expect to find in a notebook. The pieces contain an assortment of information on geographical distribution, history, and care in using, as with the little tidbit of washing blueberries in vinegar to ward against fox piss. But I go on too much about the fruity notes.<br /><br />All the recipes are complete, albeit somewhat shorter than what you may expect. Most of the recipes are difficult and many of the recipes require a long time to prepare. And, the author states that fact clearly at the beginning of each recipe. On top of all this, the instructions for some of the long and difficult recipes are rather terse. Bras' recipe for the famous `La Buche de Noel' or Christmas Log is not much more than a single page of text plus a single hand-drawn illustration. Nick Malgieri's instructions for the same cake in `Perfect Pastry' takes at least two pages. Other presentations I have seen take longer, with many pictures.<br /><br />This is not to say this is a `bad' book. Most of what this means is that the audience for this book may only be professional pastry chefs and very serious amateur foodies and bakers who like to experiment with unusual ingredients and unusual preparations, molds, and ingredients like acacia flowers and chicory. The combination of unusual ingredients, long prep times, and professional level skills means this book is not for the average bake sale matron. On the other hand, even if you are not a professional or even an active amateur baker, this book does offer a window into a world of desserts you may just not see outside of some very special shops in New York, San Francisco, Paris, Brussels, or Lyon... or in the Aubrac. In spite of the many long and difficult recipes, there are several, especially in the chapter `Basic Recipes' which will give the inventive pastry amateur a lot of interesting ideas. There are the usual recipes for frangipanes and Italian meringue, but there are also interesting recipes for Fouace Dough, caramelized phyllo leaves, and a short crust pastry dough with duck fat.<br /><br />The chapter on fruit desserts offers a lot of interesting tarts with roasted fruits, nut creams, and quinquina (whatever that is). The chapter on pastries has interesting cake recipes, mousselines, pralines, and preparations with one of his favorite unusual ingredients, milk skin.<br /><br />The chapter on ice cream may be more interesting than most books. Just be careful not to be taken in by the `instant' ice cream recipes. They are unusual in their use of whipped cream and fresh toasted bread crumb to get the fluff of ice cream, but they do require that the preparation spend several hours in the fridge and they also require the use of an ice cream maker.<br /><br />The book requires several European ingredients such as black and blond sugar. I suspect blond sugar is what we would call light brown sugar and black sugar may be an especially dark `dark brown sugar', but the book does not clear that up for us Yanks. I was totally baffled when one recipe called for the cook to measure the relative density of sugar syrup. I know how this is done, but I have never seen a device for doing this in any kitchen supply source.<br /><br />Recommended to professionals, adventuresome pastry hobbyists, and foodies bored with the average book on French cookery.this book does offer a window into a world of desserts you may just not see outside of some very special shops in New York, San Francisco, Paris, Brussels, or Lyon... or in the Aubrac.

479957:US	39134375	R3U7SW2GIF0JHU	1401301940	49557479	Jamie's Dinners: The Essential Family Cookbook	Books	5	239	259	N	Y	Jamie Oliver Cooks at Home. Very Highly Recommended	Jamie Oliver writes cookbooks I look forward to reading and this fifth volume from the Anglo wunderkind chef fully satisfies my expectations.<br /><br />Julia Child, Marcella Hazan, Paula Wolfert, James Beard, and Diana Kennedy write great cookbooks from which I always learn something. Thus, it is always rewarding to read works from these writers. But, Jamie Oliver's books belong to a very select few which are not only educational, they actively make you want to put down the book and go to the kitchen and start cooking. The select group of writers who can do that for me is lead by Jacques Pepin and has recently been joined by Tony Bourdain along with Peter Reinhart, Chris Schlesinger, and his nibs, Jamie Oliver. Even my culinary idols Mario Batali and Alton Brown can't evoke my passion for cooking as well as Messers Pepin and Oliver.<br /><br />Appropriate to this grouping of writers, Oliver's latest effort, `Jamie's Dinners, The Essential Family Cookbook' is a perfect companion to Jacques Pepin's latest work, `Fast Cooking My Way'. Both books highlight the way the two chefs cook at home, with the focus being as much on simplicity and readily available ingredients as on speed. As I rarely cook with the intention of being done quickly, but I do appreciate a simple dish with high rewards on the palate, Oliver's book promises AND delivers on exactly the kind of book I like to go to on a regular basis, just like Jacques' work.<br /><br />The theme of Jamie's last book was wrapped around his effort to train 15 deserving unemployed young people and staff a restaurant, `15' with his graduates. This book is based on a similar socially active theme of improving school lunch meals. Jamie states that he has been doing a documentary on school food programs and how they may be improved. The book gives little information about this film, but it does have a lot of material on food appropriate to school lunches.<br /><br />The first third of the book is devoted to unconventional material and presentations of recipes. The first chapter gives us recipes for Jamie's `Top Ten' dishes: Sausage and Mashed Potatoes with Onion Gravy; Burger and Chips; Baked Lasagna; Jacket Potatoes (stuffed potatoes for us Yanks); Apple Pie; Roast Chicken and Roast Potatoes; Fish, Chips, and Mushy Peas; Chicken and Sweet Leek Pie; Tomato Soup; and Chicken Tikka Masala. Jamie often likes to offer some dishes as `the best'. And, I have never been disappointed with any of his `best' dishes. Many are now part of my standard repertoire. But, whether many are `the best' may be a matter of taste. His `ultimate' burger for example includes cumin, coriander, Parmesan cheese, mustard, and raw onion mixed into the burger patty. I am perfectly happy staying with my classic Julia Child recipes incorporating nothing more than saut&eacute;ed shallots into the patty. But, I am sure that Jamie's version is `a tasty burger'. Even these simple dishes offer interesting techniques. The chips, for example are not fried, they are parboiled, then baked. The lasagna is bulked up butternut squash. The chicken potpie is topped with puff pastry instead of conventional pate brisee. One thing these dishes exemplify is that simple is not always easy. Jamie is not going for speed here, he is aiming at tasty, popular dishes. And, aside from the mashy peas, I suspect every dish will appeal to American tastes as much as it will appeal to our Brit cousins.<br /><br />The next chapter develops an idea I have had for a book for close to a year now, and Sir Jamie got to it long before it was anything more than a notion in my head. This is a presentation of related recipes that begin with a basic preparation such as pesto, then builds on this to create four or five related dishes which use this basic preparation. Ming Tsai wrote a whole book, `Simply Ming' on this idea. Ming promoted the idea as a method for saving time. I thing Jamie is closer to the practical matter for home cooks when he pushes the ideas as a means for building a good repertoire of dishes from a few simple techniques such as a marinara sauce, roasted lamb, stewed fruit, and puff pastry.<br /><br />Jamie's next chapter is on `5 minute wonders', that are very similar to the 26 recipe snippets at the beginning of Pepin's `Fast Cooking My Way'. For this chapter alone, I would have a copy of this book at my desk at work so I could pick up the ingredients for these dishes on my way home. True to Jamie's passion for fresh ingredients, most of the dishes need at least one fresh green or protein.<br /><br />The chapter on sarnies (sandwiches for us Yanks) is meant to elevate this humble preparation to a level which will satisfy even the gourmet palate by being nutritious, fresh, and interesting. I am pleased to find the selection is not limited to Italian influenced Paninis.<br /><br />These chapters alone are worth the price of admission, but we have 200 more pages of Oliver recipes to go. His salads are as interesting as usual with lots of original stuff and a few old standards. The chapters on soups, vegetables, pasta, meat, fish, and desserts are all up to his usual standard.<br /><br />There is a rather unusual chapter at the end of the book entitled `Kitchens That Work'. It is an uncommon subject for the typical cookbook, but it fits the theme of this book, that being cooking at home. Jamie's primary premise is that his recipes can easily be done in a relatively small home kitchen, which is what he actually has in his home. There are a few simple ideas that I am sure I will include in my long-awaited kitchen renovation. Leading the pack is the notion of a cutting board tabletop for veggies, with separate plastic boards only for meats and poultry.<br /><br />Very highly recommended.deas as a means for building a good repertoire of dishes from a few simple techniques such as a marinara sauce, roasted lamb, stewed fruit, and puff pastry. <br /> <br />Jamie's next chapter is on `5 minute wonders', that are very similar to the 26 recipe snippets at the beginning of Pepin's `Fast Cooking My Way'.

480065:US	39134375	R1FH7IDDYWABJJ	1891105175	925884697	Rachael Ray: Best Eats in Town on $40 A Day	Books	4	50	54	N	Y	Very Good Companion ot the Show. Not much new material.	Rachael Ray constantly surprises me with her Food Network shows and books. When I began watching the Food Network and saw Rachael appearing among high powered chefs like Bobby Flay, Wolfgang Puck, Mario Batali, and Emeril Lagasse, I thought her show was an invention of the Food Network and Miss Rachael was brought in as a pretty face and perky personality to front the show in much the same way that the distaff hosts of `How to Boil Water' are actors first and foodies second. I was pleasantly surprised when I discovered that her show concept was entirely her idea and that the show and the first book actually predated Rachael's appearance on the Food Network. Then, I thought her appearing on the `$40 a Day' show was simply cashing in on her '30 Minute Meals' popularity. Wrong again. The eating out on a budget idea also came from Rachael and also predated her appearance on the Food Network. What will that girl do next? Actually, we know what her next gig is, on a show interviewing entertainment celebrities who also happen to be foodies.<br /><br />The value you can get from this book depends a whole lot on where you live, how many of the TV show episodes you have seen, and whether you like to travel. The `where you live' is important because a large number of venues are in the northeastern US and on the southern Atlantic coast. So if you live on the East Coast, a fairly large number of locations will be within your reach in two to five days, round trip. The importance of how many episodes you have seen can work in two different ways. If you have seen no episodes, the book will be much more valuable than if you have seen several, and find little to interest you. On the other hand, if you have seen many episodes, and really like the kind of stuff presented in the shows, the book will tickle your fancy as much as the show does, with added value (more on this later). If you like to travel, even if you don't actually travel, but like the idea of travel, this book will be much more enjoyable than if you are a psychological homebody.<br /><br />There are several things in the book that do not appear on the show. First, there more information on where Rachael got the information she used in planning her visits. The show features the Internet, free newspapers, and locals. To her additional suggestions, I would add the `New Yorker' and travel magazines.<br /><br />Second, there are recipes from several of the eateries featured on the show. These recipes will be of little value if you are a major cookbook collector, as most of them are very common dishes such as clam chowder, pasta Puttanesca, and French toast. Third, there are tidbits of information on scenes which never made it into the show such as Miss Rachael's run up the Philadelphia Art Museum steps, emulating Rocky, in her sweats.<br /><br />As an occasional traveler who has been to several of Ms. Rachael's venues, including Rome, Paris, Florence, New Orleans, Cape Cod, and Chicago, and who has had both very good and very bad luck in picking out places to eat, I find Rachael's advice potentially very useful. My least favorite memory, which grows more grotesque the more I read about Italian eateries, is a lunch I had in a very small room in Florence which appeared to be nothing more than the front room of a private house where the family had two or three tables and served the most dreadfully common food you can imagine. The other side of the coin is that this experience tempers my opinions when I hear of the abundance of great eateries in some out of the way corner of the world. I don't need Tony Bourdain to tell me there is some really bad food being sold out there. The other side of the coin is a chance discovery of an excellent tavern / restaurant I found in New Bedford on a whimsical turn off the Connecticut turnpike on the way to Cape Cod.<br /><br />I can't really give this book five stars for several reasons. First, it is dated material. As the author says herself, places go out of business on a regular basis, so call ahead if you plan to visit these venues. Second, the material the book adds to the experience of the show is not great. It is much more fun watching Rachael do something embarrassing by simply being herself than it is to read about it. Third, the book is not a substitute for a true travel guide, as the selection of venues is very narrow. Even in a small town like Cooperstown, there are probably plenty of other good places to eat that will be reasonably priced. But, it is still a fun book at a very reasonable list price. I have a lot of admiration for Rachael and her publishers for keeping the prices of her books down to a very reasonable cost for the quality of the material.<br /><br />Recommended for foodies and travelers.o out of business on a regular basis, so call ahead if you plan to visit these venues.

481243:US	39134375	RLKOKV2YI68H0	1931605076	191070050	Essential Cuisine	Books	4	29	36	N	Y	Very 'haute cuisine', very decorative, useful ideas.	`Essential Cuisine', nominally written by Michelin starred French chef Michel Bras and his brother, Sebastian, is translated from the French and is published by a very small house, `ici la Press' that I guess specializes in distributing such French material transplanted to these shores.<br /><br />Like an earlier book `A Chef in Provence' by Edouard Loubet, this book is the perfect example of a foodie's coffee table decoration which will very likely never see the inside of a kitchen or suffer an olive oil stained fingerprint on any of its especially glossy pages. The main difference between Loubert and Bras' efforts are that Bras and company wastes less page space on nice pictures of Provencal gardens, hill, forests, and wildflowers among the recipes. The gallery of pretty pictures is relegated to the back of the book. This is little solace for the $50 price tag for highly impractical recipes.<br /><br />This does not mean this is a bad book. It only means that it would be a real shame for someone to buy this book under a mistaken idea about its contents. If cookbooks were mapped to magazines on building, carpentry, crafts, and hobbies, Julia Child's `Mastering the Art of French Cooking' would become `Fine Woodworking', Tony Bourdain's `Les Halles Cookbook' would become `Handyman', and Michel Bras' `Essential Cooking' would become `Architectural Digest'. The first two are consulted for serious ideas on projects that an amateur can do at home. The latter is browsed for the pictures and the romance of very expensive venues.<br /><br />The title, `Essential Cooking' gives the impression of being about basics. The book is about as far removed from being about basics as you can imagine. Unfortunately, it is also devoid of much insight about professional cooking which can be transferred to improving an amateur's cooking practice. But let me spend a few words on telling you what is good about this book.<br /><br />The very first thing which appealed to me was the somewhat quirky, but highly effective method of laying out the ingredients and procedure for each recipe which typically appears on the left side of a two page spread dedicated to each dish. The translators have done a serviceable, albeit somewhat gross translation of metric measurements into familiar English units. I can't complain too much about these, as even the equivalencies in Patricia Wells' excellent books are often off by about 20%. But, in the world of savory cooking, 20% difference doesn't mean a whole lot.<br /><br />The next feature that impressed me was the dual table of contents that cross-referenced all the recipes by both primary ingredient and by type of dish. This is really a very European thing, as I see it much more often in French and German books than in books written by Americans.<br /><br />Other especially good features were the basic advice and basic recipe sections. The basic advice has not nearly enough content to come even close to being a tutorial on cooking, but it does include a few rare pointers centered on taking your time, paying attention to taste, and being organized. The basic recipes are not just your typical stocks and vinaigrettes, as Monsieur Bras' recipes require several unusual pantry preparations. There are some less common but still familiar preparations such as beurre noisette, pate brisee, pate sablee, Italian meringue, and French meringue. There are also some preparations I have never seen before such as aigo boulido, gomasio, grilled lard, huille rance, kefir, long jus, short jus, and nougatine. Some of these preparations are simply unfamiliar names for common cooking techniques. Gomasio, for example, is simply toasted sesame seeds crushed with sea salt. Some preparations are totally familiar to every cook, yet they are generally thought of as nuisances, such as milk skin, that skin that forms on the surface of heated milk.<br /><br />Other nice features are the short glossary of terms, the very necessary table of substitutions, and the totally unique page of stencils, templates, and diagrams of unusual equipment. The table of substitutions, like many of the pantry preparations is not your everyday sour milk substitution for buttermilk. These recipes use lots of exceedingly uncommon ingredients such as agar-agar, amaranth, bee balm, rau0ram, tansy flowers, and yellow bedstraw flowers. Fortunately, all the stand-in products are very common, such as spinach, gelatin, celery, and basil.<br /><br />I should also soften my judgment that the recipes in this book are totally impractical for the home cook. There are many ideas here which, with a fair amount of practice, can turn up on your table when you entertain to impress. The chef author is very fond of soft-boiled eggs; something which is very uncommon in American cookery and which therefore, would make a big impression, especially with the ways the author tweaks the presentations. The soft-boiled egg recipes appear under the unfamiliar rubric `mises en bouche', a variation on `amuse-bouche'.<br /><br />Many other recipes also start with very common ingredients to give us fried bread and Mediterranean tuna with a presentation which would knock the socks off of the most jaded brunch guest. But then, the author goes off the deep end by giving us recipes requiring Banyuls sweet wine, venison, potimarron squash, demerara sugar, candied orange, and juniper berries to yield a leg of venison with licorice-like lemon puree. The presentation of this dish, like all the others, is a knockout.<br /><br />The texts surrounding the recipes are a combination of childhood memories and somewhat mystical ruminations on things that inspire the chef's cooking.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this expensive book is totally impractical for everyday cookery, but it does give us a look at the substance and inspirations of French haute cuisine. And, unlike Charlie Trotter's book `Raw', it is not totally impractical. The four stars I give are a compromise between a warning to look before you lay out your cash and a recommendation of the book as very good eye candy and a source of inspiration.of substitutions, and the totally unique page of stencils, templates, and diagrams of unusual equipment.

482444:US	39134375	R1CHGAU4K9BIKA	1903402557	949313537	Jamie Oliver: The Biography	Books	3	7	7	N	Y	Routine Journalistic Effort. 4 years out of date already.	`Jamie Oliver The Biography' is a weak book using just about every criteria you may wish to apply to the biography of a contemporary culinary celebrity.<br /><br />The very first warning I would make to a potential buyer is the fact that the book was published in 2001, so it was probably completed in early 2001, when Jamie was about 25. This means that all of the most interesting events in his life and career such as the birth of his children, the `Oliver's Twist' TV show, on stage performances, and the whole `15' restaurant enterprise do not even appear in this book.<br /><br />I suppose there is some justification for doing a biography of a public figure so early in their career OTHER than making money, but this book exhibits none of what I would consider worthwhile. If this were a book on a 25-year-old physicist, mathematician, or microbiologist, I would expect that it would deal with the subjects scientific achievements in some depth. If this were a book on a 25-year-old chess player, I would expect an intelligent analysis of the subject's play. If this book were on a 25-year-old poet, I would expect some intelligent analysis of the subject's poetry. This book says virtually nothing about Jamie's cuisine, aside from the fact that it is based on Spanish and Italian influences (and that he likes his great mortar and pestle), and everyone who has watched his shows already knows that.<br /><br />In fact, in these 250 pages, there is precious little I did not already know about his nibs already. By the nature of Jamie's shows, we already know that he grew up in Essex to parents who ran a local pub and that he began his cooking career by washing dishes and doing prep work in the pub's kitchen at the age of 8. We know all about his being mentored by Gennaro Contaldo and his stint at the River Caf&eacute; where he was discovered during the taping of a TV special featuring Rose Gray and Ruth Rodgers at the River Caf&eacute;. There are even events in Jamie's early career I have encountered that are not in the book. For example, Ruth Rodgers was very stern with Jamie when he first applied for a job at the River Caf&eacute;. It turns out, this was just her `game face' when talking to unsolicited job seekers. The book does absolutely nothing to examine Jamie's relations with Contaldo, Gray, or Rodgers.<br /><br />The book is pretty thin on several other accounts. While 250 pages seems to be a rather respectable size for the story of a 25 year olds life, the font is quite large, so we are probably getting no more that about half that number of pages were the book printed in a normal font size for the size of the page. Regarding the content, even those things we may not know about young Jamie are pretty easy to adduce from what we know of his character, without having to be told. It is new to me to read that Jamie and Jools have known one another since shortly after Jamie graduated from catering school. And, they were a real couple before Jamie attained even the slightest hint of celebrity. But, the book doesn't even come close to discussing anything interesting about their relationship. There is more interesting material on this matter in the introduction to Oliver's third book `Happy Days with the Naked Chef' than there is in this whole book.<br /><br />So, this biography is almost purely journalism of the most superficial type. A year ago, there was a long profile of Mario Batali in the New Yorker which, in about 10 pages said more about the inner workings of Mario's ambitions, achievements, and culinary style than this book does in its anemic 250 pages. And, it really fails as good journalism too, as I found at least one rather serious factual error, where Bobby Flay's name is misspelled as `Bobby Ray' and he is only credited with being the executive chef of Bolo and Mesa Grill rather than being a co-owner.

Could be Better.	`Cooking Rocks' continues in print a Rachael Ray / Food Network theme of cooking with kids, a strong theme already championed by Emeril Lagasse in two recent books and several `Emeril Live' episodes. So, the most obvious comparison on which to evaluate Rachael's book is to compare it with Emeril's efforts.<br /><br />The premise of both authors' kid's cookbooks is that cooking is fun. While it has been a very long time since I was a kid, I have vivid memories of my attempt, at around the age of 9, with my 6 year old cousin, to make a cake from scratch with our elderly grandmother able to not much more than be an adult presence for two very inexperienced bakers. My mother's reaction upon returning home from work to our efforts, which featured using granulated sugar in place of confectioners sugar, and creating an ungodly mess in the kitchen did nothing to encourage further culinary attempts until I stood for the cooking merit badge in Boy Scouts. I really wish she had Rachael's book and attitude when I was a kid.<br /><br />The best thing about Rachael's book is her advice to parents and kids about cooking. This is because she was never actually taught how to cook. In the kitchen, there was never the question `Can you do ....?'. It was always put to her to `Please do ....'. Little Rachael would then proceed to figure out how to do it, or ask for help if she did not know or could not work it out herself.<br /><br />Another good thing about Rachael's book is that recipes are presented by age. There is one chapter for 4-6 year olds, another chapter for 7 years old and up, and a section for 12 years old and up. There are other chapters on beverages and snacks and on submarine sandwiches (sammies in Rayspeak).<br /><br />The recipes for 4-6 year olds may not appeal to adult tastes. They are offered to both appeal to young adolescents and be doable with a minimum of hot liquids, sharp knives, and electrical appliances other than the stove, wrangled by a GH (Rayspeak for grownup helper). I confess some of the dishes may violate the sensibilities of an adult aware of the evils of additives in commercial preparations, but the recipes may still be a good source of ideas.<br /><br />The recipes for 7 years and older take a big step up in complexity and palatability. They start to fit the typical Rachael Ray template, and, she claims they are suitable for grownups' tastes as well as for kids. One thing which appeals to me and which I hope appeals to kids is that the book does not dumb down the language. Sushi, paninis, and crudites appear undisguised with any Rayspeak pseudonyms.<br /><br />There is a fair amount of kid talk that may or may not work. As soon as I reached the third grade, my greatest ambition was to graduate to the adult stacks of our city library, which denied access to all who were less than 12 years of age. This is probably what led me to start buying books, as the material in the children's room simply did not satisfy me after the age of nine. I worry that the more precocious cooks to whom this book is addressed may be impatient with the aspects of the book clearly designed to interest young readers. If you have an especially bright kid who shows a great interest in food and cooking, neither Emeril's nor Rachael's book will be as good as Jamie Oliver's third American book `Happy Days with the Naked Chef'.<br /><br />All the recipes after this show little difference from material in Rachael Ray's earlier '30 Minute Meal' books. I am happy that although the '30 Minute Meal' trademark is in the title, Ms. Ray doesn't belabor this point in the text, as you do not want to rush things with kids in the kitchen with the abundance of heat, electricity, water, sharp edges, heavy metal, slippery surfaces, and germs.<br /><br />The biggest difference between Rachael's entry and Emeril's `There's a Chef in My Family' and `There's a Chef in My Soup' is that `Cooking Rocks' addresses three different age groups while Emeril's first book addresses the youngest chef candidates while the second addresses teenage and sub-teenage student cooks who would have no trouble reading the entire book on their own. Another big difference is in the way the authors present themselves and their audience. It is telling that Emeril appears in photographs while his audience is present as cartoons. In Rachael's book, her students appear in photographs while she and her sidekick dog Boo are present as cartoons.<br /><br />While I am really inclined to prefer Rachael's book, I think Emeril's second book has a lot more substance. Rachael's biggest original contribution to the dialogue is the lecture to adults on how to approach kids and cooking. Rachael also does a great service to the grownup helpers (GH, remember) by giving kid friendly directions to help find many of the ingredients in your favorite megamart. I am of two minds about Rachael's Rayspeak, the most famous example of which is `evoo' standing for extra virgin olive oil. I would have no objections to this if it were a general culinary term, but it is unique to Rachael and her family and, probably now to battalions of her TV fans. I have much less objection to her teaching kids to estimate amounts, as this is how cooks really work. I especially notice she is careful to direct kids to taste for seasoning. I also give Rachael and her publisher high marks for a very reasonable price and spiral binding which makes the book very easy to use in the kitchen.<br /><br />Rachael is great with her kid sous chefs on TV and has a very light touch in print. I recommend this book, but I cannot rate it higher than Emeril's book, so I give both four stars.eril's first book addresses the youngest chef candidates while the second addresses teenage and sub-teenage student cooks who would have no trouble reading the entire book on their own.

Highly Recommended.	`Little Cakes' by professional writer and `cookbook archeologist' Susan Waggoner is a very pleasant discovery I am happy to recommend to all, especially occasional bakers who want to go just one step beyond the Duncan Hines and Betty Crocker packages to make cakes from scratch. In spite of the delightful watercolor illustrations dotting the dust jacket, I was expecting a weak effort on petit fours and other less than useful preparations. This especially in light of my recently having reviewed expert baker and baking writer Flo Braker's reissued `Sweet Miniatures'. I was very pleasantly surprised with what I found.<br /><br />For starters `little cakes' in this book means primarily single layer cakes baked in an 8-inch square or round pan, with icing. There are plenty of recipes which can be adapted to two or three layers, and the author gives many suggestions for same, but the heart of the matter is cakes baked with a relatively small amount of batter for a relatively short time. Within those constraints, the variety of cakes presented in this delightful book is wide indeed. The basic types include silver cake, white cake, white chocolate cake, yellow cake, gold cake, genoise (French sponge cake), whipped cream cake, chocolate cakes, devils food cake, marble cakes, `German' chocolate cake, flourless chocolate cake, red velvet cake, pound cake, marble pound cake, butter pecan loaf, lemon pudding cake, orange cake, banana cake, grapefruit cake, pineapple upside-down cake, raisin spice cake, oatmeal cake, pumpkin cake, gingerbread, carrot  cake, walnut cake, spice cakes, sandwich cakes, tea cakes, ginger buttons, petit fours, icebox cakes, ladyfingers, and cheesecakes. I will be happy to forgive the author for including cheesecake (a cheese custard pie) and other non-caky desserts such as trifles and tiramisu, as she has successfully created a highly accessible source of good recipes for quick reference when you do not want to wade through a 600 page tome to find something quick for a last minute baking need.<br /><br />The litany of cake types above is multiplied by pairing each type of `crumb' with an appropriate icing, of which Ms. Waggoner gives several such as whipped creams, lady Baltimore frosting, white decorator icing, basic vanilla icing, basic chocolate frosting, lavish fudge frosting, chocolate ganache, white chocolate buttercream, white chocolate meringue, basic cream cheese frosting, grapefruit frosting, powdered sugar glaze, quick-set fondant, browned butter frosting, peanut butter frosting, penuche frosting, and caramel icing. On top of these are recipes for fillings and syrups for `kicking things up a notch' to borrow a phrase from someone.<br /><br />While Ms. Waggoner does not have the professional baking credentials of Flo Braker or Nick Malgieri or Gayle Ortiz or Gail Gand, she is no slouch when it comes to starting one out with excellent advice on how to go about baking a good, simple cake. As far as I can tell, she touches all the right bases and gives absolutely no spurious advice. Some practical folk may object to her ward against using an oil spray from an aerosol can to lubricate a pan. I suggest those folk go and read the ingredients on those little cans and realize that the `no fat added' advertising claim is based on a fuzziness in the labeling law which says that if the amount is less than 1%, it can be deemed zero. The wrapper or a stub end of a stick of butter will give no more fat and probably be a lot healthier. A huzzah for Ms. Waggoner on this point.<br /><br />For those of us who bake cakes only about three or four times a year, I still recommend Ms. Waggoner's book, as it is a very entertaining read for foodies as well as being an exceptionally good quick reference for a wide variety of basic cake types. The very short biography on the dust jacket says Ms. Waggoner enjoys rummaging through old magazines and newspapers for recipes. Well, she has really put all that rummaging to good use. Before the recipe for each major classic recipe, there is a little story on the source and age of the recipe and where it has been between the time it was created and its appearance in this little book. There are even some references to that greatest of pastry chefs Antonin Careme who is credited with the invention of the strawberry charlotte russe.<br /><br />It is a small point for a book of such high quality recipes, technique, and stories, but the book is also exceptionally well designed to be both pleasant to read and easy to follow when you are doing recipes. The watercolor illustrations contribute little to the appreciation of the end result, but they succeed in being very decorative.<br /><br />I compared some of Ms. Waggoner's recipes to my favorites and I will not give up my Nick Malgieri recipes for carrot cake or gingerbread and I will not stop referring to Rose Levy Beranbaum or Shirley Corriher for advice on what went wrong with my genoise, and I will definitely go to Maida Heatter when I want a seriously impressive production, but I will definitely turn to Ms. Waggoner the next time I need something I can make quickly from the pantry of a very short trip to the local grocery store.<br /><br />Highly recommended to all foodies, occasional bakers, and readers in general.se.

Highly Recommended	`Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking' is Marcella Hazan's fourth book, composed of an edited and updated amalgam of her first two books, both of which were on `classic Italian cooking'. As with all of Ms. Hazan's books except for her latest, `Marcella Says', my main regret is that I have not read them sooner. All, especially this volume, are every bit as good as the blurbs may lead you to believe.<br /><br />Some reviewers have compared this book to `The Joy of Cooking'. It is much more accurate to compare it to Julia Child's seminal `Mastering the Art of French Cooking' on several counts. First, like Child's book, Hazan's book is devoted exclusively to the techniques, ingredients, and recipes of a single major national cuisine. Second, unlike `The Joy of Cooking', it does not cover absolutely every kitchen technique and issue such as hygiene, nutrition, preserving, and obscure game meats. Third, the book is published and edited by the same people, Knopf and senior editor Judith Jones. This common publishing team means the two books have a very similar look. Both are illustrated by line drawings and both benefit from Knopf's traditional skill in designing the typeface and layout of books in general for easy reading. Fourth, Ms. Hazan arrived at cooking in almost exactly the same manner as Julia Child, in that they found themselves married to men who likes to eat well, and they did not know how to cook at the time.<br /><br />The 64-dollar question of course is whether this book is equal in quality to Child's book. I think there is little shame in saying that while Hazan's book stands head and shoulders over virtually every other book I have read and reviewed on Italian cuisine, it does not quite match Child et al on the latters' innovations in recipe writing, the great good humor of the writing, and the comprehensive treatment of virtually every aspect of French kitchen equipment and the `cuisine bourgeois' techniques.<br /><br />This book by Dr. Hazan (she has a Ph.D. in natural sciences and biology) is the exception which proves Tony Bourdain's observation in his excellent new cookbook which claims that cooking professionals are mostly just ordinary blokes who happen to have learned a skill which you the reader do not yet have. This applies as much to most cookbook authors as it does to most chefs. The thing that separates most good cookbook authors (witness Jamie Oliver) from their readers is their passion for the importance of good ingredients, careful observation of technique, and love of achieving a desirable result. Ms. Hazan is one of the very, very few writers who approach their subject as much with the rigor of an academic as with the passion of a good cook. Ms. Hazan's academic voice is much more anthropological and phenomenological than it is scientific a la Shirley Corriher.<br /><br />Ms. Hazan succeeds in distilling for us the essence of Italian savory cuisine based on the notions of battuto (an Italian trinity of lard, parsley, and onion, chopped fine), soffritto (battuto saut&eacute;ed until onion is translucent and garlic is pale gold), and insaporire (the technique of preparing ingredient such as the battuto and additions to extract flavor from the primary ingredients and impart that flavor to other ingredients, as when the flavors of the soffritto are imparted to the rice in making a risotto). After introducing these essential concepts, she gives us a very detailed tour of the most important ingredients in Italian cooking. To the casual American reader who may not have been schooled by `Molto Mario', there are some surprises, such as the fact that garlic is not as important an ingredient as you may believe. Another culture shock is the difference between the French stock and the Italian broth, and Ms. Hazan's insistence that using the former is simply not Italian cooking, thank you. That is not to say that there are not at least some things in common between French and Italian cooking. The most prominentis Bechamel sauce (Salsa Balsamella), made in exactly the same manner in Rome as it is in Paris. I am reluctant to steal any thunder from Ms. Hazan, but I must pass on to you her excellent suggestion for cutting your own scallopine from the top round, so that you can be sure of getting it cut against the grain.<br /><br />If there is any dissonance in Ms. Hazan's presentation, it is in her paean to the regionality of Italian cooking, where, for example, the cuisines of Bologna and Florence, just 60 miles apart, is almost as different from one another as the cuisines of Venice and Naples, which are over 400 miles apart. The geographical origin of most (but not all) recipes is given in the headnotes, yet the general discussion of Italian technique makes no notice of this great geographical variety.<br /><br />Like Child's book (taking volumes I and II together) and unlike virtually every other book on Italian cooking, this volume deals with so much more than the usual 6 chapters in that it has large, separate chapters on Soups, Pasta, Risotto, Gnocchi, Crespelle (Italian for crepes), Polenta, Frittate, Fish and Shellfish, Fowl and Rabbit, Veal, Beef, Lamb, Pork, Variety Meats, Vegetables (very large chapter), Salads, Desserts, Breads, and typical Italian menus. Also like Child's books and unlike her later books, this volume does deal almost exclusively with traditional dishes. I cannot guarantee that the book is complete, as it is missing any reference to Puttanesca or saltimbocca, two certifiable classics of regional Italian cuisine. But, completeness is not the objective here. The main objective is to teach you how to cook like an Italian.<br /><br />This book does not replace the dozens of good books on Italian regional cooking and it does not replace good books on Italian specialities, such as Carol Field's book on Italian baking. But, it should be the very first book you buy on Italian cooking to better understand what it is these other books are saying.is Bechamel sauce (Salsa Balsamella), made in exactly the same manner in Rome as it is in Paris.

Excellent	Working backward from Marcella Hazan's latest work, this book `Marcella's Italian Kitchen' is the third of Ms. Hazan's books I will be reviewing. Following Ms. Hazan's advice early in this book to pay very close attention to words and exactly what they say, I adduce (and confirm by a reading of many prefaces to the various recipes) that this book is less about traditional Italian recipes than it is about recipes collected by and prepared by Ms. Hazan in her own kitchen, personal or classroom, which are done in the Italian style. And, Ms. Hazan goes to very great lengths to define exactly what that Italian style is. She does this to a depth of detail which puts overshadows virtually all other popular American interpreters of Italian cuisine. That is not to say she disagrees with them. Part of my confidence in stating that Ms. Hazan is giving us the right stuff is based on my having read and heard the same themes from other respected authorities such as Mario Batali, Lydia Bastianich, and Nancy Harmon Jenkins. It means she both takes everything just one step further into the authentic soul of Italian cooking, and explains those steps in depth, leaving virtually nothing to the imagination or to an invocation of some sense of the spiritual as Ms. Grace Young does when she rhapsodizes over `wok hay' or `The Breath of the Wok' in a recent work.<br /><br />Be clear that Ms. Hazan's devotion to an authentically Italian style of cooking does lead her to hold strong positions that violate some conventional American wisdom on Italian cooking. Some of these positions are easy to understand for anyone who has watched two or three `Molto Mario' shows, such as the banishment of bread flavored with butter and garlic to the realm of the inauthentic sham posing as `garlic bread'. True Italian garlic bread or bruschetta is always oiled with olive oil and not butter. And, the authentic article is grilled. A more difficult precept is the banishing of French style stocks from the making of Italian soups. I have even seen a review of her later book, `Marcella Cucina', criticize her strongly for this position, in spite of the fact that Batali, Bastianich, and Bugialli all agree with Ms. Hazan. It is easy to make this mistake, as there are probably tens of thousands of recipes in America that innocently build a suppa or ministre with chicken stock from a can. In better books, the authors probably recommend these soups be made with homemade STOCKS based on a recipe straight from their favorite French cooking authority. An even more surprising statement is when Ms. Hazan admonishes us not to add Parmigiano Reggiano to sauces based on olive oil. Even I find this a little hard to take, unless on understands this to mean that you do not flavor the final dish with both fresh olive oil AND freshly grated cheese. She even disagrees with my hero Mario in professing to use prefer only fresh tomatoes in cooking, and canned tomatoes, even San Marzano tomatoes are second best. My verdict on all of this is to go back to the title and remind you, dear reader, that Ms. Hazan is teaching us her interpretation of true Italian kitchen practice. If you accept her on that basis, she is simply the best there is writing in English.<br /><br />If you are not happy with these constraints, consult the dozens of good books of recipes inspired by the Italian cuisine such as those from Lydia Bastianich,  Jamie Oliver and Rogers and Gray of River Caf&eacute;.<br /><br />Focusing on the `Marcella' in the title be sure to understand that many of the recipes in this book are Ms. Hazan's inventions. What makes this so delightful is that her stories about how many of these dishes came about match exactly the analysis of Tom Colicchio in `How to Think Like a Chef' where he says that chefs do not conceive of a dish then go out to shop for the right ingredients. Exactly the opposite is true. Most original dishes arise when the cook is faced with a limited set of available ingredients. `Necessity is the mother of invention' was never truer than when it is applied to the cook in the kitchen. And, all the invention is done while remaining true to the principles of the Italian kitchen.<br /><br />Since Ms. Hazan how has five books on exactly the same subject, one can be concerned that one may be better than the others. Pending my review of her earliest books, I will say that there is some repetition of introductory information across volumes and some duplication of descriptions of basic techniques such as the making of fresh pasta, but there is no duplication of recipes. And, not only is there no overlap of recipes, each book presents the material in a somewhat different way, making the encounter that much more interesting. I will say that the lessons on fresh pasta making are a bit better in `Marcella Cucina' than they are in the present volume, as the newer book adds very good pictures to the text to guide the student. Also, the discussion of the foundations of Italian technique including the notion of `insaporire' is better in `Marcella Says' than in the current book. Yet, this volume contains many pages of general information and advice that is in neither of the other books I have reviewed.<br /><br />Like her other books, recipes for pasta dishes are the stars, outnumbering all other recipes. Unlike `Marcella Cucina' where the pasta recipes were all about the sauces, the current volume matches the sauce to the pasta, giving the reader the whole dish. The very best things about the recipes are that they are spelled out in great detail, making them simple for even a novice. As Ms. Hazan does in every book, be warned that simple is not easy, but she takes you by the hand through each step.<br /><br />Highly recommended.essity is the mother of invention' was never truer than when it is applied to the cook in the kitchen.

Highly Recommended	Reading `Marcella Cucina', the fourth book by culinary educator Marcella Hazan doubles my dispair at not reading her sooner, especially after just having read and reviewed her latest book, `Marcella Says'. This is not to say that the dozens of other books I have read on Italian cuisine are not good, it is just that Ms. Hazan is so obviously among the cream of the crop, I would have been a better judge of those other books if I had digested Ms. Hazan before sitting down at the table with Batalli, Bastianich, Bugialli, and a legion of Italian regional specialist writers plus all the writers covering the Mediterranean as a whole.<br /><br />This book has just a slightly less concentrated level of wisdom than the latest work, but you definitely deserve to own and read both if you are fond of Italian cooking. There is some overlap, but this volume is definitely superior to `Marcella Says' in several regards, especially in the very well illustrated instructions on making fresh pasta by hand.<br /><br />As the title suggests, `Marcella Cucina' is about the cooking which Ms. Hazan does in the privacy of her own kitchen. That is not to say that all the recipes are Hazan inventions constructed from whole cloth. My sense is that about half of the recipes are from native Italian cooks and professional chefs and about half are inventions of Ms. Hazan. But, even the inventions are so true to the spirit of the Italian table that you can hardly tell the difference. Ms. Hazan professes to be a great believer in the principle of `terroir', or things that grow together, go together. She has little use for fusion cooking. On the other hand, while she is a native of Emilia-Romagna and a resident of Venice when this book was written, Ms. Hazan takes her inspirations from all over the Italian peninsula, from Genoa and Venice in the north to Sicily in the south to Sardinia in the west.<br /><br />I always thought it ironic that my great culinary hero Mario Batali would constantly mention how so much of the Italian cuisine was based on poverty, and how, therefore, so much of the Italian cuisine was vegetarian, with meat being used more as a condiment than as a major source of protein. Yet, every `Molto Mario' show seemed to feature a dish involving a large hunk of pork or chicken or beef or lamb or veal, even if it was a `poor man's cut' such as the pig's jowl or the lamb's shoulder. Ms. Hazan does not commit that anomaly. Her subjects, in order of greatest to least number of recipes are:<br /><br />Pasta, including a 13 page essay with pictures on how to make fresh egg pasta using a manual pasta machine, a dowel rolling pin, and the Maccheroni alla Chitarra of Abruzzi. Like all great writers on Italian cuisine, Ms. Hazan does not look down on dry pasta. Fresh and dry pasta are two different products enhanced by two different types of sauces. She does look down on fresh supermarket pastas artificially kept soft with additives. She recommends fresh homemade pasta left to dry to soft supermarket fare doped with artificial ingredients. I love the Anglo-Italiaphile recipes from Jamie Oliver and the River Caf&eacute;, as they are typically both delicious and simple, but Ms. Hazan is the real deal. She gives us 27 different pasta sauces based on tomato, dairy, and olive oil from Liguria, Sardinia, Venice, Naples, and the hunter's cabin in the Apennines. After reading this chapter, I find it hard to even look at a commercially bottled pasta sauce without a guilty conscience. This very long chapter ends with eight very special recipes for stuffed pastas such as raviolis, tortellonis, and pies.<br /><br />Vegetables, the European Mediterranean coast's gift to the world's cuisine. While the Slavs make the most of the simple green head cabbage, the Italians glorify all manner of cruciform veggies. Add to this their love of beans, artichokes, celery, radicchio, zucchini, eggplant, peppers, and wild mushrooms, and you wonder that they ever missed meat. As tomatoesare a minor player in this chapter, you can get a good sense of what the Italian table was like before the discovery of the New World. The introductory chapter on shopping at the Venetian Rialto market makes me instantly jealous of those who live in Venice.<br /><br />Appetizers, with a special emphasis on frittatas and stuffed vegetables. Aside from the first recipe for the Friuli frico, there are few familiar recipes here. Many, to my knowledge, are seen in this book for the first time. A highlight of this chapter is a delightful recipe for `Sardinian Sheet Music Bread', a semolina flatbread related to pita.<br /><br />Meat, including veal, beef, lamb, and pork, with a selection of involtini (rolled meat) breaded scaloppini's, stews, braises, roasts, and boils.<br /><br />Fish, with a remarkable absence of recipes for salt cod. The featured proteins are scallops, swordfish, squid, bluefish, and salmon. Yum!<br /><br />Soups, especially the simple ministre style of peasant soup, with most recipes featuring one type of bean and one type of green. All soups use the simple meat brodo rather than the French stock. None of these soups are thickened by puree and Ms. Hazan is explicitly opposed to thickening by roux.<br /><br />Salads, including some new and some old. I forgive Ms. Hazan for including a recipe for two different versions of the Caprese salad because she included two new potato salad recipes.<br /><br />Desserts. All the usual fruit, cream, nut, custard, and gelato suspects.<br /><br />Poultry and Rabbit make me wish rabbit was more commonly available in my local megamart.<br /><br />Risotto and Polenta. Enough said.<br /><br />If one were to learn nothing else from this book, it would be to concentrate on letting ingredients speak for themselves with a bit of help from salt rather than loading them up with garlic and other condiments.<br /><br />My judgment so far is that you cannot own too many books by Marcella Hazan.oes are a minor player in this chapter, you can get a good sense of what the Italian table was like before the discovery of the New World.

Buy It!	If you have one Italian cookbook or a hundred, you still need this book!<br /><br />It belongs to an elite class of cookbooks which explain how and why techniques we have seen on dozens of `Molto Mario' and `Naked Chef' and `Ciao Italia' shows for years, and explains them in terms which are easy to understand, practical to apply to new recipes, and make it easier to successfully improvise in cooking.<br /><br />Marcella Hazan has long been the first among the leading writer / educators of general Italian cuisine such as Lydia Bastianich and Giuliano Bugialli plus the great regional specialists such as Lynn Rosetto Kaspar and baking specialists such as Carole Field. And, she has been doing it for close to 30 years, long before the current crop of excellent advocates of genuine regional Italian cooking.<br /><br />This legion of writers have produced mountains of books on the cooking of great Italian restaurants, whole mountain ranges of books on cooking from the various regions of Italy, both individually and collectively, and whole libraries of great books on Italian influenced cuisine from transplanted Italiophiles such as Jamie Oliver and Rose Gray and Ruth Rodgers. And yet, very few of these books have explained much of Italian cooking with an analytical eye honed by decades of practice. The only book on cooking which comes close to this enormously revealing work is Paul Bertolli's book `Cooking by Hand'. And, even this excellent book suffers in comparison in that it overlays common sense techniques with the obsessions of a professional chef which a home cook will typically find much to extreme to embrace with an equal vigor.<br /><br />This, Ms. Hazan succeeds not only in turning an analytical eye on everyday cooking techniques, but she also presents her observations with a simplicity which even the most casual cook of pasta and sauces can appreciate.<br /><br />The first sign that I was dealing with a very important book was when I began reading Ms. Hazan's discussion of `insaporire', an Italian culinary term which Hazan believes has no easy English translation, yet an understanding of this term explains the technique, `arrosolare' behind thousands of different Italian inspired recipes. `arrosolare' is the technique whereby an ingredient is saut&eacute;ed with just the right amount of heat for just the right amount of time to reach a state of `insaporire' where just the right taste has been coaxed from the food. An important aspect of this state and technique is that they are best done to individual ingredients that are then combined in a dish after each as been brought to the perfect state of tastiness. The simplest example of this is the very common technique of heating garlic in a fat to just slightly brown, when the garlic is either removed from the fat or the temperature of the pan is lowered by adding another ingredient, usually onions. The technique for making risotto is offered as another prime example of `insaporire', in that rice is added to the base ingredients of oil and savory flavorings only when the base tastes have been fully developed.<br /><br />Proper heat level and `doneness' are also discussed in connection with `insaporire', as the former is the best means to reach this state, and the latter means that we have attained this most desirable state. On heat, Ms. Hazan's advice is one of the very few times when an important authority has disagreed with my culinary hero, Mario Batali. Mario constantly cites the use of a very high heat. Marcella is much more prudent in warning us to use `no less and no more heat than you need'. On doneness, Marcella gives us a simple tip on sauces that I have failed to find in over 300 cookbooks. That is, when a sauce started by saut&eacute;ing ingredients with water on an oil base demonstrates that all the water has evaporated and the remaining liquid is only the oil, you are done. She offers two simple, easily observed methods for detecting this state. Another basic technique I have seen nowhere else is the suggestion to use high walled saucepans for long cooking sauces and low walled sautee pans for fast cooking sauces.<br /><br />I have read a dozen or more discussions of techniques for making fresh pasta, yet none are quite as good as the one given in this book in its simplicity, authenticity, and genuineness in encouraging one to take up the effort with full confidence that you will produce a successful product. The fresh pasta discussion is supplemented by a brief geography and history of pasta in Italy with a rather droll take on that hoary old Marco Polo story of the way in which macaroni arrived in Italy from China. She explains why good dried pasta products are good, based on the way they are made by automated, yet still artisinally based methods.<br /><br />Mario constantly praises the Italian practice of using a simple `brodo' in contrast to elaborate French stocks, yet neither Mario nor any other writer on Italian cuisine has shown me a recipe which produces something which is really different from a classic French stock. Marcella Hazan not only clearly explains the difference between the Italian brodo and the French stock, but gives a recipe for brodo which looks quite different from a recipe by Jacques Pepin, Julia Child, or the CIA.<br /><br />All of this just scratches the surface of the wealth of cooking wisdom in this book. Just as when I read a Rogers and Gray book of River Caf&eacute; recipes for the first time, I am distressed that I have not paid attention to Ms. Hazan's works sooner. At the average cookbook list price of $35, the 78 page chapter `At Master Class' alone is worth this price. On top of this remarkable essay, we get chapters on all the classic Italian dishes.<br /><br />This is easily one of the ten most useful cookbooks out of the 300 some volumes I have reviewed.ue I have seen nowhere else is the suggestion to use high walled saucepans for long cooking sauces and low walled sautee pans for fast cooking sauces. <br /> <br />I have read a dozen or more discussions of techniques for making fresh pasta, yet none are quite as good as the one given in this book in its simplicity, authenticity, and genuineness in encouraging one to take up the effort with full confidence that you will produce a successful product.

Almost every culinary celebrity cookbook aims at some twist to promote the career of the chef / author, and Emeril's latest book, `Emeril's Potluck' is no exception. What is distinctive about this effort is that it is so different from other celebrity chefs' offerings. Other recent culinary celebrity books I have reviewed have a slant aimed at foodies (serious amateur cooks) as with Rocco DiSpirito's `Taste' and Ming Tsai's `Simply Ming' or aimed at one of the current culinary hot buttons, as with Jacques Pepin's `Fast Food My Way' or `Cat Cora's Kitchen' which focuses on reminiscences and Greek cuisine. Emeril has gone his own way with at least two very distinct slants. The first is with the book's titled theme, potluck dishes and the second is the person and the business of the titular author, Emeril Lagasse.<br /><br />There is a new interest in the first slant, with a recent very good book by leading culinary commentator James Villas entitled `Crazy for Casseroles' and an artfully done book on comfort foods, `Lost Recipes' by Marian Cunningham. But, this is hardly a hot topic like low carbs and fast cooking. In fact, the collection of recipes in this book is so basic that a final edit could have framed the recipes in the book in at least three different directions, toward comfort food, fast preparation dishes, and `family style' eating. In fact, the book reminds me of a story told about an information science book of about 20 years ago where it was claimed that at the last minute, in the light of the fast rise of object oriented programming and design, the author did a global change to the text with his word processor to change all occurrences of `procedure' and `subroutine' to `object'. It would not be hard to do a similar operation on this book with practically no harm done to the presentation or relevance of the recipes. This impression is reinforced by the fact that many of the `potluck' iconed sidebars have notes which have little or nothing to do with transporting the dish to your neighbor or the local parish.<br /><br />The second slant of this book is the personality and product line of the author, Emeril Lagasse. Emeril is probably as little liked by foodie types as he is liked by the occasional food show viewer who treats `Emeril Live' as just a different flavor of reality show which is what it is. The great irony of the Food Network programming is that the greatest success in their shows and book publishing goes to culinary educators Alton Brown and Rachael Ray, while mainstream restaurateur culinary critics give Emeril's shows. Emeril's personality and marketing angles pervade the book. Every third recipe seems to include one of his products, primarily his spice mix, `Essence' as an ingredient. The locations and means of reaching his restaurants are in the back of his book. The web site addresses of all his commercial connections from the Food Network to All Clad to B& G foods are also in the back of the book. But, the most pervasive presence is Emeril's quite familiar persona in the introduction to each recipe.<br /><br />Emeril's theme, encapsulated in his trademark exclamations, `Bam', `Kick it up a notch', `Gaaaarlic' and `Pork Fat Rules' is that his cooking takes traditional recipes and improves on them. This is dramatically different from the mantra of almost every other food writer today, where the holy of holies is fresh local ingredients. In a sense, I really respect Emeril for not beating this horse any more than it already has, and for touting his claims that he is presenting improved versions of comfort food classics.<br /><br />Emeril's selection of recipes could fit a book on entertaining, fast cooking, comfort food, or cooking at home as well as his `potluck' rubric. This means that Emeril has managed to put together a truly useful book for the average cook, and I celebrate him for doing so. The recipe chapters are:<br /><br />Basics: Syrups, salsas, mayonnaise, and simple recipes for basic stocks.<br /><br />Drinks: Inexpensive variations on classics, all tasty and homey such as eggnog.<br /><br />Starters: As I said, a good source of material for entertaining.<br /><br />Salads: More classics such as Nicoise Salad, Pasta Salad, Green Bean Salad, Coleslaw, and Potato Salad<br /><br />Soups and Gumbos: Chowder, Corn, and Leeks, oh my.<br /><br />Casseroles: The main event which sticks to the familiar like lasagna Bolognese, ham and potato, penne a la vodka, and chicken potpies.<br /><br />Beyond Casseroles: Comfort food which does not come in a gratineed in a porcelain dish such as fried chicken, chicken chili, shrimp etouffee, pot roast, brisket, and stuffed peppers. Emeril even glorifies the hoary old green bean casserole with the addition of two different Emeril packaged food products plus Fontina cheese.<br /><br />Breads: Cornbread, Biscuits, and Dinner Roles.<br /><br />Desserts: More classics such as carrot cake spice cake, pound cake, and strawberry shortcake.<br /><br />If you are a devoted foodie and already own 20 or more cookbooks, buying this volume will probably not make a big impression on your collection of recipes, as you will already have three recipes for chili, seven recipes for coleslaw, and ten recipes for chicken stock. But, if you just have a `Joy of Cooking' and want some modern recipes with a bit more cachet to your non-foodie friends, this is the book for you. I doubly respect Emeril for the very moderate list price for this volume which fit's its image as a cookbook for everyman. For this, I will forgive him for putting his picture on every other page. The recipes are all good and simple and none violate any culinary gods. Even if they are not great, they will be easy and delicious. A few have a lot of ingredients, but none of them are exotic. Emeril even does us the favor of substituting familiar ingredients for the esoteric, as when he replaces crawfish with shrimp. A crustacean by any other name.....<br /><br />Good, familiar, inexpensive, commercial laden recipes.asic stocks. <br />Drinks: Inexpensive variations on classics, all tasty and homey such as eggnog. <br />Starters: As I said, a good source of material for entertaining. <br />Salads: More classics such as Nicoise Salad, Pasta Salad, Green Bean Salad, Coleslaw, and Potato Salad <br />Soups and Gumbos: Chowder, Corn, and Leeks, oh my. <br />Casseroles: The main event which sticks to the familiar like lasagna Bolognese, ham and potato, penne a la vodka, and chicken potpies. <br />Beyond Casseroles: Comfort food which does not come in a gratineed in a porcelain dish such as fried chicken, chicken chili, shrimp etouffee, pot roast, brisket, and stuffed peppers.

This is one of those rare books who begin with great promise, starting with the excellent photography and design composition on the cover and the acknowledgments giving thanks to every major Chinese-American chef and culinary educator from Martin Yan, Ken Hom, and Ming Tsai on down (This is an extreme case of inflation similar to the absurd level of detail to which movie credits now go).<br /><br />The description of the book's subject on the cover is \\"Unlocking the Spirit of Chinese Wok Cooking Through Recipes and Lore\\". This is an especially accurate characterization of the book's contents, in spite of the fact that the book occasionally strays into discussions of history, chemistry, and sociology. And, the book does not fare well in these supplementary topics, in spite of the fact that it does a good job of addressing it's primary subject.<br /><br />Before addressing what is good about the book, I will point out what I found weak about the book.<br /><br />First, the book spends a lot of time on discussing the differences between the `northern' wok with a long handle and the southern or Cantonese wok with two ear-shaped handles, yet at no point is there a simple picture of the two side by side to make clear in the reader's mind the differences. And, although there are allusions to techniques which are appropriate to one style and not the other (one can saute' or `jump' ingredients with the long-handled northern style but not the southern style') there is no serious discussion of this technique.<br /><br />Second, the book intimates that the wok, unlike any western cooking implement, can perform just about every savory cooking method there is, including braising, steaming, poaching, and deep-frying. I don't object to claims for poaching and there is no question that steaming has been a time-honored use of the wok for centuries, with special bamboo steamers of ancient design constructed especially for the purpose. On the other side of the coin, I cannot seriously agree that the wok is a good tool for either braising or deep-frying. Classic braising requires a low pot with a tight fitting lid that can fit in the oven. Similarly, deep-frying requires a LOT of oil in contrast to the very little oil that is the forte of the wok's techniques.<br /><br />Third, the author explains how to season a traditional iron or carbon steel wok, and does not succeed in explaining why Chinese chives are used in this seasoning technique. Part of her explanation for the efficacy of heating the wok while coating the surface with oil is that the pores in the metal open with the high heat and are more easily filled with the oil. The problem with this is that Shirley Corriher has claimed exactly the opposite behavior for heated metal cooking utensils in explaining why high heat will improve the non-sticking properties of the pan by closing the pores and cracks in the metal. The author mentions that the traditional oil for seasoning is pork fat, but fails to point out why this is actually desirable even today. My interpretation is that animal fats are a good choice because they are solid at room temperature and they go rancid much more slowly than vegetable oils.<br /><br />After saying all that, I must repeat that the author does succeed in bringing to life the `wok hay' or breath of the wok for non-Chinese readers like myself. Aside from excellent recipes covering a large number of different cooking techniques and ingredients, the author recounts several especially warm family gatherings involving both her own family of aunties, uncles, and cousins and the family of novelist Amy Tan.<br /><br />Another very nice aspect of the book is on the opening pages which have a quick tour of howwoks are made by hand in rural and suburban blacksmith shops and how they are used by rapidly disappearing street food vendors at a `dai pai dong' in the outskirts of Foshan. After the rather loosely organized historical and cultural tour, the author gets down to the serious business of how to select, buy, season, and clean a good wok. For cooks with standard home cooking ranges, the author strongly recommends a carbon steel wok with a flat bottom and discourages us from using stainless steel, nonstick surfaced, electric, or multilayered metals. Oddly, she does not give an opinion on purely aluminum woks. The instructions for seasoning are thorough, with six different methods from which to choose. I feel the discussion of technique is much better than the explanations for how these techniques work. The book now addresses it's heart, the notion of `wok hay', which I feel the author turns into something which is just a bit more mystical than it really is. If Marcella Hazen can spell out with clear sentences some notions that are at the heart of Italian cooking technique, then why must Ms. Young resort to metaphor and reverence for what is simply a matter of technique.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the portions of the book devoted to recipes, especially the excellent discussion of making the famous pork barbecue steamed dumplings, as done by the family of Amy Tan. Recipes also cover stir-frying poultry, meat, seafood, rice and noodles, vegetables plus smoking, pan-frying, `braising', poaching, steaming, and deep-frying. The book ends with an excellent directory of Chinese pantry ingredients. This alone is worth the cost of the book. The appendices also include menus that would be of great use to a Chinese heritage or to someone who wishes to entertain in the Chinese manner.<br /><br />This is a beautiful, informative, and useful cookbook, essential to someone who wants to get the most from their wok. It must, however, be approached with a critical mind.ck tour of how woks are made by hand in rural and suburban blacksmith shops and how they are used by rapidly disappearing street food vendors at a `dai pai dong' in the outskirts of Foshan.

491263:US	39134375	R2P32XRE8IDUIO	0811835421	965232350	Joie Warner's Take a Tin of Tuna: 65 Inspired Recipes for Every Meal of the Day	Books	5	10	11	N	Y	Excellent Recipes for Star Pantry Item. Highly Recommended	Jolie Warner has produced another of her 20 cookbooks, `take a tin of tuna', in that relatively undistinguished but very worthy genre of recipe collections centered around a single ingredient, in this case, canned tuna. While Ms. Warner does not have the high wattage name like Cat Cora, Tony Bourdain, or Rachael Ray, she is doing us a service as good or better than these very readable chef / authors. That is, she is giving us 65 recipes for an extremely inexpensive, durable staple. With this book and similar books on recipes for pasta, potatoes, sardines, corn meal, and canned tomatoes, one can live like a king with good recipes on a pauper's income. Ms. Warner has put one more nail in the coffin of my projected book on cooking cheaply but well.<br /><br />Before I go any further, I must put in a plug for canned tuna. Like several other ingredients that have been available in a can for a very long time, this product has virtually taken on a life of its own, completely distinct from the cuisine and recipes based on fresh tuna. Like salt cod, it is not only accepted as a different product, it is actually better for many recipes than the fresh flesh, which is both highly perishable and requires a fair amount of subtlety to cook well. Even the highest authorities on French cooking give us Salad Nicoise made with canned tuna.<br /><br />The first chapter in this book is the routine intro. on showing us around the varieties of canned tuna and itemizing good pantry items to have on hand to work with tuna. While this list, especially the first half, is better than most, it violates my standing rule about pantry lists in that it lists several relatively perishable items in the refrigerator and dried basil in the spice rack. I use lots of dried spices, but I would not use dried basil or parsley short of having a gun put to my head. Both are available fresh the year around and fresh parsley is usually dirt-cheap. I do respect the author's recommending selected national brands for bacon and mustard. I have seen good things said about her recommended products, but I have seen bad things said about them as well. Be very aware that in spite of the sense that it is virtually imperishable, please know that mustard looses its pizzazz after about three months in the bottle, so don't stockpile the stuff, especially the stuff shipped to us from France.<br /><br />Among the recipes, you will find all the old standards such as Salade Nicoise, Tuna salad, and Tuna casserole, but you will find lots of other goodies as well. The first chapter of recipes is on starters with recipes for stuff such as tuna tapenade, tuna dips, tuna and caper spread, tuna wontons, and tuna tapas, for example. I think I will pass on the tuna fondue.<br /><br />The second chapter of recipes gives us tuna coups and chowders where, among other things, we have tuna standing in for clams and keeping company with beans, corn, broccoli and cheddar, and tomatoes. I get strongly positive feelings about all these recipes. This may be worth the price of the book.<br /><br />The third chapter of recipes covers sandwiches, the home of the classic tuna melt. The author does here what lots of recipe writers do in turning a recipe for a salad into a sandwich, with virtually no alterations except that the ingredients are plopped between two halves of crusty bread. Ms. Joie does this with a tuna nicoise sandwich, simply leaving out the potato salad which, I'm sure, you will be happy to find as the featured side dish.<br /><br />The fourth chapter is the center ring for sure for the canned tuna show, as these are the salads, both classic and nuveo. The author essays tuna with lots of tomatoes, beans, curries, leafy veg, and Mexican themes. These recipes are more traditional than the soups, but swell to have all in one place.<br /><br />The last chapter of recipes is largely all the things that do not fit in other categories.

Better than Most	A few months ago I reviewed two books on Tuscan life and cuisine, `Ciao Italia in Tuscany' by PBS series host Mary Ann Esposito and `Simply Tuscan' by New York City restaurant chef / owner and curio shop impresario Pino Luongo. Neither book impressed me as giving a genuine picture of life in Tuscany, especially as it was before EuroAmerican homogenization took over. This book, `The Tuscan Year', Life and Food in an Italian Valley' by textile artist and Tuscan resident Elizabeth Romer is the real deal. The venue is an isolated valley in the southeastern corner of Tuscany, genuinely rural in that it is several dozen miles from the large cities of Florence and Sienna. The feeling the author gives about this lovely environment reminds me of the admittedly artificial feeling of lyric isolation from the cares of the world in the very obscure movie `The Hidden Valley' based in an isolated Swiss valley community surrounded by the ravages of the 30 years war.<br /><br />The major text of the book is in twelve chapters, one for each month of the year, beginning with January and ending with December. There are very few illustrations, limited to a few simple line drawings opening each chapter. The text is divided roughly equally between culinary information and recipes and non-culinary tales of the domestic, agricultural, and animal husbandry. The highest praise I can give this book is that it has a strong kinship in the style and quality of its content to Patience Gray's great culinary journal `Honey from a Weed' which I have been attempting to accurately review for over six months now.<br /><br />The main characters of the story are not the author and her family, but a native Tuscan family of Orlando and Silvana Cerotti  \\"of the remote mountain area between Cortona and Castiglion Fiorentino. They have a single son and they run their estate and live their lives in a traditional manner. They do this from choice not necessity. Their lives are bounded by the land, which they use to its fullest extent, and in this way they are virtually self-sufficient. Their property is extensive, stretching over 400 hectares, and includes acres of forest and arable land, streams, vineyards, many small houses and their own imposing fattoria with its surrounding walled kitchen garden, olive groves, chapel and outbuildings.\\"<br /><br />The most enheartening part of this story is the fact that the Cerotti's and their family and farm hands have been successful in maintaining a lifestyle that has the feel of dating back to the Renaissance, if not earlier. This is not a story of an agricultural estate in irreversable decline, although the family has cut back on some farm resources such as the herd of pigs. Rather than maintaining 100 swine, the family buys a pig each year and has it slaughtered and butchered by a professional travelling butcher. All the `charcuterie' is done on the premises by the butcher or the family. The hams are cured by Silvana and hung to dry in the attic. Orlando takes care of sausage making with the butcher.<br /><br />All the recipes are given `in context' in the month when their ingredients are in season and, where appropriate, in the liturgical season most appropriate for the dish. There are precious few culinary tips in the recipes and all are written in a narrative fashion, with no neat lists of ingredients and careful quantities, well-defined prep instructions, and numbered steps in the preparation. This is as much a book on anthropology as it is on things culinary. That is not to say the recipes cannot be made by an American suburbanite. If you have basic cooking skills and good instincts, you should have no problems with these recipes. Just be sure to read the author's notes on measuring at the end of the book. She is very much the student of Elizabeth David when it comes to weights and measures, using the proper Englishman's teaspoon, tablespoon, soup spoon, and teacup as measuring devices. The author gives some correlations of these devices to our shiny stainless steel measuring devices, but as Ms. Romer points out, Silvana used no measuring devices at all, so if I were you, I would get the lay of the land and proceed to measure things out by the seat of your pants. You will probably get a much more desirable result than if you try to exactly translate the measurements into the metric or something equally precise and irrelevant.<br /><br />My only reservations about the culinary contents of the book are in the recipes for brodo (stock) and in the absence of a recipe for the salt-free Tuscan bread. The brodo recipe calls for boiling the stock for three hours, which violates absolutely every single stock recipe I have ever read, in that stock ingredients are to be just brought to the edge of a boil, then simmered. Also, the rationale for the saltless Tuscan bread is given in great detail, but there is no recipe for same, and, I suspect you may have a very hard time finding true saltless bread in an American suburb. My local megamart carries a Tuscan loaf, but I will bet more than a few lire (or euros) on the fact that salt was used in the recipe.<br /><br />This book is first and foremost a delight to read. At the same time it is a valuable scholarly source document for a lifestyle which seems to be disappearing from around the world. Grab onto it and savor it while you can.<br /><br />Highly recommended to readers and cooks alike.ons of these devices to our shiny stainless steel measuring devices, but as Ms. Romer points out, Silvana used no measuring devices at all, so if I were you, I would get the lay of the land and proceed to measure things out by the seat of your pants.

Highly recommended	Cat Cora and her very southern American accent always presented something of an anomaly when she appeared on the Food Network with Rocco DiSpirito doing the Greek half of the Mediterranean food segments paired with Rocco's Italian dishes. This book fills out the explanation given on TV that Cat (Catherine) was born and raised in Jackson, Mississippi to Greek parents embedded in a strongly Greek neighborhood with all that entails, as seen in detail in the movie `My Big Fat Greek Wedding'.<br /><br />Cat has been working several different Food Network shows as well as several of her own California culinary shows and appearances on network talk shows for the last few years, establishing herself as a culinary celebrity staple equal to Tyler Florence and Sara Moulton, and just a notch below fast cooking diva Rachael Ray and super food nerd Alton Brown. This is her first book of recipes / memoirs and she has matched the quality of her equals, Tyler and Sara, and has made a very worthy contribution to the literature on Greek cooking.<br /><br />This is not a reference book on Greek food like Diane Kochilas' `The Glorious Foods of Greece' nor is it a popular survey of Greek cooking such as the recent `The Olive and the Caper' by Susanna Hoffman. It is a personal history of Cat's food experiences in her childhood Jackson home, in the ancestral home of her family on the Aegean island of Skopelos, Greece, in her California restaurant kitchens in northern California, and in her modern home kitchen. This orientation with the liberal notes on the niceties of Greek ingredients, her experiences with famous influences such as Julia Child, Jacques Pepin, Thomas Keller, and Alice Waters, and stories of her US and Greek family members make this a more than usually entertaining personal cookbook.<br /><br />Although the recipes are divided between four different venues, there is not a lot of differences between, for example, the dishes prepared in Jackson and the dishes prepared on Skopelos. They are all Greek recipes, methods, and ingredients. The Jackson recipes are the least Greek, as there is some Johnny Reb influence in some barbecue recipes, but every single recipe has both an English main name and an Greek name. Extra points to Cat for consistency in uniformly providing both names. Makes things much easier when comparing her recipes to standard works such as Kochilas' book.<br /><br />The first overall impression is the omnipresence of lemon as an ingredient. It is so pervasive that I wonder why Nancy Harmon Jenkins did not feature lemons in a chapter of her excellent `The Essential Mediterranean'. Another oddity is that the recipes from the island of Skopelos contain no fish. While Cat makes no note of this fact, it confirms an observation I saw in a book on Greek island cuisine that all the good Aegean fish is carted off to Athens to be sold. Little of it is eaten at home.<br /><br />Menus of dishes that typically go together organize all the recipes in the four sections. This enhances the use to which books of this type are most commonly put, as sources for themed entertaining. If you want to do a Greek dinner, this book is an excellent resource.<br /><br />Cat has the usual litany of praise for fresh ingredients and the usual tips for finding them. She has some special comments on important Greek ingredients such as feta. Apparently, most non-Greek Feta is bland when compared to the real thing, and, Dutch feta seems to be especially off the mark, but Cat does not elaborate. She is also especially fussy about getting red pearl onions instead of white for several dishes.<br /><br />I have made several dishes from this book and these I have found uniformly tasty and relatively easy to make. As all recipes are organized by dinner menu, there are a roughly equal number of appetizer, main dish, salad, and dessert recipes. The star of many of the dessert recipes, of course, is phyllo dough. I wish she had not mentioned that our freezer staplephyllo dough is a pale, fragile product compared to fresh phyllo, but I'll live, and may even seek out a local source for fresh phyllo.<br /><br />Like the Italian cuisine, there are lots of recipes for wild and bitter greens, beans, artichokes, tomatoes, bread, shellfish, and sardines. There are also plenty of recipes for chicken and lamb, some recipes for pork and rabbit, and not many for beef, although veal stock does play an important role as a pantry item. There is a really super lamb and cheese sandwich recipe and a fair number of grilled food recipes.<br /><br />This is very much the kind of cookbook you want to get if you just happen to be in an adventurous culinary mood, but don't want to spend a lot of loot. The book has just the right mix of easy recipes, showoff recipes, and unusual tastes.<br /><br />Highly recommended for a good read and a very good culinary change of pace.h phyllo, but I'll live, and may even seek out a local source for fresh phyllo.

No more than expected.	`The Gourmet Cookbook' edited by Ruth Reichl of  `Gourmet' magazine is a major effort by the leading culinary magazine in the country, edited by arguably the most important active culinary journalist in the country. At over 1000 pages and 1000 recipes collected by one of the best culinary writing staffs in the country, it is not easy to come to a decision on the value of this book. The fact that it is not easy after reading a few pages is a sure sign that the book is neither excellent nor terrible, but somewhere in between.<br /><br />For starters, let me identify that this book is not a new `Joy of Cooking' or `James Beard's American Cookery' or Mark Bittman's `How to Cook Everything'. These three very large recipe collections are systematic teaching texts. Every chapter includes notes on the primary raw material and the primary cooking method. `The Gourmet Cookbook' is primarily a collection of recipes claimed to be the 1000 best, selected from 60 years of publishing over 10,000 recipes. The most famous similar cookbook is Craig Claiborne's `The New York Times Cookbook'. Reichl has improved a bit on Claiborne by adding some features appearing in the `Joy of Cooking' style of book such as sidebars on ingredients, tips, and techniques. I will approach evaluating this very big book by evaluating individual aspects and adding up the score at the end.<br /><br />Selection of Topics: Comprehensive, but just a bit oddly organized. The chapter titles represent either a type of ingredient such as poultry, vegetables, and shellfish; a type of dish such as soup, salad, bread, and pie; or meal such as breakfast and brunch and first courses. I had a hard time finding the sticky bun recipe Reichl touted on the `Today' show because it was in `Breakfast and Brunch' and not in `Breads'. Chapters on Eggs, Charcuterie, and Smoked Foods would have been better than `Breakfast...'.<br /><br />Selection of Recipes: Overall, the selection is good, although the quality of the selection is uneven from one chapter to the next. In the chapter on salads, there is a recipe for almost every famous named salad you can think of, with a few minor omissions. The Waldorf salad and the chef's salad are missing, even though the latter is mentioned in the chapter introduction. The chapter on breads is much poorer, as it is less than half the size of the salads chapter, yet dozens more big books are written about bread than about salads.<br /><br />Variety of Recipes: Very good. European, Mediterranean, Asian, Latin American, African, and North American cuisines are all well represented. A slight tilt toward French and Italian specialities is entirely understandable and appropriate. No sense in straying from your strengths.<br /><br />Quality of Recipes: Good, but not Great. This is the big kahuna category. If we are given 1000 excellent recipes in a single volume, all other considerations pale into insignificance. I confess I have not read all 1000 recipes, but I have read enough of the standards to see that most of the culinary gods have been appeased, but not all. The brioche dough recipe correctly requires an overnight rise in the fridge. On the other hand, the recipes for omelets leave out several important steps which superchef Jacques Pepin would include AND which super tutor Alton Brown would second. The book is wise enough to include a recipe for the Philippine dish chicken adobo, yet it does not give us the recipe the way the Filipinos prepare it. The recipe also violates a principle given in another part of the book to use whole chickens and calls for making the dish with chicken legs. My Philippines cookbook and all my Filipino friends use the whole chicken. Reichl and her writers make much of their selecting the best of a very large number of recipes for certain dishes which have appeared in the magazine over the years, but this means they are giving us not the very best recipe, but the best recipe which has appeared in the magazine, brought up to date where necessary. I checked out the sticky bun recipe and found it good, but not quite as good as the classic presented in the `Baking With Julia Child' volume which does several more layerings of butter in the rolled dough and which uses the more traditional single pan baking approach rather than Gourmet's muffin pan technique.<br /><br />Quality of Supplementary Material: Generally very good. Its primary weakness is that sidebar subjects are determined entirely by the whim of the editors rather than by the demands of the subject. Eggs get an excellent essay on quality and size, but there is no special discussion of omelets or souffle making. There is no sidebar on braising technique, the single most important technique in the French canon. The Glossary is just large enough to be respectable, but no replacement for the Larousse Gastronomique. The list of suppliers is large, but just a little quirky. It covers all the Food Network favorites such as Murray's Cheese Shop and Penzey's Spices and a lot more, but it oddly lists some sources with nothing more than a phone number and web site, with no clue to the kind of provisions they supply.<br /><br />Basics: Solid recipes for stocks and condiments labeled as the most important chapter in the book. You will not go wrong with these recipes. The five-spice recipe, for example, is better than the one I just used from a book on spices.<br /><br />Most reviewers comment on the yellow recipe titles that are difficult to read. I agree this was a mistake, but my 60-year-old astigmatic eyes can still make them out. I sincerely hope that the second edition corrects this goof.<br /><br />This is a good collection of recipes from 60 years of a good culinary magazine done by a great editor.

Great Fun. Highly Recommended	Culinary bad boy Tony Bourdain and his Les Halles owner chefs have written a very, very good cookbook. If you have an ounce of interest in reading good cookbooks, stop reading this and go to the top of the page and order yourself a copy.<br /><br />If you are still here, I will tell you that this is an excellent cookbook:<br /><br />1. Tony Bourdain is a very good writer. That means reading this book is very entertaining and worth the price even if you make none of the recipes. There are hundreds of good cookbooks, but Bourdain joins the very select rank, along with Alton Brown and Wayne Harley Brachman of culinary writers who can have you laughing out loud. It also means that he knows how to put things so you understand them and remember them.<br /><br />2. The book is all about demystifying classic Bistro cooking and in convincing you that with the right attitude and the right directions, you can do as well or better than any newbie professional cook entering Tony's kitchen to work for the first time. Bourdain lays out the reality of this cuisine in a way I have never seen before. If you ever had any reservations about whether you wanted to cook or had the aptitude to cook, this is the book for you.<br /><br />3. The book presents excellent directions for doing most of the basic preparations for bistro dishes, with special emphasis on preparing stocks. I even think Tony sells himself short when he says that if a chef used his directions at one of Thomas Keller's restaurants, he would be fired on the spot. I personally find Bourdain's stockmaking recipes as good or better than any I have seen short of the CIA textbook. All the right steps are there and all the right culinary reasons for doing them are there.<br /><br />4. The book explains some kitchen techniques and ways of thinking that I have simply never seen anywhere else explained so well. Recipes for dishes such as bouillabaisse and cassoulet which in most other books seem to be daunting projects are broken down into realistic steps which make them entirely manageable. This is the only place I have seen the very logical distinction between `deep prep' and `prep'. Deep prep is the type of work Beetle Bailey does when he is on KP duty. It is distinctly unskilled labor. Prep work requires culinary training and involves making stocks, glazes, compotes, and the like, and work that requires trained knife skills.<br /><br />5. The book gives us excellent recipes for all and only classic bistro cooking with wonderfully informative comments and instructions. (I am especially grateful that Bourdain gives both English and Metric measurements for all ingredients. The French, after all, cook entirely in metric.) There is no filler here. There are no recipes which would be more at home in a book by Mario Batali or Ming Tsai. It also means that if you have two or three good French books on `cuisine bourgeois', you will probably already have recipes for many of the dishes presented in this book. But, this book is so entertaining and the recipes are so well written I would not let this give you any pause. Buy it anyway.<br /><br />6. The book does not make itself out as the wisdom of a single mind. Culinary skill is highly social, done in a world full of influences and people to influence. Bourdain is generous with his being clear about the people and institutions to whom he owes his culinary skill, with special mention being given to Jacques Pepin. Yet, Bourdain has absolutely nothing about which to be modest. He has given us a major addition to useful culinary literature.<br /><br />Aside from excellent chapters on general principles and glossaries, the chapters are almost all the same you will find in any good English language book of French recipes. These are:<br /><br />Soups, including excellent comments on which preparations improve with age and which DO NOT!<br /><br />Salads, including a surprising method for preparing lardons. Boiled, not fried.<br /><br />Appetizers, especially gratins, snails, and mussels.<br /><br />Fish and shellfish: Lobster and dry scallops and pike, oh my!<br /><br />Beef, of course. Note the very important notes on how the French cut up the cow different from us Yanks.<br /><br />Veal and Lamb. The lamb stew recipe is especially good. Baaaaaa.<br /><br />Pig, from nose to tail. Bourdain is a great fan of Fergus Henderson and of using everything but the oink.<br /><br />Poultry and Game, roasted, braised, and rolled chicken, duck, and pheasant.<br /><br />The big Classics. You know the ones.<br /><br />Blood and Guts. Recipes for `the fifth quarter' of organ meats.<br /><br />Potatoes. I love a book that puts potato recipes in a special chapter. Way to go Tony.<br /><br />Desserts. Everything you expect. Cr&egrave;me Brule, poached pears in wine, and clafoutis.<br /><br />Even the trivial stuff is done right. The recipe titles are BIG. The recipe text is done in a very easily readable font. The binding is especially well made to take a lot of standing open while you prepare dishes from the recipes. The book is so well put together, I am surprised it was not published by Knopf , Scribners, or Harper Collins. The closest recent book to this volume is from the chefs at Balthazar, also in New York City. This book beats out that effort by a mile. My only complaint that this book shares with the Balthazar book is that some recipes are in French and some in English. Why not consistently give both?<br /><br />This book is not a classic like Julia Child's `Mastering the Art of French Cooking' or James Peterson's `Sauces', but, I have read several of Bourdain's references by Robuchon and Bocuse on French cuisine and I would recommend Bourdain over these luminaries for the clarity and fun in his writing.<br /><br />Very highly recommended for both clear recipes of popular dishes and the great support he gives to the confidence of the amateur cook.especially gratins, snails, and mussels. <br />Fish and shellfish: Lobster and dry scallops and pike, oh my! <br />Beef, of course.

502564:US	39134375	R3FCBRTVC15R5I	078686852X	538759949	Happy Days with the Naked Chef	Books	5	34	36	N	N	Jamie Does Cooking with the Family. Highly Recommended	In every way imaginable, this third Jamie Oliver cookbook proclaims that he has arrived as a celebrity chef, husband, father, and all around swell lad made good. His name on the cover is about three times the size of the book's title, `Happy Days with the Naked Chef', the book is dedicated to his two children, Little Henners and Jakey Bakey, and photos his nibs with his wife, Jools appear throughout the book. On top of all this, there is a much broader representation of international flavors in these recipes based on trips to the Orient, echoing the influence of Japan on the culinary thinking of Joel Robuchon.<br /><br />At the risk of laying it on just a little too thick, I really believe Oliver shows the kind of passion about good food and cooking which I have seen in very few other TV culinary personalities. Stopping short of a comparison with Julia Child, as Saint Julia did say she couldn't quite understand him most of the time, I would compare his enthusiasm with that of Mario Batali and Jacques Pepin, although he does not have the depth of technique of Jaques or the extensive knowledge of local Italian cuisines as Mario.<br /><br />Oliver does not simply dedicate to his children for schmaltz value as he devotes a sizable section of the book on the value and attitudes to use when cooking with your kids. These few pages alone are worth the price of the book. Emeril just published a whole book on techniques for cooking with your kids, and as good a job as he did in telling you how to do it, Jamie does a much better job of telling you why you do it and what benefits will arise from the effort. Jamie also gives a few insights into his cooking with Jools as well when he says that once upon a time, every little suggestion on Jools' cooking from world famous chef Jamie was taken as a criticism and tended to dampen her enthusiasm for doing something she did not especially enjoy anyway. The whole picture changed when Jamie simply praised everything Jools did in the kitchen. The quality of her cooking and her attitude improved dramatically. I can think of a few of my relatives I would love to feed the wisdom in this book.<br /><br />In reviews of Oliver's other books, I have warned that while Jamie preaches simplicity, this is not the same as quick or easy. Jamie does lean a bit toward quicker and easier in some chapters in this book, keeping to the cooking with the kids theme. He has a chapter on `Quick Fixes' and `Comfort Grub' plus `More Simple Salads'. And, he leaves out any recipes for homemade pasta, with all pasta dishes being based on dried pasta, which he always says is not inferior to fresh, just different. There is also a very short chapter just after the introduction on using fresh herbs, which for the entire world sounds like a sermon from Pastor Oliver exhorting you to use fresh herbs. This homily is understandable if you recall that Jamie Oliver's writing and televising about food is all about lifestyle, not just how to cook. His lesson is that fresh herbs are necessary to good cooking.<br /><br />As always, Oliver's most appealing recipes are for salads, pasta dishes, and seafood. I sometimes wish that all of his books would be reissued collecting all like chapters into individual volumes and I would buy the salad and pasta volumes simply to have all these recipes together. They are by far the most original of his dishes, although there is one pasta dish Jamie attributes to Mario Batali and there are a few in his books that are attributed to his experiences at the River Caf&eacute;.<br /><br />Bread is one of my favorite culinary subjects and Jamie is one of the very few superstar chefs who gives special emphasis to bread baking. His basic bread recipe is a classic fast method he probably got from Gennaro, as Contaldo uses a very similar recipe in his book `Passione'. The recipe violates the recommendation from experts like Peter Reinhart who promote little yeast and long rise times, but I have made Jamie's bread and I find it just fine, especially as a medium for rolling in savory additions such as onions and salami. To atone for his fast yeast bread, Jamie adds a recipe for artisinal sourdough bread with natural yeast and a classic Italian bega. Read this recipe very carefully before starting, as it takes a FULL WEEK to complete. If you are serious about bread, check out books by Reinhart, Joe Ortiz, or Nancy Silverton, but you could do a lot worse than getting your first taste of bread baking from Sir Jamie.<br /><br />When someone has an engaging TV personality, I fear their enthusiasm may not transfer to a skill with the written word, especially with Jamie, as I have heard him say he dictates all his books into a tape recorder, as he never really learned to write properly in school. Let me assure you here that even his chapters with low culinary interest such as his chapters on mixed drinks are a joy to read.<br /><br />Jamie has a habit of labeling certain recipes as `the best ever'. Well, I have made his `best ever' recipes and I agree with him. They have all become standards in my repertoire. He continues to match or exceed the very high quality of recipes you will find from the River Caf&eacute; or even from Signoir Batali himself.<br /><br />On the remote chance that Hyperion editors read this review for constructive criticism, I will point out that the layout of ingredient lists makes reading the recipes a bit annoying, as does the absence of ingredient lists from some of the simpler recipes.<br /><br />If one wishes to get more out of their cooking, they could not do much better than to work their way through Jamie Oliver's cookbooks.and I find it just fine, especially as a medium for rolling in savory additions such as onions and salami.

503185:US	39134375	R3JLTELPBBBICP	0786867558	31222512	The Naked Chef Takes Off	Books	5	26	28	N	N	Solid Second Book on a Naked Food Lifestyle. Outstanding	As I was reaching my 1000 words at the end of my review of Jamie Oliver's first book, `The Naked Chef', I had an epithany revealing that Oliver's writing is about an entire culinary lifestyle. While he professes simplicity with recipes which can be easily made at home, he does not sideline some seemingly daunting cooking tasks such as bread baking, pasta making, stock making and risotto dishes. Rather, he is enthusiasticly inviting us amateurs to enter unafraid into some of cooking's most satisfying challenges. In this what, his first two books go beyond the very useful Rachael Ray quick cooking techniques and they also go beyond the lineup of simple restaurant recipes presented in the superb River Caf&eacute; books from Rose Gray and Ruth Rodgers. Our Jamie writes and lives the kind of enthusiasm for tasty home cooking from English, Mediterranean, and Oriental flavors which other culinary luminaries simply act out with less than convincing enthusiasm. I am even more convinced that like Robin Williams, and unlike other TV culinary personalities, Oliver is a genuine force of nature in embodying a love of cooking and talking about cooking.<br /><br />This book, `The Naked Chef Takes Off' is described as being directed at American readers; however, I see few differences in style between this and his first book. The major additions are chapters on growing herbs in the city, breakfast dishes, tapas and other snacks, bevvies (mixed drinks, bevereges for us Yanks), and stocks. These chapters have less value as thorough discussions of their subject than they do to spread Sir Jamie's enthusiasm to new subjects. As light as it is, his chapter on growing herbs was helpful in pointing out which ones do best outside. I would have saved myself a growing season of disappointment if I had known that basil does not do well outside in the sun, and parsley does. The breakfast dishes are mostly good English fare with an expert chef's special touch. The tapas chapter will not add much to your knowledge if you already have a book on the subject, but if these are new to you, you will be impressed by how simple a great many Mediterranean munchies recipes can be. The chapter on mixed drinks offers some interesting information on some classic Brit potables, but a Mr. Boston book of mixed drinks will be a better reference. The chapter on stocks should convince you that these can be easy. But, if you are a total newbie to stockmaking, please read an authoritative discussion in something like `The Joy of Cooking', a CIA text, or Judy Rodgers' `Zuni Caf&eacute;' book. It is easy if you do it right, but there are pitfalls if you are not careful.<br /><br />The heart of this book simply expands the range of recipes we got from the first book with no hint of feeling that we are getting leftovers, as I often sense in second books from other culinary celebs like Ina Garten and Paula Deen. All of Oliver's recipes sparkle with the kind of freshness I got from the first book. He does expand his range of ingredients by bringing in Middle Eastern flavors and Oriental flavors with ingredients such as lemon grass and Kaffir lime leaves. I always get a sinking feeling when I see Kaffir lime leaves in a recipe as even my favorite megamart has yet to carry these.<br /><br />Like the River Caf&eacute; cookbooks, the stars of Oliver's books are the salads and pasta dishes. Being a simple tomato sauce and spaghetti eater for all my life, the pasta recipes in these books are a revelation for both their variety and simplicity. Why would anyone bother with a jar with Emeril or Paul Newman on the label when you can whip together a dressing with parsley, olives, capers, cherry tomatoes, and olive oil in less time than it takes to retrieve that jar and check out it's expiration date. Second in line for me are Jamie's fish and shellfish dishes. As the variety of tastes at the fish counter greatly outweighs the tastes of beef, lamb, and pork, I love new fish recipes, and Jamie hasthem aplenty. Especially interesting is his take on Shephard's pie replacing the grass eater flesh with cod. Many of the dishes include Oriental flavors such as ginger and coconut milk. Some may go a bit too far, as not all of us live in London or New York City where there is a vendor of banana leafs just down the block. I am tickled to see Jamie use things like horseradish, as this is both a very familiar flavor which simply does not find itself into dishes outside central European Slavic and Yiddish cuisines.<br /><br />The chapter on meats introduces several recipes for carpaccio of beef which, by the very nature of this Italian technique is very fast and very flavorful. While the classic carpaccio is as uncooked as a sashimi or a tartare, Sir Jamie gives us recipes which put a touch of sear on the meat, just enough to please the American who likes their beef bloody, but not raw. Add the recipe for the roasted fillet of beef wrapped in prosciutto and we have several recipes for high class entertaining. While chuck and oxtails and flank steak may be great economy dishes, you don't want to serve these to your boss or a prospective client. And, you can drop the fact that these dishes were served to Tony Blair, or near enough to fib.<br /><br />I am a great fan of Jamie Oliver and I become a greater fan of his cooking with each of his books I review. Like so many other recipes based on natural, elemental ingredients, Jamie's recipes require a fair amount of kitchen experience, so follow his instructions very carefully. He doesn't leave anything out, but he doesn't give many warnings of pitfalls either.<br /><br />Very highly recommended for both simplicity and variety of dishes.specially interesting is his take on Shephard's pie replacing the grass eater flesh with cod.

Jamie Oliver's first book, `The Naked Chef' was published shortly after his success with the short run BBC series of the same name, when Jamie looks to be not much more than 20. While it was easy to understand the quality of his fourth American publication, `Jamie's Kitchen', it is a little surprising to encounter the quality in his very first book, until you read of his culinary apprenticeship under both Antonio Carluccio and Gennaro Contaldo (of the Neal Street restaurant) and Rose Gray and Ruth Rodgers (of the River Caf&eacute;) in London plus a journeyman's stint with a major restaurant in Paris. Young chefs do not get stints with these venues without some serious abilities above and beyond their three years at the Westminster Catering College. His working to Carluccio certainly explains his love of fresh ingredients. His visits to the local greengrocer and other markets are not a TV gimmick. A `Gourmet' magazine writer was visiting the London open air markets collecting information for a story when they ran into our boy Jamie, off camera, doing exactly the kind of ingredients collecting he does at the beginning of each of his TV shows. I also understand the background of his simple approach to food after having reviewed three cookbooks from the River Caf&eacute; duo Gray and Rodgers. This first book was done not long after he left their service and in many ways it reads like another Gray / Rodgers effort, except that our Jamie has added a few good touches of his own to enhance the material.<br /><br />As the flyleaf clearly explains, the `Naked' moniker refers to the style of food preparation practiced and promulgated by Monsieur Oliver and not a comment on his attire while cooking. Be very clear about the fact that this is not the same as fast or even easy, however most of Jamie's recipes are relatively easy for a moderately talented home cook. `Naked' primarily means dishes which are prepared from ingredients which are as close as possible to the soil, the sea, and the pasture. And, it means that the food is prepared with a minimum of fuss and measuring. Jamie firmly believes in the maxim that good cooking is acquiring the very best ingredients and doing as little as possible to muck them up.<br /><br />The first indication that this book is not about fast is when Jamie gives us two recipes for homemade pasta and goes on to give many, many recipes which use this homemade fare, with the full expectation that you will take the time to make these yourself. True to his River Caf&eacute; roots, there are many good pasta dishes in this book. The homemade ravioli and tortellini recipes alone may be worth the price of admission. The seafood recipes are a close second in their simplicity and appeal to the mind's taste buds.<br /><br />The chapter on meat, poultry, and game broadens Jamie's horizon to include pork and lamb dishes inspired by American, British, and North African cuisines. There are four variations on roast leg of lamb, a real boon to lamb lovers like myself. Roasted chicken and duck get a turn in Jamie's oven as well. Jamie returns to his Italian inspiration at the end of meats with a rather elaborate meatball recipe that includes just about every spice in the Italian pantry plus the usual bread, egg, cheese, and mustard for mortar. This recipe is a perfect example of where Jamie may be overlooking some finer details for the sake of simplicity. The meat is simply `meat for grinding or bought ground meat'. There is no suggestion of beef and pork and veal mixtures. The simplification goes further in suggesting that unground meat can be made ready by giving it a whizz in the food processor. My favorite foodie nerd Alton Brown gives detailed instructions for grinding meat in a food processor, as a heavy finger on the `On' button can easily turn your choice chuck into choice mush.<br /><br />The chapter on vegetables covers a lot of familiar Mediterranean territory, but it also branches out to the Orient for a stir-fryrecipe and a vegetable tempura. Jamie really dips into his love of the Mediterranean cuisine by devoting an entire chapter to legumes. I would expect a true Brit to talk up potatoes, but not our Jamie. And, he will have nothing to do with canned beans. All recipes in this and other chapters call for beans soaked overnight. This fits the `cheap and easy, but not necessarily quick' theme of the book. The stars in this chapter include cranberry beans, chickpeas, yellow split peas, green lentils, black-eyed peas, lima beans and cannellini beans.<br /><br />Another paean to the Mediterranean is the next chapter on risotto and couscous. I'm really surprised to find that Jamie's favorite risotto recipe includes both rice and beans; however, a little reflection reminds me that this is simply another marriage of foods which have been complementing one another for centuries. The couscous recipes touch the high points with two hot dishes and a salad.<br /><br />Jamie's chapter on bread is another sign that his style is all about simplicity and not speed. His basic recipe is pure Italian, using classic Italian techniques and durum semolina flour. I have done Oliver bread recipes with great success, so I heartily recommend his contributions to everyday bread baking. For a relatively small book, the variety of bread recipes is really impressive. Compared to the bread chapter, the dessert chapter is rather short and sweet, focusing on conventional English and Italian standards.<br /><br />Jamie Oliver is not giving us quick cooking. He is not even aping River Caf&eacute; works and giving us good, simple Italian cooking. Jamie Oliver is promoting a lifestyle based on good cooking from basic ingredients.<br /><br />Jamie's recipes may be a bit too simply stated for a complete novice, but I am ready to sign up for his view of home cooking with naked ingredients.

504985:US	39134375	R2469WNC4TMW19	0026045702	422504912	JOY OF COOKING	Books	5	17	19	N	N	Beaver and Muskrat and Armadillo, oh my	`The Joy of Cooking' is touted as the most comprehensive culinary manual published in English by the unprecedented appearance of introductory blurbs by the holy Trinity of American culinary writers, Julia Child, Craig Claiborne, and James Beard. That is more than enough incentive to see if this hoary classic has clay feet. I am very pleased to report that in spite of a few hiccups here and there, this book deserves every bit of reputation it has acquired as the `go to' cookbook for America.<br /><br />A little hint I learned early on about assessing the quality of non-fiction books is the number of editions through which the title has been printed. I do not know what the record is, but `The Joy of Cooking' probably comes close to it for a book that is not published every year such as an almanac. A lot of editions means that the book has been popular and that many eyes have gone over the text and have corrected just about any misstatement which may have crept in. My copy reports thirteen (13) editions beginning in 1931. Since agriculture, nutrition, cooking fashion and equipment changes with the times, especially in the last 100 years, I would not trust an older book as a practical kitchen guide, although I may value it as a historical source. The changes over the last 30 years in the fat content of pork alone can turn a host of good recipes into recipes for shoe leather. `The Joy of Cooking' shows many signs of being abreast of the times, up to the mid 1970s, but it also shows some signs of not knowing about important recent trends. While both Julia Child and Elizabeth David both endorsed nonstick surfaced skillets for cooking eggs and other protein, `The Joy of Cooking' has no entry in its index for `Teflon' and does not mention stick-free cookware in its discussion of omelet making techniques.<br /><br />The other side of the coin is that the `Joy...' covers most subjects, including omelet making to a level of detail which would impress even the most fastidious culinary writers such as Judy Rodgers and Jeremiah Tower. It does not just give us a single omelet technique, it gives us five. Where most 300 page cookbooks gives us six or seven topics, `Joy...' has 32 chapters of recipes plus three chapters on general food topics such as preservation techniques in 850 pages. My favorite all-purpose cookbook `James Beard's American Cookery' comes in at a close second at 840 pages. `Joy...' covers a greater range of topics than Beard and probably has a lot more material than the scant 10 pages difference in size suggests as `Joy...' has a smaller typeface and is printed in double columns. Size would count for nothing if the information were not good. It turns out that the quality of the instruction on standard tasks such as making stock, cooking an omelet, and making a basic piecrust is very, very good. The directions for stock making cover all the cautions and recommendations of Judy Rodgers, the writer / chef whose stock recipes are by far the most careful I have ever seen.<br /><br />`The Joy of Cooking' reminds me of promotional material for the Encyclopedia Britannica, where the 24 volume set was pictured as a replacement for a library comprised of fifty or more books. `Joy...' covers numerous subjects which you may be surprised to find outside a book specializing in subjects such as artisinal breads, canning, and game animal cookery. And, while Beard has instructions for cooking bear and squirrel, he missed out on the recipes for muskrat, woodchuck, beaver and armadillo. So, I agree 100% with the notion that if you start a collection of cookbooks with the intention of actually cooking from them, the latest edition of `The Joy of Cooking' should be the very first one. But, I also recommend that if you are especially fond of a certain style of cooking or with any type of bread or pastry making, that you get at least one or two books on that speciality. In bread baking, `Joy...' covers yeast breads and sourdough breads, but it does not address techniques for using natural yeasts and its yeast rising for certain breads such as brioche take short cuts to avoid an overnight rise. Oddly, the book also takes shortcuts to speed up the usual 3-day marinade for sauerbraten. So, this is definitely for the everyday cook and not for the artisinal or the `slow cooking' devotee.<br /><br />From the low price and binding style, one may approach `Joy...' as a greatly inflated church lady fund raising cookbook. Nothing is further from the truth. The writing is as skillful, as crisp, and almost as entertaining as the best of Julia Child's text. There are long, intelligent essays on foods and how to identify the best produce, meats, and fish. The book does not give you the Shirley Corriher angle on techniques, but it does give you all the best techniques and a common sense explanation of why they are good. I even suspect my favorite culinary nerd Alton Brown lifted some ideas from these pages, as it includes the notion of storing root vegetables in sand, something I have seen on `Good Eats'.<br /><br />There are a few minor lapses, such as overlooking a mention of the high acidity (7%) of white wine vinegar and the low acidity (4.5%) of rice vinegar. A sign of the age of the text is the fact that it doesn't even mention balsamic vinegar. Another small blemish is that the text often refers to pictures that are not located where the text points. I will also point out that the book makes extensive use of references to other pages for procedures or preparations to fill out a recipe. A small price for a truly encyclopedic work.<br /><br />Highly recommended as a first cookbook and a reference for even jaded foodies.it does not address techniques for using natural yeasts and its yeast rising for certain breads such as brioche take short cuts to avoid an overnight rise.

Great for Foodies too	`Saffron Shores' is the first of Joan Goldstein's Jewish Mediterranean cuisine books I have read, and it is easily the best book of Jewish cuisine I have read and reviewed. I say this with the reservation that there are several books on Jewish cooking out there which have excellent pedigrees, such as Claudia Roden's `The Book of Jewish Food', so you may have to take my opinion with a grain of salt.<br /><br />That said, I still believe this is an excellent book on Jewish cooking and an excellent book on southern Mediterranean cooking. I am surprised this book makes no mention of the fact that that Ms. Goldstein is the author of a really excellent general book of Mediterranean recipes entitled `The Mediterranean Kitchen', published in 1992 by Morrow. While there are dozens of good, well-known books on Mediterranean food by a pantheon of authors headed by Paula Wolfert, Claudia Roden, Nancy Harmon Jenkins, and Clifford Wright, Ms. Goldstein has a light touch in all of her books which make her recipes especially easy to follow.<br /><br />The very first thing which impresses me about `Saffron Shores' after the delightfully designed dust jacket is Ms. Goldstein's history of the Jewish peoples after the Diaspora, especially the Shepardim who, unlike the Askenazim of eastern and central Europe, settled around the Mediterranean in lands dominated by the Arabic, Moorish, Berber, and Ottoman cultures of Islam. This essay goes far to explain the similarities between Islamic cuisines and the Jewish `dhimmis' who on average had a better time of things under Islam than their Northern brethren had under Christians.<br /><br />The next thing that impressed me and should impress you is the sketch of Jewish kosher dietary laws. As a gentile, what I knew about these traditions and laws was entirely based on hearsay. My only surprise with this description is that the primary categories of food (fleishig, milchig, parve) are named in Yiddish not Hebrew or Spanish or any other language more familiar to the Shepardim than the Askenazim.<br /><br />The kosher dietary laws are not only covered in general, they are also discussed as they are applied to the major holidays of the Jewish calendar, including the Sabbath, Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, Sukkot, Hanukkah, Purim, and Passover.<br /><br />`Saffron Shores' means primarily the modern lands of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya, also known collectively as the Maghrebi. As such, reading this book immediately sounds like an echo of writings by Paula Wolfert. Among the appetizers are the classic chickpea preparations, olive dishes, and salt preserved lemons.<br /><br />I also detect Ms. Goldstein's drawing a bit outside the lines when she selects some dishes. The `Savory Pastries chapter includes dishes from Iraq and Lebanon. Closer to home, the Maghrebi, we have the b'stilla, a version of savory pie of North Africa which seems to pop up in some form or other in every Mediterranean land from Morocco to Armenia.<br /><br />Among soups, there are several recipes for specific holidays including Passover and Rosh Hashanah. Lentils and fava beans are the stars in many of these recipes. Some recipe headnotes include comments which reveal some parallels between Jewish and Islamic (Ramadan) fasting traditions and meals designed to break one's fast.<br /><br />A large number of fish recipes seems quite natural, as fish with scales seem to have very few limitations on cooking technique and we are talking about the shores of the Mediterranean here. This section includes a Moroccan tagine, fish with couscous, and fish with citrus. All very Moroccan. I am tickled to see fish braised here, as I was just a bit surprised to read fish braising recipes in a book dedicated to braising.<br /><br />Chicken is another Jewish / Mediterranean culinary favorite. The chapter on same has the usual tagines, couscous dishes, and roasts, but no Frenchy game bird dishes here, thank you, as kosher rules forbid food killed in the wild. More Moroccan inspired b'stilla recipes appear here. As chicken was rare in North Africa and more valuable for its eggs than its meat, many of the chicken dishes are specifically allocated to important holidays.<br /><br />What would a North African cuisine be without a few lamb dishes done in a tagine? I'm surprised to see some sausage recipes here. This is simply a reminder that sausages do not have to be made with pork.<br /><br />It is fun to see in North African cuisine some dessert themes which made their way all the way to Vienna at the high tide of the Ottoman incursion into Europe. As raw sugar is uncommon in the desert, desserts are made mostly with dried fruits, nuts, and honey, and are typically done in small portions.<br /><br />This is not a scholarly book, but it was created with scholarship from scholarly sources in English, Arabic, and French. For scholarly sources, see the excellent bibliography at the back of the book, especially the works of Ms. Wolfert and Ms. Roden, which will be much more accessible than most of the other works.<br /><br />For one who cooks for a family that observes Jewish dietary laws, this book should be a delight. I can easily imagine the constraints of kosher cooking can lead to a limited palette without some inspiration, as you will find in this book. General readers who are fond of the cuisine of the Maghrebi will also find much to enjoy in this book; however, if you already have a sizable collection of books on North African and Mediterranean cuisine, you may find a fair amount of overlap.<br /><br />All in all, I recommend this book to foodies and strongly recommend it to kosher foodies.killed in the wild.

Molly Stevens has given us an excellent book `All About Braising' which adheres to the very basic cooking principle that if you pay close attention to all the little details of good ingredients, your cooking will invariably improve. So, the book is almost as much about identifying and buying the best ingredients for braising as it is about braising itself.<br /><br />The name `braising', based on `brazier' and heating on hot coals mislead me for years when I knew more about French than I did about cooking and before I started reading about cooking in earnest. I imagined it was a type of grilling when it's only real connection to hot coals is the very old technique of placing coals on the top of Dutch Ovens cast with rimmed lids to accommodate the coals.<br /><br />It is also easy to confuse braising with stewing. Braising is a very well-defined method characterized by browning a relatively large cut of protein or vegetable, followed by cooking over a low, all-around heat with liquid extending about 1/3 the way up the height of the primary ingredient. The braising container is tightly lidded so that vapor does not escape the cooking pot and designed to encourage condensation to drip back down on the braised food. Some braising vessels are also designed to leave little very little headroom between the primary ingredient and the lid. Stewing is a much less well defined technique which does not require a lid and is generally done with much more liquid and smaller pieces of food than a braise.<br /><br />The list of classic `comfort food' braised dishes is long and familiar to Western foodies, headed up by coq au vin, sauerbraten, braised lamb shanks, and osso bucco. And, these are just the headliners. Ms. Stevens gives us chapters on braising vegetables, seafood, poultry, beef, veal, pork, and lamb. I was not surprised to find recipes for braising vegetables as sauerkraut and other cabbage dishes are well-known braise ingredients, but I was surprised to find braises for fish and some veal cuts. Fish is great for all the fast cooking methods such as saut&eacute;s, grills, broiling, and poaching. Overcooking is the most common danger with fin fish and shellfish cookery. But, the virtue of braising is that it is the premier cooking method for infusing a protein with flavor from the braising liquid and it is typically done at a relatively low temperature. That means that the principles behind poaching fish apply also to braises, in that you can cook fish to about 160 degrees Fahrenheit and keep it there almost indefinitely without its drying out.<br /><br />As braising is a very clearly characterized cooking method with a long tradition behind it, it is not surprising that their many different cookpots have evolved to accommodate the method. Almost all of us foodies have an adequate arsenal of Dutch ovens made of either naked cast iron or the traditional French enameled cast iron. I am so in love with my Le Cruset enameled ironware, all my cast iron and Calphalon heavy aluminum ware is gathering dust. Most of us also have large lidded skillets, although I never thought of them as braising pots until I read this book. My fondest recent kitchenware discovery is the Le Cruset bistro pan in enameled cast iron. My two sizes acquired about two years ago are my most commonly used pots next to my 8-quart Dutch oven. Other pots commonly used for braises are braiser pans, typically of lined copper, buffet casseroles, gratin dishes (lidded with parchment paper or foil), and a Doufeu, a Dutch oven lookalike with a well in the lid to accommodate ice to help condense the cooking liquid in the braise.<br /><br />If I were teaching cooking, I believe braising is the first technique I would teach, as it is evident from this book that the technique is very easy and it makes the very best use of less expensive cuts of meat. It is nota fast method, but it should be the method of choice when you need to feed a large family and you can be in the house while the dish is cooking. This does not mean there are no techniques you need to master, and the author explains the how and the why of braising better than anyone I have read to date, including my culinary hero, Alton Brown. The only little detail I have found unmentioned is the paradox braising shares with poaching in that if you overcook protein, even while sitting in liquid, all the fat and collagen will cook out of the meat fibers leaving it dry in the midst of water, stock, and wine. But, once you know the basics, braising strikes me as one of the very easiest techniques with which to improvise. As a long cooking method, the margin for error with the cooking time is very large and the risks are very small. The most common error will probably be nothing more than a somewhat too dry protein.<br /><br />In spite of the fact that braising is a very easy technique, the author's directions for the recipes in this book are detailed in the extreme. This is another reason this is an excellent text for beginning cooks. Nothing is left to the imagination. Not only are the instructions detailed and clear, they are labeled with the names of all the traditional braising steps, so if you have read the introductory material well, you will be reminded of why you are doing each step. The author clearly states that crock pot methods are basically braises, but the author does not discuss the method in detail, and it is good she does not, as the differences are sufficient to warrant your searching out a good slow cooker book for that subject.<br /><br />An excellent book I highly recommend for your kitchen cookbook shelf.hoice when you need to feed a large family and you can be in the house while the dish is cooking.

Not just a cookbook	`Autumn' by Susan Branch at first appeared to me in its Amazon listing under newly published cookbooks to be simply a cookbook of dishes appropriate to Autumn produce. As you in the know about Susan Branch's series of `Heart of the Home' books chuckle over my misunderstanding, I have to shift gears and change the criteria by which I judge the book, as it is not intended to be only an Autumn produce cookbook, and at almost $30 list price, it is not worth the money as simply a seasonal cookbook.<br /><br />For those of you who are like me and are encountering Susan Branch's series of books for the first time, this is the twelfth book in a `From the Heart of the Home' series which provide at least three things.<br /><br />First, the books are cookbooks in that they contain recipes appropriate to the season or holiday theme of the book. This full priced book contains only about 100 recipes, of which at least a third are very well known garnishes, drinks, cookies, dressings, and sauces. For 60 more recipes at 2/3 the list price, you can get the Food Network cookbook with a full serving of new recipes from around the world. Also, for 2/3 the price, you can get the full 800 pages of James Beard's American Cookery which, I will bet, contains virtually every recipe in this book, plus an additional 1000 more. On top of these numbers, there is the consideration that the book is `written' and not `typeset'. The pages are literally photocopied, very artistically to be sure, from what looks like handwritten text. The text is probably a computer created script font, but it is still not as easy to read as a conventional New Times Roman in a reasonable font size for reading in the kitchen while you are following the steps in the recipe. When you reach 60, your eyes need all the help they can get, and these recipes are simply not the easiest to read and follow. They are also not written in the form of numbered steps. This makes them even harder to follow and remember where you were after stopping to answer the phone or to check out Emeril's latest dish on the Food Network in the Living Room.<br /><br />The second aspect of the book is the pages dedicated to Autumn crafts and entertaining techniques. In this department, the book works a little better, but it still does not work as well as some alternate sources of information. You will probably find close to the same amount of fall craft instruction in three issues of `Martha Stewart Living' as you find in these pages. And, the `...Living' editors give us much more detailed instructions on `how to'. Ms. Branch's strength is in demonstrating the efficacy of these suggestions by making them in a context which really succeeds in putting you in the mood to get your 7 closest friends or family members together for a party under the brightly colored leaves on autumn trees. Many of the suggestions on the craft / entertaining idea pages are so simple and so obvious, you wonder how anyone has the chuzpah to charge $30 for a book containing them. Examples are recommendations for using lamps instead of ceiling lights, lining tomatoes up on a windowsill to ripen, and getting a cat or dog.<br /><br />The third aspect of the book is what in other contexts may be called marginalia. These are brief sayings intended to be relevant to the season, to home, and to the style of the book. Frankly, most of the quotations simply do nothing for me. Quotations from sources I recognize such as Lewis Carroll (Alice in Wonderland), Kenneth Grahame (`The Wind in the Willows') and Woody Allan (dozens of films), are nice, like hearing an old favorite song on the car radio. Most of the quotes from unfamiliar sources simply leave me cold. For example, a quote on a page giving suggestions for prepping a guestroom is `Meet Me in Dreamland, Sweet Dreamy Dreamland...' attributed to Beth Sloater Whitson. What is the point? I have seen cookbooks make excellent use of inspirational quotes. For example, the books by Benedictine Monk Brother Victor-Antoine D'Avila-Latourrette have quotes that are not directly related to the recipes, but they have meat on their bones. Most are from Christian writers, yet they have the power of a Zen koan to mystify and reveal at the same time.<br /><br />After all of this grousing about details, I confess the book comes across as much more than the sum of its parts. If you allow for the fact that it is just a bit pricy for the amount and quality of its contents, it does work as an evocation of autumn in New England. And, the book really is talking about Autumn only as it is realized in New England. But like books on Tuscany, Provence, the Galapagos, and San Francisco, the book is as pleasant to read in a Baltimore row house as it is in a Concord Cape Cod.<br /><br />The place for this book and its siblings in Ms. Branch's series may be in one of the suggestions she gives about stocking a house, especially the guest bedroom, with classic feel good books such as `Heidi', `Little Women', and `Pollyanna'. I confess I am more inclined to stock up on Stephen King, `Lord of the Rings', `Catcher in the Rye', and Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />If you know and like these books, nothing I say will change your mind. If you do not know the books in this series, I would weigh very carefully what it is you want in a cookbook and judge accordingly. Martha Stewart and Sheila Lukins have great cookbooks for seasonal dishes and holidays.Monk Brother Victor-Antoine D'Avila-Latourrette have quotes that are not directly related to the recipes, but they have meat on their bones.

Highly Recommended	According to the preface and acknowledgments to this book, `The Olive and the Caper' by Susanna Hoffman, the author went through many more difficulties than usual in bringing this book to completion. Heading the list was the loss of the virtually complete manuscript in 1991, and its reconstruction in the following years. I for one am delighted that the author took the effort to reconstruct this volume, as it should stand as a template for how to put together a readable, useable, entertaining exposition of the cuisine of a country.<br /><br />I am not saying Ms. Hoffman has given us the very best treatment of a national cuisine or even necessarily the very best treatment of Greek cuisine. Diana Kennedy's `From My Mexican Kitchen' is a different approach to a national cuisine that works equally as well as a format and her content is of the highest possible quality. Similarly, Diane Kochilas approaches Greek food in `The Glorious Foods of Greece' in an entirely different manner than Hoffman, giving us a third valuable approach.<br /><br />While Kochilas' approach is by region, with each chapter covering a different ethnic and culinary enclave such as The Peloponnesos, The Ionian Islands, Thessaly, Macedonia, Crete, and Athens and others, Ms. Hoffman approaches her subject by ingredient or type of dish. While this seems very conventional and while it is definitely less scholarly than Ms. Kochilas book, it is done with a depth that is uncommon among lesser books on a national cuisine. For example, the very first chapter deals with the drinks of Greece, including lowly water, which just happens to have a special place in Greek tradition. It reminds us that it is Greek intellectual tradition and customs that contributed much more to the development of early Christianity than Roman customs. Most of the first bishops of the church in Asia Minor were Greek and the intellectual underpinning of theologians such as St. Augustine was Plato. If the traditions of baptism and holy water did not originate with Greek Christians, their traditions certainly reinforced these Christian ideas.<br /><br />Interspersed with recipes within each chapter are excellent culinary sidebars on things like Greek cheeses, olives, pickles, bread, tomatoes, saffron, and marinades, among many other topics. There are also excellent sidebars on Greek history and mythology on subjects such as Zeus, Byzantium, Cyprus, Pericles, the Olympics, Alexander the Great and so on. And, there is much here which may be new to even well informed readers. I did graduate studies in Philosophy and was an avid reader of Greek Mythology, and I find things here that I did not know. The reference to the mysterious Sythians, a culture which lived in Hellenic times above the Black Sea shows they had culinary and trade connections to the Greeks, before they were erased from world history by the Tartars.<br /><br />The book divides the material into three great parts. The first is Drinks, Meze, and Savory Pies. I have already discussed the drinks section which includes wine ouzo, tsikoudia (similar to Italian grappa), brandy, beer, coffee, tea, and fruitades. The second chapter is Meze, of which much has been written recently. The third chapter in the first part covers savory pies, primarily constructed from filo pastry.<br /><br />The second part covers the lions share of savory dishes. The chapters are:<br /><br />Bread - Greek bread is really different from what you expect from French and Italian bakers. This is where the Eastern Mediterranean flatbread terroir starts, with lots of stuff like eggs, olives, and figs baked into the bread.<br /><br />Soup - Much closer to Italian traditions and recipes than the bread. Lots of vegetable soups with beans and greens.<br /><br />Salads - The famous Greek Salad plus new variations on common Mediterranean themes.<br /><br />Eggs - One of the most distinctive Greek ingredients. The author explains how the Greek colony in Denver, with their traditional involvement in running diners, created the Denver omelet, much more a Greek than a cowboy dish, it turns out.<br /><br />Sustaining Grain - Barley, Wheat, Rice and Noodles<br /><br />The Vegetable Parade<br /><br />Fish and Shellfish - One of the very few lapses in this book is that it makes no mention of the fact that contrary to expectations, fish does not play as big a part in most island cuisine as you may expect, since almost all fish is shipped off to Athens for sale. That is not to say Greece does not have a lot of fish recipes, just that you may not find them where you expect.<br /><br />Meat - Lots of lamb.<br /><br />Birds - Mostly Chicken<br /><br />Wild Game - The other birds<br /><br />Sauces, Toppings, and Marinades<br /><br />Fruit as the Finale<br /><br />The third part of recipes is a single chapter on sweets. Like the Italians, Greeks eat fewer sweets after their meal than they do in the afternoon with coffee or late at night. The star of Greek pastry is filo, honey, and nuts in dishes such as baklava, kadaifi, and other cakes, fried pastry, cookies, and puddings.<br /><br />There are many very good books on Greek food, but if you have none yet, this should definitely be your first. It is a great survey by topic with recipes written in an extremely clear, detailed style which even a novice should have no trouble following. I also find practically no overlap between this book and Diane Kochilas' classic. Get them both, but get this one first. Then get Kochilas' book on Mezes, as neither of these others cover the full range of this topic.<br /><br />Highly recommended for all foodies, especially for those with an interest in the Greek, Turkish, and Eastern Mediterranean cuisines.ement in running diners, created the Denver omelet, much more a Greek than a cowboy dish, it turns out. <br />Sustaining Grain - Barley, Wheat, Rice and Noodles <br />The Vegetable Parade <br />Fish and Shellfish - One of the very few lapses in this book is that it makes no mention of the fact that contrary to expectations, fish does not play as big a part in most island cuisine as you may expect, since almost all fish is shipped off to Athens for sale.

517927:US	39134375	R2OLGCPPKKH2A1	1400060990	199199019	The Philosopher's Kitchen: Recipes from Ancient Greece and Rome for the Modern Cook	Books	5	35	35	N	Y	Great Entertaining Source and Fun Foodie Read	This is the third literary themed cookbook by self-styled food historian Francine Segan. The first, which I have not reviewed or seen, dealt with meals from movies. The second volume that I did read and favorably review dealt with recipes of dishes based on quotes from Shakespeare's plays and documents contemporary to Shakespeare. Aside from the fact that `contemporary of Shakespeare' was interpreted a bit liberally, with references to works which were published many decades after Shakespeare's death in 1616, this was an entertaining and informative book with recipes you would actually want to make, as the author modernized all of the texts to fit modern cookery praxis and cookbook readers' expectations.<br /><br />This third book, `The Philosopher's Kitchen' deals with recipes from ancient Greece and Rome. In many ways, this book is superior to the Shakespeare volume. For starters, I suspect many people are actually much more interested in Mediterranean cuisine before the advent of New World fruits and vegetables than they are with the early version of a cuisine with few contemporary claims to fame. A second advantage is that there really are a lot of ancient references to recipes, many with a lot more substance to them than the hint given in a single Shakespearean line. Those Greeks and Romans liked to talk about and write about their food as much in ancient times as they do now.<br /><br />I have often heard it said that the ancient Romans were basically vegetarians, with only the occasional piece of meat used more as a seasoning than as an important source of protein. You can see from these recipes why beans and greens and mushrooms and other vegetables are so important to modern Mediterranean cuisine by seeing their role in these recipes.<br /><br />The olive and the grape were as important in ancient times to the Mediterranean cuisine as they are today. In fact, there is a Latin quote that says that a meal without wine is a meal for the dogs. It seems odd, therefore, that the author did not include any wine recommendations with these recipes, although wine and wine vinegars are used liberally in these recipes. Similarly, olive oil was as much a final dressing to dishes as it is today in Italian cuisine. Mario Batali would have been right at home in an ancient Roman kitchen.<br /><br />The attention to sauces also reminds one of French cooking of Careme and Escoffier that has often been described as being done to accommodate poor teeth. I suspect the dental equipment of the ancients was no better than that of 19th century Frenchmen.<br /><br />The nine (9) chapters of recipes follow a very traditional organization, with the twist of titles borrowed from ancient texts. The eight chapters of recipes are:<br /><br />Ad Gustum: Appetizers where lots of olive based goodies look a whole lot like Italian, Provencal, and Spanish starter dishes. The author takes more than a little poetic license by using pasta that, strictly speaking, was a medieval invention. All is explained, so all is forgiven.<br /><br />Fire: Soups and Stews where the absence of the tomato is more dramatic than in most sections. Figs are an important ingredient in recipes throughout the book and it is surprising to see them appear in meat stews in this chapter.<br /><br />Earth: Salads and Vegetables have lots of fennel, kale, beans, squash, celery, leeks, and Brussels sprouts. These recipes seem especially fresh and inviting.<br /><br />Water: Seafood has many dishes that look remarkably modern such as the red snapper in parchment. The ancients didn't use their good vellum to cook. They used salted fig leaves to take the place of the modern silicone product.<br /><br />Air: Poultry also has many modern looking recipes, as the New World vegetables play less of a role in cooking birds.<br /><br />Macellum: Meats has meatballs, pork chops, steak, stuffed squash, pork loin, lamb, veal chops and tenderloin. Gingersnap cookie crumbs stand in for ancient spiced breadcrumbs here.<br /><br />Panis: Bread where I suspect the variation from the ancients is pretty dramatic. They had yeast, but certainly not `instant dry' yeast. And, baking powder was not invented until the late 19th century.<br /><br />Ambrosia: Desserts has simple recipes which are probably closer to the ancient original in substance than many other dishes, especially the breads.<br /><br />The original ancient text on which the modern interpretation is included with every recipe, so you can easily see how much interpretation was done to create transpose the ancient quote into a modern recipe. Not surprisingly, a large number of recipes are from the famous Roman cookbook `On Cookery' attributed to Apicius.<br /><br />While the author is credited with being a `food historian', these works are much more like popular interpretations of food history than they are scholarly works. The author very wisely includes an extensive bibliography of her references, but this does not make this an academic book. Aside from the enjoyment of reading the recipes, stories, and rationales in recipe translations, the very best use of the book would be as a source for entertaining to a theme of ancient recipes. The recipes are just complicated enough to impress guests, and just simple enough to allow them to be done by cooks with modest talents. The added cachet of serving dishes from the ancient world is more than worth the price of the book. Use if for your next ides of March party.<br /><br />The rationale for using philosophers in the title of this book is a bit thin, especially as most of the dishes are based on Roman sources and Imperial Rome was not known for its philosophers. A similar case could probably be made for poets or playwrights. They probably wrote about food as much or more than Plato and Aristotle.<br /><br />Excellent source for themed entertaining and a darn good foodie read.. <br />Panis: Bread where I suspect the variation from the ancients is pretty dramatic.

518294:US	39134375	RS9KN2F5PO6OW	0060096764	698202386	The Ultimate Muffin Book: More Than 600 Recipes for Sweet and Savory Muffins (Ultimate Cookbooks)	Books	5	69	72	N	Y	Excelllent Subject for Comprehensive Reference	This is the eighth `Ultimate' cookbook title for authors Bruce Weinstein and Mark Scarbrough. Others have been on chocolate cookies, potatoes, brownies, shrimp, candy, ice cream, and party drinks. This is the first of this series I have reviewed and I sense the format works much better for a subject like muffins, brownies, and chocolate cookies, where all recipes have a lot in common than it does for potatoes or candy, where there is a large variation in cooking techniques.<br /><br />The cover announces that the book contains over 600 recipes for sweet and savory muffins. This blurb may be misleading in two ways. First, there are only 100 full-page recipes, with each recipe expanded by up to eight (8) variations, and each variation is treated as a recipe. The potential number of preparations may go well beyond the 600 if you combine the 100 basic recipes with the ten (10) toppings (icings) recipes, giving a thousand variations. For sure, some toppings will simply not go with some muffins, but you get the idea.<br /><br />By `muffin', the authors mean the classic American muffin that is a chemically leavened quickbread baked in a muffin tin, developing a domelike cap, and typically not iced. Unlike a cupcake, muffin recipes are meant to stand on their own, so they typically have more moisture and more flavor than the cupcake, since the icing is what usually carries the water for a cupcake. The authors specifically exclude the `English' muffin that is an entirely different animal.<br /><br />The very best part of this book is the first chapter, `Making Muffins' which includes just about every tip you could possibly imagine regarding muffins, plus important notes on equipment and ingredients. The authors get double points from me for including the simple recipe for making your own baking powder and for the suggestion to use powdered buttermilk. I had already discovered this product, but this is a boon to everyone who buys a quart of buttermilk to make a batch of biscuits or muffins and has ¾ of the quart go bad in two weeks. The authors are probably a little conservative with their estimates of the shelf life of baking soda and baking powder, although I will take proper note of their warning about measuring the life of baking powder from the date you open the can. Personally, I have successfully used an open can of baking powder for 6 months after opening. I also suspect the shelf life of baking powder is a lot longer than their 3 months. Unlike the mixture baking powder, baking soda is a simple inorganic chemical, almost as inert as salt unless it is added to an acidic liquid. The warning against using baking soda that has been used as a refrigerator deodorizer is not based on its loss of efficacy but is based on the noxious odors it may bring to the party.<br /><br />The 100 primary recipes are arranged alphabetically, which, in this type of book, is a really good idea until you get to recipes which are not named according to their distinguishing ingredient, as in `Basic Muffin' and `Mexican Muffin'. Otherwise, this is excellent for a book you will go to a few times a year for holiday recipes, bake sales, and special brunches. This organization is supplemented by a cross-reference of recipes by most important characteristic other than the dominant flavoring. This groups, for example, all bran, cornmeal, chocolate, gluten-free, and low fat recipes together.<br /><br />Considering the amount of detail given in the introduction cited above, the individual recipes are still quite detailed, with a prudent repetition of some of the more important warnings, such as the caution to use room temperature eggs and melted, but not too hot butter in the preparation.<br /><br />Any fault found with this book would never rise above the level of nit picking, as the book is so successful at being a guide to baking good muffins. One nit I must pick with the copy editor is the use of the term `silicon' baking tins where the authors surely meant`silicone'. What is meant was a flexible, stick-resistant plastic. What was said was glass. The authors did a great service in warning us about the fact that the volumes of muffin tins often vary and different sizes can mean different baking times. I think they could have improved this point and some others by a few simple pictures. In the `room for improvement' category, a cross-reference of recipes to holidays and seasons would have been keen, especially as there are some recipes for less well known Jewish holiday occasions (See Haroseth muffins, p. 98). The writing is not quite as entertaining as Jim Villas' quips in his book `Biscuit Bliss', but then, these authors are not Jim Villas. Get both books. There is no overlap, as both authors stay on message very well.<br /><br />This is an excellent treatment of a subject that works well with this approach. This gives us a great reference, saving us the journey through half a dozen other books for just the right muffin recipe.rely meant `silicone'. What is meant was a flexible, stick-resistant plastic.

There is no overlap, as both authors stay on message very well. <br /> <br />This is an excellent treatment of a subject that works well with this approach. This gives us a great reference, saving us the journey through half a dozen other books for just the right muffin recipe.  <br />	2004-09-17

Highly Recommended	`The Great Book of Chocolate', David Lebovitz' third book, is much, much more than a book of chocolate recipes. It is a great resource, including recipes, lore, history, sources, anecdotes, manufacture, producers, and botany of cacao and chocolate.<br /><br />Even if you have any other book on chocolate, you will find things in this book which do not appear in any others, as it has information I have not seen in about a half dozen books on chocolate and about 20 hours of Food Network shows on chocolate done by everyone from Alton Brown to Tyler Florence to Gordon Elliot.<br /><br />One of the most interesting new facts I found in this book is that like coffee, there are two different naturally occurring varieties of the cacao plant, plus a manmade hybrid. One of the varieties is much more delicate and much less common than the other, accounting for about 5% of the world's chocolate, but it is a much richer product. Very few chocolate processors deal with this criollo variety. Most use the much more common forestero variety or the hybrid trinitario.<br /><br />Like tea and coffee and olive oil, cacao is a highly complex product, much of whose more desirable and subtle properties are destroyed by too much heat during processing. Heat is also the enemy of chocolate when melting and tempering chocolate to be used for cooking. This brings up one of my very few complaints about this book in that it explains a very primitive method for heating and tempering chocolate. I would have devoted at least one page to explaining how professional chocolate tempering pots work, and in what way one could be improvised. The author gives some very brief suggestions using a heating pad, but a paragraph plus an illustration would have been dandy. Other explanations in the book would have been well served by an illustration or a caption to a picture, but these are small matters in light of the overall quality of the book.<br /><br />While Lebovitz was already a highly talented and accomplished pastry chef when he started writing this book, he has gone to the extra effort of investigating first hand the workings of premium chocolatiers in San Francisco, Paris and Brussels. He has also recently completed a course in chocolate at Callebaut College in Belgium.<br /><br />The chapters in this book, after the introduction which covers Lebovitz personal involvement with chocolate includes:<br /><br />Chocolate Explained gives the history, botany, and processing of the cacao plant, plus some stories of two important American chocolate producers, Hershey and Sharfen Berger.<br /><br />Sustainability of Cacao discusses the fragile place of cacao in jungle ecosystems and the production of organic chocolate.<br /><br />A Chocolate Primer discusses the forms of chocolate, from pure chocolate liqueur to cocoa power, plus an explanation of tempering. While he points out that there is no difference between `semisweet' and `bittersweet' chocolate, he does not discuss the availability of chocolates with sweetening graded by percent, as done by Vahlrona. It is also surprising that while so many other chocolate companies are mentioned in the book, this very important French company is not. It is not even listed in the very good list of resources in the back of the book.<br /><br />Chocolate and Wellness reveals that carefully processed chocolate has a lot more antioxidants in it than even health food stars prunes, raisins, and blueberries. Not only that, it has lots of other good stuff, including some compounds which work as an antidepressant.<br /><br />Buying Chocolate gives a brief consumers guide to sources for good chocolate, including a detailed chronicle of seven days spend working at the shop of the best chocolatier in Brussels.<br /><br />Chocolate of Paris continues the buying guide with a focus on sources in Paris that rivals Brussels as one of the leading chocolatier centers in the world.<br /><br />The 34 recipes certainly do not cover the whole world of chocolate baking and candy making, but they give you a pretty good sampling of both conventional products such as hot chocolate, truffles, fudge, and cakes; to the slightly unusual such as chocolate and cherry scones, mint and chocolate cr&egrave;me anglaise, and bourbon mud pie; to the really unusual such as chocolate sauerkraut cake and chocolate pizza dough.<br /><br />Lebovitz says many of the recipes are original and, as he is a much, much better baker than I will ever be, even in my dreams, I will accept these recipes for being the cr&egrave;me of the crop. As I said above, this book will not replace your books by Flo Braker, Nick Malgieri, or Alice Medrich or even Lebovitz' earlier books on desserts. It is much more of a supplement to resources for making the best use in recipes by all bakers and chocolatiers.<br /><br />As the book is much more valuable for its websites, addresses, and information than it is for its recipes, the awkward tall and skinny format does not annoy me as much as it may in other cookbooks. I just wish Ten Speed Press would come out with an explanation for why they are so in love with this tall, skinny format.<br /><br />Highly recommended enhancement to your enjoying chocolate.whole world of chocolate baking and candy making, but they give you a pretty good sampling of both conventional products such as hot chocolate, truffles, fudge, and cakes; to the slightly unusual such as chocolate and cherry scones, mint and chocolate crme anglaise, and bourbon mud pie; to the really unusual such as chocolate sauerkraut cake and chocolate pizza dough. <br /> <br />Lebovitz says many of the recipes are original and, as he is a much, much better baker than I will ever be, even in my dreams, I will accept these recipes for being the crme of the crop.

This book, `The Flavors of Provence' by chef Jean-Andre Charial and illustrator Isabelle De Borchgrave, belongs to a rare genre of cookbook which specifically combines recipes with artistic illustrations done for the sake of art rather than for the sake of illustrating the dishes. The third and smallest component of the book, on which the title is based, is thumbnail sketches of the classic Provencal ingredients such as olive oil, lavender, basil, truffles, and herbes de Provence.<br /><br />The recipes by the chef / owner of two star Provencal restaurant and hotel l'Oustau de Baumaniere are certainly true to Provencal tastes, but with five or six recipes in each of the six culinary chapters, the recipes don't even come close to covering the field of classic Provencal recipes. But, this is actually typical of Provencal cookbooks. Unlike the three books of Roman cuisine I have reviewed, the five books of Provencal cuisine simply do not repeat themselves. The range of dishes seems so broad that while the Roman books overlap dishes by over 50%, Provencal books have no true duplicates except perhaps the occasional pistu and ratatouille recipes.<br /><br />Like so many other cookbooks, this one includes a paean to the fact that the chef uses the freshest ingredients, often from their own garden. That's great for the people who visit the restaurant, but it adds nothing to the quality of the book. The irony is that while the recipes include a lot of classic Provencal ingredients, such as turbot and fresh beans, it finds that it must provide more readily available substitutions for these `fresh' ingredients.<br /><br />While many books of Provencal recipes such as those by Patricia Wells are excellent sources of quick dishes, these recipes are definitely not for quick cooking. All the recipes are primarily best suited for entertaining, but do not make them cold for a house full of guests. All the recipes require a fair amount of skill. And, a working knowledge of basic French techniques for sauce making will be a big help. Many dishes include the preparation of a veloute sauce, some with pretty unusual ingredients for a creamy sauce such as pistachios.<br /><br />The very typical chapter topics are Soups, Appetizers, Fish, Meat, Vegetables, and Desserts. These contain the expected mousses, gratins, saut&eacute;s, roasts, and sauces. Surprisingly, there are no braises or daubs. Fowl is grouped under meats, and four (4) out of seven (7) meat recipes are for poultry and two (2) of the remaining three (3) are for lamb. All recipes represent new tastes based on familiar ingredients and techniques.<br /><br />With about fifty recipes, the culinary content seems a bit thin for a book with a list price of about $30. The balance of the value is contributed by de Borchgrave's illustrations which appear to my artistically naïve eye to be oils or acrylics on colored paper. The style is very modern, with just enough spiritedness to the brushstrokes to make one have to look carefully to figure out what it is that is being pictured in many cases. Oddly, the pictures don't have the brightness I often associate with Provencal art as done by, for example, Cezanne, who was famous for appreciating the bright sunlight of Provence in contrast to the darkness of Paris and the Beaux Arts school.<br /><br />The book was translated from a French text and I can find virtually no trace of gaffes in the translation. It seemed a bit odd to instruct us to heat honey until liquid, but I understand what is meant here.<br /><br />If you want a manual on Provencal food, see Elizabeth David or Patricia Wells. If you already have these works and are simply in love with Provencal style and cooking, then this is the book for you. It is doubly attractive if you are the kind of bookworm who gets a thrill from works with unusual illustrations such as the `Griffin and Sabine' series of illustrated / constructed books.c French techniques for sauce making will be a big help.

524063:US	39134375	R1R55PLB8A06GS	1579904211	156735789	In Praise of Tomatoes: Tasty Recipes, Garden Secrets, Legends & Lore	Books	4	9	9	N	N	Excellent 'Mater Intro at Good Price. Some things missing.	`In Praise of Tomatoes' is a better than average large format, glossy, moderately priced book which seems to be published to go directly to the discount stacks in the megabookstore lobbies. In spite appearances, this is definitely better than the average Borders' entrance clutter.<br /><br />The book does a pretty good job of covering just about every tomato subject you can think of, and a few which may have escaped you, which makes the book just that much more valuable.<br /><br />The backbone of the book is the collection of fifty-two (52) recipes that are scattered throughout the book and thoughtfully indexed by type of dish at the front of the book. Since it is obvious that even a folio sized book of 174 pages can't begin to give a comprehensive coverage to tomato recipes, the author has thoughtfully mixed standards such as Bloody Mary, Minestrone, and Stuffed Tomatoes with some unusual variations of classics such as the BLFGT (Bacon, Lettuce, and Fried Green Tomato) sandwich, grilled pizza, and ratatouille hoagie. The book is written by a journeyman food and crafting author, Ronni Lundi, but the recipes are done by professional chef John Stehling, co-owner of a restaurant specializing in dishes based on tomatoes, named `Early Girl Eatery'.<br /><br />The book opens with a history of the travels of the tomato from pre-Columbian times up to the 19th century, when the luscious fruit reached its full modern distribution and conquest of the world's cuisines. There is much more here than the usual story of how the Spaniards brought it from Mexico to the Mediterranean. The next chapter is on an explanation of heirloom tomatoes and their growing popularity. A co-author, Barbara Ciletti, provides a very important chapter, `The Essential Tomato Garden Primer' on how to select, plant, and care for tomato plants, including the incredibly surprising fact that tomatoes really like to be fondled. Seriously, they grow better when there is a goodly amount of breeze to stroke the leaves.<br /><br />Another essential section of the book is the table of tomato varieties showing when they will yield their best harvest, whether they are determinate (lots of tomatoes over a short time) or indeterminate (steady yield over a long season), and the best uses for each tomato variety.<br /><br />In addition to all the recipes, there is a chapter on preserving tomatoes by canning, freezing, and drying. I was particularly interested in the notion of freezing tomatoes, as an `old wives tale' states that you cannot freeze tomato recipes, as they get watery when they are defrosted, yet dozens of cookbooks give freezing instructions for tomato recipes every day. The next section discusses out of season tomatoes trucked in from warmer climes and grown under glass. Here is explained the fact that Florida and California tomatoes sold in January have poor taste because they are bread for travel, not taste. It also warns against believing the `vine ripened' label. These were probably picked while still green and, if you are lucky, were not gassed with ethylene to ripen them just before hitting the market shelves. Appropriately, the next chapter is on canned tomatoes, traditionally preferred for cooking over out of season fresh tomatoes. This is joined by the story of catsup and salsa, and excellent recipes for homemade catsup. By the way, if you want an insightful essay on catsup, check out the article in the most recent Food issue of the `New Yorker' in your library. It was the Sept. 6 issue with the cover of Republican elephants crossing the Brooklyn Bridge.<br /><br />At this point, the book goes into some of the more frivolous `mater topics, including a piece on the series of `Attack of the Killer Tomato' movies and the Rotten Tomatoes movie review web site. This is followed by more fluff about the use of the word `tomato' in American slang. The book returns to more serious matters with a piece on tomato festivals and a very nice color picture section of tomato inspired art, with due homage given to Andy Warhol.<br /><br />While I do not expect a book of this size to be complete on such a big subject, I was surprised at some of the simple things it missed. While there are excellent descriptions of heirloom seed societies and collectives, there is nothing given about addresses, telephone numbers, or web sites which would enable us to contact these organizations. Similarly, there are no addressees, telephone numbers, or web sites given for commercial tomato seed vendors or tomato festivals. Lastly, there is no bibliography of reference works on tomatoes, even though the book refers to several such reference works. Including these items would have doubled the value of the book. I also found the catalogue of tomatoes a little weak by neither summarizing tomato types nor giving more details on some varieties, as none of the tomatoes I planted this year are on their list.<br /><br />Even so, at a list price of less than $20, this book is definitely worth buying if you have any interest in growing, eating, or buying tomatoes. The information on heirlooms, seeds, and festivals should be just enough to google your way to the appropriate web sites for more information.ection of tomato inspired art, with due homage given to Andy Warhol. <br /> <br />While I do not expect a book of this size to be complete on such a big subject, I was surprised at some of the simple things it missed.

526132:US	39134375	R20D7UY06D487P	0696218488	872276816	Making It Easy (Food Network Kitchens)	Books	5	69	72	N	Y	Great variety and taste from experts. Recommended	`making it easy' is the second cookbook from the kitchen staff of the `food network'. Like the first volume, none of the Food Network's celebrity chefs are even mentioned in the book, and there is no reference to any of their programs in any of the recipes. And, as a religious watcher of Food Network shows, I see no celebrity chef fingerprints on any of the recipes.<br /><br />Making food fast is a very popular topic for cookbooks and for culinary personalities, lead by the Food Network's own Rachael Ray who, I believe, does this subject as well or better than anyone else. It is important to note that this book is not about `fast', it is about `easy', which seems to me to be a much more realistic subject, as one of the requirements to doing `fast' cooking at home is that you have good kitchen skills, especially with a knife, which will cut down on prep time and especially cut down on tracking down your mandoline, food mill, or stick blender from behind the flour canister or the salad spinner.<br /><br />The book does not turn its back on special equipment. In fact, `cool tools' is one of the four primary categories, joined by `pantry picks', `double duty', and `real quick'. Each recipe is identified as falling into one of these four categories. I think it is extremely odd that every recipe would fall into one and only one of these categories. A slow cooker recipe will easily do `double duty' recipes and a pressure cooker recipe would certainly be a good candidate for `real quick', unless the authors considered that breaking out, cleaning, and stowing this special equipment disqualifies recipes from `real quick'. Anyway, this is just a missed opportunity for carrying a theme to its logical conclusion, not a demerit against the recipes in the book.<br /><br />The `pantry picks' recipes are meant to be made from items the authors expect you to keep on hand in the cupboard, fridge, or freezer. Pastas, canned fruits and vegetables, nuts, durable vegetables, and frozen staple meats are the stars of these recipes.<br /><br />The `double duty' recipes are meant to create two meals from a single session in the kitchen, or, recipes to make the best use of leftover protein such as the 8 pounds of white meat left over from your 20 pound holiday roast turkey. For these situations, the authors provide recipes for a casserole, a Hoppin john, and turkey turnovers.<br /><br />The `real quick' recipes are meant to go from the fridge to the serving table in 30 minutes or less. The stars of these meals, as with every fast cooking protein dish, are seafood, boneless chicken breasts and beef and pork filets. For the penny pinchers, there are no veal recipes in this book.<br /><br />The `cool tools' label is applied to recipes using the slow cooker, the pressure cooker, and the microwave, all tools which can either reduce cooking time or at least reduce the time you have to spend fussing with the food as it cooks.<br /><br />All of this reminds me that I have yet to see any recent cookbook done on cooking economically. I think this is a huge untapped need that, if done really well, will sell lots of books. The last author to make a point of this aspect of cooking was Jeff Smith, and he was never really frugal, after his first book. And, economy with food is something professional kitchens do really well, so I would think the Food Network staff would have a good inside track on these techniques. Especially since I really don't expect Mario Batali or Bobby Flay to do a book on cheap eats. Alton Brown, on the other hand ...<br /><br />Like their first book, this volume covers recipes from around the world. They even go so far as to include my favorite Filipino dish, chicken adobo. Almost all recipes for established classics are done with a little twist to give you something a little different from the dozen or so other recipes you may have for a summer tomato bread salad, whether it be panzanella or the Southern classic dish with bacon.<br /><br />Thebook has lots of tips, some quite fresh, such as the idea to take your cell phone to the megamart with the market's telephone number on the speed dial, so you can call them when you are looking for something instead of trying to track down a store employee who may or may not know where the item is. Even though the authors were compelled to give us a recommended list of pantry items, they were wise enough to say that your best pantry strategy is to get what you need as you need it and build up your stockpile from recipes you really make.<br /><br />Like the first book, I find virtually all the recipes to be of high quality and fitting of the label applied to them. The cost of creating good food fast and easy is commonly paid in both money and in the use of especially flavorful ingredients that may not be that easy to find. Not every supermarket has red currant jelly, sambal oelek, lemongrass, prepared gnocchi, or shiitake mushroom soup broth.<br /><br />The battalion of authors and editors missed another opportunity when they did not put in an index of dishes by their four bullet points or at least menus of complementary recipes all either fast or pantry or long cooking times. But, prep times are given for all recipes as well as special equipment and times for slow cooking.<br /><br />If you do not wish to get Jacques Pepin's new book on fast cooking plus a River Caf&eacute; book for easy Italian recipes and a Patricia Wells book on Provencal cooking for easy French recipes, this good book of easy recipes with lots of upbeat tips and it is available at an extremely reasonable list price.<br /> <br />The book has lots of tips, some quite fresh, such as the idea to take your cell phone to the megamart with the market's telephone number on the speed dial, so you can call them when you are looking for something instead of trying to track down a store employee who may or may not know where the item is.

Highly Recommended	When I approached Jacques Pepin's new book `Fast Food My Way', I was prepared on at least two counts to find fault with the book. But Jacques always comes through with a book I love to read and love to cook. My first prejudice against the book was that `Fast Cooking' is one of the top two or three hot buttons for cookbooks these days, next to low carb cookbooks and entertaining cookbooks. I predict a `Fast Cooking Low Carb Barbecue for Entertaining' book to appear within the next year. And, like so many other authors, it may seem like Jacques is just jumping on the latest bandwagon. The second prejudice I had about the book is the fact that Jacques did an earlier book on quick cooking, `The Short-Cut Cook' published in 1990. I had similar prejudices about that book, but it came through with flying colors, especially since it has been and still is one of my favorite cookbooks.<br /><br />In a nutshell, this book can become your next go to cookbook because almost all of these recipes are genuinely easy for a modestly experienced cook and they are not only developed by a great master chef, they are the recipes that chef genuinely cooks at home on a regular basis. One also should have no concern that this is a rehash of his earlier book. It is not. There are a lot of similarities in the principles behind the selection of recipes, but that is only to the good. Jacques mixes a selection of the classics like cole slaw and Salad Caprese with unusual recipes such as Parsley and Pumpkin salad and Asian eggplant salad. In the older book, we got Salade Nicoise and hot Potato Salad mixed with potato and smoked bluefish and tangy rice stick salad.<br /><br />On average, the recipes in the new book are more original and easier to prepare than the recipes in the first volume. In both books, Jacques' recipes follow two trends common to most good fast cooking recipes, similar to what you see Rachael Ray do every day. First, the recipes do require a modest amount of skill and a fairly well equipped kitchen with stuff like a food mill, a mandoline or Japanese slicer, a stick blender, and a food processor. Second, most dishes use foods that cook quickly such as seafood, chicken breast, filets of beef or other lean steak cuts, and veal. All of these things are more expensive than the slower cooking roasts and braising meats.<br /><br />Jacques is exceptionally fond of smoked, marinated, and fresh fish recipes from the far North and from the Far East. He is very fond of Asian and Latin tastes such as cilantro and tropical fruits. But, all of this is overlaid on a solid grounding of French and Italian techniques such as the braise, the gratin, casseroles, pasta, tomatoes, potatoes, and fresh mushrooms.<br /><br />The book starts with several pages of menu selections that were the basis of the PBS series shows on which the book is based. This is followed by a goldmine of ideas modestly labeled `More ideas for quick dishes'. This is not a list of general suggestions, it is a collection of 25 mini-recipes, all of which can be done very quickly with very modest skills, and the right ingredients. The remainder of the book follows very traditional lines with chapters on:<br /><br />Appetizers and first courses (16), covering truly easy recipes with a heavy concentration on fish, beans, cheeses, and ham. The recipes also highlight the fact that Jacques generally likes his food spicy. Be careful with his instructions with the chiles if you have heat impaired eaters.<br /><br />Soups (7), including some which I would never have believed could be made in such a short time. Here is where your food mill, stick blender, and knife skills will be put to the test. Includes an easy but not too fast recipe for chicken stock.<br /><br />Eggs (4), with recipes to make this fast food staple much more interesting.<br /><br />Salads (11), the darling of fast meals. Good salads do take some time, and these are no exception. Includes a good cole slaw and recipe for herbed breadcrumbs.<br /><br />Vegetables (16), with ragouts, gratins, purees, relishes, saut&eacute;s, and chutneys. Mostly side dishes from the French and Italian canon.<br /><br />Rice, potatoes, and pasta (7), the low carb danger zone. Again, a collection of variations on French and Italian standards plus couscous and `Wonton cannelloni'.<br /><br />Fish and shellfish (15), with lots of stuffing, grilling, glazing, and saucing. While fish cooks very quickly, it always seems like the sauces supplied to spice up the bland flesh always seems to chew up a lot of time. Jacques is unconventional enough to even mix in cheese with his fish. Don't tell Mario!.<br /><br />Poultry (6), where Jacques does not use up a lot of space on game birds. All but one recipe is for chicken, including an unconventional chicken bouillabaisse.<br /><br />Meat (10), the high rent district with tenderloins, veal, and lamb chops. It also includes some fast cooking with pork and sausages.<br /><br />Desserts (30), where Jacques reminds us he is no slouch in the pastry kitchen. Baking and working with chocolate always take longer than similar savory recipes, if only because you have to be more careful in measuring and in your mixing technique, but Jacques keeps things fairly simple by relying heavily on fruit desserts and sweet toppings as in crumbles and streusels. Naturally, there is at least one crepe recipe.<br /><br />Jacques Pepin is the kind of authority whose recipes can be taken as gospel, so that if they do not come out as expected, the fault is probably with the technique or the ingredients.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this book as a first source for your everyday cooking. All recipes are easy, few ingredients are uncommon, and all dishes look exceptionally tasty. And, list price is quite reasonable for a very celebrated chef's work.pe for herbed breadcrumbs. <br /> <br />Vegetables (16), with ragouts, gratins, purees, relishes, sauts, and chutneys.

The introduction to this book also shows that unlike a lot of cookbook writers who do a volume on a particular subject such as fast cooking or Cuban cuisine or kosher empanadas because the subject is popular, Ms. Braker started her professional catering career baking miniatures and has specialized in them for over twenty years.<br /><br />One very good thing is the fact that the book deals with exactly what you would expect from the title. The book is not about `petits fours', it is about small sweet foods for desserts or snacks, including cookies, pastries, and candies. It is also especially about baking technique rather than about fancy decorating. This is no craft book that happens to be about a baked product. This is a serious cookbook by a very serious writer on baking.<br /><br />One of the very best things about the book is the introductory section on general baking technique, especially the essay on of the various types of mixing cookie doughs and their effects on the properties of the finished baked goods. This discussion starts with a theme common to her other books, which is that you should not discard mistakes. You can easily hit upon a different recipe by missing or overdoing a step. Her specific lesson came when she `overmixed' a sugar and butter creaming step when she left her mixer on to answer the telephone. The resulting batter produced cookies that were much lighter and higher and airier than usual. The explanation of Braker's discovery is in Shirley Corriher's `Cookwise' where she explains that the creaming of sugar in butter creates tiny air pockets that help leaven the product when the dough is baked. The remainder of Part I offers lots of other similar tips on general baking and on the special equipment recommended for making miniatures, most of which is the same stuff you use in general baking. I would recommend that Ms. Braker consider adding either photographs or line drawings of the specialized equipment. I have read and reviewed many books on baking, but she still uses some specialized terms that a picture would have made clear in a wink.<br /><br />As someone who does not entertain, but who would like to, Ms. Braker's book gives me much more than simply more recipes. It tells me that miniatures are very popular with just about everyone, and it tells me how to organize my work to make two or three different recipes at the same time. This will come in very handy the next time I do my batches of four different Christmas cookies.<br /><br />The first chapter of recipes presents 22 miniature variations on shortbread cookies. A first look at the recipes shows an acute attention to detail which distinguishes baking recipes from savory recipes and which distinguishes very good baking recipes from the run of the mill Wednesday newspaper recipes. One unusual ingredient in some of Braker's shortbread is non-glutinous rice flour, which you may only be able to find on the Internet or in better health food stores. One of the things which is so attractive about shortbread cookies is that they may be the pastry world's version of `refrigerator Velcro' in that they will accept as an ingredient just about any few ounces of leftover jam, preserve, nut, or nut butter you happen to have laying around. I don't recommend diving into leftover reclamation until you have your shortbread technique down pat, but here are 22 ideas for using up all that sweet stuff.<br /><br />The second chapter deals with crispy lacy things which, like ice cream cones, often serve as a container for other good stuff. The first and most architypical recipe is for tuiles, which are all about egg whites, sugar, almonds and butter than they are about flour. This and other recipes like it are cases where a quick test run with a single cookie is well worth the time and effort, especially since I have never made a tuille.<br /><br />The third chapter deals with spicy sweets, seasoned primarily with ginger, cinnamon, cloves, and allspice, `the cookie spices'. One of the best discoveries in this chapter is a recipe for `pains d'amande' or Belgian almond cookies.<br /><br />The fourth chapter contains recipes for tartlets, which is what usually comes to mind when you think of miniatures. The first recipe is for a general pastry to be used to create shells for the other recipes. There is no mystery here. It is almost identical to making your favorite apple pie crust until you form the dough into fluted tartlet tins.<br /><br />The fifth chapter of recipes covers pastries, puffs, raviolis, rolls, strudels, and turnovers made with phylo dough or puff pastry. The homemade dough of choice here is a sour cream pastry, with a variation using yogurt. Other special doughs are a cottage cheese dough, cream cheese pastry and heavy cream flaky pastry.<br /><br />The sixth recipe chapter covers cake miniatures, including the few recipes that may properly be called petits fours. Here you get more meringue, more pistachio, and more fruit pastries, oh my.<br /><br />The last recipe chapter deals with candy and has lots of important advice on dealing with chocolate, toffee, and caramel, leading up to recipes for butter crunch, candied apples, chocolate wafers, spicy marshmallows, and raspberry jellies.<br /><br />The book finishes with the chapter on planning ahead. It may have been more appropriate to put this chapter at the beginning, so I warn you to check out the table of contents carefully before jumping into a recipe at random. Advice I would give for reading any cookbook.<br /><br />A highly recommended book for general baking technique and insights into what people like.a quick test run with a single cookie is well worth the time and effort, especially since I have never made a tuille.  <br /> <br />The third chapter deals with spicy sweets, seasoned primarily with ginger, cinnamon, cloves, and allspice, `the cookie spices'.

531100:US	39134375	RCRUWAG0MINGP	0060197315	895113043	The Greatest Dishes!: Around the World in 80 Recipes	Books	5	22	22	N	N	Great Read and Super Culinary Reference.	`the greatest dishes!, around the world in 80 recipes' by Anya von Bremzen picks a clever target number for her best ever dishes, to give us a book which is almost identical in concept to another recent book `The Cook's Canon, 101 Classic Recipes Everyone Should Know' by Raymond Sokolov. There is a sliver of space between the ideas behind the two books in that von Bremzen is claiming her list is `the best' while Sokolov is claiming his list may be the most useful. This small difference in concept has a lot to do with the differences in their list, which has many expected overlaps and some surprising differences.<br /><br />Sokolov's list contains many preparations that are not dishes. They are very commonly used sauces and relishes used to enhance hundreds of other dishes such as beurre blanc, hollandaise sauce, marmalade, mayonnaise, and vinaigrette. Von Bremzen has recipes for several of these items embedded in her recipes for main dishes, as hollandaise sauce is included in the recipe for Eggs Benedict.<br /><br />Von Bremzen's list tends to contain many generic dishes for which there may be thousands of variations. A few examples are cheesecake, couscous, fried chicken, chocolate cake, lasagna, potato gratin, sushi, and risotto. In selecting the recipe for dishes with such a great variety in local favorites, she generally picks something close to, but not necessarily exactly on the common American architypical image of these dishes. For fried chicken, she takes exactly the same recipe I would have picked, a brined and buttermilk soaked from Edna Lewis and Scott Peacock's `The Gift of Southern Cooking'. For chocolate cake, on the other hand, I might have picked the recipe from the back of the Hershey's cocoa can. Ms. Von Bremzen picks a less well known but much richer recipe from Rose Pistola which includes espresso, Frangelico, and Hazelnuts. Yum. Similarly, for cheesecake, she doesn't use the very well-known New York City recipe, she uses a chocolate glazed lemon cake based on this model. Comparing her recipe to the hypercareful Alton Brown procedure, I find all the right cautions and wards are in place to prevent cracks while baking it to perfection.<br /><br />Both books have a well-balanced selection from around the world with only a slight leaning on Von Bremzen's part toward Russian and Askanazy Jewish specialties like blinis and borshch. The stories Von Bremzen and Sokolov tell about borshch are consistent, in that they both tout the Ukrainian version of the dish. Since Von Bremzen covers 21 fewer dishes in 100 more pages, her background stories are longer and her recipes are longer as well. I detected no skimping at all on even the most daunting dishes such as bouillabaisse and cassoulet. Speaking of which, neither dishes are in Sokolov's book, and I simply cannot imagine them being left out of Von Bremzen's book. The difference is that little sliver of light between the concepts of the two books.<br /><br />Regarding the narrative provided to introduce each recipe, both books are highly entertaining and there is a very high level of agreement between the books on the facts about most dishes, although Von Bremzen tends to give more information. Her ink also tends to be much less caustic than Sokolov. Where Sokolov belittles some statements by culinary essayist John Thorne, Von Bremzen cites his writings as a respected authority. Some of Sokolov's sharpness also tends to lead him into unfortunate mistakes as when he questions the presence of cracker crumbs in a clam chowder recipe. Von Bremzen (quoting Thorne no less) correctly points out that crumbs from ship's biscuit were the original thickener, later replaced by flour as late as 1820.<br /><br />If you like the idea of either of these books, I recommend you get both. Amazingly, there are only fifteen (15) dishes in common between the two books. And, as most of those 15 dishes have umpteen variations, the chance of duplicating recipes is tiny. Even so standard adish as Wiener Schnitzel is given with subtle variations, with Von Bremzen citing Mario Lohninger of David Bouley's Viennese restaurant in New York City and Sokolov citing Anna Maria Schwarzenberg for a restaurant in Vienna for the gospel. Both use veal, lemon, eggs, but Von Bremzen uses no milk, adds parsley, and is especially picky about the quality of her breadcrumbs.<br /><br />While both books are great introductions to important world dishes such as dolma, sancocho, tom yum kung, and imam bayildi, they are also great references for favorites such as apple pie, Caesar salad, eggs Benedict, lasagna, lobster rolls, macaroni and cheese, meatballs, onion soup, potato salad, roast chicken, steak, and hamburgers. Even with these standards, the difference between the two books is instructive. Von Bremzen uses a straight bechamel sauce for her macaroni and cheese with beer, sharp cheese, nutmeg, and mustard to spice up the taste while Sokolov leans closer to a custard sauce and a mild cheese, with all the spice coming from cayenne.<br /><br />My only quibble with Von Bremzen's book is that out of 80 recipes which must have posed many tough choices between various options, she picks both apple pie and tart Tatin, which by all accounts, may really be considered just a variation on apple pie. She calls it an apple cake, but the crust is made with puff pastry, which is a whole lot more like piecrust than it is like genoise. It is still worth having the recipe for the story of how the author discovered her best recipes and for the recommendation to use Gala apples in the dish.<br /><br />As both great reads and great reference cookbooks, both books are simply the best. If you simply cannot get both, get Von Bremzen's book, as I think her recipes are just a little more careful, more tasty, and more true to their archetypes.tandard a dish as Wiener Schnitzel is given with subtle variations, with Von Bremzen citing Mario Lohninger of David Bouley's Viennese restaurant in New York City and Sokolov citing Anna Maria Schwarzenberg for a restaurant in Vienna for the gospel.

Good Read.	`Frank Stitt's Southern Table' is a coffee table cookbook published by Artisan with very much of the same style, size, and heft of their earlier books by Thomas Keller and Eric Rippert, with most of the same strengths and weaknesses of these two other celebrity chef show books.<br /><br />The book begins with a highly personal Foreword by North Carolina novelist Pat Conroy who must have a more than casual eye for good food, as he just happened to run into Frank Stitt about 24 years ago across the aisle on an airplane as Conroy happened to see Stitt taking notes from what Conroy recognized as cookbooks by some very high end authors. Stitt was just on his way back to Birmingham, Alabama to open his own restaurant and confided to Conroy that he was a very, very good chef.<br /><br />Stitt's introduction fills out his culinary pedigree, citing the fact that he apprenticed at `Chez Panisse' with Alice Waters, from whom he received an introduction to leading French food writer Richard Olney. Stitt became Olney's assistant and through him met Jeremiah Tower and leading English food writer Elizabeth David. When Stitt opened his own restaurant `Highlands' in Birmingham, he combined traditional Southern cooking with these heavy French and Provencal influences with superfresh ingredients to create a cuisine with a skill which has landed him near the head of the class of American chefs.<br /><br />All this pedigree and all these paeans to fresh ingredients do not mean this is a good book. It only certifies that Stitt has in him what it takes to write a good book. The proof is in the reading, not in the reputation. For starters, he has to prove that he has added sufficient value to overcome book's drawback of being better suited for the coffee table than the kitchen counter. The book is too heavy and the typeface is too small to work well `in situ'.<br /><br />The first chapter of recipes deals with classic Southern dishes such as fried green tomatoes, Hoppin John, baked grits, corn bread, cracklins, pimiento cheese, and mint tea. All the dishes are true to other Southern writers I've read including James Villas, Edna Lewis, and Paula Deen, with a few deluxe touches such as making the pimiento cheese with home roasted red bell peppers instead of canned pimientos.<br /><br />The next chapter covers mixed drinks and bar food. While I consider mixed drink recipes in a cookbook to be not much better than filler, these do succeed in filling out part of the promise Conroy made in the Foreword that `Highlands' has some of the best mixed drinks. And I have learned from Jim Villas that mixed drinks are as much a part of the Southern culinary experience as wine is to French and Italian cuisine. This does not mean wine is ignored. The author includes one of his little essays to wine appreciation. Most of these three page bon mots deal with restaurant staff members and suppliers. The intro. to the bar food gives some conventional advice on cooking for entertaining.<br /><br />The next chapter covers appetizers, soups, and salads. My appreciation for the author jumped a bit when I saw him present recipes for both classic Southern tomato salads with bacon AND the Italian Panzanella salad without confusing the two. He does confess to adapting the Panzanella to Southern tastes by using corn bread, but I really appreciate the appreciation of tradition shown here. All recipes show a subtle mixture of things in common between Provencal and Southern cuisines such as greens, peas, beans, tomatoes, pumpkin, and mint. I am beginning to like this book more and more.<br /><br />The fish chapter continues the Southern / Provencal fusion with a little Yankee chowder thrown in for good measure. This chapter adds a new word to my vocabulary, `pirlau', a Carolina low country rice and protein stew that be made with the sweepings of leftovers from the icebox and the pantry. A mistake would be to try to duplicate this recipe exactly. It's the kind of thing where you wantto internalize the spirit of the dish and make it `ad hoc' when the proper time arrives. There are some simple dishes here, which make the reader appreciate the fact that `haute cuisine' is not always about complicated preparations. Some simple flounder dishes alone may be worth the price of the book.<br /><br />The poultry chapter covers both domestic and wild bird cooking with quail being the most popular winged protein in these recipes. Again, a fair number of recipes are pretty simple sautes with prominent French tastes. Most protein dish recipes include the recipe for a vegetable garnish. Very nice.<br /><br />The meat chapter is evenly divided between lamb, beef, and pork recipes, with some French rabbit recipes thrown in to spice it up.<br /><br />The rather long chapter of vegetable dishes continues the mix of Southern and Provencal with potatoes, corn, asparagus, peas, and greens in pirlaus, ratatouilles, and gratins. I always salivate over a new gratin recipe. The `old fashioned potato gratin' will never appear in Weight Watchers, but it looks delish. Note that the heavy cream is not just for taste, lighter dairy will quickly curdle in a hot gratin dish.<br /><br />The desserts chapter is a grand mix of Southern, French, and Italian classics, with apples, peaches, strawberries, pecans, and Jack Daniels in starring roles. The blackberry cobbler, for example, is nicely done with some taste of lemon added in. Peaches and blueberries combine to make another great variation on a classic.<br /><br />The last chapter is on pantry preparations. They are generally a waste of space except in teaching cookbooks and books meant to capture the cuisine of a specific place. True to Southern tradition, the author will make his own mayonnaise, but freely allow us to use Hellmans.<br /><br />This book is a fine evocation of Stitt's restaurant experience and a source of good, interesting, and simple recipes. If you like Keller and Rippert, get this one too.here you want to internalize the spirit of the dish and make it `ad hoc' when the proper time arrives.

Highly recommended.	`Something from the Oven' by Laura Shapiro is subtitled `Reinventing Dinner in 1950's America', referring to the conventional wisdom that home cooking in the 1950's was all about cooking with packaged, canned, frozen, and other commercially prepared foods. Oddly, the most interesting message I get from this book is that in spite of the great expansion of such preparations, home cooks, primarily housewives, did not embrace this trend and generally considered cooking with frozen foods and baking with cake mixes to be a second rate expedient to true home cooking. American home cooks in the 1950s still based much of their cooking on fresh meats, vegetables, and fruits.<br /><br />One of the other more interesting topics in this book is the fact that the packaged food marketing trend of the 50's was based to a great extent on the efforts the food packagers made to prepare instant food preparations for the American army during World War II. The most famous of these preparations was Spam, which survives to this day, although in the 1950's the book recounts a good half dozen similar brands. Another great impetus to the prepared food movement was the introduction of frozen foods before the war, which reached its apotheosis with Swanson's creation of the TV dinner, created as a solution to the company's being stuck with an especially large shipment of frozen turkeys. As I recall only too well, frozen food simply did not take off as well as we may believe from the vantage point of 50 years later. Most homes simply did not have large freezers and the technology to successfully freeze a lot of foods was simply not there yet. As someone whose father tried to make his fortune by getting into the frozen food distribution business, and wisely getting out of it almost as quickly, I can testify to the fact that the market for frozen food grew a lot more slowly than it's boosters had hoped.<br /><br />Another interesting perspective is the fact that canned fruits and vegetables date back to the beginning of the twentieth century and while they simply do not and cannot duplicate the flavor of fresh products, they, like Bisquik and Spam today, were simply accepted as a distinct product. Canned pears, pineapple, and fruit salad had their own niches, different from the fresh ingredients.<br /><br />Packaged cake mixes have not fared nearly as well as canned goods. In the 50's, they were the perfect products for flour companies to replace falling sales of plain white flour, but they were never accepted as a complete substitute for cakes made from scratch. There is no question that these products have improved over the years, but they never reached the point where they transcended their role as a less than perfect short cut, suspicious for their pharmacopoeia of additives.<br /><br />Aside from setting the record straight on trends in the 50's, the author gives several profiles of the major real and imagined trendsetters of the period. One of the most interesting by far is the story of Poppy Cannon who is probably just barely remembered by older Women's magazine readers and culinary journalists. In the mid-1950s, she broadly endorsed the use of convenience foods, modern appliances, and quick simulations of classic dishes. In writing recipes, she invented words with abandon which would make modern Jamie Oliver's `glugs' of olive oil look positively pedestrian. It is only just that Cannon is not remembered today since her doctrine was based on a basic inconsistency between gourmet dishes and convenience. Unlike James Beard who based good cooking on fresh foods and regional cuisines and whose reputation survives to this day, Cannon's key to gourmet cuisine was fancy preparation. One of the greatest ironies of her career was her association with Alice B. Toklas, whose basic French home cooking was about as different from Cannon's doctrine as you can get. Their friendship was strong, embracing even the gift of a mixmaster to Toklas, until Cannon started pushing Toklas celebrity, which offended Alice's reverence for the memory of her dead companion Gertrude Stein, as Toklas lived primarily to promote Stein's life and works.<br /><br />Another theme in the book is the dichotomy between home cooking, the world of women in the home, and gourmet cooking, the world of men in the professional kitchen and in gourmet food clubs. One of the oddest comments I have ever seen about a cookbook was a quote from someone who praised `The Joy of Cooking' for having no `womens' cooking recipes. The trend went so far at this time that the great American culinary essayist M.F.K. Fisher used her initials as her byline because it disguised the fact that she was a woman. As she ate her way through Europe, she constantly encountered the opinion that she had a man's taste for food.<br /><br />It is entirely appropriate that a fair amount of writing appears in the book about Peg Bracken who, unlike Poppy Cannon, is still fondly remembered today and whose book is still used by, for example Karen Duffy, author of `slob in the kitchen'. Shapiro reveals that Bracken really did not hate to cook, she was simply offering ways of easing the demands on housewives to provide tasty meals for their families day after day. So, If cooking was not really your forte, she offered ways to get the job done well without guilt.<br /><br />It is part of Julia Child's immense legacy that she, and not James Beard or Craig Claiborne or any other male culinary professional changed the face of home cooking in America. She broke down the wall between male and female cooking ethos by demystifying the citadel of gourmet cooking, French cuisine, for the American home cook. She may not have turned American housewives into gourmet cooks, but she indelibly shifted the focus of cooking from cheap and easy flash to good ingredients and basic skills.<br /><br />This book is highly recommended for anyone interested in American culinary history and its myths.hing Toklas celebrity, which offended Alice's reverence for the memory of her dead companion Gertrude Stein, as Toklas lived primarily to promote Stein's life and works.<br /><br />Another theme in the book is the dichotomy between home cooking, the world of women in the home, and gourmet cooking, the world of men in the professional kitchen and in gourmet food clubs.

554617:US	39134375	R25EMU1AFJKFQA	014200166X	390400356	Is There a Nutmeg in the House?: Essays on Practical Cooking with More Than 150 Recipes	Books	5	6	6	N	Y	Culinary Essays by a Master. Leftovers, but still Tasty	Elizabeth David was a leading practitioner of a rare breed, the culinary essayist. The culinary species of this genus is rare because essays in general seem to be a dying breed. The most prominent modern American culinary essayist is John Thorne. While Thorne's primary influence was Richard Olney, Olney and David were of a single mind in style and in many opinions about food. Olney and David together were the patron saints of the invention of the distinctively California cuisine, both being cited by Alice Waters of Chez Panisse, Jeremiah Tower of Chez Panisse and Stars, and Judy Rodgers of the Zuni Grill as their primary inspirations.<br /><br />David seems to have had an even bigger effect on English eating. In fact, her effect on English home cooking seems to have been strongly parallel to that of the recently departed Julia Child on American home kitchens in the writers' influence on how supermarkets stock their produce aisles with more unusual fruits and vegetables. The parallel goes even further, as both were relatively tall, both were born to well to do families with little interest in culinary quality, and both served in unusual and important posts overseas during World War II. While Child was an OSS clerk in Southeast Asia, David was a librarian to the Foreign Service in Egypt. At this point, their culinary careers follow different paths. Child becomes the consummate interpreter and teacher of French cuisine while David becomes the critic and interpreter of French and Mediterranean cuisine to her English audience. Both held very strong opinions. Child tended to keep hers out of her writing, but David felt free to offer reasoned opinions on just about anything which crossed her path.<br /><br />This volume should be a warning to journeyman writers everywhere that it is not wise to comment on the work of important writers, especially important writers whose work promises to be reprinted long after their death. Early in the book, David comments on some inaccuracies in writings on her work and career, and, I suspect, her criticisms of these mistakes will be read long after the original authors are forgotten, or, worse, remembered only for their misstatements about Ms. David.<br /><br />This volume was published posthumously but with the selection of material done largely by the author shortly before her death, as a sequel to the volume `An Omelette and a Glass of Wine'. Most pieces are magazine articles comprised of an essay on some ingredient, followed by recipes on the same ingredient or subject. Like David's cookbooks, I read her articles on ingredients and recipes less to actually make the specific dishes and more to educate my thinking about food. One fine example is her essay on rosemary in which she complains about the overuse of this herb in many dishes and by many cuisines such as the Greek use with lamb. The following essay is a liberating discussion of dried herbs, pointing out that fresh herbs are simply not always better. Many herbs attain their best effect when dried.<br /><br />I like to believe that John Thorne's fussiness with culinary nomenclature comes from, or at least is reinforced by Elizabeth David's insistence that you maintain some semblance of fidelity to the meaning of words, as when she exhorts us to limit the name Quiche Lorraine to a preparation with pastry shell, eggs, cream, and bacon. Cheese is simply not part of the paradigm. She adds to a warmly cordial reference to Child's `Mastering the Art of French Cooking' part of the blame for this linguistic larceny, as Child says the dish is very easy and gives license to improvise.<br /><br />The variety of subjects is great and engaging, ranging from egg dishes to encounters with publishers, a rather arcane subject which I always find interesting, going back as far as my reading of H.L. Menchen's cordial connection to Alfred A. Knopf. David's relations with publishers was not as cordial. While the evidence that this book is collected from leftovers, they are almost universally leftovers which were originally of a very high quality and which have improved with age, as there are few culinary writers who can match David's turn of phrase and highly balanced sensibilities about ingredients and their use.<br /><br />I would rank this volume high in value as a part of a culinary library.rom leftovers, they are almost universally leftovers which were originally of a very high quality and which have improved with age, as there are few culinary writers who can match David's turn of phrase and highly balanced sensibilities about ingredients and their use. <br /> <br />I would rank this volume high in value as a part of a culinary library. <br />	2004-08-16

Great Read	'Cooking for Kings' by Ian Kelly is a Biography with Recipes subtitled 'the Life of Antonin Careme, the First Celebrity Chef'. I suspect that since the 1820s in France did not have the great celebrity media of TV, press, and print of today, one can question whether Antonin Careme was in any way similar to Wolfgang Puck, Emeril Lagasse, and Mario Batali. But, this is probably just an academic quibble with a word in the title, as Careme is as important to the history of modern western (read French) culinary practice than any other figure you can mention, including Escoffier.<br /><br />The greatest delight in reading a book of this type, an interesting history of a period in your field of interest with which you may not be too familiar. There is a little surprise on every page, and a few really big ones. In retrospect, it is almost obvious that to become famous in the culinary field in Napoleonic France, one had to be a patisserie. There were no restaurants. In fact, the book repeats the claim that restaurants were invented by the French Revolution, as the guild system under the Bourbons prevented establishments from selling practically all kinds of food except soup. The Revolution, in seeking to overturn everything associated with the Royal regime, overturned that stricture as well. So, restaurant chefs were not exactly a dime a dozen in Napoleonic Paris. Almost all great chefs were employees of wealthy families, former nobility, or they were pastry chefs, as boulangerie and patisserie were much better established and patisserie offered a medium in which great talent can achieve expression. That is, the centerpieces of great banquets created largely out of sugar and baked shapes.<br /><br />This would make pastry specialists such as Jacques Torres and Ewald Notter the closest modern counterparts to Careme, as both Torres and Notter are leaders in the very specialized field of confectionery sculpture, one in chocolate and one in sugar. This also means that this practice which seems so 'new' on Food Network specials covering pastry competitions is actually very old, and much more widely popular than it is today. So, it was much easier for a patisserie specialist to come to the attention of the very food conscious politician Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Perigord. Talleyrand is probably the third most important non-Royal politician in French history, following only Napoleon and Cardinal Richileau. As important as dining was to Talleyrand's political techniques, it is curious to read that culinary matters were of practically no importance to Talleyrand's boss, Napoleon.<br /><br />Talleyrand was Careme's first very important patron, the second being the very wealthy Rothchild family. Having such powerful patrons at an early stage in his career did not prevent Careme from suffering and ultimately dying from the occupational disease of cooks, especially cooks in great houses. That is, disorders of the lungs from breathing in smoke and carbon monoxide from charcoal fires in dark, poorly ventilated basement kitchens. The great irony here is that the architectural convention of placing large kitchens in the basement came from the great residential architect Palladio, a major hero in Careme's interest in architecture as an inspiration to his centerpiece constructions in sugar and pastry.<br /><br />One of Careme's most famous influences on gastronomy was the classification of mother sauces, but his subtle influence is much greater. Another little surprise in the telling of the times was the fact that the style of food service common in great French meals was quite unlike what we are used to today. The French style almost seemed like a 'family style' service where many dishes were placed on the table at once. The modern system plating moderately sized courses, delivered to the table one at a time was imported from Russia and was gaining in popularity in Paris after 1815. Careme was a great advocate of this method of service.<br /><br />Just a note here to suggest that you do not buy this book with the thought that you will actually make many of the recipes in this book. A fair number can be done, but many involve ingredients that are simply no longer available and many preparation techniques will try the patience of even the most devout foodie. They remind me again and again that much of older French cuisine is built on the premise of its clients having poor teeth. It abounds in purees, aspics, and mousses squeezing some of the most improbable things through coarse screens for hours.<br /><br />But, this is all part of the picture the author very successfully paints of haute cuisine in the time of Napoleon, even if the Emperor was not himself a gourmand.<br /><br />Highly recommended reading for anyone with an interest in culinary history.> <br />Just a note here to suggest that you do not buy this book with the thought that you will actually make many of the recipes in this book.

Highly Nutritious for the Soul	'More Home Cooking' by Laurie Colwin is the kind of book that really makes you wish you could become friends with the author. Unfortunately, the author is no longer with us and I believe this volume was published posthumously, so there is a lot more than the usual barrier between celebrity and mere mortal between reader and writer.<br /><br />Like the first volume, 'Home Cooking', chapters in the book are essays composed of both culinary and autobiographical material, although the book is not a memoir a la Ruth Reichl's two books. It is also not culinary criticism or exposition in the style of John Thorne. It is most similar to the kind of essays written by M.F.K. Fisher and Elizabeth David, one of the author's heroes.<br /><br />In one of her essays, Ms. Colwin puts her finger on a reason for the popularity of cookbooks and cooking shows in the face of what some people claim to be the disappearance of home cooking. Reading about cooking is simply very comforting and reassuring. I find that I may not learn a whole lot from a particular Ina Garten or Paula Deen or Sara Moulton show on the Food Network, but it is certainly reassuring to watch, if even for the fourteenth time, how Ina cooks salmon so she can have it at two different meals with her guests being none the wiser regarding the doubling up on the effort.<br /><br />Ms. Colwin gained this insight by reading Elizabeth David's 'Italian Food' while under the influence of a particularly acute hangover. And, her admiration of David's style is well demonstrated in the way Ms. Colwin writes recipes. There is none of the formal list of ingredients at the top with neatly laid out prep instructions so one can do their mise en place in true French brigade fashion. This is straight from Elizabeth David's spare recipe writing style done at a time when home cooks knew a lot more about cooking than they do today, or that at least is the patter among the Cassandras of modern culinary journalism.<br /><br />Fortunately, Ms. Colwin's writing is less about cooking technique than it is about how we do and should think about cooking and food. It is to culinary journalism much like the editorial pages are to political journalism.<br /><br />Like all very good culinary journalism such as that done by Anthony Bourdain and Michael Ruhlman, this is stuff you can read and reread on rainy March afternoons. It is doubly good in that Ms. Colwin is speaking from a quarter she knows well, the slightly atypical American housewife.<br /><br />Very highly recommended culinary reading.

Great Read for Foodies	'Home Cooking' by Laurie Colwin is the kind of book that really makes you wish you could become friends with the author.

It is also not culinary criticism or exposition in the style of John Thorne. It is most similar to the kind of essays written by Elizabeth David, one of the author's heroes, and M.F.K. Fisher.<br /><br />The author has the advantage of most good writers in that she has lived in interesting circumstances providing fuel for her writing. One premise for much of her culinary advice is based on the fact that for several years, she lived in a very small Greenwich Village apartment with no oven, two hot plates, no sink and a tiny refrigerator, with literally enough room to hold no more than three people at a time. Amazingly, the author was able to actually entertain in this tiny space, using the bathtub and commode as a means of washing up the dishes.<br /><br />Much of the culinary advice is quirky and some is actually a bit dated, as it predates the microplane and the cheap plastic mandoline. I suspect the author may have changed some of her opinions if these tools had been available. Colwin's advice about knives is also a little dated, as she swears by carbon steel blades rather than modern stainless steel. Since there is no evidence that she sharpened her own knives, I suspect a modern Santoku knife may have changed her opinion. Even so, the essays are a testament to cooking with only the bare minimum of equipment and space.<br /><br />It is not surprising that Ms. Colwin's recipes never made the 'Best of' series, as they are quirky rather than true gourmet fare. While another of Ms. Colwin's heroes is Edna Lewis, the very influential writer on Southern cooking, Ms. Colwin's recipe for Southern Fried Chicken does not follow Ms. Lewis' lead on a number of things such as an overnight buttermilk marinade. He does, however, keep to the gospel of pan frying rather than deep-frying.<br /><br />Ms. Colwin's writing provides much more food for the soul than it does food for the gut. Reading this book makes one wish that Karen Duffey would have channeled her not inconsiderable talent for the simple in her book 'A Slob in the Kitchen' into a style more like Ms. Colwin's very entertaining twists on culinary matters.<br /><br />Highly recommended reading for foodies.l writer on Southern cooking, Ms. Colwin's recipe for Southern Fried Chicken does not follow Ms. Lewis' lead on a number of things such as an overnight buttermilk marinade.

Atypical Stock Method	In all of their books and magazines, the editors of ?Cooks Illustrated? should have a qualifier stating on which criteria their ?Best? judgment is made. My general experience with their writings is to find that they typically look for the fastest recipe which makes the fewest compromises with taste and which does not cost an unusually large amount of money. Although, it is clear from these recipes that these criteria do not keep it from naturally long procedures such as stock making or expensive basic equipment such as heavy stockpots. It is also clear that these priorities can avoid some longer methods that are needed to achieve the very best taste.<br /><br />One important question about this book is how well it rates compared to other ?Cooks Illustrated? Best Recipe volumes. In general, I find little to distinguish one from the other except to say that this volume has the virtue of gathering together similar preparations such as the Chinese egg drop soup and the Italian Straciatella, a measure they have not always taken in other volumes, as when brioche and challah are done in two different recipes separated by several dozen pages.<br /><br />While ?Cooks Illustrated? is commonly very modest about their findings and recipes, the presumption that these culinary journalists and journeyman cooks are coming up with insights which have escaped master chefs is pretty far fetched. The other side of the coin is that different chefs have different methods, and different cuisines have different approaches to the same technique. Witness the difference between French, Swiss, and Italian meringue. But, that doesn?t mean one meringue is always better than another is. An issue more relevant to the book at hand is stock making. The editors choose a saute method for browning meat and vegetables in their stocks, where most recipes brown meat and vegetables in the oven. This decision influences their recommendations of a stockpot, where they suggest a heavy stainless steel or enameled iron pot. The problem with this is that while an 8-quart pot of these metals may be manageable and affordable, a 12 or 16 quart pot is a different kettle of fish entirely. It is much heavier and it is much more expensive.<br /><br />Many recommendations for a large stockpot are for aluminum or light gage stainless steel. Alton Brown in his Gear book recommends a heavier aluminum or stainless pot to enhance heat distribution, but not for browning. My vote is for browning meat and vegetables in the oven and going for the lighter stockpot.<br /><br />Other information on stock making is invaluable, and not something you will find the typical master chef saying in their books. The comparison of stocks made with popular commercial brands of chicken versus free-range chicken is dramatic. And, the endorsement of Campbell?s labeled (Campbell?s and Swanson) chicken stocks has been consistent for several years. It is also interesting to hear that commercial stock makers use old egg laying hens to make their stocks and thereby get a stronger flavor than from young broiler / fryers.<br /><br />The odd thing is that for beef, the reverse is true. The very best beef stocks are from veal, since these very young bones have much more collagen to create more tasty gelatin in the stocks. This is such basic (French) kitchen wisdom that I?m surprised that the book simply does not deal with veal stocks at all, even to say that veal stocks are not commonly used in soups.<br /><br />The soup recipes are uniformly good and, as always, the reasoning behind each decision in selecting each recipe is well worth the effort to enhance one?s ability to think creatively about cooking. The very best part of each recipe development is in the illustration of how to select good ingredients and how do perform certain common techniques. I strongly suspect that the sidebar on some techniques ends up in many different ?Cooks Illustrated? volumes, but that?s OK. There is lots of special material to go around.<br /><br />Stews are presented in five separate chapters covering Meat, Chicken, Seafood, and Vegetable stews plus ?Chilis, Gumbos, and Curries?. I suspect the distinction between a soup and a stew is more traditional and arbitrary than can be pinned down in a few words, but the author?s rule seems to be that soups are eaten primarily with a spoon while stews can be eaten with a fork.<br /><br />While the authors and editors often come to agree with the established practices of generations of chefs, it is always fun to find an exception to a time-honored rule, as with the washing of mushrooms. The editors reproduced an experiment by food scientist Harold McGee to confirm that a quick wash causes mushrooms to pick up no more water than a like weight of broccoli. This may be old news to some, but it is still interesting news.<br /><br />The final chapter is on recipes for soup accompaniments such as rice, potato, polenta, breads and biscuits. I can?t help thinking that much of this chapter was put in to fill out a page size requirement, as I simply do not know anyone who makes it a practice of eating rice, potato, and polenta dishes with soups and stews. The biscuits and bread recipes are entirely appropriate, but they would not take up much space alone.<br /><br />I always get recent ?Cooks Illustrated? cookbooks and I am rarely disappointed with them, and this book is no exception. My only caveat is on very basic matters such as stocks, if you are not already familiar with them, is to get a second opinion from an authoritative book by the likes of Jaques Pepin, James Stevenson, or Shirley Corriher.<br /><br />Recommended primer on good, basic recipes, especially if you are willing to make your own stock.rial to go around. <br /> <br />Stews are presented in five separate chapters covering Meat, Chicken, Seafood, and Vegetable stews plus ?Chilis, Gumbos, and Curries?.

This is certainly the case with the author?s ?Crust and Crumb? being trumped by his latest bread volume, ?The Bread Baker?s Apprentice?. Both volumes have won James Beard awards up the wazoo, and both books deserve all the praise they get for how well they address the relatively difficult and arcane corner of gastronomica that is artisinal bread baking.<br /><br />Before you form any impressions that this praise means you simply must get this book, be warned that you will be perfectly capable of making superior bread at home without cracking any one of Reinhart?s books. There are several more accessible sources. My favorite, recommended by Reinhart himself is the bread baking chapters of ?Baking with Julia (Child)? co-authored by baking writer Dorie Greenspan. Another even broader and older source is Bernard Clayton?s ?Complete Book of Breads? which covers over six hundred pages without once using the words ?poolish?, ?biga?, or ?sponge?.<br /><br />Reinhart?s books are for professionals (especially ?Crust and Crumb?) and very serious bread baking enthusiasts and hobbyists (especially ?The Bread Baker?s Apprentice?). If you go back to Reinhart?s very first book ?Brother Juniper?s Bread Book?, you may even say these books are for those people who treat bread as part of their religion. Being true to the derivation of the word ?religion?, it is for people who truly wish to be connected to bread making.<br /><br />?The Bread Baker?s Apprentice? is no less serious and no less rigorous than Reinhart?s earlier books, but it is clearly more accessible to the lay reader than ?Crust and Crumb?. Aside from having one of the most attractive covers I have seen on a culinary work in a long time, it is glossier and more invitingly designed by Ten Speed Press, the publishers of both volumes. ?Apprentice? opens with a story of the author?s winning a James Beard Bread Baking competition and how that lead him to a trip to Paris and a tour of several of the French Capital?s leading boulangerie. His experiences with the French apprentice system, especially as used by some of the city?s leading bread bakers is the source of the book?s title, as well as being the source of the great pound sign marked boule being held by the very attractive Reinhart apprentice on the cover of the book.<br /><br />?Apprentice? also devotes close to eighty pages to explaining in great detail the steps of artisinal bread baking. Reinhart?s books, especially this one, are some of the very few I have seen which explain many of the things which go on while making bread. Everyone who uses yeast knows these microorganisms eat sugar or starch and exhale carbon dioxide. What people do not commonly know is that they also exhale ethanol and, in artisinal breads, wild microorganisms that create lactic and acetic acids that give sourdoughs their distinctive flavoring enhance their action. The book also explains that the first rise in bread baking has much more to do with flavor development than it does with creating the airy texture in the bread?s crumb. The only other book which does as good a job of explaining bread baking technique is Joe Ortiz? ?The Village Baker?.<br /><br />?Apprentice? also has as good or better illustrations of baking techniques than both ?Crust and Crumb? or ?The Village Baker?.<br /><br />?Apprentice? presents several of the same ?formulas? that appear in ?Crust and Crumb? but in every case, where the same bread is presented, ?Apprentice? goes into greater depth regarding the history of the bread, the special techniques needed, and the variations commonly done with the same basic formula. Both books use the Bakers Percentage Formula presentation of ingredient amounts, but both also present ingredient amounts in very easily measured ounces. I am surprised that neither book includes metric weights, asthey are immeasurably easier to scale up or down, especially when you are dealing with such small amounts as in fractions of an ounce of salt or yeast. One complaint I have seen of Reinhart?s books is in the large size of some of the recipes (meaning an implementation of a formula). I sympathize with this comment, but point out that Reinhart is not writing for the occasional home baker, he is writing for the professional and the devoted amateur baker.<br /><br />In the author?s treatment of Brioche, both books deal with this bread as the archetype of a whole family of breads; however ?Apprentice? goes into this family tree to a greater depth than I have seen in any other book. It gives formulas for ?Rich Man?s Brioche? with 88 percent butter, ?Middle Class Brioche? with 50 percent butter, and Poor Man?s Brioche with 24 percent butter. While ?Crust? gives formulas for brioche family members Kugelhopf and Challah, ?Apprentice gives formulas for brioche cousins Casatiello and Challah.<br /><br />If I were a consecrated member of the bread baking fraternity, I would want both of these book. Well, I want both anyway, since my philosophy is that a 35-dollar book has paid for itself if it yields up one good ideas, and both books are goldmines of information and ideas about bread baking. If you must choose between the two and you are not a professional, take ?Apprentice?. The cover alone is worth the price of admission. If you are a professional or professional wannabe, take ?Crust?. It has a more extensive bibliography and list of mail, web, and professional sources.<br /><br />In a culinary publishing niche with lots of excellent sources, Reinhart?s books, especially ?The Bread Baker?s Apprentice? is clearly one of the best for the serious baker.weights, as they are immeasurably easier to scale up or down, especially when you are dealing with such small amounts as in fractions of an ounce of salt or yeast.

One of the Best	I am always a little nervous reviewing a book such as Joe Ortiz? ?The Village Baker? published over ten (10) years ago when there are several unread books which are known to me as leading authorities on the subject. This situation means I can praise a book while knowing there may be even better, more recent books on the market. Well, I am beginning to correct that situation with this review of Peter Reinhart?s ?Crust and Crumb? which is just one of his two major award winning books on bread baking. I am pleased to say that not only is ?Crust and Crumb? just a bit better than ?The Village Baker?, Reinhart, in ?Crust and Crumb? recognizes ?The Village Baker? as one of the most highly recommended books on the subject of artisinal bread baking. Both books are so good, it may be hard to recommend one over the other, but I will make some suggestions in this regard at the end of the review.<br /><br />For people knowledgeable about and committed to the task of creating artisinal breads, this book is hands down one of the very best in English, readily available to people living in the United States. The subtitle says it all: ?Master Formulas for Serious Bread Bakers?. The term formulas should not put you off. The author is not turning bread baking into a mathematical exercise. Reinhart is simply using that term to replace recipes in order to reflect the well-known fact that written bread baking procedures are a different sort of thing from savory recipes where measurements can be approximate, with a variation to suit taste of up to 300% in things such as seasonings. Serious baking writers get nervous about statements that may lead to a variation of 10% in the weight of flour or water.<br /><br />For people who do not know what artisinal bread baking is all about, I warn you that the difference between artisinal baking and savory cooking is similar to the difference between building a house out of prefabricated pieces and building a house out of logs you cut down and hew into lumber yourself. If working with active dry yeast is new to you, working with natural yeasts is a quantum step in sophistication beyond that. While you can create quick breads such as biscuits in an hour and you can bake a perfectly good loaf of yeast-risen white bread in six hours, artisinal baking can take days to set up. Then, the chances of success depend heavily on ambient conditions affecting flour and wild yeasts, plus the almost impossible to teach ability to sense stages in dough development by touch, look, and smell.<br /><br />If you have no interest whatsoever in embarking on an artisinal baking project, this book may still have much to offer you. It has some quick bread recipes and it has many recipes that use fresh, active dry, or instant yeast. In addition to these, the knowledge you gain about the nature and history of artisinal bread baking is superb. I was tickled to see Reinhart correct the mistake in another book that attributed the invention of the ?poolish? technique to Polish bakers in Paris. Actually, like many other baking techniques taken for French, the technique was developed in Vienna, by, of course, Polish bakers. The book corrects or explains many other more serious matters, leading to very long write-ups for many of the breadmaking essays, procedures, notes, and comments.<br /><br />The greatest thing about this book I found was the author?s optimism in believing that you the reader are quite capable of duplicating the results of superior artisinal bakers with equipment you have in your home. No less an authority than Jacques Pepin claimed that this feat may be impossible, since you simply do not have the kinds of ovens used by professional bakers. I will go along with Peter Reinhart and not permit myself to believe I cannot bake a perfect Ciabatta, or, at least one as good or better than what is available at my local megamart.<br /><br />This book is a full service location for everything you need to know about baking several important styles of bread as well as where you can get the best equipment, flour, and further information about bread baking. I am delighted that he endorses the opening chapters of Shirley Corriher?s ?Cookwise? as a superior reference on bread baking technique and he cites ?Baking With Julia? as a great way to get started in bread baking. This was my introduction, and it has served me well.<br /><br />Needless to say, in a 210-page book that treats every formula in great depth, this book does not have everything there is about bread baking. It is an excellent text on artisinal baking, but it leaves out almost the whole world of regional specialties. For that, and almost everything else you may want to know about direct method packaged yeast baking, see Bernard Clayton?s ?The Complete World of Breads? or Betsy Oppenneer?s ?Celebration Breads?.

This was my introduction, and it has served me well.    Needless to say, in a 210-page book that treats every formula in great depth, this book does not have everything there is about bread baking. It is an excellent text on artisinal baking, but it leaves out almost the whole world of regional specialties.

It is also done from the perspective of a non-technical literary editor who, in 1996, was not conversant with the few tech totems encountered in the book such as HTML and UNIX.<br />One of the very few insights into amazon.com's technology was given when, in that same year, early in his employment, Marcus had to rotate the content of the site, thereby bringing the current internet content off-line and bringing an updated copy of the site content on line. By 1996, this technique is incredibly primitive, and the fact that it is being done by a copy editor signals an utterly `fly by the seat of your pants' operation. It is an expected relief to a frequent amazon.com user and customer to have the author say that times changed and the company Information Technology staff soon would not let a copy editor within two solid doors of a terminal capable of doing this task. Even so, this is pretty tame stuff. In 1996, working in Information Technology for a pharmaceutical company, we were doing database based content which was more sophisticated than this, and our business was drugs, not Internet content.<br />But, this is all a symptom of the fact that this book is not about technology. It is about marketing and people and organizations. Unfortunately, the principle characters in the book, lead by amazon.com founder and CEO Jeff Bezos simply does not have the kind of larger than life presence of Bill Gates of Microsoft or Larry Ellison of Oracle Corporation. Bezos simply comes across as a talented stockbroker with a good idea and the chuzpah to pull it off.<br />One of the stronger lessons of the book is that in struggling to survive, organizations have little or no mercy regarding the lives of it's employees, even an organization like amazon.com, born in the very enlightened atmosphere of 1990s United States. One of the most common occurrences repeated thousands of times in hundreds of larger organizations is the story of how the author's performance rating was dropped from a 4.5 out of 5 down to a 3.6, even after a staff reduction, due to rankings being mapped to the famous bell shaped curve, where there must be a lot more ratings in the middle of the scale than there are at the top of the scale. It is no surprise at all that this policy was imported from Microsoft.<br />The thing which makes this book so interesting is the fact that amazon.com is a great success story, being one of the most prominent survivors of the bursting tech bubble which deflated at the end of 2000. Of course, the story of amazon.com's IPO and the fortunes of its stock prices and the author's options values are a central theme of the book. One could wish just a little reflection on what made amazon.com work where others did not.<br />Ultimately, the book was interesting. I am glad I read it and it provided useful insights into young organizations. But, it was not what I was hoping for, and it had little of the drama surrounding other computer epics from the creation of Colossus during WWII by Alan Turing to the rise and fall and rise of Apple, Microsoft, IBM, and Oracle.<br />This is a good read, an interesting personal memoir, and a nice insight into a small part of the Internet boom.

584256:US	39134375	RM372ZDD8UYAC	0375412093	210483271	Jacques Pepin Celebrates: 200 of His Most Cherished Recipes for Memorable Meals with Family and Friends	Books	4	16	17	N	N	Jacques Pepin's Greatest Hits. Familiar, but still Great	Jaques Pepin may be unique among American culinary figures, as he is both a widely recognized master chef who is also a leading culinary educator to both professionals at the French Culinary Institute and to laymen through many books and PBS series. He is also closely connected to American culinary aristocracy by association with Julia Child, Craig Claiborne, and Pierre Franey, with whom he worked for many years. One small sign of his renown is that when he happened to appear on the Rocco DiSpirito reality show, `The Restaurant', both Rocco and the executive chef of the restaurant literally fell over one another to show Jaques their regard for his work.<br />This volume, `Jaques Pepin Celebrates' is, in many ways, the album of a live show of his greatest hits, where recipes and techniques from many earlier books are reprised, with new arrangements. This means the value of the book to you will directly depend on how many other of Pepin's books you already have and how much you specifically like his take on cooking. In other words, how big a Jaques Pepin fan are you?<br />The 26 episodes in the PBS series on which this book is based are based on menus for major holidays and other special occasions. The material in the book, however, is very wisely organized around the traditional French cuisine headings of `Stocks and Soups', `Eggs', `Shellfish and Fish', `Poultry and Game', `Meat', `Appetizers, Salads, Side Dishes', `Breads', `Pastries', and `Cakes and Desserts'.<br />There are simple recipes in this book, especially some of the famous French egg and salad recipes, but a large number of the recipes here are relatively complicated. That is not the same as being difficult. As Jaques very honestly states, the bread recipes in the book are relatively straightforward, but achieving a superior result is very difficult, because so much depends on subtleties in your flour, environmental conditions, and oven. Jaques is a better than average source of knowledge on bread baking and pastries, but I would suggest you read what he has to say on the matter and get books by baking specialists such as Nick Malgieri, Flo Braker, Sherry Yard, or Rose Levy Beranbaum to guide you through these subtleties.<br />Unlike books by other major chefs such as Daniel Boulud on cooking for entertaining, Pepin's dishes are almost all standards of the French cuisine. There is very little here which was not cooked in France fifty or more years ago. This is entirely in keeping with this being a `greatest hits' book. A consequence of this selection is that the book offers superior recipes for dishes such as cassolet, leg of lamb, pastry encrusted baked fish, roasted chicken, blinis with caviar, and galantines, mousses, and pates which are very familiar to a large number of people, especially to the foodies among your friends and acquaintances.<br />Like other very good culinary writers such as James Beard, Julia Child, Shirley Corriher, and Tom Colicchio, you must weigh every word, as there is no telling when the next sentence will contain an important tip on culinary technique, such as the little device of rolling hard boiled eggs around in the pot after cooking to crack the shells then cover with cool water to improve ease of peeling the eggs when they cool down. This attention to detail that is so thrilling to find is also so disappointing when you find obvious little mistakes in well respected writers work. There are no disappointments here.<br />With a list price of $40, this is Jaques' coffee table book that you can get to join your other big volumes from Eric Rippert, Thomas Keller, and Jeremiah Tower. In keeping with the celebratory theme, the menus include many wine recommendations, many of which are somewhat fussy, but for all of which Jaques freely allows any reasonable substitution of a wine with similar affinities. Not being a major wine fan, I found the wine suggestions very easy to overlook.<br />Pepin is the gold standard for active American culinary writers. There is practically no room for arguing with his technique and recipes. So, the issue with this book comes down to how well you like French recipes and how many Pepin books do you already own.<br />My personal opinion is that this is not his most valuable volume. For pure technique, I think the `Complete Techniques' volume offers a lot more culinary wisdom for the money. And, I think the `Julia and Jaques Cook at Home' volume offers much more entertainment for the money. So, I would rate this third after these volumes. This is no reflection on the PBS TV series, it is only an evaluation of the book. If you loved the series and wish to preserve these memories, get the book. It will not disappoint you. The book is certainly a lot better than his quick cooking, economic cooking, and healthy cooking titles, as these smack of being titles prepared to ride current trends in cookbooks. Although, Pepin does have special credentials for fast cooking recipes, as his partner, Pierre Franey was a long time expert on the subject.<br />Highly recommended if you are a big Pepin fan, like to cook to entertain, or have no other books by Pepin.ary writers.

585572:US	39134375	R2FNY0S7FNI7FJ	0767914880	600238730	The Tex-Mex Cookbook: A History in Recipes and Photos	Books	5	86	95	N	Y	Superb Evocation and Cookbook for Great American Food	`The Tex-Mex Cookbook' by Robb Walsh, the Southwest's answer to Maine's John Thorne, is a truly remarkable book, in that it presents the history from the beginning, in pictures, narrative, and recipes, of a complete cuisine. The credit for this accomplishment cannot be given to Walsh alone, as part of the ability to write such a history is based on the fact that the `Tex-Mex' cuisine is so young, with many of its defining events happening within living memory. And, no events in this history predate the colonization of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona by the Spanish in the 1500's.<br />One critical `defining moment' in `Tex-Mex' cuisine occurred just thirty years ago, according to the author, when Diana Kennedy, the renowned interpreter of Mexican cuisines identified the style of cooking north of the Mexican border in `The Cuisines of Mexico' as something distinctly not part of Mexican culinary heritage. Having been cut loose from Mexican cuisine by such a distinguished authority left this style of food to establish its own identity.<br />While other writers may not take the `Tex' part of the term literally, Robb Walsh wishes to define the extent of  `Tex-Mex' cuisine as truly that which is done or which originated within the boundaries of Texas, or some location very close by. This rules out several popular gringo dishes such as fish tacos so prominent in San Diego. Ground Zero for Tex-Mex cuisine appears to be San Antonio, in the shadow of the Alamo. Only fitting that the defining venue for Tex-Mex eating is the most memorable location in the battle for Texas independence from Mexico. The word `Tex-Mex' was not invented for the cuisine and may not have been applied to the cuisine until Diana Kennedy banished it from Mexican food styles. It began, however, as early as 1581, when the first European livestock arrived in El Paso, enabling the connection between Old World beef and New World corn and tomatoes. This means that `Tex-Mex' cooking style has some direct connection to Spanish influences. It did not emerge purely from Mexican styles of cooking; however, it is obvious that Tex-Mex owes most of its character to staples and basic preparations that were born in Mexico. The fact which makes the book so vibrant and alive is that many of the most interesting events in Tex-Mex cuisine history happened between 1894 and World War II, which means that so many oral and photographic sources are available for the telling.<br />The heart of Tex-Mex cooking is probably the chile, and the soul is probably the dish, chili con carne, or, literally translated `chile with meat'. The story of the differences in spelling for these closely related things is an important part of the groundwork Walsh lays for recounting the history of Tex-Mex. He presents a simple but very useful survey of chiles which includes a careful distinction of fresh from smoked forms and red from green forms, with a clarification that the famous Hatch chile is actually a cultivar of the Anaheim variety and not a truly distinct species. He is also careful to note that the Habanero is just another name for the Scotch Bonnet, an identity ignored by some other writers who should know better.<br />Needless to say, the book also contains many, many chili con carne recipes, most of which follow true Texas tradition and leave out the beans. There are at least two interesting discoveries regarding chili basics. The first is the fact that early chili con carne recipes included pork and the meats were stewed, as one may do in a French daube and not browned. The second tidbit is the fact that there is a special chili die for grinding meat in a hand meat grinder. Never saw that one on Martha Stewart!<br />The book is filled with a mix of recipes, stories, and pictures, all of which lead to an extremely pleasant culinary / literary experience. It makes one with that John Thorne, Jim Villas, and Calvin Trillin would be a little more creative with using pictures to liven up their essays. Kudos to the book designers at Broadway Books, too, for their effective assembly of all the material. It is rare to find a culinary work that gives so much for its modest $18 list price.<br />The single most important value to the book, of course, is in the recipes that never find their way into important Mexican cookbooks by Kennedy and the equally well decorated Rick Bayless. This is not to say Bayless does not endorse this work. The back cover can barely hold his praise for it. I loved the recipes for their obvious authenticity and I was truly happy to have a good source for a Tex-Mex party menu. However, the author's obvious attention to every sort of detail in telling the story of Tex-Mex food is what sells me on this book.<br />As long as you do not grind your own flour and make your own tortillas, almost all of the recipes in this book are relatively simple. You even get the simple recipes for such basics as chile powder and the original Pace salsa. But, even if you want to jump into this cuisine with both feet, the good news is that almost all the special equipment is both simple and cheap, as long as you know the proper techniques. And, this book has them all.<br />Highly recommended for the reader, dabbler, and the zealot. Few books make a culture and cuisine come alive quite so well.udos to the book designers at Broadway Books, too, for their effective assembly of all the material.

Fills out pictures of Italian life and cuisine	`Rosemary and Bitter Oranges' is a memoir of a contemporary writer's childhood, mostly around the age of eight years old, in the house of her grandparents (Nonna and Nonno), parents, and two siblings. The house is that of a pre-World War II upper middle class family of Livorno, in Tuscany, near the Tyrrhean seacoast. The time is the late 1950s, when the family has restored some of its lost wealth and position to the grandfather while father is a lieutenant and teacher in the nearby Italian naval academy.<br />The central character in the child's life is neither Mamma nor Nonna, but the cook and housekeeper, Emilia, who fits in every way the stereotype of a middle-aged Italian housekeeper. The first and most fascinating culinary memory in the story is the difference between the cuisine of the household eaten at the luncheon and dinner tables, and the cuisine that the housekeeper makes for herself and eats in the kitchen. The family's meal is described as almost entirely white, as if to avoid a mismatch with the custom Belgian white linen on the table. In contrast, Emilia's meals are a riot of reds and greens, and represent a major discovery for eight year old Patrizia.<br />Like Gennaro Contaldo's stories of his Campagnia childhood in the cookbook `Passione', and unlike some adult and second hand impressions of Italy, the descriptions of impressions, experiences, and memories are so strong, you can practically smell the starch in the linen and feel the polished brass and the cool tiles in the courtyard. There may be much metaphor in saying this, but it gives one the sense of how vivid and genuine the word pictures come across to the reader.<br />Unlike Patricia Volk's memoir `Stuffed' and Ruth Reichl's first memoir volume, `Tender at the Bone', there is not a very large cast of well painted characters filling these pages. All the aunts and uncles and grandparents and parents and siblings fill pretty much the roles expected of them for the little girl of the author's memories. Since this is a memoir of a culinary writer, it has, like Reichl's two volumes, a number of recipes within each chapter which are more like photographs used to illustrate the narrative rather than a serious source of culinary material. My most interesting find was the recipe for Emilia's marinara sauce which is almost identical to Mario Batali's simple sauce published in all his books, which includes carrots to sweeten the tart tomatoes. This is perfectly fitting, as Mario acquired his authentic Italian cuisine in Emilia-Romagna, just a few miles from the border with Toscana (Tuscany).<br />Another fascinating resonance with Mario Batali's is the description of Emilia at the great central open-air market in central Livorno. Batali constantly states that every Italian housewife believes it is her god given right to get the very best piece of meat or vegetable available that day. Judging from Ms. Chen's description of Emilia's tactics at the meat counter, this rather benign Batali picture doesn't even come close to describing the cutthroat behavior of Italians at the market. Your average American who politely takes their paper queue chit and quietly waits their turn at the deli counter would be totally out of place. At the Italian counter, there is no queue and the ladies use every trick in the book to advance their position relative to that particularly attractive lamb shoulder in the display case.<br />Next to culinary memories, the most evocative are those connected with the young child's love of reading and interest in things which would later be her career in writing. I suspect part of interesting writing is to see and describe simple things that escape the average person's attention. It is not that the non-writer doesn't experience these things, it is that they take no special note of them. In the case of this writer, her narrative of the sights and smells of bookstores and stationary stores with freshly printed books and newly sharpened wooden pencilsbrings back similar memories to me.<br />If you love culinary lore, memoirs, Italian culture, or just plain good writing, this book will be a rewarding and entertaining day's read.brings back similar memories to me.<br />If you love culinary lore, memoirs, Italian culture, or just plain good writing, this book will be a rewarding and entertaining day's read.	2004-07-16

The Gold Standard!	I suspect Shirley O. Corriher and her book, `Cookwise' are two of the most commonly quoted sources in culinary writing today. Like James Beard's `American Cookery' and Julia Child's `Mastering the Art of French Cooking', this book has become such a well-established authority in it's field that any attempt at criticism may seem like sacrilege. Well, I'm here to tell you that the reputation of this book is entirely deserved, and you should have no feelings whatsoever that there is any hype involved in the book's good name.<br />The primary value of the book is not that it explains mysteries of cooking technique, but that it explains them so well. I just finished a review of a book that attempted to explain the difference between saturated, mono-unsaturated, and poly-unsaturated fats, and it made a complete botch of the job. Shirley's explanation is so clear, it embarrasses you into having dozed through that lesson in high school. In fact, Shirley's book gives the clearest possible argument I have seen in a long time for justifying subjects like physics and chemistry in High School for people who plan to go into law or computer sciences or hair dressing. Everyone must eat. Therefore, everyone must either cook or rely on someone to cook for them. And, no sass about a raw cuisine either, because understanding what the absence of heat does to foods is as important as the application of heat.<br />My first very pleasant surprise when I started this book is that the first two chapters deal with baking subjects rather than savory cooking. And, I have read many an essay in the beginning of books on baking, and not a single one of them explains the mysteries of wheat flour, yeast, gluten, and bread making quite as well as Shirley's first chapter. Even Shirley's very good friend, Rose Levy Beranbaum does not tell the story quite as effectively. (No reason to pass on Beranbaum's books, however, she covers the whole picture very, very well.) The legendary star of the first chapter is Shirley's grandmother's `Touch-of-Grace Biscuits' on pages 77 - 78. James Villas has done a whole book on biscuits and intimates that none of his recipes quite reach the heights of this one spectacular biscuit. Shirley repeats this performance in the second chapter on pastry and piecrusts. One of the many lessons in this chapter which make you wish you had read this book years ago is the connection between creaming butter and sugar and the lightness of the resulting baked product. I won't give away the punch line. You should read the book.<br />The end of chapter has a section explaining fats and their role in cooking and baking which alone is worth the price of the book and so much more. The section begins by simply reviewing all the advantageous things fats do for various types of cooking, and various methods for reducing the amount of fat in various cooking methods. It is essential that this section be read in the light of the fact that we simply cannot live without some dietary fat as a source of fat soluble vitamins and other stuff, so don't get carried away with fat reduction.<br />Lots of people do not bake, but there is probably not a soul on the planet, or a least a soul within these United States who does not have the opportunity to cook or eat eggs. The nutritional value versus cost for eggs is staggering, and, it is probably the ingredient whose use depends more on technique than any other. And, this is even before you get into graduate level dishes such as souffles and omelets. One of my greatest revelations as I have been teaching myself cooking is the fact that egg foams are one of the three major leaveners, along with yeasts and chemical mixtures. Needless to say, this chapter covers the reason for beating eggs in a copper bowl. You must get the details on this, as no one to my knowledge has explained the effect completely before, let alone the reason for the effect. All you get from everyone else is that it's a good thing for fluffy egg foams.<br />The chapter on sauces presents the benefits of knowledge to cooking technique like no other. One of the most annoying errors speakers and writers make on things culinary is when they use the term dissolve to mean so many other things such as `incorporate', `mix', and especially `emulsify'. The whole world of French sauces would simply not be possible without the emulsifying power of eggs and butter. And, you will generally fail at even the simplest sauces unless you have some basic understandings on these matters built into your psyche. I'm not saying that French chef's are taught the physics of emulsions, because they don't need to. They are taught the proper techniques and repeat them a thousand times over until they can do it in their sleep. You will make a hollandaise or a mayonnaise or a buerre blanc two or three times a year, and have to study the recipe every time you make any of these, so any book learning you can get will make up for a lot of practice.<br />I hope Alton Brown has paid Shirley well for her appearances on `Good Eats', as I can see at least half a dozen of his shows which seem to be lifted straight from the pages of `Cookwise'. Ultimately, I rate this book even higher for the average reader than books by Harold McGee, as Shirley does a much better at explaining the connection between science and the practical application. I dare say she seems to do it as well or better than my hero, Alton.<br />Very highly recommended for enhancing your cooking and baking experience. A bit steep for complete novices, but `Cooks Illustrated' fans will be as happy as pigs in ...'.br />The chapter on sauces presents the benefits of knowledge to cooking technique like no other.

A perfect companion to this book is Mort Rosenbloom's book `Olives' which has not a single recipe, but lots of poop on the ways of the European Union, politics, olive growing locations and people, history, and economics. You simply cannot get the full picture without reading both.<br />But getting back to Ms. Krasner's `A Tasting Guide and Cookbook', the very, very best chapter is the second on techniques for tasting olive oil. This falls under the category of teaching you how to fish rather than giving you a fish. As preparing for a group tasting can be a bit pricy, it is one of the very best excuses I have ever found for gathering together a group of like-minded people to a common cause. (You find ways of socializing in some of the strangest places). In the absence of a handy group to help share opinions and defray the costs of buying ten or twelve bottles of olive oil, the author offers an 18 page guide to commercially available olive oils and her own olive oil karass' opinions on them (for the explanation of the obscure term karass, see Kurt Vonnegut's novel, `Cat's Cradle').<br />The depressing thing about this long list of olive oil tastings is that it doesn't even cover some of the brands on my megamart's shelves. But, it covers the most important ones, for sure. I was especially pleased to find the author and her tasters giving a very good opinion of at least one nationally available brand, Colavita, which is a doubly good value as it is available in metal cans in fairly small quantities. Other big Italian supermarket brands such as Berio (also very good) and Bertolli (not quite as distinctive a taste as the other two) come in cans of only a gallon or more. And, as the book so carefully states, protecting extra virgin olive oil from heat and light will prolong it's shelf life.<br />As I was already quite familiar with the differences between `extra virgin olive oil', `virgin olive oil', `olive oil', and `light olive oil' before reading this book, this was no great illumination. What was illuminating was the great variety of tastes in olive oil from region to region, and how delicate those tastes are. For those of you who always skip to the back of the book, Tuscan extra virgin olive oil has the most distinctive taste, followed by oils from Apulia (Italy), Greece, and Provence (France). It was also illuminating to read how ephemeral the sharp tastes were. A year old oil, kept under the very best conditions, will simply not taste as fresh and bright and distinctive as an oil bottled and tasted in January, a month or two after most olives are harvested.<br />One of the most important economic lessons one can get from this book is the fact that you are wasting money if you use an expensive olive oil to sautee, pan fry, or deep fry, as heat kills most, if not all of the distinctive flavors of the extra virgin oil. The whole point to producing extra virgin oil is to do it without any application of heat and without any technique which creates heat. If you are an avid follower of Mario Batali and believe that even deep frying should be done in extra virgin olive oil, be aware that there are several very good brands of extra virgin which will not fracture your pocket book. After all, if you are intent on following Mario to pure southern Italian goodness, then you may expect to have to pay for it. (Mario's point is that Italians used EVOO because that was all they had. The techniques for squeezing the second and third pressings from the olives simply did not exist until the 19th century).<br />If you did not already know of olive oil's health benefits, this book will also fill you in on this score. Olive oil benefits by being a mono-unsaturated lipid that, by itself, is better than saturated animal fats such as butter and lard, and also better than poly-unsaturated fats such as canola and safflower oils. Olive oil adds value by containing vitamins, anti-oxidants, and other good stuff that only a chemist can pronounce. The down side is, I suspect, that this goodness degrades with time, enhancing the importance of getting the fresh stuff.<br />The book contains an excellent list of internet sources, which, surprisingly, leaves out two of my favorites, Zingermans in Ann Arbor, Michigan, which does a national mail order business and DePalo in Little Italy, Manhatten, NY, NY. I cite this store because it is one place where I am sure you can go in and request a taste of olive oil samples and you will receive them with a smile. They also make primo fresh ricotta and mozzarella.<br />The recipes are useful and comprise the lion's share of pages in the book, but the real gold comes before you get to the recipes.<br />Highly recommended if you dote on Mediterranean food, or even if you just dote on good food and health.u may expect to have to pay for it.

590884:US	39134375	RZTHM7MM4NZ0C	0385482663	792889377	Good to Eat: Flavorful Recipes from One of Television's Best-Known Food and Travel Journalists	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Interesting,confused presentation of two different subjects	`Good to Eat' by Burt Wolf has a simple title with a double meaning, as it signifies that the food it presents is both tasty and good for you as well. Tie this together with its being a companion to an `important' PBS culinary / travel series by someone whose other series have won a lot of awards, and you wonder what can possibly keep this book from being wonderful.<br />There are several good things about the book. The first is the fourteen-page introduction to nutrition entitled `You Are What You Eat'. This information appears in dozens of other well-known books, however this discussion is an excellent summary of all this stuff, even if it's visual aids for the discussion of types of fats is not up to an Alton Brown standard of excellence. The best recent other culinary / nutritional combo book I can mention is `The Healthy Kitchen' by Andrew Weil, M.D. and Rosie Daley. Both books nutritional information seems reasonably up to date; however, Weil does not have to warn us that he is not a doctor.<br />The first problem I sense with this book is that it is trying to do two very different things, and it ends up so diluting its energy, that it does neither well. After it's impressive opening to a discussion of nutrition, the author seems to drop the subject and launch into a culinary travelogue which has none of the panache of Tony Bourdain a la `A Cooks Tour' or much of anything else going for it, aside from bits of useful information from all parts of the world, with not much tying it all together. Specifically, the remainder of the book consists of sidebars on semi-exotic locales such as the Bahamas and Belgium, with recipes from posh spots at these locations. Tell me what is so great about that. The recipes do contain incidental comments on the nutritional properties of some of the dishes, but not a thing to tie them all together. There is also nothing whatsoever that tells me how dishes selected from exotic waterholes are necessarily nutritious. I can occasionally get put off by, for example, Kathleen Dalhmann's cheerleader disposition, but she certainly stays on message, and you have faith that all her dishes have something about them which will help you loose weight, as long as you don't eat 5 portions of the dish.<br />Speaking of Ms. Dahlmanns and Rachael Ray and Sara Moulton and Bobby Flay and Tyler Florence and Mario Batali and Jamie Oliver, none of these Food Network worthies have ever put out a cookbook which is DIRECTLY tied to the content of one of their shows. Many have come close, some so close that they have had books with the same title as one of their TV shows, but, oddly enough, it is often the case that the book came first and the TV show is based on the concept of the book, as with both Rachael Ray and Bobby Flay. A singular exception to this is Bourdain's `A Cooks Tour', but that is not a cooking show, it is pure travelogue. I have seen more than one PBS Culinary Show / Book tie-in which just didn't seem to work, if you never saw the show. Julia Child is the only principle character in this mold (well, she created the mold, did she not) which works, as with her collaboration with Jaques Pepin. But then we are talking about caviar and truffles here. You could put Julia and Jaques on Nick at Night at 2 AM and print the results on toilet paper and it will come off well. But getting back to Burt Wolf.<br />One symptom of how this book does not work is the fact that all color plates are located in two special rotogravure sections at the first and second third of the book. These pictures include locations and dishes discussed elsewhere in the text, with little rhyme or reason to their placement. All this leads me to believe that `you had to be there to enjoy it'. That is, you had to see the TV show to appreciate the content of the book.<br />I do not want to give the idea that the recipes in this book are bad. Quite the opposite is true. The problem is that the author gives many recipes for classic dishes suchas Baked Alaska, Pecan Pie, Peanut Butter Cookies, Blueberry Muffins, Pound Cake, Tiramisu, Zabaglione, Linguine Puttanesca, Rice Pilaf, Beef Stewed in Beer, Chicken Cacciatore, Codfish Cakes, and Fish in Puff Pastry, which are available in dozens of other sources with better reasons for appearing there. If I want to learn how to make Fish in Puff Pastry, I would much rather read how Jaques Pepin does it in his own words. If I want yet another recipe for Puttanesca, I would rather see Marcella Hazan's authentic version or `Cooks Illustrated's' riff on how to make the BEST pasta Puttanesca rather than see it in a collection like this simply because it is a famous dish.<br />I also do not want to give the idea that the travelogue sidebars have no substance. Most are interesting and most say something I did not know.<br />Three stars is my standard rating for books with good content where the buyer must be careful in deciding to lay out cash for the volume. If you loved the TV series and wish to recapture feelings you had when you saw it, get the book. Otherwise, especially if you have the least bit of a cookbook collection, pass it up.as Baked Alaska, Pecan Pie, Peanut Butter Cookies, Blueberry Muffins, Pound Cake, Tiramisu, Zabaglione, Linguine Puttanesca, Rice Pilaf, Beef Stewed in Beer, Chicken Cacciatore, Codfish Cakes, and Fish in Puff Pastry, which are available in dozens of other sources with better reasons for appearing there.

More instructive than many	On the surface, this book bears a strong resemblance to the volume by James Villas and his mother, Martha Pearl Villas, entitled `My Mother's Southern Kitchen', as it is written by a younger man and an older woman, both of whom have serious culinary chops, and where the younger man does most of the actual writing. The differences between the two books, however, are much more instructive.<br />First, in this book, both authors are professional restaurant chefs who both grew up eating southern cuisine and who specialize in cooking it. In the Villas' book, neither are professional chefs. This means that there is just a bit more fussiness about the methods and ingredients in the Lewis / Peacock recipes. One example is that while both pair of authors endorse homemade mayonnaise, Lewis and Peacock go an additional step by recommending and giving a recipe for homemade baking powder, especially for use in making biscuits. Skeptics, please note, I have made biscuits with my White Lily flour and homemade baking powder, and the homemade stuff does make a difference in eliminating the faint metallic aluminum taste in the stuff from Clabber Girl or Count Rumsfield.<br />Second, in this book, the two authors are originally from two very different parts of the south. Edna Lewis was raised in rural Virginia and Scott Peacock grew up in Alabama. Both now work in urban Georgia. The Villas' are native of low country North Carolina. Therefore, this book is much stronger in discussing regional differences between, for example, the peanut oil cooking Alabama and the lard cooking Virginia. While the Villas' book deals with some regional issues, such as the dispute over the source of Brunswick stew, it is largely oriented around the cuisine of a single North Carolina low country household and extended family.<br />Third, in the Lewis / Peacock book, the authors are not mother and son, so there is no chronic family sniping over who is the better cook. Peacock defers to the older Lewis, but they clearly approach the task as equals.<br />The upshot of all these differences is that our Lewis / Peacock book is at the same time more true to its rural, old South roots while presenting these traditions with a very professional interpretation. A perfect example of this is the interpretation of fried chicken in the two books. Jimmy Villas says his mother's fried chicken has gotten great response from the likes of Craig Claiborne, Pierre Franey, and Paul Bocuse, yet it is obviously the kind of recipe which would be done in a 20th century home, using Crisco and an electric fry pan. On the other hand, the Lewis / Peacock recipe is clearly more rustic and one which would suit a large restaurant with its hotel pans and walk-in refrigerators. It uses lard, and both a brining and an overnight marinade in buttermilk before breading and frying.<br />I believe this means that if you want to learn a lot about classic southern cooking techniques, our Lewis / Peacock recipe is the preferred volume. This dedication to true traditional methods even extends to stock making, where a smoked pork stock is as important an ingredient to southern vegetable and soup cooking as a good veal stock is to French soup making. Another illuminating Peacock basic is his methods for making chicken stock, one yielding poached chicken meat and one yielding a very fast stock from scraps. Another great traditional recipe is for cooked dressing for things such as cole slaw. I have not seen this in any other modern book, while it is a staple preparation in books by James Beard, for example.<br />While the Lewis / Peacock book has a lot of well-known southern dishes, it also has many which are totally unfamiliar to us northerners. One of my favorite discoveries is `Caveach', a cold fish salad which the authors speculate was named from a corruption of the Spanish `escabeche', especially as the dish is prepared by marinading white fish in an acidic dressing. Another very nice discovery is skillet scallions, an exquisitely simple way of fattening up spring onions with butter. The variety of recipes for several common southern vegetables such as tomatoes, sweet potatoes, squash, corn, greens, and cabbage is a testament to the very vegetarian diet and long growing season.<br />If I were looking for a dish for a classic southern recipe and I had these two books from which to choose, I would start with the Lewis / Peacock book. I have made several dishes from this book and all had methods which were very simple to follow and all of which give superior results. This even includes the recipes for preserves and pickles, as the professional chefs are more likely to have a far greater well of professional experience from which to draw than the talented amateur Villas clan.<br />Be warned that this book does not deal at all with barbecue, grilling, Creole specialities or Cajun cuisine. For that, you will have to consult specialists in those fields. On the other hand, there are many little gems that are rapidly becoming better known to Americans at large through cable and PBS food shows. My finding a classic southern recipe for a `BLT' salad makes me think that Alton Brown is really nothing more than a closet southern cook who tried to turn this salad into a Tuscan panzanella salad on his `Good Eats' show about tomatoes. He would have been more honest and truer to his Georgia roots to confess that the salad was as American as his Weber grill.<br />This is an excellent interpretation of traditional southern American cuisine as seen by two very accomplished professional chefs. Not every dish is famous and some are the authors' own creations; however, all are true to their roots, and none are more complicated than they have to be.<br />A highly recommended source for home cooks and students of southern American cuisine.lions, an exquisitely simple way of fattening up spring onions with butter.

Recommended	Jim Villas is one of our better cookbook and culinary memoir writers, while remaining a throwback to the likes of James Beard and Craig Claiborne. His affinity to Claiborne is especially strong, as both are unreconstituted Bourbon drinking Southerners who live(d) on Eastern Long Island and wrote for the `Eastern Establishment' publishing powers. Villas' special talent seems to be in recapturing what is most familiar and most comfortable about food for Americans. This is certainly true of his most recent cookbooks `Crazy for Casseroles' and `Biscuit Bliss'. His most recent collection of culinary essays and opinions `Stalking the Green Fairy' brings out this orientation in well written essays, but no book represents his culinary roots and inclinations quite as well as this book, cowritten with his mother.<br />On the face of it, this book would seem to be a transcription of mother Martha Pearl's little black recipe book into a form which William Morrow can publish and we can read and effectively translate into reproductions of Mrs. Villas favorite dishes. The back story of the book seems to be much more complicated than this, as Mrs. Villas' written recipes were sketchy, poorly handwritten, and done only as an aide d'memoire for someone who cooked almost entirely by experience, and look and feel, just like every other traditional southern cook whose praxis has been memorialized in writing. Thus, Villas had to do anthropology by observing his mother at work and doing his best to estimate amounts from quantities doled out by hand and eye. This too was made difficult by an entirely familiar friendly antagonism between mother and son in the kitchen. A running theme is that Mother Villas and son agree that Jimmy simply could never quite reproduce the quality of his mother's own recipes, in spite of years spent at studying and writing about the world's cuisines. Some of the repartee which documents this antagonism is a little difficult to believe, as when Miss Martha cannot find any `White Lily' or other soft southern flour in Jimmy's East Hampton kitchen with which to make biscuits. I've been cooking regularly for less than three years and I have a regular supply of `White Lily' shipped to the Lehigh Valley from Tennessee like clockwork.<br />I am glad I am skeptical of Jimmy's inability to reproduce Miss Martha's recipes, as if this were gospel, it would bode ill for your or my ability to make the recipes in this book into something remotely like the jewels which appear on Martha Pearl's North Carolina dinner table. In fact, I think a fairly well practiced cook with average equipment will do quite well with these recipes thank you.<br />The best things about the collection of recipes in this book are that practically all of the classic southern recipes are represented here and, in spite of the crack about doing anthropology, true practitioners of this cuisine are interpreting the recipes for us. With all due respect to Villas' friend Paula Wolfert, there is no observation and interpretation going on here. This is the real deal, where cook and scribe are part of the culture on which they report.<br />Just as Italy has it's `oil line' separating the butter from the olive oil cuisines of North and South, I think the Mason-Dixon line could double as the mayonnaise line, as I suspect that beginning in Maryland, sales of Hellmans doubles per capita as you cross each state border from Maryland to the Carolinas. Both Villas are on very safe culinary grounds here, as they typically specify either Hellmans or homemade, AND, the Hellmans brands of mayonnaise are consistent winners in `Cooks Illustrated' taste tests.<br />Most recipes in this book are fairly easy, although they are typically more picky about some details of method and ingredients than fellow Southerner Paula Deen of Savannah. They are also a lot pickier about the details of method than my own mother whose ideal recipe is Deen's spiral bound church fundraiser cookbook style. Ofcourse, Miss Martha and my mother share a passion for the very freshest corn and tomatoes in season. There are also significant differences between Deen and the Villas in even a basic recipe such as pimento cheese spread. I suspect the Villas' interpretation is more traditional and it is certainly in line with Mother Villas' cardinal rule of not messing around with the taste of the main ingredients by adding a lot of extras. Their recipe for my favorite creamed chipped beef is a good example, as it is almost exactly the same as the recipe from Mississippian Craig Claiborne, but without the addition of Worcestershire sauce.<br />The recipe chapters fill all the niches you expect in a traditional southern cuisine, including Breakfast and Brunch; Canapes, Appetizers, and Snacks; Soups and Stews; Salads; Meats; Poultry and Game; Seafood; Casseroles; Vegetables; Breads; Desserts; Cookies and Confections; Pickles, Relishes and Preserves; Sauces and Dressings; and Beverages. With the chapter on preserving, the book covers more than most compendia of Southern cooking.<br />At every turn of the page in this book, I find myself nodding in agreement over choices of methods and ingredients. The use of torn bread pieces in place of breadcrumbs in meat loaf agrees with all my best sources for this delicacy. Patties for frying and doughs for rising are all chilled in the fridge for the righteous length of times to either firm up or relax. Miss Martha does share with Miss Paula the tendency to use canned soup and store-bought croutons in casseroles and such, but the application is judicious. Note that the coverage of the North Carolina speciality, pork barbecue, is a bit light. Do not depend on this book for much smoke work.<br />I really liked this book.

596618:US	39134375	R2PVWJOTO3BGPP	0688134157	552369729	Food of Portugal	Books	5	23	25	N	N	Recommended Addition to English Literature on World Foods	Jean Anderson is a member of `old school' cookbook authors and culinary educators such as Barbara Kafka, Marion Cunningham, Sheila Lukins, and Sara Moulton who edit major cookbooks such as the `American Century Cookbook' and the `Fanny Farmer Cookbook' and who edit major newspaper columns, all addressed to the average American family member who needs to cook and who doesn't have a lot of time to go out of their way to find culinary advice.<br />On what seems to be the strength of an exceptionally strong personal love for Portugal and its food, Ms. Anderson has also joined the ranks of interpreters of important national cuisines such as Diane Kochilas (Greece), Penelope Casas (Spain), Lydia Bastianich (Italy) and Nancy Harmon Jenkins (Mediterranean). While Ms. Anderson has written about both Portuguese and German cooking, the interest in the latter seems to be simply another job, while the interest in the former is based on a lifetime of affection for this cuisine.<br />Each of the four other interpreters of selected regional cuisines take a somewhat different approach to interpreting their subject. For example, Ms. Kochilas deals with Greece by region, as there are major variations in cuisine from Macedonia to the Dodecanese Islands. Ms. Jenkins and other writers dissect Italy and the Mediterranean by major food resource such as salt, olives, grapes, and wheat. Ms. Anderson's approach is most similar to that of Lydia Bastianich, with the difference that Ms. Anderson has no stories of a childhood growing up in Portugal. Both Ms. Bastianich and Ms. Anderson focus on the characteristic recipe methods of their subject.<br />Portugal should probably be considered an honorary Mediterranean country. It has no coastline on the Mediterranean, however, it's all of its principle foods were identified by Nancy Harmon Jenkins in `The Essential Mediterranean'. These are olives, grapes, pork, salt, seafood, milk, and beans. Only wheat appears to be missing from the major staples, as Portugal seems to not have the land for wheat fields like Apulia or Egypt. The very first thing Ms. Anderson points out is that Portuguese cuisine is not the same as Spanish cuisine. The differences can easily be traced to the differences in exploration and colonization in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. While Spain was playing catch-up with the daring westerly trip of Columbus, Portugal was well on its way to establishing trade with India, China, and the'Spice Islands' by way of the route around the bottom of Africa. Ms. Anderson cements the notion of these differences by opening with a truly daunting dictionary of Portuguese culinary terms. The highlights of this catalogue are `Acordas' and `Migas' (Dry soups and stews); `Bacalhau' (Dried Salt Cod); cheeses (lots of these), coffees (note that former Portuguese colonies, Brazil, Angola, and Timor are all important coffee producers); egg sweets; fish and shellfish; herbs, spices, and flavorings (almonds, paprika, and pimento are distinctly important); olive oils; sausages and hams (with analogues to many of the famous Spanish and Italian Charcuterie); and beer.<br />Possibly the two most distinctive Portuguese culinary products are the fortified wines, Port and Madeira. Portugal has many other important wines, but these two have been made and have been popular for thousands of years. The production of Port can be traced back to Roman times, and it is a great favorite with the English and a major competitor for aperitif use to Spain's sherries. While Port and Madeira are famous Portuguese exports, there are many important Portuguese products such as its cheeses that you simply cannot get outside of the country. The author slyly suggests this is a very good thing, intimating that a trip to Portugal will bring much culinary novelty to your life.<br />The recipe chapters are organized in a very conventional manner, giving us Appetizers and Condiments; Soups; Meats; Poultry; Fish and Shellfish; Vegetables, Riceand Salads; Breads; and Sweets. There is a recipe for Portuguese empanadas, but the author gives no hint of an important `tapas' culture. Most appetizers are variations on familiar themes seen in Provence and Italy. Portugal seems to take the thick Tuscan style of soup to a new level with their `dry' soups. A soup, `caldo verde' is also the national dish of Portugal, as we have seen Emeril Lagasse make on several occasions. One thing that stands out with Portuguese soup recipes is that very few seem to use prepared stocks. Rather, many of the soups seem to rely on including starchy potatoes to lend body to the soup. Wine is used as much or more frequently as a flavoring than are stocks. It seems like wine is in practically every soup recipe.<br />Many other recipes seem to have distinctive twists, such as the roasted turkey recipe that calls for no basting, but rubbing the skin with salt and roasting at a constant temperature.<br />All the bread recipes use the very familiar active dry yeast for leavening, so if you are the least adept at blooming those little foil packets of yeast, there should be no challenges here at all. Several bread recipes include eggs and scalded milk, products common in rustic Greek breads as well.<br />In place of Italy's sabayon and France's custards, Portugal revels in variations on sweet soft eggs or `ovos moles'. The author describes Portuguese egg pastries as `achingly sweet'. I suspect you may want to try one or two of these as a substitute for your cr&egrave;me brulee, but don't make too much if you are watching your waistline.<br />National and regional cookbooks can be done badly, especially when for locales such as Rumania and the Philippines, there is no competition. Ms. Anderson has done us foodies a great service with this book. It is not as deep as Paula Wolfert's Morocco or as analytical as Erica De Mane's southern Italy, but it is very good. The fact that there are no sources given at the back of the book says a lot for what you may need to do to taste some of this food.and Salads; Breads; and Sweets.

Several bread recipes include eggs and scalded milk, products common in rustic Greek breads as well.<br />In place of Italy's sabayon and France's custards, Portugal revels in variations on sweet soft eggs or `ovos moles'. The author describes Portuguese egg pastries as `achingly sweet'. I suspect you may want to try one or two of these as a substitute for your crème brulee, but don't make too much if you are watching your waistline.<br />National and regional cookbooks can be done badly, especially when for locales such as Rumania and the Philippines, there is no competition. Ms. Anderson has done us foodies a great service with this book. It is not as deep as Paula Wolfert's Morocco or as analytical as Erica De Mane's southern Italy, but it is very good. The fact that there are no sources given at the back of the book says a lot for what youmay need to do to taste some of this food.	2004-07-09

Good Book for Large Family Meals.	Jean Anderson is a member of `old school' cookbook authors and culinary educators such as Barbara Kafka, Marion Cunningham, Sheila Lukins, and Sara Moulton many of whom are prot&eacute;g&eacute;s of James Beard or Julia Child. Among them, Anderson and Cunningham have been responsible for editing two of the better `how to do everything' cookbooks in America. These are the `American Century Cookbook' and the `Fanny Farmer Cookbook' respectively. Except for Moulton, who is a staple of the Food Network programming, these authors typically do not get as much attention as their more internationally oriented colleagues such as Patricia Wells and Paula Wolfert; TV educators such as Ina Garten, Rachael Ray, and Nigella Lawson; or magazine magnate Martha Stewart.<br />In spite of this, these authors are probably the ones who write some of the most commonly picked titles among non-foodies who never watch the Food Network and simply want a reliable source of menus.<br />On the face of it, this book, `Process This!' is very similar to Barbara Kafka's highly rated `Microwave Gourmet' to which I gave five stars. Both books are about new kitchen appliances that became popular in the early nineteen-seventies and both of which tend to be misused, overused, or underused.<br />I am probably like many people who use both appliances for a relatively small range of tasks and wonder why they persist in taking up so much space on my countertop. I do, however, sense some differences in the two appliances. The biggest I believe is the fact that while the microwave is at its best doing small, quick jobs which often arise in small households or households with lots of different schedules, the food processor is best when it is used to tackle a big job.<br />The reasons for this are simple. A microwave can make popcorn, heat up a cup of coffee, cook bacon, and defrost frozen food quickly, with less electricity than a range or oven, and require little or no cleanup when you are done. And, there are few alternatives to doing these tasks as quickly or as easily. A standard size food processor can mix a pie dough, dice onions, finely chop zest, mix a mayonnaise, shred cabbage for slaw, chop garlic, and slice carrots or a hundred other vegetables in a thrice. But, after each operation, a rather sizable cleanup job is left and with most slicing and dicing, the results leave a fair amount of unevenly sized pieces. And, there are good alternatives to doing each and every one of these tasks, generally with less mess. A pastry cutter will do pie dough very nicely. A sharp chef's knife will give you evenly sized chopped onions very quickly with no slime, a microplane will give fine zest in a thrice, a blender will do an equally good job with Mayonnaises, a knife will do garlic much better than a standard food processor, and a knife can do veggies to a much greater range of sizes and much tighter consistency than can a food processor.<br />The things for which I always go to a food processor are when I wish to shred large vegetables such as cabbage to make slaw and when I wish to powder or crumb a large portion of hard, dry material, as when I want to make bread crumbs. I have gone to a fair amount of trouble to cultivate pretty good knife skills and to buy very sharp knives. I also need to cook for only two people. Therefore, my bias tends against using the large task food processor. This is not to say this tool has no good user base. It is probably at its best in preparing vegetables for salads when the vegetables are not to be cooked, but eaten raw. It is also excellent for shredding hard, awkwardly shaped vegetables such as carrots for a cooked carrot filling, not to mention an ingredient for carrot cake. Lastly, it will very commonly do an acceptable job subbing for a blender if you do not have one. Just don't try crushing ice with it!<br />So how does this book help this audience? First, I thing the introductory material on general suggestions on food processor use is very good. But, I think it would have been a lot better with a few pictures. It is not entirely obvious how the chopping blade compared to the slicing blade. The dictionary of foods and how to process them was quite good, if only to show what foods and results it is wise to prepare with some other tool. The author very wisely advises against using the processor to shred meat or to grind spices. I was also happy to see that the author did not paint a rosy picture of your making peanut butter with a food processor.<br />My first sense that there was something amiss in the book is when I saw the recipes for stock making. The instructions for the meat and the cooking times were all kosher, but I believe the instructions for chopping the vegetables is all wrong. For years, until I started making stocks for myself, I never understood why recipe writers of every stripe tell you to simply toss the peeled vegetables into the stockpot with no more than a quick cut in half, if that. Well, they were right. Simmer whole carrots and onions and celery for four hours and there will simply be no flavor left behind, and there will be no unnecessary cloudiness in your stock from vigorously chopped veg flesh.<br />My reaction to most other recipes is that I already have an ample number of recipes for all these dishes. Why do I need another that uses a tool I would not normally use?<br />This book will be helpful if you make three or four meals a week for four or more people, and, you already have a full size (11 cup bowl) food processor. Otherwise, you may find it gathering dust on your shelf.ood. But, I think it would have been a lot better with a few pictures.

599115:US	39134375	R3NWZCFIAENR8	1558322779	188227097	Twelve Months of Monastery Salads: 200 Divine Recipes for All Seasons	Books	5	39	45	N	N	Recommended for Economical Variety and Simplicity	This is the tenth cookbook by Benedictine Monk Brother Victor-Antoine D'Avila-Latourrette and the fifth that is organized to reflect recipes by season or by other milestones in the course of the year. The recipes also tend to reflect the diet of a Benedictine monastery in upstate New York, which means there is very little protein in the dishes aside from legumes, cheese, eggs, and canned fish.<br />The simple monastic calling does not keep Brother Victor from being a bit trendy in his choice of recipes and greens. In his catalogue of nineteen salad greens, he includes Mesclun, Belgian endive, mache, radicchio, and watercress. And, although he includes iceberg lettuce, he doesn't really like it and confesses that when they have it, the brothers feed it to their chickens.<br />The list of greens is followed by a `Useful tips for Salad Preparation', which are, indeed, useful, albeit, short. A much more interesting section on `Types of Salads' follows, which lists the eleven types of salad recipes listed in this book. After reading the recipes, one really wishes the author had built his chapters on these eleven types rather than the truly artificial use of months of the year. The salad types are classic international salads; rustic salads; exotic salads; creative salads; mixed salads; pasta salads; egg, cheese and fish salads; Italian salads; French regional salads; Saint's salads; and fruit salads. It is obvious that these categories are artificial and overlap in the extreme, but they are still more useful for finding a salad to fit a particular occasion than the artificial organization by month.<br />The organization of recipes by month is not entirely arbitrary, as fall and winter salads do contain a higher proportion of apples, pears, potatoes, and citrus than do summer salads. And, my `Field Guide to Produce' does say that greens such as arugula, chicory, and endive are available the year around. But, I wonder when I see tomatoes or new potatoes in recipes for February. If I were rating the book exclusively on the accuracy of its seasonality, I might give it only a B-. Luckily, there is much more of value to the book.<br />As you can see from the types of salads, the book contains many classic salad recipe names such as Caesar salad, Waldorf salad, and Salade Nantaise. While the names are classic, I believe many of the recipes take some liberties with the classic ingredients. Brother Victor's Caesar salad, for example, is based on Boston lettuce rather than being done entirely with the much more commonly specified Romaine lettuce, as recommended by such diverse sources as James Beard, Martha Stewart, and `Better Homes and Gardens'. All three sources also include anchovies, which Brother Victor leaves out. Brother Victor also leaves out Worcestershire sauce and egg yolk, specified by two out of my three authorities. In its place, Brother Victor adds Tabasco sauce. Brother Victor also adds blue cheese, which none of my sources specify. None of this is to suggest that this recipe is not perfectly delicious. It is only to indicate that one should not expect recipes with classic names to be described with the classic ingredients or method of preparation.<br />In fact, I found practically every recipe to be inviting, easy to make, and relatively inexpensive. I especially liked the generous selection of potato salads. From the index, I count nineteen (19), almost all with very traditional sounding names or sources. I do find it odd, though, that in all of these recipes, the author suggests peeling the potatoes before boiling. Virtually every potato salad recipe I have ever seen, including those from James Beard AND Julia Child recommend cooking before peeling. I am convinced this is not simply everyone copying everyone else. Rather, I believe peeling after cooking will prevent the potatoes from becoming overly mushy and waterlogged. I have even made potato salad with Russets cooked before peeling, and they peeled, sliced, and mixedwith the dressing without mushing up on me.<br />The book ends with a chapter on standard dressings such as mayonnaise, aioli, blue cheese dressing, and vinaigrettes. The author succeeds in springing a new mayonnaise technique on me. I have seen recipes done with a whisk, a food processor, and a blender. This is the first use I have seen of a hand mixer, although on reflection, it seems as much or more logical than the food processor or blender.<br />There is not much to the book aside from the recipes, but the added inspirational quotes scattered here and there in attractive iconed boxes lends a very pleasant air to reading this book. It may not seem like much unless you have just finished reading a book with a truly slobbish book design.<br />By far the greatest strength of the book is the variety of greens, cheeses, fruits, beans, vegetables, vinegars, and nuts used in constructing these recipes, without relying on anything which will break the bank. If you need recipes with chicken or fresh seafood, check out a good book of Provencal recipes.<br />Highly recommended for simplicity, variety, and saintly demeanor.with the dressing without mushing up on me.<br />The book ends with a chapter on standard dressings such as mayonnaise, aioli, blue cheese dressing, and vinaigrettes.

There are so many little things that are wrong about this book that it seems difficult to know where to begin. On the other hand, there is one very big thing right about the book. The single reason for buying this book in place of hundreds of other books on cooking and entertaining is that you are more likely to make the recipes in this book if you are, like 95% of you are, not a foodie or food professional, and have no interest in becoming one.<br />I recently reviewed two books on entertaining recipes by a major culinary magazine and a NY chef superstar that had lots of very delicious, but very complicated recipes, even for appetizers and snacks. They really were great recipes, but most people simply would not consider making them. Ms. Duffy starts with sixteen (16) very simple versions of some old classics such as guacamole and hummus, plus one utterly outrageous recipe which combines two truly dangerous things, processed American cheese and fireworks rockets.<br />Ignoring the cute titles, the remaining recipe chapters follow a pretty conventional layout, covering soups, salads, pastas, single dish meals, chicken and other poultry, meat, fish, sauces and marinades, vegetables, breads, desserts, and breakfast foods. All recipes are rated by means of a clever little chimpanzee face icon capped with a dunce cap, a mortarboard, or a chef's toque. The dunce cap recipes, which include at least 80% of the recipes in the book, are easy, and they are almost all very easy. The mortarboard recipes are somewhat more advanced. Chefs with a fair amount of experience and confidence best do the toque recipes.<br />Most recipes are so simple, it is hard to imagine anything can go wrong with them; however, my sense is that many recipes overlook enough details that a true novice in the kitchen will encounter problems with several of the recipes, even if there are no land mines, and there are land mines. Two that stand out in my mind are the recipes for waffled French toast and cheese crisps, known in Italy as Frico Croccante. In the `French toast' recipe, it calls for either challah or `French Bread'. Now I am virtually certain Ms. Duffy is thinking of brioche when she calls for `French Bread' as brioche is very similar to challah and is a well known basis for `Pain Perdu' (French Toast in French). But, if the unsuspecting reader following these instructions purchases a nice, crusty baguette or batard, they will definitely be disappointed with the outcome of the recipe, as neither of these `French' breads will work well in a waffle iron, as their crusts are entirely too stiff, and a sliced baguette will simply be too small to make the whole thing worth the effort. The recipe for Frico calls for either grated Parmesan or Provolone cheese. Every recipe and every demonstration I have seen of this recipe calls for Parmesan, Romano, or Montasio cheese. That is, some type of hard grana cheeses. Provolone is definitely not a hard grating cheese and, although using Provolone will result in an edible product, it will be quite different from the result with Parmesan.<br />What these and other examples tell me is that Ms. Duffy should have retained the services of a very good culinary co-author such as Dorie Greenspan or Melissa Clark. These professionals would have spotted these misleading directions in a thrice, and would have happily taken a decent retainer for a few days of editing and prominent mention in the acknowledgments. In spite of this, Ms. Duffy really did very well on her own. She has not only read widely in a great variety of culinary sources, but she has obviously done an excellent job of applying what she has read to entertaining her family and guests on a regular basis.<br />I have never read Peg Bracken's `I Hate to Cook Book', but I wastotally unsurprised to find Ms. Duffy citing it, rather than Martha Stewart or Ina Garten or Nigella Lawson or Julia Child as her favorite author, since it was the idea behind Ms. Bracken's book which immediately occurred to me as I began reading this book. It is even meet and right that Ms. Duffy knows Al Roker, the foodie amateur extraordinare, as Roker is also the author of two books by a culinary nonprofessional.<br />There are significant lapses in other parts of the book as well. The glossary goes from `grill' on the bottom of page 264 to `saute' on the top of page 265. Either the author got very tired by the time she reached page 264, or publisher Clarkson Potter dropped the ball. The definitions which are present are dreadfully obvious or mistaken, as when boil is defined at cooking at a temperature greater than 212 F. It is physically impossible to boil water at greater than 212 F at sea level. The following produce notes are also misleading, as when the author says apples should have a rich deep uniform color. Most good apple varieties generally have a mix of red and green in ripe, tasty specimens. Only the popular but bland red delicious apple completely fits the description.<br />I must also object to the pervasive use of the term `slob'. It made me wonder why I am reading this book, as I did not want to become a slob in the kitchen.<br />For a list price of $23, this is an entertaining read with lots of sound, offbeat advice for entertaining. Please do not interpret my four stars to mean I think Ms. Duffy's recipes are comparable to works by Bobby Flay or Mario Batali. They are not. But, the non-foodie will simply be much more likely to make these recipes than to copy Bobby or Mario.totally unsurprised to find Ms. Duffy citing it, rather than Martha Stewart or Ina Garten or Nigella Lawson or Julia Child as her favorite author, since it was the idea behind Ms. Bracken's book which immediately occurred to me as I began reading this book.

Great Read	In the last few years, we have been treated to a sweet explosion of books on `American' desserts from special subject books on chocolate and cookies to general books like the present volume covering the entire dessert table. In fact, 2003 has brought us two such volumes, this title by Judith M. Fertig and a very similar title by TV Network pastry personality Wayne Harley Brachman. I will conclude with a comparison of these two books.<br />Ms. Fertig takes her queue on the meaning of `American food' from Julia Child, who said anything cooked in America by Americans with American ingredients is `American'. With all respect to Ms. Julia, this definition is great to roll off the tongue to dismiss a query, but it excludes practically nothing. The title of the book `All American Desserts' suggests a more highly selective criteria for including recipes, but I suspect the title is simply a means to do some flag waving over our apple pies. The book is loaded with classic European dishes such as cr&egrave;me broulee, tiramisu, agua fresca, Swedish Torte, and Biscotti. The simple truth is that the book covers anything that is made and enjoyed in America, and this is a good thing.<br />It is probably also fair to say the book does not cover everything made and enjoyed in America, as that would require a book at least three times the 504 pages devoted to recipes. There is no rhubarb pie for example, but for that we have Brachman's book.<br />Unlike every other `American' baking book I have seen, Ms. Fertig actually tells us how many of the desserts in the book became American, based either on an ingredient native to North America such as cranberries or by an historical connection to a European tradition, as when she traces the effect on desserts of four different migrations from four different parts of the British Isles to the colonies, based on `David Fischer's historical work, `Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America'. For this extra effort to make the book's premise worthwhile, I send Ms. Fertig a great big virtual smooch. The book goes a lot further than this in dealing with the American roots of its recipes. There are sidebars on virtually all the classic American ingredients such as sorghum, Concord grapes, pumpkins, molasses, and rosewater. Also, `America' is broadly interpreted to mean `the New World' when it's convenient, as when Mexican vanilla is presented as an American ingredient.<br />The `Desserts' title is especially appropriate for this book, as both `baking' and `pastry' would not convey the full range of recipes covered in the book. The recipe chapters cover:<br />Fruit Preserves and Desserts, with a glossary explaining the perpetually confusing and overlapping terms such as `crisp', `crumble', `cobbler', `pandowdy' and many others. Classics such as Bananas Foster and Southern Ambrosia are well represented.<br />Cookies, with brownies, chess squares, pecan balls, chocolate chip cookies, whoopie pies, and Germantown lebkuchen, but no snickerdoodles!<br />Cakes, with classic yellow cake, baked Alaska, Stars and Stripes blueberry sponge cake, blueberry buckle with pecan streusel, Moravian sugar cake, and cheesecake, cheesecakes, cheesecake.<br />Pies, with Apple pie, Shaker lemon pie, key lime pie, Shoofly pie, crab apple Tarte Tatins, and funnel cake.<br />Puddings, Custards, Mousses, Flans, and Souffles, with New Jersey Applejack Mousse, Jacqueline Kennedy's Cold Chocolate Souffle, blueberry batter pudding, iron skillet butterscotch pudding, Bess Truman's Ozark Pudding, and New Orleans bread pudding.<br />Ice Creams, with Monticello vanilla flecked ice cream, Chicago Fire Ice Cream, Shaker coffee ice, spiced persimmon ice cream, and peaches with ice cream.<br />Candy and Flavored syrups, with cherry-almond divinity, New Orleans style pecan pralines, Mamie Eisenhower's Million Dollar Fudge, microwave peanut brittle, caramel popcorn, bourbon balls, cajeta, almond syrup, and rosy rhubarb syrup.<br />While I still miss my snickerdoodles and my rhubarb pie, it should be clear that Ms. Fertig has included virtually every region in the country. From the Pennsylvania Dutch country I know best, the book includes apple dumplings, Moravian sugar cookies, and shoofly pie, although I regret her understandable effort to make this more appealing to modern tastes. I still prefer the black strap molasses.<br />Every recipe includes a headnote explaining the origin of the recipe or a bit of how the author acquired it and, as with shoofly pie, what variation of the dozens available, did she pick. There are several sidebars on the best techniques for doing things such as making piecrusts, drying apples, and creaming butter and sugar.<br />Amazingly, this book does not cover fried doughs and its most common examples, doughnuts and bignets. For that, and for your rhubarb pie, you have Wayne Harley Brachman's book. For snickerdoodles, you will have to go to Nancy Baggett's `All American Cookie Book'. Brachman's book is less than half the size of Ms. Fertig's encyclopedia, yet there are people for which it may be the better first choice. While Fertig has many asides on baking technique, Brachman's instruction on piecrust making, for example, is much more detailed and enhanced with excellent photographs of the steps. Brachman's book will not replace pastry texts by Flo Braker or Nick Malgieri, but it does give better instruction from the point of view of a professional baker, of which Brachman is one of the best. The two books also complement one another with their headnotes and asides. Fertig gives lots of information you simply do not find elsewhere in culinary books. Brachman gives us lots of laughs. He is definitely the most amusing culinary writer this side of Alton Brown.<br />Highly recommended for bakers of all skills, especially as a great source for many regional specialities.nickerdoodles and my rhubarb pie, it should be clear that Ms. Fertig has included virtually every region in the country.

603709:US	39134375	R2H3LAP3OEMNZR	0060083913	989059076	How to Cook  Revised Edition: An Easy and Imaginative Guide for the Beginner	Books	5	33	35	N	N	Great Culinary Advice, Quirky Organization, Great Read	Raymond Sokolov's simply entitled book `How To Cook' attempts to answer to the needs of all the culinarily clueless men and women he addresses in his introduction. The simple, elegant cover design, small size, and inviting subtitle `An Easy and Imaginative Guide for the Beginner' promises us a culinary Strunk and White's `The Elements of Style'. Like the famous writers of this manual on English usage, the author also has serious credentials as a writer for famous journals. There is one very significant problem with this analogy.<br />In simplest terms, writing style and usage, like logic, can have rules that are always true. Cooking, like biology, always seems to want to color outside the lines. To take a very simple example, every written description and every TV demonstration of omelet making does things just a little different. The variations are so rampant that the great culinary writer Elizabeth David said that the right way to make an omelet is the way you want to make it. Of course, she proceeds to give you a long procedure on how to make a proper French omelet. Sokolov gives no clue to this point of view when he presents the method for making an omelet. In fact, he seems to leave out at least half of the steps many people consider essential. I truly fear that someone approaching omelet making for the first time with Sokolov's instructions will have several failures before achieving omelet perfection. And, since omelet making is all about technique, why are there no pictures? The same question applies to every other classic culinary skill Sokolov describes such as making a piecrust and breading a veal scallopine. One can argue that pictures would steal space from Sokolov's enjoyable and highly opinionated prose. And, I will agree with that argument, as long as I can treat this book more like a culinary essay by Elizabeth David than like a text by Jaques Pepin or Madeline Kamman.<br />Sokolov opens his book with a truly excellent guide to the modern kitchen. The discussion on how to read a recipe is the best I have seen. One is reminded of Mortimer Adler's classic `How to Read a Book'. His precis on the oven, the range, and the refrigerator are priceless and should be reprinted in every book of culinary writing from now to kingdom come, with one small exception. In recommending a range configuration, Sokolov suggests you get one where the four burners are close together to enable a large stockpot to be heated by all four simultaneously. This suggestion fails for the simple reason that the average single or small family cook will rarely make stock in anything larger than a 12 quart stock pot. I make stock fairly regularly, and I find it is much more common for me to need two large diameter burners far apart to accommodate an 8 quart pasta pot and an 8 quart enameled casserole than I need a configuration to support a 20 quart stock pot. I do not wish to make too much of this or any other difference. My point is not that Sokolov is wrong, my point is that Sokolov does not encourage the fledgling cooks to think for themselves. This is the same lesson as we got from the description of the omelet making.<br />Sokolov's approach to arranging recipes is quite enjoyable and typically quirky. I think it is delightful that he starts with recipes that can be made with no heat such as guacamole, vinaigrettes, ceviche, and gravlax. His including recipes for things like gravlax, carrot cake, and gefilte fish doubly impress me. These are not things you expect in a culinary primer. He does us all a service by giving novices the confidence to make such dishes. And, almost all the recipes are reasonably simple, even if they are sometimes very long, like gravlax. But, many of my favorite recipes always seem to show up with some idiosyncrasy in Sololov's hands. The carrot cake recipe is done in a tube pan rather than in layers or as a sheet. The spaghetti Puttanesca has canned tuna fish instead of anchovies. The roasted chicken is done breast down instead of breast up or done on its side a la James Beard. These are not wrong, they are just different, and Sokolov makes a habit of doing things a little differently.<br />One of the strangest things about the layout of the book is that once we leave the chapter on cold preparations, the logic of recipe arrangement takes on a very `Alice in Wonderland' feel, where dishes are arranged by how many people they serve. This puts all the vegetable recipes spread out across four different chapters. This arrangement exacerbates the fact that the book does not address my toughest culinary dilemma. This problem for an introductory book on cooking is, how can you advice people to plan their meals based on what is good at the market, if they don't know how to make anything yet. It is terrific to read Tom Colicchio say that chefs plan based on what they have in front of them, not the other way around. That's great, if you are Tom Colicchio and know every recipe worth knowing, but what do you do if you walk into a good greengrocer and don't have a clue as to what you can do with great, fresh Swiss Chard or parsnips or Napa cabbage. Like every other writer, Sokolov does not address this question.<br />Sokolov's culinary writings, this one included, are great fun to read. They are well written, full of interesting anecdotes, and full of opinions, not all of which you want to agree with, and they are definitely educational.

The others by my informal survey are probably Maida Heatter and Flo Braker, with Lindsey Shere a close third or fourth. Before reading this book, `Perfect Pastry', I was at a loss to see the basis for his influence. His more recent book `How to Bake' is a great book of recipes for cakes, cookies, pies, tarts, bread, pizzas, muffins, and the like, and I use it as my `go to first' book when I want to try something new, and I have never been disappointed by the recipes I found therein. But the book is nothing but recipes. There are none of the whys and wherefores I always rate so highly in books such as the outstanding `The Secrets of Baking' by Sherry Yard. In `Perfect Pastry', I have found much which justifies the high regard in which Nick Malgieri is held by his colleagues.<br />Before I can intelligently rank this book, it is important to spell out where it fits into the world of books on patisserie. There are at least two different scales along which a pastry book may fall. The extremes of the first scale range from `strictly recipes', which you will find in books by Gale Gand and David Lebowitz to very high in teaching and explanation content as in this book and Sherry Yard's `The Secrets of Baking'.<br />The second scale ranges from highly specific content such as `cookies', `cakes', `pies', `fruit desserts', `chocolate', or even `cupcakes' to very general books. `Perfect Pastry' is intermediate between the general and the specific, as it covers pies, tarts, cake sponges, cake decorating, and cake filling, but it does not cover much about cookies.<br />Malgieri's concentration on pastry, cake sponges, and cake icings and fillings in this volume is a very, very good thing, as he covers this subject and allied matters such as ingredients to a depth I simply have not seen elsewhere. This book comes in a very close second to Sherry Yard's book as my favorite source of instruction on pastry. Yard's book may win by a nose because it is more fun to read and some explanations have a greater depth than you will find in `Perfect Pastry'. On the other hand, Malgieri's book covers a somewhat broader scope. His discussion of ingredients such as fruits and nuts alone is worth the price of admission. The third excellent pastry book I have recently reviewed is Flo Braker's `The Simple Art of Perfect Baking', which shares many of the excellent qualities found in `Perfect Pastry' with which it shares the distinction of being recently reissued with new editions. Malgieri, Braker, and Yard all approach pastry with some variation on the `master recipe' approach.<br />It is instructive to see how each of them teaches genoise. Malgieri takes the most general approach when he classifies genoise as one of the several different kinds of sponges that may be built into cakes. Braker separates cakes into butter and sponge cakes. Yard presents genoise as one of her basic master recipes, as a model for the general technique of foaming. No three recipes are the same. Malgieri's plain genoise is the simplest and least rich, with no butter, but slightly more sugar than Braker. Yard provides an option to use from two to eight ounces of butter. All use cake flour. Both Yard and Malgieri give weights for all major solid ingredients in English units. Braker gives weights for the same ingredients in metric units. My opinion on this is that if you are just starting out to weigh baking ingredients, go metric. It is much easier to scale recipes up or down using metric measurements. In their descriptions of the basic genoise method, all three are slightly different, but Braker and Malgieri's methods are more similar to one another than they are to Yard's description, although I am certain that all three methods will produce superior results. Braker's method is the wordiest,covering details on how to sift dry ingredients and crack open eggs. She is also the most helpful in giving you notes to be well prepared to execute the procedure in an effective manner. Malgieri's description covers baking in both round layer pans and in sheet pans, very important for genoise, as one of it's principle uses is in rolled desserts such as jelly rolls and Yule logs. Malgieri gives the most precise instructions on how to detect if the baking is done for both round and sheet pans.<br />Sherry Yard gives only four (4) applications, with some variations, of genoise rounds or sheets. Braker and Malgieri both give about 23 different variations. There is a fair amount of overlap, as both cover the usual chocolate and fruit applications, but there are also differences. If your heart is set on making a Yule Log, then you will need Malgieri's book. The organization of the recipes is somewhat different. Braker has all 23 together in a single chapter, while Malgieri's appear to be intermixed with other types of sponge cakes.<br />If you want an excellent book for learning a lot of different pastry techniques at a very reasonable price, get `Perfect Pastry' by Nick Malgieri in paperback. If you want a lot of well-esplained recipes for many of the same pastries, get Flo Braker's book. If you want a really good read about understanding pastry making, plus excellent recipes, get Sherry Yard's book. If you are a compulsive baking book collector, please get all three.<br />It is evident that of the three authors, Malgieri is the professional teacher. His book is the best text for baking techniques, Braker gives the best standalone recipes, and Yard is the deepest and most fun to read.<br />`Perfect Pastry' is highly recommended.vering details on how to sift dry ingredients and crack open eggs.

It is even more accurately described as primarily a book about cake baking, with approximately a quarter of the book dedicated to pastry. Everything said about the book must be understood to be referring to only torts and tarts.<br />On average, I think books on baking seem to reach a generally higher level of quality than comparable books on savory cooking. One reason is probably that you can't fake it in baking. A small misstep in measurement, equipment, or procedure can lead to something entirely different from what you intended.<br />Of course, Braker makes the humorous, but very sound suggestion to never throw away your mistakes. You never can tell when you may have happened onto the recipe for something very worthwhile to eat. Above all, don't tell your guests that their dessert is the result of a mistake.<br />The baking enthusiast's book buying is also simplified by the presence of a few very highly respected names such as Maida Heatter, Nick Malgieri, Lindsey Shere, and Flo Braker. To this distinguished list, I must add Sherry Yard, author of the great `The Secrets of Baking'. I do not have the pleasure of having read or reviewed books by Maida Heatter or Lindsey Shere, but I am quite familiar with cake and pastry books by Nick Malgieri, Gayle Ortiz, Sherry Yard, and several others. In this company, Flo Braker deserves all the acclamation she has received.<br />Any foodie worth their salt knows that the big distinction between baking and savory cooking is measurement, but few probably know why this is true or are fully aware of the consequences of ignoring precision. Not the least of Braker's accomplishments is to teach you how to be precise, teach you how avoid mistakes in measuring, and impress on you the importance of weighing instead of measuring by volume.<br />The most valuable aspect of this book is it's `modular' approach to recipes. While there are hundreds of different cake recipes, all of these hundreds are presented as distinct variations on two basic types, butter cakes and foam cakes, with sponge cakes further divided into genoise cakes, sponge cakes, angel food cakes, chiffon cake, meringues, and dacquoise. To make this highly effective approach even more agreeable to the amateur, the author does not burden us with a single master recipe for, for example, genoise, followed by a dozen paragraph long variations whose expansion into a full recipe is left to the reader. Every single one of the twenty-three (23) genoise cake recipes are spelled out, including notes on why a brown sugar genoise has different ingredients and is made with a different method than a classic genoise. The `baker's notes' at the end of each recipe are simply not to be overlooked.<br />The modular approach extends beyond the cake baking to the final construction of the cake from layers, fillings, frostings, and decorations. A full third of the book is devoted to each of these subjects individually, in such a way that one can easily mix and match cake, filling, and frosting to create something customized entirely to your personal taste of that of your family or guests. This middle section also contains two important chapters devoted to working with chocolate and sugar. The section on chocolate cannot replace books dedicated to the subject and I think Sherry Yard's discussion of caramel is more illuminating, but these sections are invaluable in supporting the other topics in the book.<br />The chapter on pastry covers all the usual bases: unsweetened short pastry, sweetened short pastry, puff pastry, and cream puff pastry. While this section and the book as a whole does not have a lot of pictures depicting methods, I am really happy to see diagrams illustrating the fraisage technique for pressing butter into pastry dough. I have read many descriptions of the technique and few manage to make sense without an accompanying picture. The details for measuring continue in pastry making, as when the author stresses the importance of a 1/8 inch thickness for a rolled pie crust. The only technique I know which seems to get a less than thorough treatment is blind baking. The technique is used, but little explanation is given for why it is done and under what circumstances it is important to use it, and when it is not necessary. I will point out that the author's preference for fat in basic piecrusts is vegetable shortening. If, like me, you happen to be a butter person, I recommend you consult Sherry Yard's Master Recipe for 3-2-1 pie dough.<br />It seems almost heretical to say this, but it is possible that this book and other teaching books such as those from Rose Levy Beranbaum may simply not be your cup of tea. If you are already a successful, accomplished baker, you may be happier with a book that simply gives lots of different recipes. I make this warning because people have occasionally objected to excellent books because the recipes were too involved or too talky. But, I think a baker who aspires to great pies and cakes should have at least one book like this and all the homey books on regional recipes you can find.

Recommended	This book, `El Farol' by Chef James Campbell Caruso contains recipes from the menu of the Santa Fe restaurant of the same name. A few restaurant cookbooks transcend their very simple objective of publicizing the restaurant. Some of the more obvious examples are `The French Laundry Cookbook' by Thomas Keller and the `Zuni Caf&eacute; Cookbook' by Judy Rodgers. Both take the reader far beyond simple recipes and provide either very basic insights into what makes a great restaurant or truly inspired instruction on what it takes to cross the boundary between good food and great food. While both of these cookbooks offer over the top attention to details, there are some transcendent restaurant cookbooks which succeed through simplicity, at the cost of providing instruction. The premier examples of such books are the cookbooks of Rose Gray and Ruth Rogers of London's River Caf&eacute;. If this book is to break out of it's mold as an elaborate advertisement for the El Farol restaurant, it will want to emulate these great River Caf&eacute; cookbooks.<br />I believe this book almost succeeds in matching the quality of the Gray and Rogers books. The first thing that impressed me was the modesty of the book's author and `sponsor', the El Farol owner David Salazar. There was no posturing, preaching about using fresh ingredients, or gratuitous photographs of strolls through the hills around Santa Fe. The next pleasant surprise was that in spite of the fact that El Farol is very close to `Tex-Mex Central', the cuisine is almost entirely Spanish, and a fairly faithful Spanish cuisine at that. As we see in the subtitle, the cuisine also specializes in tapas. In fact, fully half of the book is dedicated to hot and cold tapas, with another full quarter of the book dedicated to sauces, flavored oils, stocks, and other pantry preparations. The scant last forty pages of the book contain main dishes and desserts.<br />The second thing to impress me about the book was the chapter on `El Farol Basics'. This is the kind of stuff that most authors stick at the back of the book. I am glad Caruso has gone against this trend, as this very valuable chapter may otherwise be overlooked. Among the thirty-four (34) recipes in this chapter, there is plenty of pretty familiar stuff such as aiolis, stocks, flavored oils, salsas, and vinaigrettes, but even these staples are often done with a twist. I really appreciated that the aiolis are made with mortar and pestle. Jamie Oliver may have single-handedly resurrected this simple tool, but just in case, I really like to see it used whenever possible. It is utterly simple, easy to clean, and actually produces a better result than a blender or food processor for many jobs.<br />I have not studied Spanish cuisine as much as French and Italian, but if this book is any evidence, it seems that butter is an important ingredient at least in some regions of Spain, the world's leader in production of olive oil. There are several recipes here for flavored butters. There are also artifacts of the great Moorish influence on Spanish cooking. The book includes a recipe for preserved lemons and a Moroccan carrot sauce and the Moroccan Harissa spiced chile sauce, a very convenient intersection of old Spanish cuisine with New Mexican produce. The variety in this chapter is truly impressive, ranging from Migas (fried bread croutons) to a Spanish version of buerre blanc incorporating preserved lemons.<br />The first chapter also introduces several pillars of Spanish cuisine, jamon Serrano, Cabrales and Manchego cheeses, the fortified wines, sherry and port, and sherry wine vinegar. I suspect true Serrano ham may be hard to find in these United States, but I believe a good prosciutto will make a decent, if not inexpensive substitute. In fact, a good Italian prosciutto may actually be less expensive than a good Serrano. This ham is so important to the Spanish cuisine, the book even offers a Jamon stock recipe. It's the rare Italian who would put her prosciutto in a stockpot.<br />The cold tapas recipes have samples of all the different classic Spanish dishes you may expect, such as ceviches, escabeches, couscous salads, queso fresco and the very misleadingly named tortilla espanola. For anyone unfamiliar with Spanish egg dishes, a `Spanish' omelet is not Spanish, and the Tortilla Espanola, is an omelet (actually more like a frittata), and not a tortilla. But, it is very, very good. Believe me, I have made it.<br />The star of the hot tapas recipes is the empanadas, of which Caruso offers four different recipes. The beef and chorizo-potato fillings are expected, but the oyster and portobello fillings are something of a pleasant surprise. As I got to the end of the hot tapas, things started looking a lot like the cuisine of Spain's Italian cousins, especially in Sicily, with the grilled sardines and fried calamari.<br />It should be no surprise at all that the star of the `Main Courses' is the Paella, with variations using pork and spinach; poultry and seafood; and shrimp and blood sausage. The remaining dishes offer a very nice mix of shellfish, fin fish, beef, pork, duck, lamb, and quail.<br />The desserts are all fairly easy, with a lot of flans and chocolate coming to the party. The chapter on drinks is no surprise, with several recipes for sangrias, brandy, and tequila. There is a useful short chapter on Spanish vintage and fortified (sherry) wines.<br />The most impressive and gratifying aspect of the book is in the simplicity of the recipes, especially for tapas. I recently reviewed two books on entertaining whose recipes for `little bites' were as complicated or more complicated than many a main dish. This alone compares it favorably to Rogers and Gray of River Caf&eacute;.<br />This book will not replace a good book on Spanish cuisine, but at a list price under $30, it will not disappoint you.tto in a stockpot.<br />The cold tapas recipes have samples of all the different classic Spanish dishes you may expect, such as ceviches, escabeches, couscous salads, queso fresco and the very misleadingly named tortilla espanola.

610702:US	39134375	R1BPYV9UYIOIF5	0688111971	61788484	Italy in Small Bites	Books	5	27	31	N	N	Italy's Answer to Mezes and Tapas. Highly Recommended	Carol Field is a major star in the field of Italian culinary writers to whom respect is shown by most major Italian food writers and many major bread baking authors for her important book `The Italian Baker'. In turn, Field shows respect for many of her colleagues such as Patience Gray and Paula Wolfert in this book.<br />I was always puzzled when I read in books on Greek and Spanish food that the western Mediterranean tapas and the eastern Mediterranean Mezes of both Greece and Turkey were not the same as the Italian `little dishes' labeled antipasto. The basis for this difference was that tapas and Mezes are made to be eaten as `bar food' in the afternoon, several hours before sitting down to the final meal of the day. Antipasto, by its very name, on the other hand, is the first course of a large meal. The source of the puzzle is that I found it very hard to believe that there was an old Mediterranean tradition with well-identified dishes at both sides of the Mediterranean, but none in the center in Italy, the very heart of Mediterranean cuisine.<br />This book answers this question. Italy has not one, but two names for between meal snacks. The older, more traditional name for a snack in the afternoon, about the same time their English cousins are having tea, is called `merenda'. Like tapas and Mezes, these are specifically made and served by Enoteca (wine bars) as well as being a traditional afternoon snack for agricultural workers in the fields. For this reason, one of the defining characteristics of merenda dishes is that they can be eaten while holding them in one hand. The derivation of the term `merenda' can be traced back to classical Latin. The second term, `spuntino' is a nineteenth century invention meaning a mid-morning snack, not unlike doughnuts at the morning coffee break. The author does not explore the origins of this word too deeply, but I would not at all be surprised to see it connected with the advent of the Industrial Revolution.<br />As one looks at the recipes in this book, it becomes clear that the distinction between `merenda' dishes and all other Italian dishes is entirely based on when and where they are eaten. Almost every class of recipe in the book can be found in dozens of other Italian cookbooks. I have whole bookshelves weighed down with recipes for frittatas; egg tarts; polenta; grilled or marinated vegetables; condimento; bocconcini (small mozzarella balls); and Biscotti. But these are not even the stars of the merenda catalogue. Appropriate to Ms. Field's bread baking speciality, the real star of merenda is the enormous range of Italian breads and the things the Italians do with bread. This includes artisinal breads, focaccia, pizza, breads with olives and other vegetables baked within, and all the things Italians do with bread such as bruschetta, crostini, and Panini. Note that I tacked Panini on to the end of that list, as Ms. Field does not even mention sandwiches, let alone devote a chapter to it. This is odd, because in his Food Network series `Mario Eats Italy', Batali devotes an entire show to merenda, and Panini are highlighted. But back to Ms. Field's book.<br />If any book will convince you that bread is even more important to the Italian cuisine than pasta, this book will do it. While bread appears on almost every page, pasta has but five minor mentions in the Index. Recall that the ubiquitous dry pasta of today is a very modern development. Dry pasta did not travel far beyond southern Italy until early in the twentieth century while bread has been made throughout Italy for millennia. In fact, one of the early chapters in this book is entitled `In the Beginning There is Bread'. The most heartwarming feature of this chapter is a very long list of ways in which bread is traditionally turned into snacks. These are methods so simple the author is even reluctant to turn them into a full recipe. It should be no surprise that the supporting cast for these `little bites' is the whole catalog of the Italian pantry such as olive oil, sardines, cheeses, onion, garlic, salame, ham, bresaola (salt cured beef) and butter.<br />For the person enchanted by every aspect of the Italian cuisine, this book is a real treasure. It gives real substance to a picture of how these merenda were eaten and dispensed by shops going back as far as Imperial Rome. In fact, the book raises some serious doubt about how modern is the `fast food' phenomenon. It seems that cheap, fast, food from probably inferior products have been sold to lower income workers from Imperial times, through the Middle Ages, on the streets of Renaissance Florence, through to the nineteenth century.  In fact, the author sees the merenda tradition disappearing and often had to rely on her interviewees' memory of what they ate as children.<br />Lest I overlook the recipes themselves, let me say they cover a very broad range of dishes (mentioned above) with especially strong coverage being given to bread recipes based on the classically Italian biga method for a very sticky sponge which is left to rise for between six (6) and twenty-four (24) hours. This is the basis of recipes for vegetable and cheese filled breads. A rustic brioche recipe is given and a fried dough, `gnocco fritto', which appears very similar to New Orleans bignets.<br />I noted that many, if not most of these recipes can be found in one or another of the thoursands of Italian cookbooks. However, if you don't have thoursands of Italian cookbooks, I heartily recommend this one as a source of many interesting little dishes, both imprompu and long in preparation, but mostly easy except for the breads. One could easily make a very usefully themed collection of this and books on other little Mediterranean foods.<br />Highly recommended reading and recipes.talog of the Italian pantry such as olive oil, sardines, cheeses, onion, garlic, salame, ham, bresaola (salt cured beef) and butter.<br />For the person enchanted by every aspect of the Italian cuisine, this book is a real treasure.

At the time, the `Library Journal' said that good books for the home baker are few and far between. In 1993, Ortiz' book was just on the crest of renewed interest in artisinal breads. At the time, the most noteworthy books on artisinal bread baking were Carol Field's `The Italian Baker' and Bernard Clayton's `The Breads of France'. Peter Reinhart had written the small, quirky `Brother Juniper's Bread Book' which was long on one big idea, but not very detailed about some other aspects of baking. Bernard Clayton's giant `The Complete Book of Breads' did not even cover two of the three main types of yeast rising bread methods. It was more concerned with giving good, easy home recipes for a wide variety of different breads based entirely on `La methode directe' or the direct method. Therefore, Ortiz' excellent bibliography contains mostly works written in French.<br />In the last eleven years, a number of excellent books on artisinal bread have been written and published, especially by Peter Reinhart, Nancy Silverton, and Rose Levy Beranbaum. I have not read or reviewed Reinhart's award winning `The Bread Baker's Apprentice', so my favorite artisinal bread text before today was Beranbaum's `The Bread Bible'. Ortiz' book has just taken it's place. Beranbaum's book is almost twice as long and has a long introduction on ingredients and general techniques, but her presentation of the differences between the three major methods for yeast bread making simply do not succeed in making the subject quite as clear, as interesting, and as convincing as Ortiz' book. Beranbaum's book is still a great work with recipes for lots of types of breads that Ortiz does not cover. Before becoming too enmeshed with praise for Ortiz book, I must say I have taken a quick look at `The Bread Baker's Apprentice' and it appears to be the equal to `The Village Baker' on many points and may offer illumination on subjects Ortiz does not cover completely.<br />The heart of Ortiz book is simple artisinal bread made with flour, water, salt, and yeast. In some Tuscan bread, even salt is left out leaving three ingredients. In many breads, the yeast is captured from the ambient microflora, leaving but two ingredients added by the baker.<br />The thing that Ortiz makes so clear is the distinction between the three main methods for using yeast to leaven bread. The oldest method responsible for true sourdough breads, and the method most clearly characterizing `artisinal' baking is what the French call the `levain' method. With regional variations, this is THE method for rising dough until the production of brewer's yeast in 1810, a conversion which became complete with the production of baker's yeast in 1900. The `levain' method required at least 24 hours, as long as you had a viable starter. To create a starter required another four to seven days.<br />The direct method of leavening with commercial baker's yeast reduced production time from 24 hours to seven (7) or eight (8) hours. The problem is, breads made with the direct method simply did not taste as good or keep as long as levain breads, which benefited from the creation of acids as a byproduct of the natural fermentation. Hence, we get sour doughs from natural yeast fermentation.<br />The solution to improve the taste of breads without relying on the long and somewhat unreliable levain method was the invention of the sponge method or `Pain sur poolish', possibly named by the fact that it was invented by Polish bakers in Paris. This method creates a sponge from baker's yeast and flour on one day that rises overnight, when it is combined with more flour to form the dough. The overnight rising creates some of the acidic fermentation byproducts to give some of the sourdough tang. The brioche family, including challah is made using the sponge method. Italian bakers use a similar method, calling their version ofa sponge a `biga' which is best for high gluten breads with a high water content for ciabatta and like breads.<br />Giving us an understanding of these three major approaches to yeast leavened bread may, itself, be worth the price of admission for this $20 paperback, but there is much more. True to the title of the book, the author' main focus is to give us an understanding of the traditional local professional baker, and to enable us to reproduce what this baker can do. To tell the full story, Ortiz gives recipes for many traditional breads as they may be done at home AND as they are done in the professional bakery. The professional recipes follow the same format used by other books for the professional baker such as Gisslen's `Professional Baking' and the recent Culinary Institute of America's `Baking and Pastry'.<br />In spite of the heavy use of French sources, Ortiz gives full coverage of Italian, German / Austrian, Italian, and American artisinal methods. That's right, American artisinal baking, headlined by the justly famous San Francisco sourdough. The only thing I miss is a reference to any special microflora native to the San Francisco area that makes this bread so distinctive. My hunch is that it is all due to the mist off the bay. In the section on American breads, Ortiz cites a large number of artisinal bakers, almost all of which are on the Pacific coast (that mist again) or in New York City. As the list is eleven (11) years old, I would verify any locations before getting into the car. Thankfully, I know that Zabar's in Manhattan is alive and well and still credited with having the best bread in New York City.<br />If you are interested in understanding serious bread baking basics, this is the book for you. Be warned, this is not simple quick stuff, but worth the read even if you never open a pack of Fleishman's yeast.a sponge a `biga' which is best for high gluten breads with a high water content for ciabatta and like breads.<br />Giving us an understanding of these three major approaches to yeast leavened bread may, itself, be worth the price of admission for this $20 paperback, but there is much more.

613552:US	39134375	R3O99PPLNZQTBA	0060085487	476831793	The Berry Bible: With 175 Recipes Using Cultivated and Wild, Fresh and Frozen Berries	Books	5	34	39	N	Y	Tremendously Useful Book on Very Important Food	Thirty-five years ago `The Berry Bible' by Janie Hibler may have attracted a place in a relatively small market of hippies, vegetarians, and Pacific Northwest berry boosters. Today, I suspect the book will and should attract a lot more attention with the discovery and publicizing of the health benefits of all berries, specifically cranberries and blueberries.<br />Even though I easily qualify as a `cookbook collector', I have never given much thought to what constitutes a good book for a cookbook collection, as my primary objective in acquiring cookbooks is to review them. But, this book easily qualifies as a paradigm for an excellent member of a cookbook collection. The two most interesting types of volumes in cookbook collections, I think, would be books on specific regions such as Provence, Tuscany, Mexico, and The Philippines and books on specific ingredients such as potatoes, duck, salmon, and eggs.<br />So, once we start collecting books on ingredients, what should they include? The most obvious answer is recipes. For these, a book on berries has much more to offer than a book on eggs or potatoes since, aside from the relatively small variations between starchy and waxy potatoes, there is not much to tell about how to make the best use of different varieties. There is also not much room to capitalize on recipes that can serve many purposes by being a stage for a wide variety of color, species, and cultivar of product. A good berry recipe can give you recipes for muffin, scone, tart, coulis, or smoothie for blackberries, raspberries, and mulberries in one fell swoop. To this end, the book contains recipes for:<br />Coolers, Cocktails, Smoothies, and other Drinks<br />Breads<br />Soups and Salads<br />Main Courses<br />Sauces<br />Putting Berries By (jams, jellies, and preserves)<br />Ice Creams, Sorbets, and Other Frozen Treats<br />Pies, Tarts, Cobblers, and Such<br />Cakes<br />Pastries, Puddings, and Other Sweet Treats<br />If the book did no more than this, it would be worth its reasonable $30 list price, but it does do much more.<br />The intellectually most attractive feature of the book is `The A-to-Z Berry Encyclopedia'. It is a revelation to see how widely dispersed in the plant kingdom the main types of berries are, and yet, how closely related other berries with distinct names actually are. I was really surprised to discover that the boysenberry is not only related to the blackberry, it IS a blackberry, simply a specially named humanly developed cultivar of naturally occurring blackberries. Another interesting aspect is distinction between two or three different species with the same common name. Both blueberries and cranberries have lowbush and highbush varieties with markedly different geographic ranges and different commercial importance. The blueberry in your local megamart will almost invariably be the highbush species, unless you happen to live in northern New England, where you may have access to Maine lowbush blueberries. Those little blue beauties you see being gathered in Maine on the Food Network are not the same as what you see in your `Super Fresh' produce department.<br />All this babble about species and cultivars has an important message for you, the consumer. If you want your local market to carry good stuff, the author recommends you find out from what cultivar a good batch of berries was picked, and ask for those berries in preference to inferior berries laid out on other occasions.<br />The berry encyclopedia has much other useful and interesting information. The common name is useful if you happen to be reading foreign cookbooks, even those written in English, and run across an unusual name. The scientific classification shows who is related to whom. It turns out that many berries, especially the blackberry and raspberry clans are closely related to roses. Figure they had to get those thorns from someone in their family. The habitat and distribution section will give you a really good ideaof which species and cultivars you may find in a true `local sources' farmers market. The history is interesting, if for nothing else than to show that berry fruits, barks, and leaves have been used as medicines since the time the Greeks started writing about their tummy aches. `Where They Are Grown Commercially' will give you a good idea of how fresh your megamart produce may be, if it is in season locally. `How to Pick' is essential if you are playing hunter-gatherer. The most common advice is to pick berries in the early morning, before the sun has warmed them up. `How To Buy' is for the us urbanites who do our gathering at SuperFresh. The more important types of berries such as blackberries and raspberries have a sidebar describing the various commercially available varieties.<br />The book ends with a list of web sites I truly believe you would not find by yourself. Most are of commercial booster groups and academic or state organizations dedicated to studying berry culture.<br />The very last section is an excellent little bibliography. You have to love a book that cites both Elizabeth David and the Ukrainian Women's Association of Canada, with a stop at `Leaves in Myth, Magic, and Medicine' along the way.<br />This is my kind of book. Even if you never want to but blackberries in your barbecue sauce or abandon your Bernard Clayton book on breadmaking, this book will reward you. If it does not, you should find a way to make berries a more important part of your life. They are that important nutroceutically. There, the book will even expand your vocabulary.<br />Highly recommended for understanding, buying, and using berries for enjoyment and health.nd cultivars you may find in a true `local sources' farmers market.

The author is a member of a very sixties hippie influenced rural community whose lifestyle seems to be grown directly from the soil laid down by `The Whole Earth Catalogue', `Easy Rider', `Alice's Restaurant', and the Hog Farm, but without any trace of the Merry Pranksters' antics or inclinations towards mind-altering drugs. The shaping of the last forty years is seen in the author's being HIV positive AIDs infected young man with a major interest in sharing his passion for fermented foods with the rest of the world through modern publishing and scholarly rigor.<br />Fermented food products are probably much more common in our lives today than they have been since the advent of the processed foods industry. And, this is a fact that even the average foodie may not be conscious. A quick inventory of fermented foods commonly used in modern American homes will show how widespread they have become.<br />The most obvious fermented product is beer, which has always been with us. Their cousins, wines and meads are also the product of fermentation. Virtually all cheeses are produced by fermentation, and our interest in and consumption of artisinal cheeses is rising fast. Yogurt is a close cousin of cheeses and consumption of yogurt has been rising since the early seventies. Sauerkraut and Choucroute have been with us since the beginning, but Asian fermented cabbage such as Kimchee and other fermented vegetables are becoming more popular. Pickles have also been a part of western cuisine for millennia Another part of the increasing interest in Asian foods is an increase in consumption of miso and tempeh, both from fermented soybeans. Asian fermented fish sauces from Thailand and Vietnam are also much more common today than they were 50 years ago. The granddaddy of fermented foods for Western cultures is yeast bread, especially sourdough breads.<br />Fermentation has at least four beneficial results, two of which have been known since prehistoric times. The first and most important effect is that fermentation is a method of natural preservation by the creation of acetic acid (acid in vinegar) or lactic acid (acid from milk sugar). The second, represented most clearly by the brewing of beer, is in the action of microorganisms on sugars to produce ethanol (alcohol in beer, wine, and liquor). The third is based on our physiological salivation response to acidic foods, or even the anticipation of acidic foods, thereby making the mouth feel of these foods more succulent by the combination of natural food moisture and our own saliva. Ancients may have sensed the last beneficial result, but it probably has not been fully realized until the 20th century. This is the ability of fermentation to break down foods which were hard to digest into different products which are both easier to digest and more nutritious. The two best examples of this action are the conversion of soy carbohydrates into miso and the conversion of milk into yogurt.<br />All of this has made fermentation into a darling of vegan advocates, as it broadens the range of useable non-animal protein and makes it all more palatable. It has also made fermentation into a favorite of alternate lifestyle nutritionists such as Sally Fallon, the author of the excellent book `Nourishing Traditions' who supplied a Foreword to this book. Fermentation is also one of the hallmarks of the slow food movement. Aside from the North African method for preserving lemons, I know of no other culinary methods that take as long to complete.<br />Anyone who has made pickles, sourdough bread, or beer should have a very good idea of the times involved in fermentation. And this doesn't even get into some of the olfactory `delights' that accompany the process of fermentation.<br />The author covers allof the types of fermentation mentioned above, devoting the greatest amount of space to vegetable, bean, and dairy fermentation. Bakers should not miss the lesser attention paid to breads, as for every book on yogurt, pickles, and kraut, there are ten books which cover artisinal baking with its sourdough sponges, poolishs, and begas.<br />On the political front, the most active issue regarding fermentation is the issue of unpasteurized cheeses being imported into or made in the United States. It is truly ironic that the home of Louis Pasteur relishes their raw cheeses while the squeaky-clean US won't let it in.<br />Aside from the thoroughly careful presentation the author gives of his material, the veracity of the book is strengthened by the extensively footnoted research behind his statements and the fact that the fruits of fermentation are essential to the lifestyle of the author and his comrades at their rural homestead. The similarity to both the hippie counterculture doctrines and the Amish lifestyle are unmistakable. One would almost take them for being scions of the Amish except for the names cited in the acknowledgments that I found myself checking against the names of the communities' goats. We owe this book in part to humans who go by the names Echo, Nettles, Leopard, Orchid, Spark, Book Mark, and Ravel Weaver.<br />I also thank Echo, Nettles, Leopard, et al and author Sandor Ellis Katz for this deeply thought out exposition of a pervasive and growing part of the modern culinary and nutritional environment.<br />This book may not be for everyone, or even for every foodie, but if anything I said sounds a chord in your psyche, I recommend you get a copy of this book and read it carefully.of the types of fermentation mentioned above, devoting the greatest amount of space to vegetable, bean, and dairy fermentation.

615344:US	39134375	R2MPDEVXZMHP8B	0060515147	864149924	Fresh Food Fast: Delicious, Seasonal Vegetarian Meals in Under an Hour	Books	4	28	118	N	Y	Good Book for Vegetarians with Little Time.	The titles of this Peter Berley book, `Fresh Food Fast' combine at least four culinary catch phrases in the space of eleven words. `Fresh', `Seasonal', `Fast', and `Vegetarian', supported by `Meals in Under an Hour' promise to hit as many cookbook buyers' hot buttons as possible. The style of the book is to do Rachael Ray one better in the fast menu planning department by addressing a common criticism of her '30 Minute Meals' books. Berley or co-author Melissa Clark addresses this by providing a `game plan' for preparing all three recipes in the meal in addition to the methods for each individual recipe. This aid is supported by three additional time-savers. The first is a market list, giving a shopping list for the entire meal, divided into produce, dairy items, and pantry. The second is a list of equipment needed to accomplish all three recipes. The third is a speed tip, an optional element to your menu game plan.<br />My immediate gut reaction to all these additions to the traditional cookbook schema is that the author is simply adding new points of failure. And, as soon as a reader perceives a weakness in one of these features, it will not take long for them to ignore the feature. I do not even say, at this point, that there are weaknesses. I am only pointing out that among the thousands of people who will buy this book, added, non-traditional features simply increase the chances of a PERCEIVED weakness. This is one of the great strengths of Ruth Rogers' and Rose Gray's approach to recipe writing or, most prominently, in the style of the great Elizabeth David. As long as you know that you will need to supply knowledge of common kitchen techniques and canvas your larder yourself, the `minimalist' approach leaves less room for leading the reader astray. This is certainly NOT true of cooking textbooks as written by, for example, the CIA or Madeline Kamman. These books need all the `read between the lines' details which may not make it into a book on regional cooking.<br />I did `perceive' weaknesses in the book. Regarding the `Market List', I typically rail against any pantry recommendations in any form. What you have on hand versus what you need on any one day can change from day to day. On the market list for the very first menu, out of fifteen items, I find seven, almost half, of the items are things I keep on hand. I simply buy them any time I use them up. The same first recipe procedure uses a salad bowl in such a way that suggests a wooden salad bowl be called for. This is not a common kitchen item, yet it is not listed in the equipment list. To the highly literal minded, the game plan for the same very first menu contradicts the recipe procedure for the salad which says the salad is to be served immediately after tossing, yet the game plan has one doing two steps between tossing and serving the salad. For so many questions to arise in the first menu makes me immediately suspicious of the book as a whole. I generally find evidence of either greatness or inadequacy in the first five minutes into a book. It may take reading the entire book to satisfy one that the book is just good.<br />This book alienated me with the first sentence of the introduction by proclaiming that it sets out to defy the trend of the `extinction of home-cooked meals and family dining'. The acre of fresh, raw produce and the yards of fresh meats on display at my local farmers market style emporium give the lie to the assumption that home cooking is in danger of dying out. The book is also a weak contender in this battle against our `Fast Food Nation' in that all of its menus are vegetarian. While I suspect people are eating more vegetables, I do not see any danger to America's cattle and pig and chicken producers.<br />I found the early section on kitchen equipment pretty good, but not without some mistakes which should have been caught by a good copy editor or by the very experienced co-author, Melissa Clark. At one point, a 4-to-6 quart Dutch oven is recommended, followed by a suggestion to also buy a two handled cast iron 4-to-6 quart pot. A less obvious oversight is in the recommendation to buy an immersion blender in place of a bar blender. Several recipes I saw had steps in their method that simply could not be handled by an immersion blender, and the method specified a bar blender. A bar blender can simply do more different things than can an immersion blender.<br />The most questionable step I found in several recipes was the instruction to add chopped vegetables to a pan on medium or high heat with NO OIL IN THE PAN. This very odd step appeared in many recipes with many different vegetables.<br />For vegetarian / vegan bookbuyers, be aware that this book uses eggs, cheese, and milk in abundance, but it uses no meat broths or stocks. It does not even use vegetable stocks in its soups.<br />If you are both vegetarian and a fan of Rachael Ray's style, you may get much from this book. The seasonal organization is good, but not rigorous. The author admits that most recipes can be done at most times of the year. Otherwise, you may not get your $35 worth from the book. I would stick with the excellent books by Deborah Madison. I worry when I am critical of a book from respected authors like Melissa Clark, but I didn't learn anything from this book and I feel there were mistakes being passed off as kitchen wisdom. I will not seek this book out when there are hundreds of other books available.<br />This is a fair book with good vegetarian recipes, but too much baggage for the experienced home cook.n is recommended, followed by a suggestion to also buy a two handled cast iron 4-to-6 quart pot.

615628:US	39134375	R1WA32887PTTRP	0618379436	62914922	How to Read a French Fry: And Other Stories of Intriguing Kitchen Science	Books	5	35	37	N	N	One of the Best Popular Books on Food Science	Russ Parsons is a `Los Angeles Times' culinary columnist originally hired by Ruth Reichl who, with Shirley Corriher (`Cookwise'), Alton Brown (TV's `Good Eats'), and Robert Volker (`What Einstein Told His Cook') work at explaining cooking to us all. I have not read Corriher's very highly regarded book, but I would give Parsons the highest regard when compared to Brown and Volker when looking at what they do in common. To anticipate any thoughts that I am overlooking Harold McGee, I believe McGee's book `On Food and Cooking' is literally in a class of its own, from which all of these other authors have probably borrowed.<br />While Brown and Volker give scientific explanations of culinary phenomena, with Brown's chapters in `I'm Only Here for the Food' being somewhat deeper than Volker's question and answer format, Parsons is looking at culinary facts from a much broader point of view. It is as if all three understand food and all three have good scientific explanations for food facts, but only Parsons understands SCIENCE. Alton Brown gives an excellent metaphor for science in describing what he does as drawing a roadmap of a neighborhood (of custards, for example) rather than simply giving step by step instructions as one would when writing out the method for a recipe. Brown, however, seems constantly constrained by the limits of a 30-minute `Good Eats' episode or of a book chapter on braising.<br />Parsons addresses the whole field of food science from the other direction. He doesn't talk about what causes meat to brown (and why this tastes so good) or how simmering in water creates gelatin in stocks, or how the barbecue method is so good at producing tender meat from tough primals. Instead, he talks about MEAT, its composition, and how it reacts, in general, to heat, and what the variations are from chicken to pork to veal to beef to lamb. From these, we can see the similarities between, for example, barbecue and braising. This is what science is all about. Explaining individual facts without an underlying theory becomes nothing more than description. Alton Brown uses the theory to explain the facts. Russ Parsons talks about the theory, with facts as examples of how the theory works.<br />What so frustrates me about the clarity with which Parsons writes is that in spite of this, TV food show hosts continue to perpetuate myths about cooking like the one about searing meat is done to `seal in the juices'. Both Parsons and McGee have refuted this statement, yet some Food Network hosts make that statement over and over. I think all people who make their living by writing or speaking about food should be required to take a good chemistry course, followed by a food science course before they are let loose with word processor or microphone. But I digress.<br />Parsons' book is composed of six essays, each on some basic aspect of food composition or behavior. These chapters are:<br />How to read a French fry: Frying and the chemical and physical properties of frying oils.<br />The second life of plants: Changes to fruits and vegetables after harvest and cooking.<br />Miracle in a shell: Eggs and their amazing emulsifying properties.<br />From a pebble to a pillow: Starches from rice, beans, flour, potatoes and their ability to thicken.<br />Meat and heat: The Maillard principle, collagen, fats, and what it is that gives meat its flavor.<br />Fat, flour, and fear: Pie crusts, butter or lard, and gluten formation.<br />Each essay is longer or much longer than a typical newspaper column. It is also a level of writing that rarely sees the food pages of my local newspaper. I suspect most of the articles were serialized over several issues. These essays alone make the book worthwhile. Parsons goes on to give practical cooking tips. All these tips should now be fully understandable and therefore eminently easy to remember once the cook has read the essay on which they are based. A favorite for me is the recommendation to thicken sauces with flour rather than with cornstarch or arrowroot. If one is exposed to a little Chinese cooking, cornstarch acquires a great attraction and is seemingly easier to use than flour. What experienced chefs know, but never say, is that flour is a much more stable thickener and will stand up to reheating much better than other starches. For those of us who dote on `Molto Mario' and `Good Eats', many of the hints, especially for pasta, will seem obvious, but then not everyone mainlines the Food Network six hours a day.<br />Parsons caps each essay with a collection of recipes appropriate to the lessons in the essay. Most of the recipes are old standards that the foodies among us have seen often before, such as snickerdoodles, macaroni and cheese, pot roast, and ratatouille. This means that anyone with a cookbook collection of any size may not find very much new in these pages, except as concrete examples of the science presented in the essays. I will say the recipes I examined are highly respectable and should produce excellent results. The author does provide a complete table of all recipes by principle ingredient (fish) or course (dessert). I think this should be a feature of every cookbook. It is doubly useful when ingredient or course does not organize the book.<br />My only regret about this book is that it is so short and that so few people will be attracted to reading it. We need food science to replace the extensive drilling in cooking techniques that we used to get at our mothers or grandmother's side. That has disappeared, and it wasn't all that great to begin with.<br />With sincere apologies to Alton Brown, who gives me more laughs in one `Good Eats' episode than Parsons has in this whole book, I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone who likes to read about food.ther than with cornstarch or arrowroot.

I will say the recipes I examined are highly respectable and should produce excellent results. The author does provide a complete table of all recipes by principle ingredient (fish) or course (dessert). I think this should be a feature of every cookbook. It is doubly useful when ingredient or course does not organize the book.<br />My only regret about this book is that it is so short and that so few people will be attracted to reading it. We need food science to replace the extensive drilling in cooking techniques that we used to get at our mothers or grandmother's side. That has disappeared, and it wasn't all that great to begin with.<br />With sincere apologies to Alton Brown, who gives me more laughs in one `Good Eats' episode than Parsons has in this whole book, I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone who likes to read about food.	2004-06-25

No Food Talk	Juliette Rossant, a business and travel journalist who also writes about the food business writes `Super Chef'. And, this is entirely a book about business, business people, and food people rather than a book about food. While it is good journalism, it has little in common with the culinary journalism of Michael Ruhlman, Robb Walsh, or Calvin Trillin.<br />The subject of the book is the business careers of five restaurateurs and talented chefs who have been successful in starting and running at least two different restaurants. The subtitle is `The Making of the Great Modern Restaurant Empires' which brings to mind Emeril Lagasse, Jean George Vongerichten, Nobu Matsuhisa, Daniel Boulud, and Mario Batali, all of which are known as great chefs who have opened several different haute cuisine restaurants in major venues. Three of the five chefs featured in the book, Wolfgang Puck, Charlie Palmer, and Todd English, certainly belong to this group, but two, Tom Colicchio and the team of Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger, seem somewhat out of place.<br />Wolfgang Puck is by far and away the poster boy for the American Super Chef prototype. More than any other, he has turned his name into a brand. The fact that no one except Emeril Lagasse even comes close to Puck's celebrity is simply a measure of how clearly he stands out from the crowd. His business concerns include a `fine dining' company with its flagship Spago restaurants, a `fast casual' company with restaurants in the mold of Chilis and Bennigans, a foods marketer handling his trademark frozen pizzas and other foods, a line of cookware Wolfgang hawks on QVC, a series of cookbooks, and headlining appearances on Food Network shows and specials such as the `Master Iron Chef' series of shows. Last but by far not least is his Hollywood catering gigs where he wines and dines the Academy Awards celebrants and other high profile events. Since Wolfgang's career is so visible, it is easy to verify some of the author's impressions of Puck against other appearances.<br />Two things about Puck are well known and are echoed in this book. The first is his great modesty in the face of a backbreaking schedule that can turn less well-tempered people into people whose company you simply do not want to share. Watching any Puck appearance on TV in a quiet atmosphere can see this. The second is his great skill under pressure. On the Food Network `Master Iron Chef' segment where Puck was competing against Masaharu Morimoto, Puck's dishes were so clearly better at using the theme ingredient that the competition didn't even seem fair. Other evidence is his behavior on specials about the Oscar catering gigs where his assistants comment that Puck seems to have ice water in his veins, as he simply never looses his cool while standing back and letting his team get the job done.<br />The truly odd thing about the forty-two (42) pages about Wolfgang Puck in this book is that I recall but a single sentence about his cooking, where the author offers the opinion that Puck is not a great chef, but he is very good. The book says as much about Lagasse's cooking talent, and Emeril is not even the subject of the book.<br />The book says much more about contracts, leases, locations, and partnerships, and the extent to which these things take the empire building chef away from the kitchen. I really regret that Daniel Boulud was not a featured subject in the book, as he is one of the very few chefs I know have written on the challenges of switching from cooking to creating a chain of high end dining restaurants. The author accurately reflects Boulud's observation that one needs a very different set of skills to pull this off. The author's main contribution to this insight is that the chef who does it must, like Wolfgang, have and maintain a relatively pleasing personality in order to build up a team of people who are willing to stay with you and embrace your vision and level of food and service quality.<br />In spiteof the very large cast of characters, the book gets close to none of the supporting characters and does not get very close to the featured chefs. One of the most revealing anecdotes was the encounter between Charlie Palmer's Las Vegas employee Andrew Bradbury and a very tired and pallid Microsoft founder Bill Gates where Gates took an unexpected half hour quizzing Bradbury on how the sommelier planned to use Microsoft products in selecting wines at Palmer's Mandalay Bay Aureole restaurant.<br />One story which shows just how much a restaurateur changes from chef to businessman when they open multiple restaurants is the fact that Charlie Palmer spends a lot of time and energy setting cost thresholds for food purchases at his various restaurants, varying levels to meet local conditions, cuisine, and clientele. This immediately illuminates some of Rocco DiSpirito's weaknesses as a restaurateur when he seemed to ignore both the kitchen and the books at Rocco's on 22nd, as seen in the second `The Restaurant' series.<br />This book is a good read whether you are interested in business or in restaurants. If your interest disappears if there has been no mention of garlic in the last two pages, this may not be the book for you. On the other hand, if you really like all aspects of the food business, you will get a major dose from this book. You will find it especially revealing if you have the slightest interest in going into the food business. The chapters on the two girls and Colicchio are interesting, even if they don't fit the book's premise as well as Puck, Palmer, and English.<br />I almost wish the author would do a book featuring the non-chef restaurateurs who have, for example partnered with DiSpirito in New York and Morimoto in Philadelphia.

They are one of the first employers of Jamie Oliver and were, I suspect, a strong influence on his style and choice of cuisine. Gray and Roger owe nothing to Oliver's current celebrity. Their reputation is firmly based on doing good Italian food before Jamie came to the limelight.<br />This is their first and most highly acclaimed book, and the last of their three readily available volumes that I am to review. The book can be viewed on at least three different levels, depending on the reader's level of knowledge of Italian cuisine.<br />The reader who is innocent of any Italian cuisine outside what they may have seen in the local American Italian restaurant will be quite surprised by the absence of the Italian-American classics such as spaghetti and meatballs, veal Parmesan, lasagna, and chicken Marsala. The better informed reader who has read Lydia Bastianich and watched `Molto Mario' will recognize many true Italian standards such as Panzanella salad, osso bucco, slow-cooked lamb shanks, artichokes alla Giudea, and lots and lots of risotto and polenta recipes. This reader may feel slightly disoriented in that there are very few hints and reminders and pointers about how to complete the various recipes. A perfect example is the Roman recipe for `Carciofi alla Giudea' (Fried artichokes, Jewish style). The recipe in David Downie's authoritative `Cooking the Roman Way' covers three pages while Rogers and Gray take three short paragraphs, occupying a quarter of a page to give the recipe with almost exactly the same ingredients. Part of the difference is that Downie's recipe includes detailed instructions on dealing with and cleaning an artichoke and details on techniques for frying with olive oil. Rogers and Gray dispatch this task in four sentences. In dealing with this book, a second paradigm shift is needed to move from the view of culinary newbie to experienced user of Italian recipes.<br />As with the fried artichoke example, tips on cooking technique are rare in this book. What is not rare are tips on the selection of ingredients. I can honestly say that this is truly the first book I have seen where the recipes are so simple and the ingredients lists so small that the choice of the proper ingredients is essential to achieving the expected results. Some recipes are so specific that they require olive oil fresh from the harvest in December and January. Oil aged as much as six months will simply be too mild to give the proper brightness to the recipe.<br />The name of the book `Italian Country' was given to `The River Caf&eacute; Cookbook' when its publication was transplanted from the United Kingdom to the United States. This new title and some few statements in the book give a somewhat misleading picture of the book as a collection of `authentic' recipes from rural Italy. I will just point out that two classic artichoke recipes are well known staples of downtown Rome from antiquity. There are also a few statements about the regional source of some recipes, but these do not make this a treatise on regional Italian cookery. The most important point of view to take with this book is the statement in the first sentence of the introduction which proclaims `... a shared vision (to) cook the food we had eaten in Italian homes but could never find outside Italy...'. A corollary to this vision is that since all the recipes were based on or inspired by Italian home cooking, they are truly easy to do in the British or American kitchen. The only catch is that in spite of the wealth of Italian speciality products available in American megamarts, some critical ingredients may still be a bit difficult to find, and the authors tend to make correct ingredient selection an important part of each recipe. Cavolo nero (black cabbage), for example, a native of Tuscany, has not found itsway to my local, well-stocked produce palaces. I also think getting fresh olive oil in January may be a bit of a trick for us colonists. But I will reserve judgment on this until I try next year.<br />While the book contains many recipes familiar to the journeyman Italian cook, there are also many unusual forms. One favorite is rotolo di spinaci, a rolled pasta akin to strudel with a mushroom, ricotta, and spinach filling. This is one of the rare recipes whose method takes a full page and the accompanying photographs detail the steps in the method. While there are tomatoes aplenty in many recipes, the book has a strongly Northern Italian bent, with the lots of risotto, dried bread, and polenta recipes and relatively few hard pasta recipes. For those who crave spaghetti, take a look at the latest cookbook from the River Caf&eacute;, `Italian Easy from the River Caf&eacute;'. This new volume has close to a dozen spaghetti recipes.<br />The irony of the book is that in spite of the simplicity of the recipes, this is `graduate level' cooking which expects a fair amount of cooking competence from its readers and a considerable dedication to tracking down the right ingredients. But do not be deterred. The world would be pretty dull if every Italian cookbook covered all the same techniques in the same level of detail. Also do not be deterred by the fairly large number of familiar recipes in this book. Most recipes with common names are different enough for you to learn from the variation. The authors' spaghetti Carbonara, for example, is significantly different from, for example, Mario Batali's recipe.<br />The styling and photography adds to the joyful feeling of the text without being too obstrusive.

They are one of the first employers of Jamie Oliver and were, I suspect, a strong influence on his style and choice of cuisine. In fact, Oliver is credited as a River Caf&eacute; chef in the Acknowledgments. Gray and Roger owe nothing to Oliver's current celebrity. Their reputation is firmly based on doing good Italian food before Jamie came to the limelight.<br />This is their second book, which I am reviewing after having reviewed their third, `Italian Easy' and I am doubly unhappy with myself that I have left Gray and Rogers unread for so long. Among celebrity restaurant cookbooks, these are distinctive in that they are all about the recipes. There are the usual lists of American suppliers and the usual glossary of ingredients which does nothing more than tell us how these ingredients are used at the River Caf&eacute;. There are few headnotes, no sidebars, very few tips on technique, and no endearing stories introducing the chapters. That is not to say there is nothing endearing about the book. The few personal comments by the authors, the photographs of the authors at work, and the overall design of the book conveys the strong sense that these are two people you would really like to know.<br />While I have not read the authors' first book, `Italian Country Cook Book', I sense all three books share a strong common philosophy which gives us exquisitely simple recipes based on classic Italian recipes and ingredients. This simplicity can be deceiving. There are virtually no tips on technique and few steps recommending you taste and season. Much of this is probably due to the natural saltiness of Italian ingredients such as the hard cheeses, anchovies, capers, cured hams, and salt cod. All this means is that a genuinely inexperienced chef may miss some very simple steps which an experienced home cook takes for granted, such as techniques for garlic in heated oil and pealing tomatoes.<br />The centerpiece of this book is recipes based on a large wood-fuelled oven installed at the River Caf&eacute; as part of a major renovation and expansion. Be assured that the way the `wood-roasted' recipes are written, they are entirely doable in your gas or electric oven at home.<br />Drinks chapter's primary feature is that most of the drink recipes use prosecco plus fresh fruit.<br />Second chapter on salads, frittatas, and other starters opens with the simple style that characterizes the whole book. The headnotes supply nothing except recommendations on which varieties of vegetable to use in each dish. There are some simple but unusual techniques in some of the recipes. One, for example, uses boiled lemon wedges in a salad with artichokes. Another novelty is a venison carpaccio salad. A great surprise for an Italian-themed dinner party. The frittatas are made with the simplest method of a quick turn in the oven after stovetop curdling of the eggs.<br />The chapter on pasta includes a basic fresh pasta recipe plus recipes for pasta verde,  ravioli, and several recipes with fresh tagliatelle. Like new book, there are also several recipes for spaghetti, all exquisitely simple. The chapter also includes three recipes for wet polenta combined with porcini, truffles, and cavolo nero.<br />The risottos chapter has a good mix of recipes which are so simple, one wonders what all the fuss is about. The chapter on soups contains the usual mix of bean soups and some special treats with an arugula and potato soup, a salt cod soup which looks deliciously like Manhattan clam chowder and a wild fennel soup. The stock recipes are so simple, it makes you embarrassed not to make your own.<br />The wood-roasted vegetables chapter opens the way to caramelized beets, carrots, artichokes, asparagus, zucchini, eggplant, Swiss Chard, and lots of potatoes. Yum.<br />The `Vegetables in Padellla' chapterchanges venues and presents the all the usual suspects in a wine braise.<br />The most interesting recipes among the fish and shellfish offerings are the wood-roasted methods that you can do in the bottom of your Hotpoint at home. The most unusual recipe may be the layered sardine sandwich. No bread makes an appearance in the ingredient list.<br />The chapter on meats, including pork, chicken, duck, and game opens with two spectacular recipes for doing a whole suckling pig and a slow roasted shoulder of pork. These are just the things for urban pig meat lovers who don't want to mess with barbecue. The other really unusual recipe is a combination of leftover pork and tuna.<br />The chapter on breads opens with a potato sourdough starter, something you may not see outside of a book on artisinal baking.

I pizza novice may want to go to Peter Reinhart's `American Pie' book on pizza to get an in depth look at pizza before tackling recipes at this level.<br />Chapter on sixteen (16) sauces has a lot more variety than you may see in more traditional Italian books.<br />Chapter on desserts has everything that is great about Italian baking, great simplicity and great taste, especially if you are familiar only with French and American pastry.

Highly Recommended	In considering this book, you should certainly be aware that grilling and barbecue are two different methods of cooking, at least as different as braising and roasting, even though the methods share similar equipment and are typically done outdoors. That means there is very little overlap between the recipes in this book and the Jamison's important barbecue book `Smoke & Spice'. Unlike barbecue, which requires smoke and which is almost always done outside, grilling wishes to avoid smoke, is done on high heat, and can be done fairly competently indoors on a grill pan, as it has a lot more in common with saute than it does with barbecue.<br />The Jamison's first chapter is one of the best introductions to a cooking method I have seen anywhere. And, you probably need it, as the mind set surrounding grilling, especially outdoors, is not friendly to serious cooking. The lessons may be summarized in the observation that grilling IS cooking on high heat, which is done to impart a unique taste, and this activity requires your full attention.<br />Chicken is a very popular subject for treatment in a dedicated book; even a book dedicated to a single cooking technique. This is because chicken is cheap, it has some challenging variety (white versus dark versus skin on versus skin off versus young bird versus old bird), it is somewhat bland so it is an excellent medium for enhancing with flavors, and it has been cooked around the world, so every one of the world's great cuisines has a wealth of chicken recipes and flavorings which can be translated to the grill. Even the homegrown American cuisine has contributed major chicken dishes such as fried chicken, barbecued chicken, and Buffalo chicken wings.<br />The first chapter of recipes owes much to the worlds oldest cuisines and cooking methods. These are `Skewers, Satays, and Other Small Favors'. These are nine recipes of grilling on skewers, especially with a peanut flavoring which defines the Indonesian Satay style of dish. The chapter ends with a `deconstructed' salad of grilled and cubed chicken, needing no skewers.<br />The next chapter is five recipes for wings with pineapple, mustard, harissa, Tex-Mex, and traditional sauces. The next chapter is seven recipes for grilled chicken in sandwiches, including ground chicken grilled as a hamburger, several Mexican treatments of grilled chicken, and a classic chicken club sandwich.<br />The chapter on '50 Nifty Recipes for Boneless, Skinless Breasts' is really ten (10) recipes with about five variations in sauce, marinade, or garnish. The star of this chapter is probably the `barbecued chicken pizza'. In this and some other recipes, the term barbecue is used very loosely, as the word is only earned by virtue of dressing the grilled chicken with a barbecue style sauce. That aside, the results are still impressive and delicious. This is getting into the Wolfgang Puck / Bobby Flay cooking with flash territory.<br />The chapter `Bone-In Breasts, Thighs, and Legs' offers nine recipes with French, Portuguese, Maryland, East Indian, Cajun, and Georgian (US) flavors. This makes me surprised there is no bickering over chicken supremacy between Maryland and Georgia the way there is between North Carolina, Tennessee, Kansas City, and Texas over barbecue.<br />Just about the only thing left is to grill a whole chicken. Early in the book, the authors point out that grilling and a whole four pound chicken really do not go together very well. That is why every whole chicken method uses either some special equipment, some as humble as a beer can, special butchering, as when the bird is grilled under a brick per the classic Italian technique, or the bird is very small, as with a Poisson or a Cornish game hen. This chapter also contains the only true barbecue recipes in the book, as the barbecue technique is much friendlier to whole chicken cooking than is grilling. This chapter also introduces the rotisserie, which is available on many gas grills. Three rotisserie recipes are provided, two with chickens and one for Cornish game hens.<br />The last chicken recipe chapter gives seven (7) things to do with grilled chicken in salads and pastas. All are pretty traditional. All look delicious.<br />The last chapter gives fifteen (15) side dishes and desserts. Again, these are almost all variations on standards, but most of the recipes give you something to do with your grill and vegetables while those Satay skewers are grilling.<br />If you are a griller, or, if you really like chicken and can swing a grill pan, this book is a great addition to your kitchen. Even if you don't have Marimoto's knife skills or Bobby Flay's flair with squeeze bottled sauces, this book will give you all you need as long as you can light charcoal and maintain a well-controlled heat level under your grill.<br />Highly recommended.

Good Technique	There seems to be something about barbecue that turns everyone who writes a book about the subject into the very best expert on the subject. On the cover of `Smoke &amp; Spice', Cheryl and Bill Jamison are touted as `America's Outdoor Cooking Experts'. Of course, similar statements and similar broadsheets of praising blurbs appear on the books of Paul Kirk and Steve Raichlen. The authors go a long way to explaining this phenomenon when they open the first chapter with the statement that `Real Barbecue is bragging food... pitmasters develop into natural boasters'. It is important to note that this book is very serious about `real barbecue', as distinguished from grilling, which is a very different thing. Please note that this review is based on the Second Edition published in 2003 by The Harvard Common Press.<br />As a linguistic purist, I am extremely happy to see that both the Jamison's and Paul Kirk clearly characterize barbecue as a low, steady heat method using hot smoke from wood while grilling is a high heat method where smoke is either incidental or even something to be avoided. The Jamison's even expand the lore of barbecue for me beyond Steve Raichlen's excellent introductory essay in `BBQ USA' when they explain that southeastern (as in North Carolina and Tennessee) pork barbecue and southwestern (as in Texas) beef barbecue arose from two entirely different sources, coalescing around styles developed in Kansas City and Chicago.<br />As much as barbecue experts like to blow their own horn, they also seem much more willing to credit colleagues with contributions to the field. As the Jamisons are mainstream cookbook authors who happen to be experts on barbecue, they cite virtually the entire pantheon of American food writers, including James Beard, James Villas, Robb Walsh, John Thorne, Calvin Trillin, and Chris Schlesinger.<br />All of this babble is primarily to indicate that for barbecue fans, this book is great fun to read, even if you don't even look at the recipes. But, if you do look at the recipes, you will find great sources for barbecue excellence.<br />Part One of the book lays down your barbecue basics, and I strongly recommend that this be read by anyone considering any of these recipes. True barbecue technique is difficult. It may be more difficult to achieve good results as it is to make some of the more arcane creations in the French culinary repertoire. What's worse, it needs equipment that are not standard equipment in an American kitchen, and, it is equipment that MUST be used outdoors. If you do not want to deal with these things, get a book by Bobby Flay and a good grill pan. The authors do briefly discuss stovetop smoking, but assign it a minor role in the world of great barbecue technique.<br />Part Two contains the recipes. The first chapter covers dry rubs, pastes (wet rubs), marinades, and mops. This collection of condiment recipes is not as extensive as the one found in Paul Kirk's `Championship Barbecue' and it does not include recipes for staples like homemade catsup or homemade Worcestershire sauce, but since Kirk's book is about competition and the Jamison's book is not, you will not find too much overlap if you own both.<br />The second chapter of recipes covers the pig. Almost every recipes includes it's own recipe for rub, mop, and other mix. For those of you who harbor any doubts about the commitment needed for barbecue, note that almost every recipe begins with the phrase `The night before you plan to barbecue...'. These recipes require a lot of work. They are the sorts of things the average working American family will be able to manage on maybe a few summer weekends a year. A dedicated barbecue hobbyist will probably manage once or twice a week. The pig chapter owes much to the Carolina style of barbecue and includes recipes for a `Carolina Sandwich Slaw', a `Memphis Mustard Slaw', and spice mixes from New Orleans to Los Angeles. The chapter finishes with recipes for what to do withsuccessfully barbecued shoulder. If you have a good commercial source of barbecue, these recipes alone are worth the price of admission.<br />The third chapter of recipes covers beef. One of the hallmarks of beef barbecue is that it specializes in especially tough cuts of beef such as the brisket, skirt steak, and flank steak as well as ribs. The chapter also covers a fair share of `aftermarket' recipes for hot dogs, hamburger, meat loaf, and hash.<br />If I were ever tempted to do true barbecue, it would probably be to do lamb. The next chapter covers this plus goat, veal and game meat. Mexican goat barbecue or cabrito is a subject all its own, on which Robb Welsh, for one, has written extensively.<br />The next chapter covers chicken and other fowl such as turkey, duck, quail, and pheasant. Chapters on fish and vegetables round out the smoking recipes. Oddly, recipes for sauces which many think are essential to barbecue are placed near the back of the book, including a recipe for a famous catsup precursor. The very last chapter includes a great selection of side dish recipes, including slaws, beans, potatoes, greens, biscuits, cornbread, and muffins.<br />As good as the side dish recipes are, you would probably do as well or better for them with a classic non-barbecue source such as `James Beard's American Cookery' if you were not planning to go the full nine yards with the barbecue technique.<br />Of the three heavyweight barbecue books I have reviewed, this is the best for true home barbecue, but it is not the very best it could be. For as detailed a technique as barbecue is, requiring very specialized equipment, the total absence of pictures is baffling.

Recommended	Celebrity chefs write books oriented towards teaching you important elements of cooking, as with Paul Bertoli's `Cooking by Hand' or Tom Colicchio's `How to Think Like a Chef'; giving you interesting, simple recipes for home cooking as with `Charlie Trotter Cooks at Home' or Guy Savoy's `Simple French Recipes for the Home Cook'; or, like this cookbook by Daniel Boulud, it offers fancy, unusual recipes which can be done at home when entertaining family or friends.<br />Unlike Guy Savoy's book, Boulud makes no pretense that these dishes are simple, and they are not. They are quite as complicated, on average, as the recipes in `Caf&eacute; Boulud Cookbook'. On the other hand, true to it's `at home' orientation, it avoids the more extreme recipes in a book such as `Chef Daniel Boulud: Cooking In New York City'.<br />In the introduction, Boulud makes a small claim to have branched out beyond his roots in French cuisine, but he has not branched very far. Almost all recipes have a French, or at very least, a European style.<br />Since this is a book about entertaining, it is quite appropriate that Boulud includes beverage recommendations from his expert restaurant sommelier Jean Luc Le Du. Credit to Jean Luc for not limiting his suggestions to wines. He is quite willing to recommend beer where it is appropriate, for an accompaniment to hamburgers, for example.<br />Also appropriate to a book on entertaining, the first chapter is devoted to mixed drinks and appetizers. There are five mixed drinks, one of which is non-alcoholic, and all of which appear to be specialities of Boulud's restaurants. If your crowd sticks to Jack Daniels and Scotch, these are a waste of space.<br />I have mixed feelings about the appetizer recipes, as they all require a long to very long list of ingredients, prep time or cooking time. As someone who has made both, blinis and latkes may seem like simple dishes, but they are not something you want to do for a party of eight when you are the only cook. The four tarts appear to require more ingredients, but they have the more novelty value and they are easier to make for six to eight portions than the blinis and latkes, especially if you have a way with piecrust. The carrot and custard tart is especially unusual. If your crowd is packed with foodies, make the artichoke and radicchio clafoutis. The notion of clafoutis alone will fuel conversation for at least an hour, as the name originally applied only to a fruit flan with black cherries. Boulud extends the notion to a sort of savory vegetable tart sans crust. One of the most valuable recipes in the book is the omnibus recipe for four different ways of preparing asparagus. Boulud repeats this technique with other recipes such as his four different ways of making hamburgers. Monsieur Le Duc makes wine recommendations for both artichokes and asparagus without missing a beat. The starters chapter has more recipes than any of the other chapters, and most of the starter dishes could easily serve as a vegetable or starch side to a protein main dish.<br />The chapter of thirteen (13) fish recipes is a very nice mix of relatively simple dishes with cod and sea bass to eye catchers like fancy lobster rolls and Vietnamese spring rolls. The vocabulary word in this chapter is mariniere, usually applied to cooking mussels. Boulud bends the dictionary again by applying the white wine technique to clams, tuna and potatoes.<br />The oddly short chapter on meat, poultry, and side dishes, with a bare seventeen (17) recipes gives some unusual dishes such as Guinea Hen casserole, but almost all of the recipes are souped up versions of well known dishes such as cassolet, lamb stew, duck a la orange, pork tenderloin, and roasted turkey breast. The most interesting recipe in this section is for roasted venison, where making the spice mixture; the marinade, the date sauce, and the garnish together take a lot longer than roasting, then broiling the meat. I would not make this dish for anyone who was not very interested in his or her food.<br />True to the entertaining theme of the book, the dessert chapter has twenty-one (21) recipes, most of that are unusual and challenging, but only two three of which involve yeast doughs. The word for this chapter is chamonix, which is so arcane, it doesn't even appear in my Larousse Gastronomique. Boulud's version is a muffin with lots of `cookie spices' and an orange sauce. Many of the recipes have simple names, such as phyllo apple tart, chocolate cakes, frozen strawberry souffle and chocolate mousse. Trust Boulud to turn each simple idea into a conversation piece. Some familiar desserts are really taken to an entirely different place as with the chocolate and pistachio crepes Suzette. You will be happy to find a very traditional clafoutis recipe with black cherries and hazelnuts.<br />Many recipes are interesting variations on well-known standards. So, like the clafoutis, many dishes will spark a lot of interest if your guests get into talking about the food. Not every dish has a photograph, but those that are photographed are competent and lend some value to understanding the dish. Unfortunately, I suspect some lapse of honesty with some of the photographs, as they do not seem to match the dishes. The kiwi pate photo lacks all trace of the characteristic kiwi green color.<br />Appendices give sources for both unusual foods and cookware. They also include menus for entertaining and seasonal menus. It is beyond me why Boulud could not do `seasonal menus for entertaining', but there you are.<br />If you entertain for people who really appreciate their food and wine, and you are competent in the kitchen, this book is a great resource. Almost all of the recipes require long ingredient list, lots of prep work, and good skills with sauces and custards.who was not very interested in his or her food.<br />True to the entertaining theme of the book, the dessert chapter has twenty-one (21) recipes, most of that are unusual and challenging, but only two three of which involve yeast doughs.

Mostly Simple	I always try to evaluate cookbooks with special attention to the audience to which the book is written. I will not think well of a book which claims to present methods for easy cooking or entertaining if the recipe methods are long or the recipes have a high or expensive ingredient count. I also tend to devalue books that mislead the reader's expectations about the subject or emphasis of the book. On the other hand, I raise the number of stars for any book, regardless of audience, which advances my understanding of cooking. I will also raise my evaluation if the book is entertaining. This book sits on the cusp of these two conflicting influences on my rating.<br />Backed by the star powered Foreword by Patricia Wells, Guy Savoy's title states clearly that the recipes are both simple and designed for the home cook. I suggest that many of the recipes are not very simple and the author's paradigm of the home cook seems to be someone with several hours a day to spend on cooking and shepherding preparations which extend over two or more days. I also get a strong feeling from the ambiance and food styling in the photographs that the `home' environment they picture looks a whole lot like the inside of a professional kitchen. But, there are some redeeming qualities. Let's look at the recipes by chapter.<br />Even in the opening chapter, `Appetizers', the author gives the game away by giving excellent estimates for prep and cooking time. The chapter starts out on the right foot with the first six (6) recipes giving simple vegetable dishes and salads, but things get darker when we hit recipes such as `Sausage en Brioche' and `Pot-au-Feu Salad' where preparation spans two days, with one or more hour of preparation on each day. These two recipes are not isolated examples, although they are at the upper extreme. Over half the recipes have a combined prep and cook time of 90 minutes or more and about a quarter of the recipes need two days. And, like the `Sausage en Brioche', many of these recipes are things like terrines and mousses I would not dream of cooking at home. They remind me of the characterization of French cooking as being designed for people with bad teeth. The appetizer recipes also tend to use ingredients that may not be easy to acquire, even at an American megamart, for a Wednesday evening dinner. Its needing celeriac, cr&egrave;me fraiche, smoked duck magret, and mimolette cheese devalues an otherwise delightful recipe. I know my local Wegmans will have the first three, but I am really not sure of the last. I have a strong feeling that the home cook to which Chef Savoy is writing lives in Paris, although I give the author (or his translator) high marks for Americanizing the measurements. I also found cases where the photographs and the methods clearly disagree. This is very annoying in any book, but doubly so when the photographs should assist in understanding the methods.<br />The chapter `Gratins' goes a long way to winning back my opinion of the book. Unlike appetizers, I have no problem seeing long cooking times for gratins. And, I am especially fond of them for packing an enormous amount of taste and nutritional diversity in a relatively easy package. The author racks up major points by giving an insight into making Mac and Cheese (a simple gratin) by `marinading' cooked pasta in sauce for 24 hours to soak up the sauce. Not really in the same class as a Kraft microwave dish, but well worth a try for some wow effect on Saturday night with dinner guests. There are at least two gratin recipes in this chapter that are alone worth the price of the book (at a reasonable discount).<br />The chapter `Fish' has many good recipes and fish cooking is always pretty fast; however, the choice of fish species, with few recommendations on substitutions tends to spoil the anticipation. The recipes include things like skate, porgy, turbot, and brill, plus trout so fresh that it is impractical to make the dish more than a few yards froma Catskills trout stream.<br />The chapter `Meat' combines recipes for red meat, game, and fowl. Many of the recipes are variations on fairly standard models such as steak tartare, beef stew with carrots, roasted chicken, rabbit stew, chicken shepherd's pie, veal stew, lamb stew, braised veal rump, and braised pork with chestnuts. Like gratins, I am very fond of braising, although I have all the time I need to do the prep and baby-sit dishes in the oven for hours. Most Americans who cook for families do not have this time. They would be better served by a good book on slow cooker recipes.<br />The chapter `Cheese' is short, with some standards and some good ideas spoiled by calling for some unusual cheeses.<br />The chapter `Desserts' is relatively long for the size of a book by a savory chef. If you have no books on desserts, pastries, or baking, this section is an important addition to the value of the book, as it includes both very simple recipes like raspberry clafoutis, poached pears, and rice pudding; some high impact dishes such as crepes with citrus fruit and champagne granite; and some simple classics such as sugar cookies and Madeleines.<br />All recipes are very well written. There are many uncommon recipes and most versions of old standards have an interesting twist. If you have no French cookbooks, you could do worse than this volume. You will not find the kind of cooking insights you will get from Julia Child or Richard Olney or Patricia Wells' book with Joel Robuchon, but you will find good recipes.<br />Recommended for those with the time, especially if you like braises, gratins, and simple desserts.kills trout stream.<br />The chapter `Meat' combines recipes for red meat, game, and fowl.

Recommended	'Italian Easy' authors Rose Gray and Ruth Rogers are two English chefs who seem to carry a lot of weight in the community of writers on Italian Cuisine. They are one of the first employers of Jamie Oliver and were, I suspect, a strong influence on his style and choice of cuisine. In spite of Oliver's great celebrity, Gray and Roger owe nothing to this. Their reputation is firmly based on doing good Italian food before Jamie came to the limelight.  Mario Batali also offers their books as one of his favorite reads for Italian recipes.<br />Creating food that is both easy to prepare and sophisticated in taste and presentation always seems to me to be a chimera. An attempt to put together two things which are simply incompatible. I think Rogers and Gray have succeeded as well as anyone who has put their mind to this task. In their favor is the great pantry available to an Italian cook. Sometimes I think that if you put Parmesano Reggiano, fresh Tuscan olive oil, capers from Panteloria, sliced garlic, and basil from Genoa on shoe leather, it would taste good. It you replace shoe leather with artisinal bread, pasta, shellfish, spinach, or chicken and add tomatoes and anchovies, you basically have the recipes in this book. This is certainly an exaggeration, but not much. I am truly impressed by how simple and easy many of the recipes in this book appear on the page. Like a lot of simple recipes in Patricia Wells' new book 'The Provence Cookbook', they make you wonder how something so simple can taste good. I tried recipes in both books and I can attest that even a simple combination of pasta, broccoli, olive oil, garlic, and pancetta which comes together within 20 minutes, can be really impressive, especially as a dish which gives one both a starch and a vegetable.<br />The same surprisingly short list of ingredients is the norm for most of the recipes. This is not to say there is no variety in the recipes. Just the opposite is true. In the short chapter on ricotta recipes, there are two different Italian specialities based on similar short ingredient lists that are totally unfamiliar to me. The first is 'Gnudi' that may be loosely described as a ricotta gnocchi. There are two recipes, one plain or 'Bianchi' and the other with spinach. The second type of recipe is a ricotta gratin named 'Sformata di ricotta'. The very best aspect of this and many other of these recipes is that it calls for cherry tomatoes which succeed in being reasonably tasty even if they are grown in a hothouse out of season. Another example of a successful mix of novelty and diversity is the chapter of nine potato recipes. Two of the nine are gnocchi, so there is nothing new there, and one is mashed potatoes with nutmeg and parmesan, so there is nothing dramatic there. But the other six recipes make dramatic combinations of potato with fennel, mustard, pumpkin, lemon, and tomato sauce.<br />Speaking of tomato sauce, the book's pantry 'quick tomato sauce' is really quick with four ingredients and about 20 minutes of cooking time for an experienced cook. Compare this to Mario Batali's basic sauce which I find difficult to prep and cook in less than an hour (but then, I'm not the fastest knife in the kitchen).<br />Even dishes which may appear to have involved or difficult recipes such as potato gnocchi or risotto appear simple in Rogers and Gray's words. I think this is a symptom that these recipes are not as daunting as they may seem to the newbie, but it is also a symptom of the fact that Rogers and Gray are writing to people who have some experience in the kitchen. The dozens of helpful little hints you typically get on the 'Molto Mario' show about the technique for heating garlic in oil, for example, are simply not there. There are no tips on peeling fava beans or even a hint that fava beans are naturally double wrapped. There is no babble about terroir or commentary on how the recipes were found or invented. Unlike the 8 year old 'Italian Country Cookbook' there is no consistent use of Italian recipe names with English translations taking a second line role. While many recipes such as potato gnocchi are Italian classics, many others are either highly streamlined versions of Italian classics or they are River Caf? inventions with Italian ingredients and techniques.<br />I really like the many chapters with only a few recipes in some chapters, making it easier than usual to find the nine recipes based on potatoes or the three risotto recipes or the nine truly simple spaghetti recipes. The Brits must be as fond of spaghetti as we colonists. I really dislike the artsy presentation of the dozen bruschetta food photos on one page opposed to the corresponding dozen recipes on the following pages. What WERE these people thinking? Luckily, this nuttiness plays itself out by the time we get to the third chapter, carpaccio and we return to the sanity of recipe and photo on facing pages.<br />This is the first River Caf? cookbook I have reviewed, and I regret my having overlooked them up to now. The authors have truly succeeded in giving straightforward recipes, easy to prepare with readily available (but not necessarily cheap) ingredients.<br />Very highly recommended, especially if you have any taste for Italian food and need fast recipes.

626718:US	39134375	R2IOFH3T1EF50B	1931686807	419952955	Field Guide to Produce: How to Identify, Select, and Prepare Virtually Every Fruit and Vegetable at the Market	Books	5	85	98	N	Y	A Guide Which Accomplishes its Objectives. Recommended	I generally expect to find one or more deficiencies in small guides like this volume from Aliza Green, so I was not surprised to find some. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the book also covered a lot more ground than I expected.<br />The first positive aspect of the book is the title, `Field Guide to PRODUCE'. It would have been easy and misleading to say it was a guide to fruits and vegetables, when many items in the book such as chestnuts and mushrooms are neither fruits nor vegetables. The book should have taken this positive title one step further and not divided entries up into fruits and vegetables. As I said, chestnuts and mushrooms are neither, and other products such as tomatoes are classified under their commercial category of vegetable instead of their botanical category of fruit.<br />The next positive aspect of the book is that the only product I could not find in either a primary entry such as `cabbage' or as an entry type such as `Brussels Sprouts' was the truffle. I will forgive them this omission, as it is the rare megamart that even carries truffles. On the other hand, the book did include such rarities as durian, loquat, and mung beans (although I thought the coverage of mung beans could have been a bit better).<br />Another positive aspect is that for produce such as apples, pears, cabbage, and tomatoes, several major cultivars are cited, with the best uses for each given.<br />The single biggest use for this book would probably be to find out when produce is in season, how to choose the best specimens, how to clean them, and how to store them. I will not be searching this book for the best fruits for a particular dish, although I may refer to the properties of apples to pick the best variety for a tart. On this subject, the book is excellent. It tends to be very conservative in specifying storage times. It gives apples about two weeks in a refrigerated produce drawer, while I have successfully kept some there for two months with little degradation.<br />Another use may possibly be to help identify a particular item in the grocery store. I often run across tamarind in South Asian recipes, but I would be hard pressed to describe exactly what it looks like, and most written descriptions really don't seem to hit the mark. A picture here is truly worth a thousand words. For this reason, there is probably a virtue in bringing all photographs together in a single section rather than having them accompany the article of the product. Another reason is probably because this was cheaper to publish.<br />Useful aspects of many articles are things like the climates in which the plants flourish, the land in which the product was first cultivated, the origin of `manmade' products such as grapefruit (from orange and pomelo), the scientific name, and best uses for products. I am constantly amazed at how many of our most commonly used fruits and vegetables originated in or near the Fertile Crescent formed by the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Several alternate names like `aubergine' for eggplant are given; however, the author would have made this feature immensely more useful by including the alternate names in the index. Great help for people scratching their heads over `rocket' in Italian salads.<br />One `expected oversight' is the absence of cross-reference entries. Brussels Sprouts, for example is in the index, pointing to a paragraph in the article about cabbage, but there is no entry for `Brussels Sprouts, See Cabbage' in the main text. Broccoli and Cauliflower are derived from cabbage and even have the same scientific name, yet they get their own articles. This rant is probably due entirely due to my fondness for Brussels Sprouts, so you can take it with a grain of salt. Missed opportunities are the absence of a tabular presentation of produce seasons and tables of uses versus varieties for major families of products such as apples, pears, cabbage, oranges, and tomatoes. A fun feature, albeit somewhat difficult to accomplish may have been a table or `tree' of food preparation techniques with most useful products.<br />I could add more nice things to see, but most of these would lead to a full-sized volume, loosing the utility of the `field guide' size.<br />This is a better than average book of its type. If you need something to make the best of finding, selecting, cleaning, and storing produce, this is your book. It will also help you pick the best apple for the pie and the best potato for your salad.t to accomplish may have been a table or `tree' of food preparation techniques with most useful products.<br />I could add more nice things to see, but most of these would lead to a full-sized volume, loosing the utility of the `field guide' size.<br />This is a better than average book of its type.

Like Barbara Kafka, she is a student of the great James Beard, and quotes his opinions often in this book. She is the most recent editor of `The Fannie Farmer Cookbook', a position she obtained on the recommendation of James Beard. For all of these reasons, this book is a disappointment.<br />The book does not disappoint because the recipes are poor. In fact, they are all both good and simple. One would expect nothing less from a cookbook published by Alfred A. Knopf and edited by that most famous cookbook editor, Judith Jones. One Knopf trademark is an very attractively designed artwork all wrapped up in an exceptionally pleasing cover, all for a modest list price of $22.50.<br />The disappointment is in the failure to fulfill the premise of the book embodied in the very clear title. One expects recipes that are simply not made anymore, and we are poorer for their neglect. The fact is, almost every recipe in the book is alive and well, thank you.<br />In the chapter on soups, Gazpacho, Vichyssoise, Corn Chowder, Seafood Stew, and Ham and Bean Soup are present in more cookbooks than I care to mention, and I make three out of five of these soups more than once each year. I just recently ran across a recipe for Mulligatawny Soup in a new cookbook. Of the 19 soups, only Oatmeal Soup is totally new to me.<br />In the chapter on breads, I commonly make Boston Brown Bread from a James Beard recipe. Jim Villas has just published a whole book on biscuits, Martha Stewart features Monkey Bread on one of her programs, and sticky buns are in virtually every book on baking that I own. Out of 16 recipes, one or two such as `salt rising bread' seem a bit unusual.<br />In the chapter on vegetables, I have recently made colcannon and scalloped potatoes. Candied carrots were featured in a recent issue of `Saveur'. I have done onions as a side dish on several occasions. The Vegetable cobbler may be new to most, but this is only one out of 16 recipes.<br />In `Yesterday's Side Dish', it seems almost a joke to call Spanish Rice, Pilaf, Fried Rice, and Vegetable Frittata `lost recipes'. It's true that Welsh Rabbit and Yorkshire Pudding are not made as often as they may once have been, but I often run across both in new cookbooks.<br />In `One Dish Meals', I am surprised to find the New England Boiled Dinner, as John Thorne recently did a rather long essay on this dish. I am doubly surprised at the appearance of Meatloaf, as Jim Villas devoted a whole chapter to this dish in his recent book of columns, `Stalking the Green Fairy'. I am truly tired of seeing Food Network recipes for Shepherd's Pie and Stuffed Cabbage Rolls.<br />In `Real Salads', I am surprised to find Coleslaw with Boiled Dressing, as this is my favorite type of slaw, based on a James Beard recipe. I also often make Potato Salad, Waldorf Salad, and Salad Nicoise. I have even recently made Green Goddess dressing.<br />Some may claim that I am missing the point, especially since I am certainly not typical. I have all the time I need to shop and cook, while most people do not. This is why I cited some published sources for many of these examples, to show the weakness in the book's premise is not simply based on my experience. Some may argue that the true meaning of `Lost Recipes' is not that this excellent recipe is no longer being prepared. In fact, the author's introduction tends toward that interpretation when she states surveys of between 30% and 40% of American families actually cook at home. The fact is, I simply do not believe these statistics and I believe they are trotted out to provide a justification for a weak book premise.<br />In the total absence of any documentation, my first basis for skepticism is the cost of eating out. A family of four can eat a good meal at home for three dollarsa head. A far less nutritious meal out probably averages twice that. I concede this figure probably puts people using frozen or deli-prepared convenience foods eaten at home in the `not home cooked' category, but this leads to another objection to this book. My second basis for skepticism is the great popularity of cooking shows on both the Food Network and PBS.<br />Even if neither of these arguments hold water, the book still does not hit its mark, as it is no solution to family meal providers who are pressed for time. If the object is to draw more people into home cooking, what you need is something like Rachael Ray's approach of fast meals from common ingredients. Coleslaw with Boiled Dressing is great, but it takes a long time to make and it is dangerous outside the fridge for very long, as it contains raw eggs.<br />Marion Cunningham is a very good, very important cookbook author, but I think this book is misguided. A new, paperback edition of `The Fanny Farmer Cookbook' would have far more effectively served the object of the book with highlights on fast and on neglected recipes. Buy `Fanny Farmer' and give this book a pass.<br />If you get the book as a gift, don't take it to the church bazaar. It has good recipes and will look very nice on your bookshelf. It is a perfect refutation of the books premise when another reviewer says this book gives her all her favorite recipes in one place.a head.

629352:US	39134375	R1BFP9G3AFK2LO	1580085733	572643326	The Village Baker's Wife: The Desserts and Pastries That Made Gayle's Bakery Famous	Books	5	37	42	N	Y	Very Highly Recommended Instruction on Pastry	This book spawns the germ of an idea that the American Renaissance in appreciation of food first sprouted in the soil of the mid 1970s from a seed planted in the hippie counterculture movement of the sixties. Gayle's bakery was founded in 1978 by a housepainter and an amateur, self-taught baker who did Summer replacement work for Lindsey Shere, the co-owner and pastry chef at Chez Panisse, the holiest shrine of new American food, which was itself started in the mid-1970s. But enough idle speculation.<br />Like Nancy Silverton's books on the products of the La Brea bakery in LA, most recipes in this book are of goods baked daily at Gayle's bakery in a very small town, Capitolana, a few dozen miles south of San Francisco. Also like Nancy Silverton, Gayle and Joe Ortiz and Louisa Beers have given us much more than a simple book of pastry recipes. In many ways, this book is what Nick Malgieri's book `How to Bake' is not. While Malgieri's book has lots of very good recipes, many of which I use on a regular basis, it simply does not have the depth of instruction in both simple and sophisticated techniques present in abundance in `The Village Baker's Wife'. This is not the very best book on baking I have reviewed. That honor is reserved for `Sherry Yard's great book `The Secrets of Baking'. In addition to great instruction and recipes, the Ortiz add sketches of many great bakers who influenced their career, such as Lindsey Shere, Pierre Herme, Flo Braker, and others.<br />One hallmark of French sophistication in the culinary world is the way they separate boulangerie (bread making shop) and patisserie (pastry shop). From an earlier book by Joe Ortiz, it is apparent that Gayle's bakery does both bread and pastry, but this book is all about pastry, including some products like croissants and brioche which may seem like breads, but which the French do in the patisserie. And, the whole style of Gayle's products are based in the French rather than Austrian or Italian tradition. In fact, with everything the book says about croissants, I am sad that it did not point out that croissants were invented in Vienna, not Paris.<br />This book is almost entirely about technique. It does not go into great depth about the details of ingredients or explanations of technique like Rose Levy Beranbaum's bibles. It does not go into deep reasons and skillfully crafted master recipes like Sherry Yard's `The Secrets of Baking'. It really concentrates on explaining the HOW of some of pastry's most difficult tasks. They take a scant 24 introductory pages to cover advice on general techniques and equipment. I second the author's warning. Do not skip this chapter! My only argument with this chapter is the fact that it recommends salted rather than unsalted butter, where virtually every other important cookbook in English recommends unsalted butter.<br />Butter is the unquestioned star of the first half of the chapters on recipes. The nine recipe groupings are:<br />Croissant - 28 pages devoted to France's favorite morning sweet bite. The techniques include making croissant dough from a levain (sourdough starter) plus lots of recipes for basic croissants, croissants with sweet fillings, and croissant-like goods. Croissant dough is made much like puff pastry, except it has only about 1/10 the number of folds and layers as true puff pastry.<br />Danish Pastry - Another type of dough based heavily on the proper application of butter. All the familiar Danish style recipes are here, including bear claws, braids, and rings.<br />Puff Pastry - Yes, this book tells you how to make puff pastry from scratch, along with lots of applications, especially the most famous such as Napoleons, turnovers, cheese sticks, and palm leaves.<br />Pies and Tarts - This is the last of the great quartet of chapters on butter doughs, and the subject which is probably most familiar to most American amateur bakers. I am both surprised and pleased that the author's basic pie dough is simpler than the one I got from Susan Purdy's book `As Easy as Pie'. It leaves out the vinegar and egg yolk and does it all with just water, all-purpose flour, and butter. All our favorite pies are here, but the star of the show is the instruction on how to make a good crust, including when and how to blind bake the crust.<br />Cookies - Probably not as useful as the first four chapters, unless you simply have no other source for cookie recipes. Many classics are here, but not all.<br />Muffins, Cream Puffs, and Other Bakery Goodies is most interesting for the recipes using Pate a choux.<br />Cakes, Icings, and Decorations has important sections on instruction. Its most valuable recipes are for the genoise and petits fours. Also good recipes for icings, cheesecakes, and tiramisu.<br />Gayle at Home - Things they don't sell at the bakery with lots of fruit.<br />Holiday and Other Festive Desserts - The brioche chapter, plus yummy sourdough pastries and others.<br />The end of the book has a better than average listing of ingredient and equipment sources.<br />If you make not a single recipe from this book, you will still enjoy it for the insight and information into great baking. If you simply want good cookie and pie recipes, you will get a nice selection here. But, the real payoff in this book is the techniques for butter doughs for croissants, Danish, and puff pastry. This book and a fond memory for the days of `The Whole Earth Catalogue' can come dangerously close to turning you into a baker.<br />A bit steep for a novice, but highly recommended for a wide range of interests.han the one I got from Susan Purdy's book `As Easy as Pie'.

630025:US	39134375	RRF1VHZRXD34F	1862055491	76850290	The Savoy Cookbook	Books	3	13	14	N	N	Good Famous Restaurant Book. Not much else	Anton Edelmann's `The Savoy Cookbook' is a celebrity restaurant coffee table book which must be judged on merits relevant to its type rather than being judged by the same criteria as a regional cookbook or a social group fundraising cookbook or a teaching cookbook or an `everything you will ever need cookbook, or even a celebrity chef cookbook like those from Jeremiah Tower or Paul Bertolli, for example.<br />The criteria I deem distinctive of the `celebrity restaurant showbook' are:<br />Very effective pictures of food, building, and `cooks at work'.<br />A good story of the origins of the restaurant, its cuisine, and it's successes.<br />Interesting recipes, easily understandable by the amateur cook, in principle reproducible by same. At least some recipes should be practical for the home cook while retaining the `wow' factor the dish achieves in its very posh venue.<br />Facts which set this venue apart from all similar restaurants.<br />Success with these four criteria will get you four stars. To get five stars like `The French Laundry Cookbook' or `The Zuni Caf&eacute; Cookbook' requires that the author(s) transcend these criteria and give us something special in either great `do at home' recipes or even greater insights into the nature of great professional cooking.<br />There is also a criterion that is difficult to state clearly. This may be characterized as a `visceral' reaction to the whole package. Satisfying this criteria means that you come away from the book satisfied with a genuine interest in visiting this venue. The things that contribute to this feeling are often a modest, respectful attitude toward the reader and the restaurant's accomplishments and the effectiveness with which the experience at the venue is conveyed through words and pictures. It is difficult to get past three stars without this feeling.<br />In spite of some weaknesses in the more easily quantifiable criteria, this book hits the visceral target. I really wanted to stay at the Savoy Hotel in London, eat its food, and order room service there at 2 AM after a night at the theatre. Part of what promotes this interest is the unusual venue. The Savoy is not a single restaurant. Rather it is a very large group of kitchens with a very large staff serving three different restaurants, a very large banquet hall, many private dining rooms, and 24 hour a day room service to a large hotel. Another part of the interest is that the very first Maitre Chef des Cuisine at the Savoy was Auguste Escoffier, the legendary chef and codifier of modern French restaurant practice and the inventor of many famous dishes.<br />The other side of the coin is that the book simply does not succeed on some of the easy stuff. I give the book high marks for modestly telling an interesting story of the hotel and its food venues. I also give the book passing grades on its food photography and styling. The largely black and white photographs are a waste of space. Much is said about the art deco design of the hotel, with not one single photograph to demonstrate this. Much is said about the d&eacute;cor of some famous private rooms. Not one photograph of said private rooms. What photographs there are have no captions. They are eye candy with artificial sweetener.<br />The recipes are very well written, with one technical and one practical weakness. The technical weakness is in the excellent practice of giving all measurements in both metric and English units. The problem is that many of the conversions from one unit to the other are grossly inaccurate. Some conversions are off by almost 20%, where, for example one cup (245 milliliters on my Corning measuring cup) is translated into 200 milliliters. Almost all weight and volume measurements are off by 5 to 15 percent. The practical weakness is in the use of hard to find ingredients such as quail eggs and French melons. I really don't hold this against the book too much, as I believe that truly doable recipes is not what these booksare all about.<br />I did pay special attention to the preparations I always use to judge a cookbook. Applicable recipes for this book were the omelet, the crepe, brioche, pasta dish, and chicken stock. In all cases, the level of detail is simply not suitable for instruction to an amateur. The book essentially assumes you already know how to make these things, especially the omelet. The brioche recipe probably works well in the hands of a professional chef, but it breaks several rules given by people who are truly teaching their readers how to make brioche. The crepe recipe is also much more suitable to a professional kitchen than the home kitchen as it skips some traditional steps and gives no hints about forgiving a bad first crepe.<br />I do think there are recipes here that a skilled amateur can successfully reproduce for entertaining. There are virtually no dishes here aside from a few of the breakfast dishes that would be at home on the family dining table.<br />If you are a collector of restaurant cookbooks, this is better than average, but not as good as the best. For those people I give it four stars. My official rating must be only three stars, though, since I wish to warn people that while this book contains recipes for exceptional dishes, these dishes are not meant for your daily meal, or even the Saturday night or Sunday afternoon family meal. And, the book gives little insight into professional cooking. In my heart it gets four stars. My head gives it only three./>I did pay special attention to the preparations I always use to judge a cookbook.

631527:US	39134375	RCD72PKMDG2BA	1558322426	641652602	Paul Kirk's Championship Barbecue: Barbecue Your Way to Greatness With 575 Lip-Smackin' Recipes from the Baron of Barbecue	Books	5	76	84	N	N	Very Good Competition Barbecue Manual.	A few days ago, I interviewed a thin, oversized book entitled `The Big Grill' published by a minor, undistinguished publishing house. The book had all the look about it of a volume destined to go directly from the publisher to the discount stacks, and I found nothing in the book which changed that opinion. The only puzzling aspect of the book is that the thumbnail biography of the author on the back jacket listed some very serious credentials for the author, Paul Kirk. By chance, I soon ran across this volume by the same Paul Kirk, published by the very serious Harvard Common Press, with very high powered blurbs on the back jacket from the likes of John Thorne and Tony Bourdain, plus several luminary barbecue restaurateurs. Like the case with my poor review of one of Nigella Lawson's lesser efforts, I was anxious to find a genuine source for all this admiration. Therefore, I do this review of a book that is dramatically different and better than `The Big Grill' potboiler.<br />A superficial look at the size and the cover of `Championship Barbecue' may give you the impression that the book is similar to Steve Raichlen's encyclopedic collections of barbecue recipes. While Raichlen's excellent `BBQ USA' gives a great history of the subject and a thorough collection of recipes from around the country, Kirk's `Championship Barbecue' is almost entirely the story of how to participate in and win barbecue contests, a skill he seems to have mastered early and excelled in often.<br />The very first thing which struck me about Kirk's description of what it takes to win at a barbecue contest is how similar it is to lessons learned by traditional chefs doing haute cuisine. Kirk repeats the mantra told by everyone from Daniel Boulud to Paul Robuchon that a lot of the secret comes from practice and attention to details. This is why he can freely teach people his recipes and techniques with little fear that it will give them the means to beat him at the next competition. To have even the smallest chance of matching Kirk's performance requires years of practice and experience, plus the stamina and discipline to check a smoker every 90 minutes overnight, thereby giving up a perfectly good night's sleep in order to insure 16 to 24 hours of smoking at a consistent temperature.<br />The only thing Kirk does not tell us is the recipe for his latest rubs and sauces, as he changes them for each year's competition. He is more than generous in telling us just about everything else. The book starts with three chapters, about fifty pages, on competition planning, equipment, rules, and preparation before he even gets to the recipes. The next hundred pages cover pantry preparations such as marinades, mops, sops, slathers, seasonings, rubs, sauces, salsas, relishes, and dipping sauces. Some recipes are borrowed (or stolen) from friends, but most are the author's own creations. My favorite recipes were for the most basic staples such as catsup, tomato paste, and Worcestershire sauce. The chapters where recipes cover completed dishes are:<br />Hog Heaven begins with a long essay on pork primals, brines, woods, whole hog smoking, and the recipes. While Kirk is based in Kansas, which is beef country, most big competitions have pork contests and some of the biggest contests such as the Memphis in May invitational are all pork. Note that Kirk is crystal clear on the difference between barbecue and grilling and he includes a lot of grill recipes which correctly are fast cooking over high heat, while barbecue is slow cooking with smoke over indirect heat.<br />Steer Crazy covers beef recipes, both for barbecue and grilling. Some recipes include veal and sweetbreads, but the main attractions are burgers, kabobs, sirloin, strips, filets, ribeye, and brisket. At the beginning of the chapter, Kirk clearly indicates which cuts are best for grilling and which cuts are best for `cue and which cuts can go both ways.<br />Lamb and Cabrito covers lamb and goat cookery. Cabrito is a method of roasting a whole goat that originated in Mexico. Lamb recipes cover Greek, Lebanese, Japanese, Indian, Caribbean, Tex-Mex, Hawaiian, French, and plain old barbecue.<br />Putting on the Dog covers all things you can stuff into a pig's intestines, otherwise known as sausage. It includes kielbasa, chourico, andouille, Italian, Texas Hill sausage, bratwurst, lamb, gyro, apple, and venison, oh my.<br />Plentiful Poultry covers birds, including burgers, wings, jerk, grilled, smoked, fajitas, quesadillas, Cornish, turkey, duck, dove, and quail.<br />Smokin' with the Fishes covers fillets, lots of catfish, grouper, mackerel, lots of salmon, lots of swordfish, lots of tuna, crabs, lobster, oysters, octopus, shrimp, and squid. Most recipes for fish are for the grill, but there are some smoker recipes for some of the firmer fish and game fish such as mackerel, salmon, and trout.<br />On the side is... sides dishes, mostly salads, casseroles, and bakes with potatoes, macaroni, and beans. Southern and Yankee cornbread and hoe cakes round out the list. I am really surprised to discover here that it is the Yankee, not the Southern cornbread that contains the sugar.<br />The book ends with an excellent section on sources for grills, spices, wood, and charcoal. Early in the book, there are also contacts for the three major barbecue competition certifying organizations. Be very clear that this book is great even if you never take the first step towards entering a barbecue competition. What makes great competition barbecue will make great home barbecue.<br />With two big caveats, almost all the recipes are pretty simple. The first gotcha is that a grill or smoker setup, even with Kingsford briquettes can be a pretty big chore, especially if outdoor space is tight.

632280:US	39134375	R37YT0QXM6V2TM	1582432783	785651575	Are You Really Going to Eat That?	Books	5	11	14	N	N	Literary amuse bouche. Very tasty. Highly recommended.	Among other things, this book demonstrates that chef / author Tony Bourdain's persona as literary tourist to some truly bizarre culinary experiences reported in the book and TV show `A Cooks Tour' is not only not entirely original, but not necessarily the best of the genre. Culinary `Thrill Seeker' and Journalist Robb Walsh has been there and done that, hitting many sites and smells and tastes chef Bourdain has not yet experienced.<br />To be fair to Tony, Bourdain and Walsh are not doing exactly the same thing. Walsh's reporting lies somewhere between the `New Yorker' detached style of Calvin Trillin who is most interested in placing the reader in the place and time being reported and the gonzo participatory journalism of Bourdain which owe's a lot more of its style to Hunter Thompson than it does to the `New Yorker' or even to the `good feeling' reporting style of Food Network travelogues.<br />Witness a comparison between Bourdain's reporting on a visit to Thomas Keller's The French Laundry, arguably the best restaurant in this country with Walsh's reporting on a visit to `The Best Restaurant in the World', the restaurant of Ferdy Girardet in Switzerland. Walsh's piece is a quiet recitation of his solo meal eaten under the guidance of chef Girardet, followed by observations of the chef and a brief interview. All of this focuses on Girardet's vision of a meal at his restaurant being not unlike a visit to a museum where guests simply experience the artist's work without being given any real opportunity to tailor the experience to their own tastes. Bourdain's chapter is like a chronicle of planning for and executing the invasion of Normandy. Bourdain assumes the role of the timid supplicant at the alter of the renowned French Laundry, padding his request for an audience with a supporting cast of culinary stars such as Eric Rippert, Scott Bryan, and Michael Ruhlman, a literary collaborator with both Rippert and Keller. Keller never makes an appearance in the piece, leaving his food to speak to the communicants.<br />Both Bourdain and Walsh are entertaining, and both represent the left wing of culinary journalism to James Villas' right wing and Calvin Trillin's centrist position. I confess Bourdain evokes more chuckles, but Walsh, in a very cramped format, may bring more information per page to his readers.<br />Almost all of Robb Walsh's pieces in this book are reprinted columns and articles from newspapers and fairly light journals that can only support relatively short pieces of writing. Many of the articles remind me of Jeff Goldblum's line in `The Big Chill' where he describes his writing for `People' magazine as being articles which the average reader can complete during a session in the crapper.<br />All of this talk about `like him' and `not like him' is simply done to convey to you, dear reader, the fact that while Walsh may not be as well known as Bourdain or Trillin or Villas or John Thorne, he is equally as entertaining and equally as informative as all of these other culinary literati, but in his own special way.<br />Many of his articles cover familiar ground, such as the article on the search for Perigord truffles, but like Mort Rosenblum, another talented culinary journalist, he always seems to unearth interesting angles on his subject. One surprise on the truffle front, for example, is that some agronomists have actually been successful in creating an environment for truffles to grow in the United States.<br />Another very familiar (to me) subject is Alsatian Choucroute, the French term for Sauerkraut, which Walsh explores in a largely unsuccessful search for the best sauerkraut in Alsace and his final success at a small restaurant, `Le Cerf' in a little town outside Strasbourg. Walsh also covers many unfamiliar subjects such as cabrito, a method for cooking goat in Mexico and durian, a Southeast Asian fruit with the olfactory impact of overripe Limburger cheese topped with a spoiled egg.<br />The very best thing I can say about Walsh's writing is that each of his articles leaves me wanting more information. That may also be the worst thing I can say about them as well, as the articles are typically so short, they just don't seem to fill you up. But, an amuse bouche is no less delicious for being small.<br />Very highly recommended standing beside other leading culinary journalists.g I can say about Walsh's writing is that each of his articles leaves me wanting more information.

632851:US	39134375	R2M2UBA3R2W9UY	0688157920	140651882	Microwave Gourmet	Books	5	79	83	N	N	Exceptionally Good Reference for Kitchen Fixture	I make a point of distrusting blurbs by friendly (and probably compensated) colleagues and self-congratulatory comments on the covers of all books, especially cookbooks, where the criteria for quality are often a lot more objective than for fiction, memoirs, or criticism, for example. In rare cases, an especially strong or unexpected blurb can turn my head. With this book, the combination of distinguished cookbook author Barbara Kafka and front cover blurb source Maida Heatter combined with the very prosaic subject of the microwave has definitely turned my head. Ms. Heatter says `Don't even think about using a microwave without Microwave Gourmet'. Maida Heatter is rarely wrong about anything.<br />The microwave seems to be the iceberg lettuce of kitchen appliances. It is the device that many culinary writer / TV hosts love to malign, or at least ignore. Sara Moulton seems proud of the fact that she does not even own one. The microwave so prominently visible on Rachael Ray's set of '30 Minute Meals' rarely gets any use. Gadget king Alton Brown has, in about sixty shows I have seen, used it but once or twice. He at least did us the favor of explaining how it works on one occasion.<br />Some prominent culinary author whose name escapes me at the moment has said the microwave is good for melting chocolate, baking potatoes, and cooking bacon, and that's about it. That statement actually did me a favor, as I didn't even give it credit for doing those things. I regularly do baked potatoes and bacon in the microwave now. On the other hand, I have had a long history of failures and accidents with using my microwave, all entirely due to my misunderstanding its capabilities and limits. Using it to soften butter often leads to greasy messes. Using it to defrost chicken often leads to frozen breasts with toasted edges. Using it to roast garlic leads to dry, useless cloves. Even my successes with the microwave such as a really very nice catfish stew from Shirley King's book `Fish The Basics' end up being something of a nuisance, as they involve constantly opening and closing the microwave and pealing back the plastic wrap to stir and add ingredients.<br />Barbara Kafka has done us all the service of eliminating any excuses for microwave mishaps. I strongly agree with Ms. Heatter's advice and the subtitle claiming that this is the only microwave cookbook you will ever need.<br />In the opening chapter `The Oven', Kafka explains how a microwave works and all the whys and therefores about what works and what doesn't work and what kind of machine you should buy. She especially agrees with Alton Brown that a microwave without a rotating plate should be donated to the Smithsonian. All the little details of working with microwave dishes and plastic wrap are explained with excellent line drawings. The serious, detailed instructions continue in the `Microwave Basics' chapter. One of the most important lessons in this chapter is the explanation that special consideration has to be given to multiplying quantities in recipes, and Kafka explains why this is true, based largely on the fact that microwaves work to a much greater extent on asymmetrical molecules like water and proteins than they do on symmetrical or non-polarized molecules such as fats. The remaining chapters are:<br />First Courses, especially preparation of cold, make ahead salads, pates, and cooked vegetables.<br />Soups, one of Kafka's specialities, as she has written a complete book on the subject.<br />Good Grains, Pasta & ... especially rice. The risotto recipes reveal one of the true difficulties of microwave cookery. This is the need to often open and close the door and restart the oven. On the plus side, the microwave does give especially good control of these operations with the built-in timer.<br />Fish and Seafood This is where the microwave shines, as both fin fish and shellfish cook very quickly, especially in the microwave.<br />Fair is Fowl No surprise here that the most successful microwave cooking methods for chicken are poaching and braising, as neither depend on browning for their appeal. If browning is needed, the recipes typically call the broiler into service.<br />Mainly Meat opens by entering the very rocky territory of chili recipes. Ms. Kafka's recipe is very toney, as it calls for cubing beef and including a bit of chocolate. Very Aztec. Traditional daube recipes contribute much here, as the method specifically prepared red meat without browning.<br />Vegetables are a natural for the microwave since they cook so well in water, steam, or water-based sauces. They are doubly applicable to frozen vegetables. Broccoli is a feature in this chapter, as the author takes if from simple to complex recipes.<br />Savory Basics covers something I would never have thought of connecting with microwave cooking. This basically gives you techniques for making small quantities of broths, stocks, and funets quickly with a microwave. Other cooking staples such as roux, duxelles, and infused oils are covered as well. The article on breadcrumbs turns a generally nasty microwave property of drying food into a virtue.<br />Desserts, especially based on poached fruit, are done here. Chocolate and caramels are also prominent.<br />Jams & ... covers many common pantry preparations with fruits and pickling.<br />The best section in this overall very good book is the `Dictionary of Foods and Techniques'. It is the section to which I refer whenever I crack the microwave for anything except heating water. It will give me comforting reassurance when I do bacon and good estimates of cooking times for all sorts of fruits and vegetables.<br />There is no question that microwave cookery cannot do everything and it can do some things not as well as conventional cookery, but it has its place.

634877:US	39134375	R1F22RIQ5460WR	0375507353	785402298	Gourmet's Casual Entertaining: Easy Year-round Menus for Family and Friends	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Very Good Recipes. Very Misleading Concept	This `Gourmet' magazine produced volume on `Casual Entertaining' has been produced by a staff almost large enough to have produced `The Lord of the Rings', with the role of director Peter Jackson being played by the very distinguished editor in chief Ruth Reichl plus a staff of dozens from `Gourmet Magazine', `Gourmet Books',  `Conde Nast books, jaBS MEDIA and probably a few dozen more unsung laborers from Random House. The irony of dedicating these battalions to publishing a 200-page book is not lost on the anonymous copywriter responsible for the acknowledgments. In all the activity by all these people, no one person is identified as the author. The best the publishers could do is to associate various `Gourmet' food editors with various chapters plus a credit to the wine editor's contribution of wine selections. All this chatter about the number of contributors to this volume is simply to highlight that after all this effort, the book does not succeed in attaining it's subtitled objective of `Easy Year-Round Menus for Family and Friends'.<br />Other reviewers have commented on this fact, but I was willing to give the good folks at Gourmet the benefit of the doubt, since the main title of the book is Casual ENTERTAINING, and one certainly does go a little out of the way when feeding guests.<br />The five chapters with about seven menus per chapter and five or six recipes per menu are entitled `Easy Saturday Nights', `Lazy Sundays', `Easy Celebrations', `Easy Grills', and `Easy Picnics'. It certainly seems to me like they had `easy' recipes in mind when they created the concept for this book.<br />Almost every recipe by itself is, indeed, fairly straightforward. The number of ingredients per recipe rarely exceeds nine and the very clearly written procedures rarely exceed three short paragraphs. As usual, the most detailed preparations are for the desserts, where special instructions are often needed to prepare something that can be prepared and refrigerated or frozen days in advance of the relaxing day of entertaining. As I noted above, the recipes are all written in an exceptionally clear manner, with each distinct step being put in its own paragraph with a clear emboldened verb at the start to make clear what it is that is being done. I would expect nothing less from the staff of Gourmet Magazine. Wherever appropriate, the recipe's `Cook's Notes' specify how far in advance the recipe can be made.<br />I think it is fair to say that many recipes are for dishes that fit casual situations. There are a lot of dips, finger foods, satays, salads, shish ka-bobs, and what have you. Even the somewhat toney dishes such as baked eggs in brioches allows that you will not make the brioche yourself, but buy it from you neighboring Boulangerie. One problem is that while you may not have any problem finding brioches in NYC, out here in the hinterlands, I have a problem finding any baker who even knows what brioche is, let alone being able to sell me some.<br />Scattered throughout the book are general suggestions on entertaining, but taken all together, they certainly do not constitute a tutorial on entertaining, such as what you will find in Martha Stewart's classic book `Entertaining'.<br />If you consider the source of this volume, a magazine named `Gourmet', you should really expect pretty toney content, and that is what you get in these menus. Each recipe taken individually is fairly straightforward, but all the recipes taken together plus classy wine recommendation requires a fairly sizable grocery bill and some pretty adept hands in the kitchen. This is much, much more work per menu than what you will find in an article in `Parade' or `Better Homes and Gardens'. So, the question to you dear reader, is how often you will refer to this book to do all or most of a set piece menu. This book is simply trying to meet two incompatible objectives, simplicity and flash.<br />For purely family entertaining, I found Sheila Lukins book `Celebrate' much more useful. Somewhat less complete but also good is `The Family Table' by Christy Rost. For really easy entertaining, see Rachael Ray's `Gettogethers' or any of Rachael Ray's `Thirty Minute Meals' books for that matter. Patricia Weir's `Cooking in the City' is a good resource for high end entertaining without breaking the budget.<br />This volume would be more valuable if there were a complete table of recipes by course. The index is pretty good, but it is no substitute for a complete list of recipes.<br />There are books I would not even buy if they were on the steeply discounted stacks. I would consider this if it were available for less than nine dollars.e' much more useful. Somewhat less complete but also good is `The Family Table' by Christy Rost.

Recommended	I think I would enjoy a book from Chris Schlesinger and Doc Willoughby on just about any culinary subject, based on their excellent `How to Cook Meat' and even more so on this tasty little book `Quick Pickles' on what may loosely be described as refrigerator pickles, as no heat-based preservation techniques are involved. I should note that while Schlesinger and Willoughby are certainly the big names on this briny marquee, the third author, Dan George, is probably the most important contributor of content. George is a lawyer by training, but his real passion and skill is in cooking, especially in cooking pickles. In addition to his role as a litigator, he is billed as the `pickle chef' for Schlesinger's restaurant `Back Eddy' in Westport, Massachusetts where pickled this, that, and the other thing are a big feature of the cuisine. What this means is that this book is not the result of Schlesinger and Willoughby's wanting to make a fast buck by attaching their name to a book about a subject on which they have no expertise.<br />As revealed in the introduction, pickling, at least some of the most traditional pickling techniques, belongs to two venerable culinary traditions.<br />The first and more important theme is that of methods used to preserve food before the advent of mechanical refrigeration. In this vein, pickling vegetables joins curing meats with salt and preserving foods by drying as a means of retarding spoilage by bacteria. That most of these techniques are still in use is a testament to the fact that they are also methods for enhancing flavor by removing water and adding salt or vinegar or both to the food.<br />The second theme is that as a method for preparing foods, pickling is in the same class of techniques as the baking of artisinal breads, beer making, vinegar making, and cheesemaking. All these techniques involve fermentation of sugars or starches into alcohol or acetic acid by the action of yeasts or other microorganisms. This means that in spite of the title `Quick Pickles', pickling procedures simply proceed at a much slower pace than a roast, sautee, braise, or even a marinade. Some recipes may take hours, but others, especially those involve fermentation often need days.<br />One big surprise is in the number of different pickling subjects and methods. There is a lot more here than dill pickles and Kimchee. The chapters of recipes are:<br />Fresh vegetable pickles where the stars are cucumber, chiles, corn, onions, zucchini, cabbage, carrots, tomatoes beets, squash, and turnips. The authors do not cover gherkins or cornichons as the vegetables on which these pickles are made are simply not grown in this country. Pity.<br />Fresh Fruit Pickles, the most common of which are from watermelon and rhubarb. It is more surprising to see pickles made of grapes, peaches, citrus fruits, pineapple, and mango. The secret to pickling soft fruits seems to be in the use of balsamic vinegar, soy sauce, sugar, and spirits, preferably bourbon.<br />Fermented Pickles, like breads raised with natural yeasts, are the artisinal versions of pickles. This is the land of Kimchee and sour pickles and procedures that run for many days. These are the pickles you fish out of great wine barrels in 19th century general stores.<br />Oil Pickles are the big surprise in this book. The most familiar oil pickled products to western palates are olives done in a North African style. The true star of this chapter is the technique that comes from India. The famous spice mixes of India such as garum masala plus lots of mustard, garlic, and chiles are heavily used here. Greece and the Middle East are other sources of oil pickles.<br />Pantry Pickles give us many of the recipes we are most likely to expect in this book, including purple pickled eggs, pickled horseradish, and pickled cherry peppers. Some recipes produce interesting edibles in a few minutes, but all give better results after a few days.<br />It is just a little surprising that after presenting both East Indian and Pennsylvania Dutch specialities, there is no mention in the book of either chutneys or chow chow or any other pickle relish for that matter. I do not think this is a weakness in the book, but it should temper buyer's expectations by knowing they will need to find a book on relishes to get recipes for these preparations.<br />While this book offers great recipes, great background, and great applications for pickles, it also happens to be a great book to read. I suspect the Schlesinger and Willoughby team is so successful in it's combining a very talented chef with a very talented culinary journalist. It also does not hurt to have the inspiration of a passionate pickle chef.<br />Highly recommended recipes that are easier than you may expect, but do not be surprised at the need for one or more days for the products to reach their best taste.r presenting both East Indian and Pennsylvania Dutch specialities, there is no mention in the book of either chutneys or chow chow or any other pickle relish for that matter.

It makes you appreciate the achievements of writers such as Steve Raichlen, Chris Schlesinger, and Bobby Flay who either cover the big picture with illuminating 600 page tomes or lighter volumes which limit their objectives to presenting good recipes.<br />As the subtitle suggests, this book wishes to cover the entire field of 'outdoor entertaining'. To that end, it includes a superficial chapter on grilling equipment and technique and chapters on 'Salads and Breads' and 'Desserts'. Also to this end, the book devotes a lot of recipes to a translation of a non-grilling technique to the grill such as for several different chicken wings recipes and a paella recipe. This objective makes it seem odd that many recipes also call for a heavy dependence on a saucepan to prepare marinades and a pasta pot to cook pasta. It is also a small but curious anomaly that the peach cobbler is made in a conventional oven rather than 'cowboy' style in a Dutch oven, as the recipe is called named after 'Texas Hill Country'.<br />In the selection of recipes, the author is demonstrating a broad knowledge of world cuisines with chipotle butter and saffron aioli in abundance. Many of the recipes are tasty, but the dependence on the old Hotpoint back in the kitchen seems a bit high for pure 'outdoor entertaining'.<br />In reviewing this book, I confess to being hobbled somewhat by a discipline about words which gets me bent out of shape when a 'chowder' recipe has no potatoes and a 'salad nicoise' is made from fresh rather than canned tuna. It's the kind of devotion to linguistic purity which makes me purr when John Thorne christens a bread salad a 'Panzanetta' rather than a 'Panzanella' because it does not follow the classic Italian recipe.<br />My biggest issue in this book is with the use of the word 'barbecue'. No linguistically sophisticated person will believe the distinction between 'grilling' and 'barbecue' is rigid, yet there are some clear hallmarks. Some authorities distinguish barbecue as a method of cooking over a low heat for a long time with smoke. Grilling typically involves cooking quickly over moderate or high heat with smoke playing no significant role in the result. An alternate interpretation may define grilling as simply all cooking on a grill, with 'barbecue' being a special case of grilling.<br />Kirk alienates me with his very first sentence when he states that 'How barbecuing actually started is unknown'. This is in the face of a long essay in Steve Raichlen's book 'BBQ USA' which documents the exact person and manuscript which identified the Caribbean native word 'barbacoa' for a method of cooking fish over an open fire. What is at issue is not the origin of cooking food over fire, but the origin of applying a specific word to a specific type of cooking. This is known as well as we know most historical facts from 400 years ago.<br />This little linguistic disagreement may all be smoke if it were not for the fast and loose way in which the author uses the terms grilling and barbecue virtually interchangeably in recipes throughout the book. Seeing one word or the other applied to a recipe conveys no information to the reader. On page 47, for example, there are two recipes for halibut steaks which are virtually identical with two different marinades followed by a grilling over high or medium - high heat. One is grilled, the other barbecued. Meaningless.<br />Other little nuisances abound. Many early pictures have no captions when captions would have enlightened the text discussing styles of grilling. After a careful discussion of a hand test for measuring heat from a grill, later recipes ignore the test and use a completely new technique for only a few recipes. There are no sources for unusual ingredients or equipment. I do not follow grilling equipment availability as well as I might, but I suspect that some things such as grill baskets are not the most easily obtained items. My biggest complaint about the layout of the book is in the fact that a large number of marinade, rub, sauce, and salsa recipes are given in two special chapters devoted to these preparations, yet there is no reference to these in the grilling recipes. All marinades, rubs, sauces, and salsas used with the recipe are embedded in the recipe.<br />There are so many excellent books on grilling by Raichlen, Schlesinger, and others that I simply do not see any reason to get this book unless you can get it for a steeply discounted price. I see Mr. Kirk has several other grilling titles, many of which are much larger, with ample celebrity endorsements from the likes of Tony Bourdain. I hope they show greater dedication to their message. The quality of the recipes shows that the author knows what he is doing over the grill. I will go so far as to suspect this volume is a poorly done digest of material from better books.ght, but I suspect that some things such as grill baskets are not the most easily obtained items.

Recommended	The author of `Pasta Salad', Barbara Lauterbach, is a culinary teacher and author of two other books on traditional salad types, `Potato Salad' and `Chicken Salad'.<br />This type of cookbook is always one of the easiest to add to one's collection, in that if you like the single subject of the book, you are virtually assured of making good use of the book, unlike a volume by the latest celebrity chef or latest exploration of the cuisine of a former Soviet republic.<br />There are three key aspects of the book which add to its attraction. First, almost all recipes are not only fairly simple, they virtually all follow the same pattern, just like gratins, braises, and chowders. Second, although there are a lot of similarities in method, the range of tastes is broad. While French and Italian flavors are the most common, there is a strong contingent of Asian, Greek, and Latin flavors and textures from the use of Oriental noodles like udon, soba, and rice noodles. Third, since the noodles, `supporting cast' of meats and vegetables, and the dressings are so interchangeable, improvisation can take you well beyond the nominal fifty recipes in the book.<br />The book begins with five master recipes for vinaigrette, mayonnaise, roasting peppers, blanching vegetables, and toasting nuts and seeds. If you have few cookbooks, these are important to have near at hand. I may have added a recipe for aioli, at least as a variation on mayonnaise.<br />There are four chapters on salad recipes. The first, largest, and most interesting is on the vegetable pasta salad. The very first recipe for a salad including squash shows the variety of this dish. Other favorite and unusual ingredients are mango, jicama, pears, and peaches. As you could tell from the master recipe on roasting peppers, this is one of the author's favorite ingredients. It appears in several different vegetable recipes. The second and shortest chapter adds meat, primarily chicken. I would not be surprised to see a little borrowing from an earlier book in this chapter. The third chapter of recipes covers seafood with all the usual suspects, lobster, shrimp, anchovies, crab, tuna, and salmon. The last chapter of recipes is a catchall of recipes `from family and friends'. It is altogether fitting that this chapter ends with a recipe for the great American `retro macaroni salad' with mayonnaise, onions, bell pepper, and celery.<br />The book has the contemporary `de rigeur' feature of cookbooks is a headnote which tells a story of how each recipe was developed, it's life outside this book, and how it was chosen for the book. Except for attributions of recipes to family and friends, there is no credit given to any other sources. With a pinch of skepticism, I will believe that the author developed most of the recipes. I was almost expecting to see my favorite `World's Best' pasta salad recipe done by Jamie Oliver, but these are all just as good.<br />There are a few blemishes that are as much a weakness of the publisher's copy editor as of the author. One is the flip side of my pet peeve where it is said that salt must melt into the liquid of vinaigrette before adding the oil. For all the times the word `dissolve' is misused, here is a case where it is missing and it should have been used. Another blemish is an inconsistency in the amount of water specified for cooking pasta in the text and in a table. None of these are serious. I just hope that pointing them out will encourage book publishers to be more vigilant in future volumes.<br />Subjects the author may wish to consider in a second edition of this book are discussions of whole wheat noodles, the impact on a carb sensitive diet from these recipes, and a bit more discussion of mayonnaise and safe storage. I do give the author very high marks for notes on the `shelf life' of the recipes. That is, which should be served cold, which should be served warm, which can be refrigerated and for how long, and which should be served immediately.You don't always get this stuff in your Wednesday newspaper culinary supplement.<br />Highly recommended if you make pasta salads. Slightly pricy for fifty recipes, but the chances that you will use a large number of the recipes is very, very good.

Broad Range of Recipes	This is the first of Bobby Flay's books I have reviewed and I approached it with the expectation that it will either deflate the hype of Flay's celebrity or show that, as I have seen with Jamie Oliver, there is real substance behind the smoke.<br />My first observation is that aside from a few nice frills, the book is all about the recipes and all about Bobby Flay. To get them out of the way, the nice frills are the complete list of recipes at the beginning of the book, the list of internet sources at the end of the book, and the last chapter on menus. For a book with only 125 recipes, the complete listing of recipe titles in the table of contents is a natural feature. It should be a feature in every cookbook. The list of internet sites is becoming another expected feature of cookbooks. The list of menus is a very nice touch and shows up what I think is the book's strongest feature. I must say the few color photographs of plated dishes are very good. The many black and white photos of Bobby doing this and that are boring.<br />I was very pleased to see that Flay's choice of recipes was not at all limited by the cuisine of his two restaurants. In addition to Southwestern and Spanish cuisine, Flay covers other Latin tastes such as Cuban, Caribbean and Argentinean plus Greek, East Indian, Chinese, Thai, and Italian. He has enough recipes to fill out complete menus for each of these cuisines.<br />Even when you just look at his core cuisines, you can see that Flay is giving us original recipes. They may not be all of his own invention, but they are certainly uncommon. For example, he presents six quesadilla recipes, none of which contain black beans, which is a staple in the four quesadilla recipes in Steve Raichlen's encyclopedic 'BBQ USA'.<br />It is surprising, in fact to see Flay make heavy use of Greek ingredients. Feta cheese seems to be one of his favorite ingredients and he uses it and blue cheese almost as often as he uses cheddar and Monterey Jack. In fact, he says he loves the Greek cuisine since it is rooted almost entirely on grilling. This brings up a basic culinary issue of 'fusion' food versus an interest to not violate cuisine or 'terroir' boundaries in the composition of recipes. I cannot say Flay never crosses boundaries in his combinations, but it seems he respects them a lot more than he crosses them. Feta is most commonly pared with other typically Greek ingredients such as olives, spinach, and lemons. Blue cheese, on the other hand, has become an ingredient that is pervasive throughout western cooking, as there are French, Italian, Spanish, English, and American native blue cheese products. So, as long as you don't go pairing it with raw tuna, you are pretty safe with just about any blue cheese use.<br />The chapters of food categories are a bit mixed. They are:<br />Cool Drinks, largely alcoholic.<br />Dips, Pizza, Flatbreads, and Quesadillas<br />Vegetable Appetizers, Salads, and Sides<br />Big Parties with Fish Tacos, Burgers, and Skewers. This is one of the more valuable chapters in the book.<br />Fish and Shellfish - Surprisingly large selection of recipes for grilling fish.<br />Chicken, Duck, and other Birds<br />Beef, Lamb, Pork, and Sausages<br />Simple Desserts - Not all of these recipes involve grilling fruits.<br />One of my favorite aspects of these recipes is that they give so many techniques for inexpensive meats or cuts that have become difficult to cook. There is a very simple and effective method, for example, for grilling thin pork chops with nectarine ginger chutney. Another aspect of almost all the recipes is their simplicity, as long as you get past the steep setup time required preparing to use a gas or charcoal grill. Flay says he uses both and offers few opinions or instructions about using one or the other.<br />This is an important consideration when buying this book. Flay gives some few tips about equipment and heat control at the beginning of the book, but there is virtually no other advice about finding your way around the grill. I think I would not want to start grilling from recipes in this book. If you are a novice, start with one of Steve Raichlen's books and assimilate his lessons on working with grills before tackling Flay's recipes. In a similar vein, Flay gives very little guidance on basic culinary techniques. I sensed that he was assuming a fair amount of knowledge on the part of his readers when he gives no clue to the fact that fava beans require a double pealing. He and his cowriter only mention a single pealing. On the other side of the coin, Flay and co-author Julia Moskin are very careful and thorough in specifying what can and what cannot be prepared ahead. They are as careful about warning us about what must be served immediately as they are about what can be refrigerated.<br />These recipes show the great natural culinary talent with which Flay has been credited. If you are a devoted griller or you are a devoted Bobby Flay fan, get the book. If you are a foodie or simply an avid cookbook reader, you may wish to use the money to fill out your M.F.K. Fisher collection. My biggest criticism may be that Flay has not given any guidance to people who do not wish to invest in grilling hardware and prefer to stay with their modest indoor grill pans.<br />Highly recommended for grillheads.

641165:US	39134375	RZ7SEW5LCBW78	0471273449	821581063	Stalking the Green Fairy: And Other Fantastic Adventures in Food and Drink	Books	5	29	30	N	Y	MSS from the Culinary Right Wing, Excellent Read.	This is the most recent work of culinary writing from James Villas, who was recently honored by `Bon Appetit' as Food Writer of the Year for 2003, an honor Jim richly deserves if only for the variety of his writings which include columns on food topics of general interest (this book, for example), cookbooks on classic American culinary subjects (`Biscuit Bliss' and `Crazy for Casseroles' for example), and memoirs (`Between Bites'). This is like having M.F.K. Fisher, Edna Lewis and Ruth Reichl all rolled up into one person.<br />Jim Villas represents old school American culinary writing. He is as direct an intellectual descendent of James Beard as you are likely to find today. He was a friend and confidant of Beard, Craig Claiborne, and Richard Olney. He does have ties to recent trends and writings, as he is a good friends with Paula Wolfert and Jeremiah Tower.<br />Unlike Beard, Villas does not limit his journalism to American cuisine, although his cookbooks are firmly rooted in southern American cooking, being a true native of North Carolina with a strong interest in all the traditional controversies over styles of barbecue, okra cookery, Brunswick stew, and iced tea. There is a fittingness between Villas' being a North Carolina reb (his word) and his conservatism regarding food.<br />The most appealing aspect of his conserving attitude about food is his strong regard for tradition. In this regard, his writings in this book are very similar to the essays of John Thorne in that both are intent on calling a chowder only those things which contain traditional chowder ingredients such as salt pork and are made in the traditional manner, such as by using either biscuit or potato to thicken. The two authors both devote an essay to chowder, although typically, Thorne's essay is more scholarship and Villas' essay is more opinion. Many excellent culinary journalist / educators today can benefit from this kind of conservatism which calls a salad nicoise only those preparations which have some basis in traditional Provencal practice. I am often annoyed when, for example, Alton Brown gives an excellent exposition on a subject only to follow it with a recipe of, for example, something he calls panzanella salad, which has small resemblance to anything prepared in Italy.<br />Some of Villas' most interesting targets for preservation of the established or recently neglected are iceberg lettuce, tuna fish canned in oil, and meat loaf. He recounts long battles over iceberg lettuce with Craig Claiborne and how some swells of modern cuisine are surprised on `rediscovering' the virtues of this very common, very economical product. One of Villas' bete noirs is the current rave over fresh tuna and the fact that, in his opinion, few people know how to properly cook tuna. Villas positively gushes over the virtues of a good meatloaf and gives evidence that many modern haute cuisine luminaries secretly crave this very American dish. At the end of many chapters on specific dishes, Villas provides one or more of his favorite recipes. Some are provided on, for example, Brunswick stew, grits, fruitcake, meatloaf, and so on. One of Villas rants is very close to my heart as I, like he, are exceptionally fond of the traditional club sandwich made of toasted bread, iceberg lettuce, crisply fried bacon, sliced poached chicken, and either homemade or Hellmans (full fat) mayonnaise.<br />One of the great ironies of Villas personal tastes is that while he is a great believer in terroir and believes that one cannot get a truly great Bouillabaisse outside the range of fish caught off the coast of southern France, he is in love with some of America's most humble commercial products such as Hellmans mayonnaise and peanut butter in a jar. These passions are squared by his devotion to shopping economically at both supermarkets and Sam's Club. His story of this passion is doubly endearing in that he admits to a fair amount of spoilage in the great quantities of goods hepurchases and stores over the long haul.<br />If it is not already clear, let me say that Villas has strong opinions and is not bashful about expressing them in his writing. Many, such as his stand on iceberg lettuce and meat loaf are liberating, in that one now has the sanction to appreciate them without guilt. Other opinions may be less sound. In spite of his close ties to the culinary revolutionary Jeremiah Tower, Villas seems to have a distaste for almost all things new on the American culinary scene. This is the second book in which he takes a swipe at Wolfgang Puck while embracing traditionalist Emeril Lagasse.<br />My culinary experience will never hope to match Villas' resume, but I do believe his opinions on cooking tuna, for example, take culinary conservatism just a little too far. I am four square in his corner on his disliking fusion cuisine (see terroir), but the Japanese way with food is just as valid as the French or Italian or North Carolinian.<br />Just so you know, the `Green Fairy' of the title has absolutely nothing to do with Peter Pan or a J.R.R. Tolkein creation. It is a nickname for absinthe, a green, very highly alcoholic liqueur that is nominally illegal in the United States and was illegal until recently in most European countries. Villas tells the story of this wormwood-based potion and his experiences with it.<br />On an intellectual level, I think Villas' culinary writings are not as sound or as durable as the works of John Thorne and Paula Wolfert. I also think his little jabs some modern culinary luminaries are undeserved.  Nonetheless, his writing is very, very entertaining. It is as much fun to rail at his opinions as it is to be tickled by Tony Bourdain's salty comments. I leave to you, dear reader, to find the anonymous little jab Villas takes at chef Bourdain's experiences and writing.purchases and stores over the long haul.<br />If it is not already clear, let me say that Villas has strong opinions and is not bashful about expressing them in his writing.

642524:US	39134375	R2ERG1SVEMKH52	0761106243	38298581	French Farmhouse Cookbook	Books	5	53	56	N	Y	Excellent Read and Recipes. Highly Recommended	`The French Farmhouse Cookbook' is not a book which should be bought if all you want is recipes. This is especially true if you have two or more books of French recipes by, for example, Julia Child, Richard Olney, or Patricia Wells. This is not to say these recipes are not good. They are very good. It's just that a mere mortal needs so many recipes for green salads, roasted chickens, pistu soup, and poached fish with aioli. One fact that keeps down excessive redundancy is the fact that unlike the three luminaries mentioned above, Ms. Loomis is based in Normandy rather than in Provence. Therefore, butter will be the star of many dishes rather than olive oil.<br />The primary charm and value of the book is in the stories surrounding how the author, Susan Herrmann Loomis acquired the recipes and her background on the French farms. As the ever-present blurb from Alice Waters says, this is a cookbook `that expresses accurately the milieu of its recipes'. If you need any additional blessing on the book's authenticity, see the sincerely written Foreword by Patricia Wells.<br />The book is divided by the origin of the produce and the occasions for eating in the life of a French farm family. The first chapter of recipes gives the French take on the meze tradition. Since the whole of the Mediterranean world from Spain to Turkey takes a mid-afternoon break with tapas or Mezes or what have you, why should we expect the queen of Mediterranean cuisine to be any different (I reserve the role of king for the Italians). In this chapter, we see that chestnuts are not exclusively a northern Italian specialty. Gascony, among other provinces also claims chestnuts as an important food. My most interesting discovery is a recipe for anchoiade, a Provencal spread akin to tapenade made from anchovies. Yum.<br />The second chapter is devoted to soup. This chapter and the third chapter on salads will be most familiar to any readers of French cookbooks. The fourth chapter on dairy includes the obligatory recipe for an omelet. The variations on omelets are most interesting. The most valuable recipe may be for fromage blanc (white cheese) which is to the French countryside what yogurt is to the eastern Mediterranean.<br />The fifth chapter does chicken, and it is not limited to roasted chicken. The most interesting recipe is `Poule au Pot' where an old hen is stuffed with meats and vegetables and stewed, accompanied with vegetables to add taste to the broth, followed by additional vegetables to serve as a side dish. If nothing else, this recipe shows that complex preparations are not the invention of men in tall hats and bad attitudes. The chapter includes a fair number of duck and rabbit recipes as well.<br />The sixth chapter on the pasture is devoted to beef. True to the French love of the long braise, the headline recipe in this chapter is a daube, which is characterized by a very long marinade in wine followed by cooking without searing the meat, or at least that is what I thought until I read this recipe from Provence. That's why I read a lot of cookbooks. No one writer has the full story.<br />The seventh chapter is on fish. As expected, salt cod occupies the most prominent role in these recipes. You also encounter pibales, tiny eels from the Basque region that I have not seen mentioned since I read a cookbook from Daniel Boulud. The eighth chapter is devoted to vegetables, one of my favorite subjects, as one can easily afford to buy vegetables for eight to ten veggie dishes a week, while stretching two or three meat dishes over the same period. As expected, the favorite techniques for preparation are the gratin, the braise, and the puree. The favorite ingredients are the eggplant, broccoli, potatoes, and green beans. One important dish from the Basque region is the Piperade, a dish of heavily cooked vegetables and cured ham, sometimes with eggs. Like it's sister dish, the Provencal ratatouille and many others, the French always seem to cook the bejesus out of their vegetables.<br />The ninth chapter is all about artisinal bread, primarily sourdough bread made with `Le Levain', a starter which lives and breathes from week to week. One landmark in my culinary education was when I discovered that sourdough is not unique to San Francisco. That benighted city may have something truly unique in the world of artisinal breads, but Europe has been doing bread with natural yeasts for centuries. One can do worse than starting your artisinal bread exposure with this chapter. It includes recipes for my favorite olive bread, an interesting change from the olive bread of Rhodes. The chapter also covers savory tarts, one of my truly favorite French inventions. The tenth chapter is on sweets, primarily the kind eaten when their English brothers would be taking tea.<br />The last chapter has the recipes that always make me yearn for a true pantry that would stay naturally cool the year around. The stars of the chapter are jellies, jams, preserves, and marmalades. The sidebar on the contents of a French Farm Pantry is one of the most realistic I have seen, as it contains nothing which will not last several months without mechanical refrigeration or freezing. One unusual type of preparation in this chapter is in the recipes for flavored wines. More common are the recipes for flavored vinegars.<br />Aside from a wealth of lore, the book adds to our culinary French by providing many `astuce' or tips on dish preparations.<br />Highly recommended to cookbook readers of all stripes. Many recipes are easy, some, like daubes, breads, and Poule au Pot and its cousins are involved. This book is great culinary entertainment and information.sus out of their vegetables.<br />The ninth chapter is all about artisinal bread, primarily sourdough bread made with `Le Levain', a starter which lives and breathes from week to week.

644275:US	39134375	R2SUMAFIETCJQQ	1579121659	734544427	Jacques Pépin's Complete Techniques	Books	5	220	228	N	Y	Essential Authority on Techniques. Highly Recommended	`Jacques Pepin's Complete Techniques' may be one of the landmark works signaling the beginning of the Renaissance of American culinary practice. This volume, published in 2001, is an omnibus of two earlier works, `La Technique' published in 1976 and `La Methode' published in 1979, just as Pepin was changing his career from leading French chef to culinary writer and educator. These will probably always stand as his most important books.<br />The book in English that is most similar to this is James Peterson's `Essentials of Cooking'. This newer volume is an excellent book with color photographs and coverage of subjects which is probably pretty complete for the average culinary amateur. Pepin's work is in an entirely different class, aimed at the professional and, by extension, the foodie wannabe professional.<br />In Peterson's book, the first chapter, `Basics', covers twenty-four (24) topics. In his first chapter of the same name, Pepin covers seventy (70) subjects. Even allowing for the fact that Pepin includes nine (9) egg topics in Basics that Peterson puts in a later chapter, this is an impressive margin of coverage from Pepin. Pepin's topics tend to be somewhat more basic and focus heavily on knife skills, even including a section on how to sharpen knives. Even though these topics are simple, Pepin gives each technique all the attention it needs. One of the clearest examples of Pepin's great attention to detail is in his treatment of my favorite subject for evaluating one's culinary writing. This is how to make a classic French omelet. As I noted in my review of Peterson's book, Chef James is just a bit short on some important details. Pepin not only covers all the bases, but also adds a few tips to omelet making technique that I have not seen elsewhere. The only warning I give about his technique is that since it was written before non-stick surfaces on saute pans were perfected and available on high-end cookware, the author does not recommend them. All recent descriptions of omelet making strongly recommend non-stick pans for all egg cookery.<br />The chapter on Fish and Shellfish continues Pepin's emphasis on basics, including several topics for which the average amateur chef may never have a use, such as methods for handling sea urchins, frogs legs, salmon in aspic, and pate of fish. Conversely, I am surprised to find no section on the `en papillote' cooking method that Peterson covers in detail. Other Peterson topics on which Pepin passes are methods for squid and preparing salmon steaks. The differences in coverage in this chapter alone make it worth one's while to own both books.<br />The chapter on vegetables is a real wealth of techniques for making really cheap ingredients into impressive presentations. You can dream about poaching or smoking whole Scottish line-caught salmon, but you can easily afford to do one of the eleven (11) different techniques Pepin describes for potatoes. In fact, this is probably some of the most dramatic evidence of the French obsession with food preparation. When I think of Irish potato preparations, I think of boiled potatoes, champ, and colcannon. In this chapter, the French have eight (8) different ways of just cutting potatoes, let alone all the methods used to fry, gratin, roast, boil, and saute potatoes in the French lexicon.<br />Pepin uncharacteristically combines poultry and meat into one chapter, but this is incidental. Pepin and Peterson cover a roughly equal number of chicken subjects, with Pepin covering some more typically French subjects such as glazing and sausage making. On cutting up a chicken, I give extra points to Peterson for the efficacy of his color pictures detailing his technique. Pepin very usefully separates all his carving techniques into a separate chapter that covers fish, birds, and beasts.<br />In the next chapter on `Breads', Pepin covers a topic that Peterson simply does not even touch. Pepin points out that bread making is one of those activities which involves a few simple ingredients, but a highly sophisticated technique. Like making a good omelet, it's all in knowing how. Having made a fairly wide variety of loaves of bread in my time, I would not recommend Pepin's book as the best introduction to breadmaking. His book is all about technique. It gives practically no understanding of why you do each of the steps in a particular way. And, his basic breadmaking technique is a little different from any other I have seen. On the positive side, I would strongly recommend anyone attempting to make baguettes to check out Pepin's description, as it is the only place I have seen pictures of classic baguette making equipment in use.<br />The real jewel in this book is the last chapter on `Pastry and Dessert'. This is the first indication I had of Pepin's skill as a pastry chef in addition to his great reputation as a savory chef. This by far the longest chapter in the book and has the greatest potential to adding a bit of `wow' to one's entertaining. One of the more important gems hidden in this chapter is Pepin's technique for making crepes in the section on Crepes Suzettes. I have successfully made crepes using Julia Child's recipe for years, yet Pepin's pictures and comments succeed in adding to my knowledge of the technique. For the supreme `wow' effect, check out the technique for the Christmas Yule Log (Buche de Noel). Another major topic absent from Peterson's book you will find here is the method for souffl&eacute;. In spite of all these flash dishes, the chapter still concentrates on a lot of very basic building block techniques such as recipes for custards, creams, meringues, toasts, galettes, caramel, brittle, and chocolate leaves.<br />If you are an aspiring professional or serious foodie, Pepin's book is probably the most important book you can have in your kitchen. It covers twice the material of Peterson's book with greater authority and fewer lapses. If you are an amateur who enjoys cooking, get both.

The reasons are as simple as they can possibly be. First, the book covers virtually all the really important basic techniques you need to do serious cooking well. Second, the author does a very good job of explaining these techniques in words and pictures. The only other book with which this book can be seriously compared is `Jaques Pepin's Complete Techniques', which I have not yet read critically and reviewed, but I will point out that while that older volume was done by an extremely talented chef with a flair for teaching, with black and white photographs, the current volume is done by someone who is more of a teacher with a talent for cooking, and it is done with color pictures.<br />I generally discount the value of photographs of prepared dishes in cookbooks, but I make a huge exception for photographs that demonstrate techniques. The only thing better than a really good set of pictures for explaining a culinary technique may be a really good set of colored drawings, since they can eliminate the distractions and focus one's attention on the important details of the technique. In this book, the photographs range from useful where all the action is done in a saucepan as when you are making a beurre blanc to absolutely essential when you are forming a salmon steak into a medallion for poaching.<br />The range of techniques covered by this book is truly impressive. As I turn each page to a new method, I find myself thinking `Of course, there is a right way to do this... and I can never seem to find an authoritative description of the method.' This happened to me just yesterday as I was looking for the method to poach pears in wine. Well, it's in this book along with dozens of other essential techniques.<br />There are six (6) chapters that roughly correspond to the most typical division of recipes in a French cookbook. These chapters and their salient points are:<br />Basics - These techniques are commonly done during prep or by the garde manger. It includes preparing fruits and vegetables, making broths and sauces, making pasta doughs, and making gnocchi, blinis, crepes, risottos, and pilafs.<br />Vegetables and Fruits - This is summarized as the techniques for applying heat to fruits and vegetables. It includes sections on roasting, gratins, glaces, deep-frying, grilling, steaming, saut&eacute;ing, mashing, flans, soups, and poaches (as in poaching pears in wine).<br />Fish and Shellfish - This gets into the problems posed by coaxing the best properties out of your most typical shellfish packagings, in addition to the typical methods of applying heat to flesh. This includes methods for cooking en papillote, cooking things with tentacles, shucking oysters, preparing soft-shelled crabs, using anchovies, and making a miso soup.<br />Poultry and Eggs - This is the chapter on fowl butchery and how to treat eggs with the respect they deserve when boiling, poaching or baking them or in making an omelet or a souffl&eacute;. I confess to finding the description of making a classic French omelet to be just a bit thin. There is no mention of the qualities of the best type of pan to use for omelets and no mention of bringing the eggs to room temperature before beating. Compared to many other descriptions, the instructions seem sparse between the point that eggs are added to pan and the cooked omelet is folded.<br />Meat - Roasting, grilling, saut&eacute;ing, poaching, braising, and stewing the big red stuff.<br />Working from Scratch - Butchering things without feathers is the heart of this chapter with techniques for scaling and filleting fish, hot and cold smoking fish, curing, trimming and butchering lamb, cutting up a rabbit, and braising rabbit.<br />One of the most delightful aspects of this book is how you can run across techniques for things you which on the face of it appear toviolate conventional cooking wisdom. My favorite example is the section on making a stew without browning the meat before starting the braise. Not only is this an acceptable technique, but the French have a name, a daube, for this type of dish. The heart of a daube is a long marinade in wine followed by thickening with a beurre manie or cornstarch slurry. The most famous daube is actually a German dish, sauerbraten, but it is common to many areas in western Germany and eastern France such as Provence and Alsace.<br />A second great virtue of this book is how it can give you the confidence to do things that a simple description in a conventional cookbook may leave you in doubt of your ability. This book shows you how to do it and the pictures assure you that it can be done.<br />As you consult this book, it may be easy to overlook the Glossary. Don't. This section is easily as useful as any of the chapters mentioned above. The name of the section is even a bit misleading, as the section does not simply define terms used in the book. It contains pictured descriptions of several important procedures such as degreasing a liquid and preparing a mousseline. Even if you are not in the habit of simply reading cookbooks, I strongly suggest you read this glossary. It will easily double your culinary IQ in a single sitting. One example is the article on blanching. Thousands of recipes tell you to blanch food before applying heat in some other way with no indication of why you are doing this. The article reveals at least four different reasons for blanching.<br />This book is not perfect, but it is very, very good. Highly recommended for turning difficult recipes into routine. And, it is very entertaining to read. Peterson is both a skillful teacher and an entertaining writer. Get this after you buy Julia Child or Patricia Wells.nal cooking wisdom.

And, Wells has already done a work on the cuisine of Joel Robuchon in the volume `Simply French' that won a James Beard award for best international cookbook in 1992. All this suggests this should be a great book. I also found things in this book that were not in `Simply French' which made this book more interesting to the reader; however, I did not find this a great, inspiring book for the cook. For the little concerns that lessened the overall impact of the volume, I give it only four stars rather than five.<br />I rate culinary works according to several different criteria, depending on the intended audience. The major accomplishments I value are lots of good, attainable, interesting recipes as in `James Beard's American Cookery'; masterful description of culinary technique as in Thomas Keller's `The French Laundry Cookbook', thoughtful reflections and revealing comments on culinary terroir, history, or culture as in Patience Gray's `Honey from a Weed'; accurate portrait of a regional cuisine as in David Downie's `Cooking the Roman Way', or exceptional presentation of a particular ingredient or branch of cooking as in Sherry Yard's masterful `The Secrets of Baking'. Memoirs such as Ruth Reichl's `Tender at the Bone' and straight journalism as in Tony Bourdain's `Kitchen Confidential' have their own special criteria, most of which is simply based on successfully telling an interesting story.<br />After all these reflections, I have to rate this volume somewhat below the very highest rank. The book addresses three subjects related to the career and art of Joel Robuchon.<br />The first subject is a brief chronicle of Robuchon's career, plus some comments on the careers of six of Robuchon's most prominent students. This section is a bit thin, but it does contain some interesting connections. It explains, for example, Robuchon's connection with and appearances on the Japanese produced show `Iron Chef' which appears regularly in translation on the Food Network. It turns out that Robuchon became enamored of Japanese cuisine early his career and he has a restaurant in Tokyo. He was also a very successful competitor in French culinary competitions early in his career. This section also reminds one of the practice of Thomas Keller. Wells describes Robuchon's kitchen as being quiet as a monastery, almost exactly the same description given by Michael Ruhlman of the kitchen at the French Laundry.<br />The second subject is a catalogue of Robuchon's favorite ingredients and their suppliers. Here is another parallel with Keller's French Laundry book, as Keller insisted that the book include profiles his of most important suppliers. Robuchon's hallmark ingredients are potatoes, caviar, scallops, cepes, sweetbreads, truffles, chestnuts, and almonds.<br />The third and largest section is a presentation of five or six recipes for each of the eight ingredients. Each recipe is the creation of Robuchon and one of his six disciples. Every recipe is spelled out in exquisite detail rarely seen in the methods of merely mortal chefs. Cooking times are given from exact milestones such as the time at which a pot of blanching water returns to a boil after adding vegetables. I confess some times and instructions are quite surprising to my totally amateur experience. I almost feel I need an explanation for why they poach asparagus for a full twenty minutes. I find asparagus totally limp and unappealing if it spends much more than five minutes in boiling water. Another major surprise is when a recipe puree's cooked scallops to be formed into quenelles on a mushroom puree. This brings back the comment of French cooking as being designed to suit people with bad teeth. In spite of the exquisitely detailed recipes, I did find a missing step here and there, where, for example, the recipe asks that cheese and potato slices be overlapped in a gratin without having given any instructions on how to slice the cheese.<br />A truly expert photograph of each finished dish accompanies every recipe by Herve Amiard, Robuchon's personal photographer. All are done with the food plated on a white plate, photographed from directly above the dish, with lighting always coming from the upper left (at about 2 o'clock). Dishes requiring special techniques as with grilled wild mushrooms with eggplant caviar are accompanied with detailed photographic montages and instructions to be certain that the reader can understand and follow the technique. This technique alone uses sixteen well-executed photographs.<br />This book includes two supplementary tables that enhance its value as a collection of recipes. The first is a tabulation of cooking times for each recipe, by ingredient. Don't get any impression that this book is a resource for quick cooking. The average prep and cook time is 90 minutes and some are as long as 10 hours. The second is a detailed table of contents. It is a little odd that these two tables duplicate a lot of information and their objectives could have been accomplished on two rather than on four folio-sized pages.<br />I am truly impressed by the modesty of the principle subject of the book and his collaborators. I just reviewed a book by a lesser French chef which might have been subtitled `An Advertisement for Myself'. In all, I found less new knowledge in this book than I found confirmation of statements by other great chefs. Robuchon, for example, confirms an observation made by Daniel Boulud that a cornerstone of culinary technique is repetition. You prepare a dish many, many times over until you know your ingredients and your techniques intimately.<br />Unlike Boulud's `Letters to a Young Chef', I don't think this book is required reading for foodies or professional chefs, but I think it is good stuff. It does several good things, but nothing great.e and potato slices be overlapped in a gratin without having given any instructions on how to slice the cheese.<br />A truly expert photograph of each finished dish accompanies every recipe by Herve Amiard, Robuchon's personal photographer.

This book of recipes by chef Edouard Loubet of the two star restaurant Moulin de Lourmarin belongs to the class of `Cookbook as Travelogue', where the object is not to use the book as a means to travel to exotic locations as to experience them vicariously. The other prominent aspect of the book is as an advertisement for the chef / author and his Provencal restaurant.<br />The first objective has never held much interest for me in a cookbook. To switch metaphors somewhat, a cookbook is much more commonly looked upon as a collection of plans for building furniture than as a book of pictures of either great modern pieces or antique furniture. The only type of cookbook I may ever buy with no expectation of actually preparing dishes from them is a historically important book such as the Roman Apicius' famous `first ever cookbook'.<br />I am almost certain that the author(s) assembled this book with the expectation that the typical American reader or even the typical French reader (the book is translated from an originally French publication) will simply not be able to reproduce the recipes as written. For example, a single recipe requires the ingredients sea squirts, germander leaves, baby octopuses, saltwort, purslane, and nigella leaves. Admittedly, this is an extreme case, but virtually every recipe calls for some genuinely rare or unusual ingredient. Shaved truffles look positively ordinary beside the sea squirts, germander leaves, and saltwort. My spell checker does not even recognize most of these names. At least I know I can mortgage my house to actually buy a truffle at my local megamart. This book does not even provide the usual list of Internet sources for these unusual ingredients. I suspect that is because many are simply not available outside of a garden in Provence.<br />I make this case of impracticality to be sure that any reader who is on the lookout for a book of Provencal recipes does not buy this book by mistake. They are sure to be disappointed. If this is what you want, please get a copy of either of Patricia Wells' books on Provencal home cooking or Lydie Marshall's book `A Passion for My Provence'. Two out of three of these books are in trade paperback, and I suggest you get both Marshall's book and Wells' first of two, `Patricia Wells At Home in Provence'.<br />Since I hope you are now sufficiently armed with knowledge of what this book is not, let me say that the book includes at least one really interesting general culinary idea, which explains most of the unusual ingredients. The author's big idea is that many fragrant edible items simply do not taste the same as they smell. Loubet's objective, then, is to contrive a set of ingredients and a method of preparation which reproduces in the act of eating, the same experience one gets when they smell certain fragrant edibles. On a physiological level, I suspect there is something bogus to this idea, but I do believe there is a grain of gustatory truth in this idea. The difference between this idea and some of the more extreme notions of great chefs such as Charlie Trotter or Thomas Keller is that with some effort, you can actually reproduce them with only a modest expense in your own kitchen, and verify for yourself the effect of the preparation.<br />The second prominent aspect of this book has little or no redeeming side to it. In many ways, the book is an extended advertisement for the chef and his restaurant. Buying it to use as a cookbook has much the same effect as buying a baseball cap with the Chevrolet or `Shrek 2' or TopFlite golf ball logo on the front. You are paying them to advertise a product to yourself.<br />One sure sign of the nature of the book is the fact that almost all the non-recipe text in the book was written not by Loubet, but by Catherine Vialard, a home economist and culinary journalist, whose text sounds for all the world like copy written for an extended advertising brochure. The book is full of tales and pictures of the authorstrolling through picturesque Provencal gardens and scenery with all sorts of talk about the surprising rise of Loubet's career from ski pro to chef. Loubet is joined in these pastoral reveries by his parents, grandparents, and agricultural purveyors. I appreciate many of the pictures, but I am not impressed in the same way that I was impressed by books of great recipes by Paul Bocuse and Joel Robuchon, both of whom amazed me by their modesty almost as much as they impressed me with their great culinary skill.<br />The only text with a degree of genuine warmth in it is the introduction by Peter Mayle, he of `A Year in Provence' fame.<br />Recommended if you like cookbooks as travelogues and are fascinated by unusual culinary notions. The three star rating is done as a warning to all that may mistake this for a true cookbook. The only things preventing me from giving it two stars are the very good tables of recipes by page and by name at the end of the book, plus the modest bibliography, needed if you want to really understand the unusual ingredients.strolling through picturesque Provencal gardens and scenery with all sorts of talk about the surprising rise of Loubet's career from ski pro to chef.

649510:US	39134375	R1N6FB2GNPAY14	0688154573	711004836	The Glorious Foods of Greece: Traditional Recipes from the Islands, Cities, and Villages	Books	5	32	33	N	N	Major Contribution to Knowledge of World Food. Outstanding	Diane Kochilas stands in the first rank of food writers specializing in Mediterranean cuisine, along with Mediterranean generalists Paula Wolfert, Nancy Harmon Jenkins, Claudia Roden, Clifford Wright, and Joyce Goldstein; Spanish specialist Penelope Casas; Italian specialists Marcella Hazan, Giuliano Bugialli, and Lydia Bastianich;  and fellow Greek specialist Agliaia Kremezi. This is Ms. Kochilas' third book on Greek food and I apologize to the author if I slight the first two in my praise of this volume, as I have not yet read or reviewed them.<br />Considering food writing as a whole, not just the Mediterranean, this is easily one of the best essays of a country's cuisine I have seen. The only volume which I have read and reviewed which may be better is Diana Kennedy's `From My Mexican Kitchen', although the two books take a different route to excellence.<br />The very first impression is the design of the cover, typeface, and book layout that sets the stage for the feeling that this is an important book. It has the kind of restrained design I typically attribute to cookbooks published by Knopf, but which other publishers have done well. The next impression is that Ms. Kochilas has done everything that I missed from Ms. Kremezi's recent book `The Foods of the Greek Islands'. While the latter volume did a good job on recipes, it did not dedicate itself to informing it's readers in a clear, lucid manner on what it was which distinguished the cuisines of the Greek Islands from one another, from the mainland, and from the Mediterranean in general. Ms. Kochilas does this with skill and insight. The first sign of this serious analysis of her subject is the superior map of Greece with the various island groups identified and icons representing major food product sources placed on the map. This is an easy attention to detail. The next aspect is the organization of the book into the various geographic regions. These are The Peloponnesos, The Ionian Islands, Roumeli, Epirus, Thessaly, Macedonia and Thrace, The Islands of the Northeastern Aegean, The Cyclades, The Dodecanese, Crete, and Athens. As Ms. Kremezi mentions in her book but does not detail with any analytical understanding, there are significant differences between, for example, the relatively poor Dodecanese and the agriculturally rich islands of the northeastern Aegean such as Lesbos.<br />Ms. Kochilas has artfully combined the analytical insight and presentation of Nancy Harmon Jenkins with the deft personal warmth of Paula Wolfert in discussing her sources of specific recipes. The only adverse effect of Ms. Kochilas' approach is that the book may not fit some readers' expectations to find a volume with the approach of Julia Child, which is heavy on culinary wisdom and recipe and light on exposition. Ms. Kochilas addresses this concern when she says that this volume may not cover many of the architypical Greek dishes, as she has already presented them in one of her two earlier volumes. When references to classics such as moussaka are appropriate, she even gives references to her earlier works if you are looking for that recipe. Another compliment to this book is Ms. Kochilas most recent book on Mezes that is lighter on the analytical approach and heavy on great recipes for these tasty bites.<br />The other side of the coin is that by not spending a lot of space on well-known classics, Ms. Kochilas and her editors have made space for more recipes on pastries and breads, one of my favorite topics. I have made several of the breads in the book and have found them uniformly excellent. One should also not get the impression from my comparison to Julia Child's works that this book is all exposition and no cooking. The opposite is true. The final chapter on the basics of Greek cooking gives great insights into some of the most important skills in the Greek kitchen. In keeping with a concentration on pastry and baking, this section opens with two different recipes for Phyllo. Thefirst is a traditional homemade dough and the second is a recipe for the style of phyllo made in Macedonia. For the purists, there are even variations to the basic recipe given for the Ionian islands, Roumeli, Afrato, and Epirus.<br />One of the most interesting discoveries in this final chapter is the story of trahana. To my novice eye, it is a pasta with some similarities to couscous and some similarities to gnocchi. Ms. Kochilas greatly expands Paula Wolfert's brief discussions of the subject with several recipes in the geographical chapters to round out her fascinating summary discussion. I am especially grateful for the paragraph on grating tomatoes. Other books on Greek cuisine give brief descriptions, but Ms. Kochilas tells us enough to give us confidence that this improbable technique actually works.<br />I have only touched the surface of the great richness in this book. I can hope to whet your appetite for more by quoting from the chapter on Crete where the author<br />`had come to witness this yearly winter ritual (brewing raki, similar to grappa, from the residuals of the local wine grapes) as well as other things in Crete, from the island's mythic, heart-saving diet, exemplar of simplicity and variety, to its seemingly limitless flora - over half the twelve thousand indigenous plants in Europe are found on Minos's island. ... The island is at the crossroads of Europe, Africa and Asia, the real and mythic cradle of the Mediterranean'.<br />Exciting words for someone who thrilled to tales of Hercules, Theseus, and Achilles as a boy.<br />Highly recommended addition to any culinary library, especially for those interested in regional cuisines.first is a traditional homemade dough and the second is a recipe for the style of phyllo made in Macedonia.

People with something in common tend to eat the same diet. A diet commonly becomes a homogeneous, identifiable cuisine based on a common cultural heritage and a common terroir, the products of the region's agriculture, animal husbandry, hunting, and gathering. Based on these simple observations, it is easy to see why the cuisines of Provence, Tuscany, Alsace, Apulia, Emilia-Romagna, Morocco, Mexico, Japan, Canton, and Szechwan are interesting. These observations also make it very easy to wonder why anyone other than a native of the Greek Islands would be interested in the cuisine of the Greek Islands, separate from the cuisine of mainland Greece. This issue was not obvious to me until I read award winning Aglaia Kremezi's book.<br />The first source of wonder is the great cultural diversity affecting the history of these islands. Many of the islands have gone through rule by ancient Greece (typically lead by the Athens city-state), Rome, Byzantium (Eastern Roman Empire), Islam, Ottomans, Italians (specifically Venetian and Genoese), Turkey, and Modern Greece. The second source of wonder is the agricultural poverty of many of the islands. Some larger islands such as Crete, Lesbos, and Chios seem to have a viable agriculture, but most of the smaller islands need imported food to survive. The third and most amazing source of wonder about the Greek Island cuisine is the lack of seafood. There is literally so little commerce in seafood on the islands of the Aegean that there are no fish mongers on most islands. The reasons are that, apparently, the number and size of fish in the Aegean is simply very small, and, all the good stuff gets shipped off to Athens for sale in the markets of the capital. This is why salt cod from Portugal or Scandinavia is one of the most commonly cooked seafoods. The only local seafood that seems to be prominent in the island cuisine is the mollusks (squid, cuttlefish, and octopus).  It doesn't end there. It is also true that traditionally, there is very little baking done on most islands, as there is very little wood remaining on the islands after thousands of years of habitation. About the only thing really distinctive of the islands' cuisine is the foodstuffs which can be foraged.<br />And yet, this cuisine is interesting and distinctive. I cannot say with any authority how distinctive the island cuisine is from the Greek and Turkish mainland, as I have yet to read and review books on Greek or Turkish cuisine, but I can say that there are things which set it apart from the general world of the Eastern Mediterranean.<br />The most distinctive preparation of the Greek Island cuisine according to the recipes in this book seem to be `Savory Pitas and Pies' encrusted with either a Cretan phyllo dough, a standard pastry dough, or commercial puff pastry. Most of the savory pie contents are vegetables and cheese, with fennel, leeks, onion, tomato, feta, zucchini, and eggplant being the most popular. Lamb is definitely the favorite meat filling, but pork, octopus, and salt cod appear as well. The variety lies not only in the fillings and crusts, but also in the shapes and methods of preparation. Some are shaped like empanadas and fried, some are shaped and prepared like calzones, some are prepared in a coil from a roulade, some look like pot pies straight from the Pennsylvania Dutch.<br />Another distinctive element of island cuisine is the meze, which the author at one point mistakenly translates as `hors d'ourves'. Diane Kochilas, an authoritative writer on Greek cuisine, in her book `Mezes' says Meze, short for mezethes, denotes small dishes served typically at small eateries like `mezethopoleion'. Even our author describes these dishes as being much more similar to something eaten at an afternoon break than as a pre-dinner starter. If you need a French term for them, `amuse bouche' may be more appropriate.<br />Other chapters are `Fish and Seafood (Scarce but Excellent)', Succulent Meat(Lamb, Pork, Veal and Chicken)', `Beans, Rice, Bulgur, and Pasta', `Seasonal Salads, Vegetables and Potatoes', `Bread', and `Island Desserts'.<br />The prominence of pies, pasta, and breads in the island cuisine makes up another great mystery in that Crete was identified as the epicenter of the healthy 'Mediterranean' diet. The puzzle is how the high incidence of cooked rice and processed wheat in the diet and the apparent less than expected incidence of seafood leads to a healthy diet. What about all those carbs!!! I'm not a fan of low carb diets, but I just thought I would bring out that anomaly to entertain your mind, dear reader.<br />Greek ingredients are almost as easily found in our megamarts as are Italian foods, but there are some ingredients for which you will have to go out of your way to acquire. Aleppo pepper, in particular, seems to show up in almost every savory recipe. Another problem with ingredients is the author's claim that Atlantic and Pacific fish simply cannot reproduce the taste of fish taken from the Ionian or Aegean seas.<br />In spite of all the puzzles this book creates for me, I must say that this book is a worthy exposition of a cuisine. Think of it as the food of Achilles and Odysseus from the movie `Troy'.<br />The photography of the people of the Greek islands is evocative. The photography of the dishes is average. Each recipe is identified by its Greek name with a useful English translation. All recipes are good, some are extraordinary. Some are easy, many, especially the pitas and pies, are involved. The author's identifications of the island(s) from which the dishes came are inconsistent. Sometimes it is in the title, sometimes it is in the headnote, and sometimes it is absent.<br />This book is excellent if you have no familiarity with Greek or Eastern Mediterranean cuisine and you are adventuresome in the kitchen.

651189:US	39134375	R2K9EUP5HREVAF	0517122359	586452164	Craig Claiborne's New New York Times Cookbook	Books	5	41	47	N	N	Excellent  Reference. Look Elsewhere for Instruction	This Craig Claiborne `magnum opus' was my very first serious cookbook, from which I have probably done more recipes than any five others put together. As such, I have an intimate knowledge of its strengths and weaknesses.<br />The evaluation of this book depends greatly on an understanding of the purpose that the book best serves. The main feature of the book is its vast size. It weighs in at about 800 pages. The only `cookbook' on my shelves with more words and pages is the encyclopedic `Larousse Gastronomique'. The class of cookbook which most closely approaches this book in size is the all-purpose `how to cook' manual such as `The Joy of Cooking' and Mark Bittman's `How to Cook Everything'. This Claiborne volume fits neither of these two categories. It is also certainly not a restaurant, celebrity, or `terroir' cookbook such as those about Provence or Tuscany. It basically defines a class of which it is probably the premier exemplar. This is the class of book that is simply assembled to provide you with as many recipes as possible. It's reason for being is volume. There are some special cases of this class of book which deal with a particular cuisine, such as the `Thousand Recipe Chinese Cookbook' by Gloria Bley Miller. Claiborne outstrips this book by a mile, giving us two to three recipes per page, thereby weighing in with about 2000 recipes covering the four corners of the world.<br />In a sense, the class of cookbook that may come closest to this MS is the fundraising cookbook commonly published by churches and social organizations with recipes supplied by the group's members. The similarity is that the recipes were supplied by dozens of different authors and there are few if any threads connecting the recipes except the organization sponsoring the publication of the volume. This Claiborne work distances itself from such volumes in the quality and diversity of the recipes. It is important to remember that most, if not all of these recipes have appeared in the pages of the New York Times. In order to do this, they would have had to pass scrutiny of not only Times editors but the thousands of readers of the New York Times food columns. Each recipe would have had to survive a second professional screening when it was being considered as an entry in this book. Additional screenings would have been done for each successive edition. The bottom line is that the value of this book is in its providing a widely diverse selection of high quality recipes for a cent and a half per recipe. Compare that to the twenty to thirty-five cents per recipe you pay for a new hardcover cookbook from the latest celebrity chef or the latest send-off of recipes from Rome, Tuscany, or Provence.<br />The other side of the coin is that the only thing you get in this cookbook is the recipes. Period. Virtually every recipe is composed of nothing more than a title, a number of servings, a list of ingredients, and numbered steps for the procedure to be followed. A very few recipes for truly unusual preparations such as `Taramasalata', a Greek Carp Roe spread have a brief headnote explaining the source and use of the recipe. For pantry items such as the very first recipe in the book, `Mignonette Sauce', there is only the briefest indication of the purpose to which the recipe is to be applied. This is the price to be paid for the book's filling the role of encyclopedic reference, where sheer numbers of recipes is its objective. I must temper this rather austere picture ever so slightly by pointing out that there are some few recipes which do deserve a special treatment such as the recipe for the omelet for one, where there are some sidebar comments on technique and the procedure is considerably more detailed than the average. This is only fair, since, as Alton Brown has said, the omelet is all about technique. Being an only modestly practiced omelet maker, I believe Claiborne's omelet recipe is illuminating without being overly fussy.<br />The archetypal recipe in this book, to my mind, is the one for Bouillabaisse. It has a very long list of ingredients, none of which are beyond the reach of the average American supermarket, and a very short procedure. In place of a freshly prepared fumet, the recipe calls for clam juice. The most revealing aspect of the recipe is that it shows that Bouillabaisse is, indeed, a relatively simple recipe. The description of the procedure is less than one-fourth the length of the procedure for making an omelet for one, which can be done within five minutes.<br />What may be easy to overlook is that this book may have been as important as any in creating the market for gourmet food products. The irony is that Claiborne is clearly a writer and not a chef. In fact, some reports describe him as somewhat deliberate and slow in the kitchen, where he simply did not have the well-practiced manual skills of a professional chef who preps and mixes and sautes every day, all day. In fact, this also means that virtually all the recipes in this book were collected and edited by Claiborne rather than being created or even discovered by him.<br />This book is a classic which makes thousands of recipes available to people who have no time or room for a library of cookbooks and who have the basic skills which will fill out the complete, but sparse instructions. Coverage of savory cooking is exhaustive. Coverage of baking and pastry is limited. I have never been disappointed by my results from making any recipe in this book, and, most have exceeded my expectations, based on the relative simplicity of the procedure.<br />Highly recommended for experienced cooks who are time or space challanged.ecipe in this book, to my mind, is the one for Bouillabaisse.

The description of the procedure is less than one-fourth the length of the procedure for making an omelet for one, which can be done within five minutes.<br />What may be easy to overlook is that this book may have been as important as any in creating the market for gourmet food products. The irony is that Claiborne is clearly a writer and not a chef. In fact, some reports describe him as somewhat deliberate and slow in the kitchen, where he simply did not have the well-practiced manual skills of a professional chef who preps and mixes and sautes every day, all day. In fact, this also means that virtually all the recipes in this book were collected and edited by Claiborne rather than being created or even discovered by him.<br />This book is a classic which makes thousands of recipes available to people who have no time or room for a library of cookbooks and who have the basic skills which will fill out the complete, but sparse instructions. Coverage of savory cooking is exhaustive. Coverage of baking and pastry is limited. I have never been disappointed by my results from making any recipe in this book, and, most have exceeded my expectations, based on the relative simplicity of the procedure.<br />Highly recommended for experienced cooks who are time or space challanged.	2004-05-28

Cuisine	Ms. Victoria Jenanyan Wise, a highly experienced cookbook author from an Armenian family has successfully blended traditional products of the Armenian terroir with modern California style and market to give us a taste of what Armenian cuisine tastes like in our American setting. As this objective is not the same as a faithful evocation of the native Armenian cuisine, it is important you do not buy this book with the intention of faithfully recreating your own Armenian culinary heritage. Ms. Wise is giving us her Armenian culinary heritage, not an anthropological document.<br />She is delightfully successful in evoking the Jenanyan memory of Armenian cuisine with recreations of Armenian recipes, family interpretations of Armenian recipes, and her own deft experiments with Armenian methods and ingredients as interpreted by what is available in the California marketplace.<br />Ms Wise scores her first points with me by including a map of the historical Armenia and its surrounding lands which primarily includes Asia Minor (Turkey), the Caucasus, Syria, Iraq, and Iran. Armenia today is on the eastern edge of Turkey, with parts of ethnic Armenia being in Azerbaijan. One of the little mysteries of the book is how this terroir can be considered `Mediterranean' since it is a good 500 miles from the Bosporus, where the Black Sea empties into the Mediterranean. Although the author doesn't invoke this justification, she is in good company, as Paula Wolfert has included Georgia, which is north of Armenia and even further from the Mediterranean in a book of Eastern Mediterranean cuisines. Wise rationalizes the importance of Armenian cuisine by pointing out that the Armenian highlands are very fertile, a rich land for growing wheat, and possibly the historical origin of wheat culture.<br />Armenia shares some major culinary elements with lands bordering the Mediterranean such as yogurt, wheat, lamb, and eggplant. On the other hand, olives and olive oil, the cornerstone of Mediterranean cuisine is less important than butter, especially clarified butter, in Armenian cooking.<br />Since this is neither genuine Armenian nor purely Mediterranean, what is the attraction of this book. In a word, it is variety. If you are especially fond of the cornerstone Armenian ingredients (yogurt, lamb, eggplant, bulgar and legumes, and you are tired of your Italian, Greek, and Levantine sources, this is the book for you. The chapter subjects are a mix of the traditional and the quintessentially Armenian. These are:<br />Yogurt - Ms. Wise gives us the whole picture, including a reliable recipe for making homemade yogurt, and yogurt substitutes for staples such as fresh cheese, cr&egrave;me fraiche, and bechamel sauce. She also gives us the important caution that although you can start a yogurt culture from a commercial yogurt, the dry yogurt starter from a health foods store will give you better results. Take that Alton Brown.<br />Armenian Mazas - The Armenian take on the Greek and Turkish Meze cuisine. The stars here are eggplant, chickpeas, tomatoes, onions, pickling cucumbers, and zucchini. One surprise is in the recipe for string cheese.<br />Breads and Savory Pastries - The signature product here is `Lavosh', the Armenian Cracker Bread which is dry like matzo, but leavened with yeast like pita, and baked with a covering of sesame seeds. Pita and Armenian `pizzas' are also present, along with several fillo based Greek / Turkish like savory packets.<br />Salads - Old World style, but New World ingredients are emphasized here. Legumes and spinach are the stars here, along with the old war-horse Taboulleh.<br />Kufta - One of the most distinctly Armenian dishes in the book. This is less a dish than a whole family of dishes, closely related to the Georgian dish, Kibbeh, described in Paula Wolfert's `The Cooking of the Eastern Mediterranean'. Part of what makes Wolfert's book great while this volume is merely good is the fact that Wolfert gives detailed, diagrammed instructions on techniques for making Kibbeh while Wise simply gives us many different recipes and a small sidebar of tips. Both Kufta and Kibbeh are a style of cooking which puts all sorts of different ingredients, from meats to barley to bulgar to legumes into a stuffed or not stuffed `meatball'.<br />Lamb and other Meats - This is how to do Shish Kebab right, and other tales of lamb cookery. An interesting ethnic tidbit here is that while Armenians were Christian, Muslim lands surrounded them, so they had little interest in pork, even if they had no religious inhibitions against it.<br />Poultry, Game, and Eggs - This is a chapter that will give relief to a tired inventory of poultry recipes.<br />Fish and Seafood - Another Old World style blended with modern techniques and sensibilities. Focus is on fresh water fish and shellfish.<br />Vegetables - Eggplant, Eggplant, and more Eggplant. I just wonder how okra got to Armenia from Africa.<br />Pilafs - Bulgar, rice, lentils and nuts.<br />Sweets - Baklava is the headliner, even though the author admits it is no more Armenian than Pizza. Filo dough, peaches, apricots, almonds, walnuts, and pistachios star here. Great source of nut nutrition here.<br />Like many other ethnically oriented cookbooks by skilled culinary authors, this one offers new, nutritious, dishes to Armenians, foodies on the lookout for novelty and vegetarians on the lookout for novelty. This is a very good book that succeeds in its objective, but it is not a great book. The anecdotes of family history are pleasant, but do not have the evocative power of, for example, some of the stories told by Gennaro Contaldo in `Passione'. On the other hand, `Gourmet' magazine has declared Eastern Mediterranean cuisines as one of the next big things in eating. This book is as good a source as many.<br />Highly recommended for those with an interest in this cuisine and in Eastern Mediterranean food in general. Relatively easy recipe methods.

654253:US	39134375	R3N119RM94GCMQ	0609609718	33653096	Larousse Gastronomique	Books	5	71	74	N	N	Essential, Exhaustive Reference to French and World Food	This weighty, 1200 page volume is a reliable gold standard among culinary works. It should not surprise that it is originally a work published in French (Larousse is a major French publisher that specializes in encyclopedic volumes on many subjects). The inevitability of the volume is based on the premier place of French cuisine on the world stage and on the very European tradition of publishing great omnibus works on just about every subject imaginable. It was Diderot in 17th century France who invented the encyclopedia and great references in most subjects are available in French or German or even Italian long before they are available in English.<br />The blurb on the front of my edition states that the Larousse Gastronomique is the `World's Greatest Culinary Encyclopedia'. I cannot judge this statement for volumes available in French, German, Italian, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, Thai, Hindi, or Arabic. But, in English, this is undoubtedly true. This statement is true not only for the size of the volume, but for the great range of subjects the editors have chosen to include. The entries cover all the obvious things such as vegetables, meats, fish, shellfish, herbs, spices, fruits, and spice mixtures.<br />On these subjects, the writers do not limit themselves to a simple description of appearance, taste, seasonality, geographic distribution, and a statement of culinary uses. It includes representative recipes for almost all basic foodstuffs, the number depending on the relative importance of the food. The entry for aubergines (eggplant) includes a general recipe for the preparation of the vegetable plus eight recipes within the article itself plus references to eight other recipes under other articles. The drawings or photographs accompanying articles on major foodstuffs like aubergines are truly first rate. I am pleased, but not surprised at this, as I have come to expect European editors to do as good or better job of illustrating books than American publishers, especially where these illustrations are an important aspect of the work. Regarding the illustrations in general, the genius of the editors is in the great variety of media used in the pictures. Where technical detail is important, color drawings are used to focus on the important and hide the incidental in pictures of raw ingredients, for example. Where a prepared dish is pictured, photographs are typically used. Where the subject is a geographical or historical subject, the first choice is usually an historical engraving, painting, or cartoon.<br />If the book covered no more than these foods, it would be a valuable work indeed, but it also covers such diverse subjects as geographical regions of culinary interest such as Provence, both common and rare kitchen tools such as the autoclave and the bain marie, culinary songs such as chants used by street vendors in Paris, types of eating establishments such as caf&eacute;, bistro, and restaurant. One of my favorite things is to be looking for a particular entry and run across some other totally appropriate, yet totally unexpected entry. My most recent find is an article on the traditional fraternal orders and associations of culinary professionals in place in France, some since the Middle Ages. This relatively long article is accompanied by full color pictures of the robes worn by members of these orders.<br />The range of subjects covered by the book is quite international, but there is a clear emphasis on French techniques, history, produce, and dishes. The coverage of wine and cheese around the world is extensive, as these products are so important to French gastronomy. Some subjects that are very important to Asian cuisines get relatively little attention. Soy gets a half page article, and miso gets no more than a paragraph. Lemons get a page and a half, yet lemongrass has no article at all. On the other hand, techniques for butchering a chicken get two full pages.<br />I do not often refer to the Larousse Gastronomique for recipes, but it is always my reference of last resort when all other sources fail. The only culinary question on which it is mute is on substitutions. A replacement for buttermilk can be found in any number of lesser references, yet the Gastronomique simply does not cover this.<br />The Larousse Gastronomique is simply the essential reference to French technique, ingredients, culinary history, and geography. Get this before you get your Julia Child and your Jaques Pepin and your Patricia Wells. I seriously doubt if the latest editions have any significant improvements over used editions of thirty or even fifty years ago. Just be sure to get one in good condition. You will refer to it often.<br />Essential.ue for recipes, but it is always my reference of last resort when all other sources fail.

The subject of bread baking seems to attract large, authoritative titled books, as this is the third 400 or more page book on bread which claims to be either complete or a bible. As the other two books (both entitled `The Bread Bible' by Beth Hensperger and Rose Levy Beranbaum) were published in the last five years and Mr. Clayton's first edition of his book was published thirty years ago, Bernard Clayton has a distinct claim to have commanded this cookbook niche for the longest time, thereby having ample opportunity to correct, improve, and augment. From the author's new introduction, I see he has been doing that faithfully for the last thirty years.<br />In a sense, Mr. Clayton is very old school, as he was in a position to consult not only with Julia Child, but also with Craig Claiborne and James Beard, both of which have left us for tables on high. The augmentation of thirty years' effort gives us a volume which weighs in at 685 pages at an exceedingly reasonable $35. Kudos to Simon and Shuster for giving the volume the price of most cookbooks which rarely exceed 300 pages.<br />While Mr. Clayton arose from an `old school' background, the general technique behind his bread recipes is very modern and will be very welcome to the inexperienced home baker. The heart of his technique for yeast breads is to use the newest incarnation of commercial yeast, typically called `Rapid Rise'. I believe this yeast was specifically developed to work with bread machines. The fact that `Rapid Rise' yeast can be added to dry ingredients without being proofed in warm water and sugar or flour is what distinguishes it from the older `Active Dry' yeast from producers like Red Star and Fleishmans. Virtually every yeast based recipe in the book mixes the yeast with dry ingredients and starts with water at 120 degrees Fahrenheit rather than blooming the yeast in water at about 105 degrees Fahrenheit.<br />The very best thing about Mr. Clayton's book in comparison to it's closest competitor, `The Bread Bible' by Rose Levy Beranbaum is the fact that Mr. Clayton makes a point of showing you how bread baking can not only be easy, but it can be relatively easy with an incredibly wide range of historically and ethnically interesting breads made with manual kneading, bread machine, stand mixer, and food processor. After reading books by such hyper fussy bakers such as Beranbaum, Silverton, and Reinhart, this is a real revelation. The second best thing about this book is revealed in the title. This is a complete book of BREADS. Note the plural. The most important aspect of the book is that it presents, in depth, recipes for twenty-four different types of breads, including many ethnic favorites. I found, for example, a recipe for the Russian Easter bread, Kulich, a close cousin to the local Lehigh Valley favorite, Paska from the Ukraine. None of the other encyclopedic approaches to bread included this recipe. However, I did recently find it and the true Ukrainian recipe in the new book `Celebration Breads' by Betsy Oppenneer.<br />The great thing about this variety is that it gives pretty complete coverage to all special needs, such as those who need a gluten-free bread, those who need a yeast-free bread (and are tired of Irish Soda Bread), and those who want healthy, whole grain bread recipes. It even covers recipes for crackers and batter breads and baking for dogs, if you can believe that.<br />The most amazing thing about the subject of bread baking is that in spite of the great size of this book, it simply does not cover everything, and, what it does cover is done from what is not the only or even the best point of view. While this book does touch on breads made from starters, the book does not deal with this subject in any detail. The book does not even include the words sponge, poolish, or biga in the index. It is on this subject where Ms. Beranbaum really shines. Unlike Mr. Clayton who gives a relatively cursory introduction to the techniques of yeast bread baking, Ms. Beranbaum gives about 90 very detailed pages to the intricacies of artisinal baking with both natural and commercial yeasts. I have already noted Mr. Clayton's focus on `Rapid Rise' yeast and it's techniques. Other writers prefer either `Active Dry' or even moist, `live' yeast that must be refrigerated. Other baking experts such as Peter Reinhart also make compelling arguments for very long rise times, which, in the interest of appealing to the amateur, Clayton does not discuss in depth.<br />If you want an exceedingly rich source of baking recipes for a very reasonable price with a very friendly voice which will make you confident that you will do well when you bake bread, this is the book for you! If you have no interest in a deep understanding of bread baking or in natural yeast techniques, you will need no other book. If your interest in baking is more professional or more in need of deeper understanding, check out Beranbaum or Reinhart's books.<br />Highly recommended.

657099:US	39134375	R3SGGZYBD6EAFV	0618239979	697443462	A Year in a Vegetarian Kitchen: Easy Seasonal Dishes for Family and Friends	Books	5	210	213	N	Y	Practical, Smart, Seasonal Vegetarian Dishes	On several counts, this is a better than average vegetarian cookbook by veteran author and Cooks Illustrated executive editor, Jack Bishop. The most outstanding virtue of the book is that, true to the title, the recipes are organized by season. This is a popular notion these days and several books have done it already, but it is doubly appropriate to a vegetarian cookbook. Mr. Bishop decides to divide things into the four seasons rather than splitting things up more finely as others such as Albert Portale have done in one of his books.<br />The second virtue of the book may actually be a requirement for a seasonally organized book. This is an additional table of contents organized by type of dish. The categories so organized are Soups and Stews; Lighter Salads; Main-Course Salads; Sandwiches and Tortilla Dishes; Pasta and Noodles; Rice, Grains, and Couscous; Beans and Lentils; Eggs; Tofu and Tempeh; Pizzas and Tarts; Vegetable Main Courses; Side Dishes; and Accompaniments. I am not up on all the finer distinctions in the vegetarian / vegan world, but the presence of distinctly eggy dishes such as omelets, frittatas, and souffles tells me that Mr. Bishop is on the liberal end of the vegetarian spectrum.<br />The third virtue of the book is the great variety in foods used in the dishes and in the great variety of ethnic influences. Italian pastas, frittatas, beans, and veggie dishes are cheek and jowl with lots of Middle Eastern, South Asian, Southeast Asian, Chinese, Japanese, and Latin dishes. Tofu, miso, grains, and couscous are given prominent roles in ethnic dishes. I have seen some vegetarian cookbooks that claimed to declaim classic dishes with virtually no rice dishes represented. True to his `best recipe' background from `Cooks Illustrated', Mr. Bishop's techniques are dead on in every case I checked. His rice technique is especially keen on the finer points of difference between cooking simple long grain rice and rice for `sticky rice'.<br />The fourth virtue of the book is set of sidebars on ingredients and techniques. In one, for example, he echoes a finding in `Cooks Illustrated' that points out that American imitations of Indian Basmati rice simply don't cut it. The sidebars plus headnotes leave no mistaken impressions that this is fast or simple cooking. One's first experience in preparing a dish from fresh artichokes or fava beans will demonstrate that some veggie delicacies can be very finicky and time consuming to prepare.<br />The fifth virtue of the book is in the pantry recipes or, more accurately `Everyday Basics' with recipes for stocks, doughs, basic rice preparations, basic potato preparations, and basic corn meal preparations. These are all `seasonless' recipes, as good rice, potatoes, and corn meal are available the year around. The best finds in this chapter are the three different vegetable stocks, one traditional, one Mediterranean with basil and potato, and one Asian with dried shiitake and ginger. Bishop demonstrates great respect to his veggie ingredients by simmering for no more than an hour.<br />The last virtue I consider valuable for you, dear reader, to know is the fact that Bishop is neither preachy nor rigid about his vegetarianism or seasonality. He freely confesses to using imported materials out of local season and makes recommendations for supermarket replacements for stocks and such (look for stocks in cardboard aseptic containers). This liberality extends to the fact that several recipes are not strictly from their seasonal chapter. I am especially happy that Mr. Bishop did not bring along the `Cooks Illustrated' dialectic of examining lots of unsuccessful methods, which cooks have known to be bad ideas for centuries.<br />I do believe there are some recipes that are less than stellar. There are times when `simple' leaves you with the feeling that something is missing, but then, maybe this just means you palate needs some education. Overall, I found lots of sound ideas, albeit few with which I was unfamiliar. Sometimes, I think certain culinary ideas, even ideas which may be centuries old, suddenly acquires a currency among culinary writers. All of a sudden, everyone is talking about adding Parmesan rinds to soups and broths. Mr. Bishop uses this very simple idea in the most novel manner by adding it to the broth to be added to risotto in place of the conventional chicken stock. Thank you, Jack.<br />Highly recommended for the vegetarian and all others searching for reliable seasonal recipes and nutritious dishes. Intermediate skills required. Few expensive or truly hard to get ingredients.th which I was unfamiliar.

Highly Recommended	`The Flavors of Southern Italy' by Erica De Mane is one of the most revealing expositions of a regional cuisine I have had the pleasure to read. This includes about twenty books covering Italy, regions of Italy, France, regions of France, Morocco, regions of China, and regions of the United States, plus several on the Mediterranean as a whole and the Arabic lands of the Mediterranean. The quality of the presentation is due to the most distinctive approach revealed clearly in the title of the book.<br />Most writers on regional cuisines do a gloss on the ingredients of the cuisine and proceed to a presentation of many of the classic dishes of the region. This is certainly the approach of the three different books I have read and reviewed on the cuisine of Rome. As long as the recipes are reasonably authentic and not the author's overly interpreted versions of these representative dishes, this approach can be quite good, as it is in these three treatments of Roman food.<br />Ms. De Mane's approach is most similar to the ingredients driven monograph `The Essential Mediterranean' by co-Italian specialist Nancy Harmon Jenkins.<br />Ms. De Mane makes no claim whatsoever to being true to the recipes of southern Italy. This is not to say there are not some authentically Italian dishes here, but this is not Ms. De Mane's game. Her book is not on the recipes of southern Italy, it is on the FLAVORS of southern Italy. Her approach to her subject begins with a very long chapter entitled `Essential Southern Italian Flavoring Ingredients'. This chapter covers virtually every major spice, herb, and condiment used in southern Italian cooking plus sections on olive oil, tomatoes, peppers and chilies, salumi, cheeses, nuts, and wine. The remainder of the book is organized not by course as is tradition with many other Italian cookbooks, but primarily by principle ingredient or type of preparation. In this way, salads and appetizers are not treated in a separate chapter. They are presented with other dishes with a common principle ingredient.<br />The chapters of recipes are:<br />Vegetables, including sections on shopping, cooking, and making salads<br />Seafood, including sections on buying and flavoring seafood<br />Meats and Poultry, including sections on typical usage and cooking for a group.<br />Savory Tarts, including sections on pizza and calzones.<br />Soups<br />Pasta<br />Desserts<br />The book ends with a chapter on the author's favorite southern Italian wines and a chapter on menus.<br />The author's definition of southern Italy is comprised of the provinces, in order of emphasis, of Sicily, Apulia (heel of the boot), Campania (Naples, Capri and the Amalfi coast), Basilicata (instep of the boot), and Calabria (toe of the boot). Sicily, Apulia, and Campania are the rich regions, which produce great quantities or olives, grapes, and wheat. Calabria and Basilicata are poorer, having a geography inhospitable to agriculture.<br />The author's strategy in the book is based, among other things, on three important aspects of what is available to her. First, many native southern Italian products simply do not travel well beyond their native land, in spite of the author's access to an excellent Manhattan source of Italian foods, DePalo Cheese, run by a family native to Basilicata. Luckily, this problem does not affect most classic ingredients like olive oil, hard cheeses, procuitto, and wines. Second, many Italian salumi products cannot be imported into the United States. Third, for many fresh ingredients, native American products are actually superior to what is available in Italy.<br />While the author relishes the wealth of American ingredients, she remains true to the Italian simplicity, especially in salads and soups. Unlike American and French salad constructions, she does not pile in everything but the kitchen sink. On the other hand, some classically influenced dishes such as the recipe for meatballs with green beans and potatoes doeshave a rather large ingredients list; however, the recipe is for meatballs, green vegetable, and starch.<br />My conviction that this is a superior treatment of it's subject is based on the fact that it says nothing which disagrees with things I have heard and read from reliable sources and it tells me much about the skillful use of many classic ingredients which I did not know or fully appreciate before.<br />If you are fond of an authentic Italian approach to food, like good writing about food, or are simply an all around foodie, then get this book. The spirit is all Italian, but the ingredients are very supermarket friendly. No heavy use of truffles or porcini or balsamic vinegar or even Parmesano Reggiano here. Unfortunately, you will probably feel just a bit left out if you don't have a good source of buffalo mozzarella at hand.<br />Highly recommended, especially for salads, vegetables, seafood, and pasta recipes.

Ms. Scarpetta has appeared on shows for both of her sponsors and she attributes the impetus behind this book to urging by Ms. Stewart. As with Gennaro's book, I would have paid this book no attention at all without the big name connections.<br />On first blush, it seems foolish for an amateur housewife to venture into the world so thoroughly explored by big name chef / writers such as Mario Batali, Lydia Bastianich, Marcella Hazan, and Giuliano Bugialli, just to name the currently most popular names in Italian cuisine writing. Ms Scarpetta does not even have the added cachet of a skillful culinary amateur Vincent Schiavelli, a well-known character actor and seasoned culinary writer.<br />Just as I wrap up all my reasons for pessimism, I actually start reading the book and discover that Ms. Scarpetta has captured a niche in culinary writing which none of the other names I have mentioned, even soul mate Gennaro, have touched. This is the role of the cook who genuinely cooks exclusively at home based on shopping done exclusively at retail markets in the Bronx' little Italy. She is not adapting restaurant recipes to the home or interpreting dishes done by Italian Nonnas or dishes written in 200 year old cookbooks. To this niche, Ms. Scarpetta adds a genuine passion and skill for canning and preserving, the talent that brought her to the attention of the Martha Stewart organization. This aspect immediately appeals to the unreconstituted `Whole Earth Catalogue hippie' in me, especially since I saw Ms. Scarpetta do her thing on Ms. Martha's show and it is easy to see the lady knows what she is doing.<br />Scarpetta describes her recipes as Italian American, based on the traditions of southern Italy in and around Naples, her birthplace. As such, the names of dozens of her recipes are immediately recognizable to regular readers of Italian cookbooks. Here we have yet another recipe for such classics as Eggplant Rollatini, Spaghetti Carbonara, Pasta Puttanesca, Chicken Cacciatore, Ossa Buco, Calzones, Sausage and Peppers, and several varieties of Minestrone. There are a fair number of original dishes, especially a wide variety of dishes featuring eggplant. There are also many good recipes for southern Italian torte for those of you totally jaded by Parisian and Viennese pastries.<br />There are a few general twists that differentiate Ms. Scarpetta's recipes from many others. The first is the prominent use of home preserved tomatoes (although a large can of Roma tomatoes is a satisfactory substitute). The second is to consistently replace Parmesano Reggiano with Pecorino Romano. Ms. Scarpetta says she prefers the stronger taste of the goat's milk cheese; however, it satisfies my sense of geographical fitness that Ms. Scarpetta from Naples would prefer the Roman product to the product from Parma, much further north on the Italian peninsula. The third is to actually prefer dried herbs to fresh in many cases. This is immensely satisfying, in that this is much more economical to the average cook and much more realistic, as even in warm Italy, an herb's growing season will probably fill only half a year. What do you do for the other half of the year? Ms. Scarpetta goes a step further and recommends that the home cooks take the effort to dry their own herbs. One reservation I have with the dried herb practice is in the use of dried basil. Every source I have ever seen on the subject prefers fresh to dried basil, fresh basil is available year round, AND, fresh hothouse basil available in your megamart is actually better than basil grown outdoors in the naked sun. I discovered thismuch to my surprise last year and have seen it written by veg experts since then.<br />Ms. Scarpetta provides all the information you need to do the home preserving she uses in her recipes and which I am sure she does herself with great skill and success. Preserving recipes cover drying herbs, canning artichoke hearts, marinated eggplant, canned sweet Italian peppers vinaigrette, canned roasted red peppers, canned caponatina spread, and (last but certainly not least) cured green olives. That's right. Ms. Eleanora cures her own Sicilian or Cerignola olives.<br />I've read almost every recipe and I find them all to be both of a professional quality and `just simple enough' but not too simple. All are worthy of the skills of premier restaurant chefs Mario and Lydia. It is important to note that Ms. Scarpetta had the assistance, as co-author, of Sarah Belk King, a well-known freelance writer and co-author for fellow Martha Stewart alumnae Sara Foster. Based on Ms. Belk's credits and acknowledgments, I suspect her contribution was primarily with cooking the words rather than with cooking the pasta.<br />The downsides of this book are few and depend on what you want from a new cookbook. While there are some family anecdotes herein, none have the richness and vibrancy I found in Genarro's work. Also, unlike Genarro's recipes, there are many, many standards that you will have in any number of other books on Italian-American cuisine. There was one ingredient in these recipes which puzzle me to no end. This is `fresh cheese'. I simply cannot visualize this ingredient except as cottage or farmer's cheese. I am also puzzled by the basic bread recipe, as it seems to use far too little yeast for the amount of flour, and a great amount of flour it is. For simple Italian bread, check out Gennaro or his student, Jamie Oliver's recipes in `Jamie's Kitchen'.<br />Highly recommended for genuine, straightforward Italian-American Home Cooking.much to my surprise last year and have seen it written by veg experts since then.<br />Ms. Scarpetta provides all the information you need to do the home preserving she uses in her recipes and which I am sure she does herself with great skill and success.

Its style of cooking reminds me of the famous comparison of Elvis to the Beatles as being like Campbell's soup to an Andy Wharhol silk screen of Campbell's soup. The one is utilitarian, the other is making art out of something utilitarian. This is not a criticism of Elvis or Campbell's soup or even of these recipes. It is simply a characterization that is meant to bring out its role in the world of recipes in a concise and illuminating way.<br />The book is a collection of recipes reprinted from the allrecipes.com web site that touts itself as the world's number one cooking site. As this is a review of the book and not the web site, I will not dwell on this claim except to point out that this means the book which may serve as a close parallel to this volume is the Food Network cookbook published about 9 months ago.<br />To begin my evaluation, I read all of the twenty (20) recipes listed in the `Recipe Hall of Fame' and I found all of the reasons I avoid this genre of recipe writing in my own cooking. The primary reasons I look elsewhere for recipes is:<br />Heavy use of packaged products such as soups, gravy mixes, cake mixes, and spice mixes.<br />References to packaged preparations are generic. No preferred brands or characterizations are cited.<br />Vague instructions. Interesting and important details such as best potato type to use are often left out.<br />Wrong instructions, such as directions to frequently move saut&eacute;ed meats before achieving a good sear.<br />Where I know of a similar recipe published elsewhere, alternate recipe is always superior.<br />Recipes tend to be high on empty calories relative to culinary value delivered.<br />Ironically, the packaged products and the unsophisticated methods lead to results that are not simple on the mouth. By simple, I mean what Richard Olney means by simple. Characteristics of the basic ingredients are enhanced rather than obscured by the recipe.<br />These are all my own reactions to this style of recipe. I should clearly say that if one cooks often, but has no patience with browsing a large number of cookbooks, this book may offer an important source of inspiration. The book may be especially welcome if you are a devotee of the allrecipe.com web site.<br />In comparing this book to the Food Network cookbook, it is clear that the two are in a completely different class. The allrecipe.com authors are all amateur home cooks and the Food Network authors are all professional cooks. The Food Network offerings have been tested in a professional kitchen and they have been offered to other food professionals. This does mean the Food Network recipes are, on average, more difficult and more time consuming to realize, but the results are a lot closer to the art of Andy Wharhol than they are to something which has come out of a can from New Jersey.<br />This book is a great outlet for creative amateur home chefs. Their efforts are not unlike what I do as an amateur writer churning out reviews for free on Amazon.com because it provides the fun without the agony of locating a professional venue in a magazine, newspaper, or even a culinary web site.<br />My best suggestion to the fine people who search out books of this type are to consider some professionally written sources which may fit their culinary objectives. If you are in need of fast cooking, check out Rachael Ray's books. If you need diversity with an international cachet, try Patricia Wells' books on Provencal cooking.

662389:US	39134375	R37ETKEK11TJ5Z	0688163769	178976663	The Mediterranean Kitchen	Books	5	42	46	N	N	Good Mediterranean Recipes for the Rest of Us. Recommended	I was just a bit disappointed when I began reading this book, as I was expecting something a bit more scholarly, based on the title, the very classy artwork on the cover, the impressive blurbs from Paula Wolfert and Jacques Pepin on the back cover, and the large number of expository books on Mediterranean cuisine by the likes of Ms. Wolfert. As it turns out, this book is neither a historical and geographical study like Claudia Roden's `The New Book of Middle Eastern Food', nor an analytical study of Mediterranean cuisine like Nancy Harmon Jenkins' `The Essential Mediterranean'. The book is teacher and restaurant chef Joyce Goldstein's interpretation of a cuisine which skips around the entire rim of the Mediterranean.<br />Since these other books and many like them have some interest beyond the recipes themselves, Ms. Goldstein's book will shine primarily if she succeeds in doing a better job with the recipes. After all, unlike the other authors who are primarily culinary journalists, Ms. Goldstein is a professional chef with credentials that include a stint at running the shop for Alice Waters at Chez Panisse.<br />Thus, what I did was to compare Ms. Goldstein's recipes to those for the same dish in the books by the culinary journalist / scholars. The first is the old war-horse Baba Ghanouj. Comparing Ms. Goldstein to Ms. Roden, the first difference one sees is that Ms. Goldstein adds pine nuts to the recipe and gives a wider range of presentation tips. The more significant difference is that Ms. Goldstein's procedure is just a bit fuller and fussier in its detail. While Ms. Roden clearly knows her stuff, Ms. Goldstein proves her professional kitchen experience here.<br />The second comparison was based on a Moroccan Lamb Tagine with Lemon and Olives, comparing again to Ms. Roden. The first thing which jumps out at you is that Ms. Goldstein is very clear that this is not an authentic dish, as she substitutes a lemon conserve for the traditional briny Moroccan preserved lemons prepared with salt. The second big difference is that Ms. Goldstein begins by marinating the lamb cubes with a spicy olive oil `rub'. The third big difference is that Ms. Goldstein (optionally) adds baby artichokes and specifies `Moroccan or Kalamata' olives to Ms. Roden's generic green olives. Lastly, Ms. Roden's method is specifically written to be done in a tagine, while Ms. Goldstein's procedure is more friendly to a commercial kitchen.<br />The third comparison with Ms. Roden was for a Fish and Couscous soup / stew. Ms. Roden's recipe is an Algerian recipe, while Ms. Goldstein bases her recipe on a suggestion from Paula Wolfert. Both recipes call for harissa and both books give recipes for same. Ms. Goldstein's recipe from Pantelleria adds Moroccan Charmoula (go figure), a spicy lemon / olive oil based fish sauce. The procedures are remarkably similar, although Ms. Goldstein's method is more clearly based on restaurant practice, where prepared fish fumet is used and lots of flavor are imparted by a long, refrigerated marinade.<br />As the pattern of differences with Ms. Roden the journalist have become clear, I decided to compare a pasta, Spaghetti alla Puttanesca from Ms. Goldstein to a `gold standard' recipe by Cooks Illustrated `best recipe' workup. True to the spirit of the dish, Ms. Goldstein's recipe is simple, but does not violate any cautions posed by the fastidious `Cooks Illustrated' interpretation. My only reservations with Ms. Goldstein's recipe is that it uses a prepared tomato sauce as an ingredient, which seems contrary to the spirit of the dish and she does not offer any suggestions on using the pasta cooking water to loosen up the sauce, if necessary.<br />In my last comparison, I decided to put Ms. Goldstein against the great (literally) Mario Batali's potato gnocchi recipe which Mr. Molto says has been done in his family since his Nonna made them. In all essential matters, the recipes follow almost identical steps, with the singlemajor difference that Ms. Goldstein bakes her russets rather than boils them as Mario does. Ms. Goldstein spent a great deal of research to arrive at this variation to tradition. Also, while Mario describes a simple well method done with riced potato, Ms. Goldstein adds many cautions regarding minimal working and the smallest possible amount of flour added. Other gnocchi recipes have also been more emphatic about being spare with the flour than Mario is, but then, his book is stressing simplicity and other books are not. I give Ms. Goldstein big points on adding to our understanding of this dish, even if I am sure Mario's technique is much more traditional. Ms. Goldstein's method will work better for those of us who have not been making potato gnocchi for the last forty years.<br />Ms. Goldstein's book literally takes a cooks tour of the Mediterranean with chapters on Appetizers; Antipasto and Other Mixed Plates; Mediterranean-Inspired Salads; Soups; Pasta; Beans, Rice, and Other Grains; Fish and Shellfish; Poultry; Meats; Vegetables; and Desserts. There is no plan to the selection and a clear statement that these are interpretations done for the restaurant, not traditional dishes.<br />The book includes a rather good chapter on wine recommendations. I cannot speak for the choices, as I know nothing about wine. I can only say the presentation of the wine selection rationale is as good or better than I have seen elsewhere.<br />Highly recommended source for a thoughtful, tasty, and very wide-ranging selection of Mediterranean dishes from Gibraltar to the Levant. Not always easy, but always fully explained.major difference that Ms. Goldstein bakes her russets rather than boils them as Mario does.

663038:US	39134375	R21B4BXPZJI1U4	1585674753	391171449	The Russian Heritage Cookbook	Books	4	41	43	N	N	Very Good Culinary Picture of 19th Century Russia	I have seen several cookbooks covering eastern European cuisines that are nothing more than collections of relatively simple recipes, where the primary objective is number of recipes and the secondary objective is a reasonable faithfulness to their sources. These books give no insights into the wellsprings of these cuisines and typically give only the simplest versions of classic recipes. This book does not fit this description. It is a rich evocation of 19th century Russian cuisine and it's influences, and those things it has influenced.<br />While the current edition is being published in 2004, this is the second edition of a book the author states was originally published 20 years ago, although the copyright page does not state the date of the first edition. The only reason for this I can see is that this is the first edition to be published in the United States. I bring this up for three reasons. First, if a book survives to a second edition, it means the first edition was well received and worthy of an update. Second, this means this worthy book was probably improved in the reissue. Third, and most interesting, is the fact that the two editions straddle the fall of the USSR, and the author has several interesting observations on this fact.<br />The author's introduction and the discussion of Russian cuisine in the USSR is an interesting take on Paula Wolfert's contention that one of the requirements for a sustenance of a great cuisine is an aristocracy which can support a class of creative chefs. This was certainly true of Czarist Russia, and it was certainly not true of Russia in the USSR. In spite of how immediate these events are to us, it is still surprising to read that even up to the very end of the Soviet regime, access to fresh or gourmet foods was difficult even in Moscow and St. Petersburg, and, this access is much greater today.<br />It is common knowledge that in the 19th century, Russia was enamored of all things French, especially of French cuisine. Many French chefs were brought in to cook for noble and wealthy families and many Russian chefs were sent to Paris to learn to cook the French cuisine (Some failed to use their return ticket). What may be less commonly known is that many French chefs returned from Russia and opened Russian cuisine restaurants in Paris. Other than France, the greatest foreign influence on Russian cuisine seems to be Scandinavia and fish from the Baltic and northern Atlantic. The most prominent local ingredients are, of course, caviar, vodka, eggs, dairy (yogurt and sour cream), rye, and kasha (buckwheat). The preservation method of choice is pickling. Root vegetables and mushrooms seem to play a very large part of this cuisine. The prominence of mushrooms seems surprising, as I most commonly associate them with temperate forests, not frozen steppes, but then again, Russia is a very large country.<br />The division of dishes into chapters gives us:<br />Zakuski, the Russian take on hors d'ourves and antipasti. I do not take the author seriously when she says this is a distinctly Russian custom after hearing stories of Italian Trattoria tables groaning under the weight of heaping antipasti. The stars of Zakuski are pickled herring, mushrooms, cucumbers, cottage cheese, and hard cooked eggs. In fact, I was surprised to find hard-cooked eggs with filling from spiced yolks so common, as it is also such an American stable.<br />Soups, or, borshch, borshch, and more borshch, and potatoes and onions (All spellings are Russian, not necessarily the most familiar spelling to American eyes, as in borshch for borscht).<br />Pirogs and pancakes includes the famous Russian platform for caviar, the blini.<br />Fish, primarily salmon, cod, pike, carp, and trout. A large number of recipes are simply for `fish'. It is probably not surprising that there are no recipes for salt cod, as it was probably cold enough to naturally refrigerate the fish for half the year. I suspect also that salt was not asplentiful as it was on the temperate Atlantic coast or certainly not as common as in the Mediterranean.<br />Meat and poultry features beef with many traditional Russian ingredients, as in Beef Stroganoff made with sour cream and served on noodles.<br />Vegetables, a classic intersection of Russian ingredients and French preparations. Potatoes and cabbage are the stars here, with a strong showing by mushrooms and other root vegetables and cabbage family members.<br />Desserts feature cakes and tortes. There are few tropical fruits here, but bananas and pineapple do make an appearance. Chocolate is common and cherries are very big along with kasha and dairy.<br />Sauces, jams, and drinks provides the usual pantry items, starring horseradish, beets, and sour cream.<br />The author is more of a scholar and writer than a chef and almost every recipe is attributed to a contributor who was born in Russia or born of Russian parents. The culinary cautions are a bit slim and an experienced amateur cook may have much more success with them than a total newbie.<br />The background writing approaches the quality found in works by Claudia Roden but not quite up to the breathless immediacy you can get from Paula Wolfert or the freshness you get from Patricia Wells or some of the better Italian regional cuisine specialists. Most of this is due to the fact that the subject is so clearly in the past, so some dryness may be expected.

This book presents the one hundred best recipes out of the five hundred soups the author / chef / owners have developed at the restaurants. This description alone promises a first class collection. I began reading the book with great expectations about the quality of the recipes.<br />One aspect of the recipes in this book is that since `Daily Soup' serves only soup, every recipe must be robust enough to be a full meal. The authors state this plainly in the beginning of the book. If you need a light soup, look to Barbara Kafka's `Soup, A Way of Life' or James Peterson's `Splendid Soups'.<br />Early in the book, it became clear to me that the authors truly have fun with their soups and succeed in communicating that sense of fun to you, dear reader. This is a rare commodity in culinary writing which you find as a rare spice to a few writers such as Julia Child and as a truly hot ingredient in the works of Alton Brown and Wayne Harley Brachman. This gave me even greater expectations for the book. The good humor appears in most general instructions, sidebars, headnotes, and selected chapters devoted entirely to whimsy such as the best soups to eat to various movies and the best musical accompaniment for some soups.<br />The introductory chapter(s) including a section entitled `Some Things to Remember' are pure gold in the world of advice about soup. The most interesting advice regarded temperature in general and freezing soups in particular. Another obvious but often forgotten fact about temperature is that every time an ingredient is added to a heated pot of soup or stock, the temperature will drop a bit, so one's figuring about how long the cooking will take and what must be done to keep the food a temperature which will kill any roaming bacteria who get the notion to join the party.<br />The authors organize their recipes in a sensible fashion, by primary ingredient. This is doubly sensible in their case in that almost every soup is hearty enough to satisfy one as a full meal should. Therefore, there are no broths and few soups with a small number of ingredients. The authors augment their classification by ingredient with one or more additional classifiers above the name of the soup. These classifiers include `vegetarian', `spicy', `dairy free', `vegetarian', and `low fat'. The principle ingredients, being recipe chapter names, are Vegetable; Tomato; Rice; Grain, Pasta, and Bread; Corn; Potato; Bean; Chili; Lentil and Pea; Nut; Coconut; Cheese; and Fruit. To these are added chapters on Roux based soups such as the gumbos and `Really Delicious Soups That Didn't Fit Into Any Chapter'. This chapter contains seven recipes. The perfect example of this is Bouillabaisse.<br />Bouillabaisse is also a perfect example of the fact that the authors are not standing on custom in the recipes they use. I was surprised to find them using a vegetable stock in the Bouillabaisse when a recent Tyler Florence show in Marseilles shows the stew being done with a very fresh fish stock. I also checked a recipe by Paul Bocuse. This recipe also uses a broth made from fish flesh and bones. Both French sources give recipes taking between an hour and a half and two and a half-hours. The `Daily Soup' recipe can be cooked and ready to serve in forty minutes, not including the ingredients prep and stock making. In fairness, the French recipes included the stock making in the timing. In the case of other classics such as chili, the authors can have it more than one way, as there are six (6) different chili recipes. Even so, all six recipes have a higher than traditional carb count from either beans or pasta. All this really means is that these ladies and gentlemen are creating their own versions of classic soups to fit the strategy of their recipe.<br />It is not at all surprising that all `Daily Soup' recipes are made with stocks prepared by `Daily Soup' itself. These stocksare so instrumental to the outcome of their soup recipes that I would feel uncomfortable in making any of these soups with anything less than a homemade stock, preferably one made by their recipe. Here is where I found a rare problem with the book. The authors in the introduction state that vegetables do not need to cook as long as meat in a soup. This agrees perfectly with statements in a recent text by the Culinary Institute of America, which goes on to give stock recipes which add the veg an hour before the stock is to be done. Somehow, the authors of this book overlook this advice when it comes to their meat stockmaking. In the lamb stock recipe in particular, they cover both meat and veg with the water and simmer together for four hours. I was also quite surprised at the two (2) hour cooking time for the basic fish stock. The fussiest fish stock recipes stop at 30 minutes. I have never seen an authoritative fish stock recipe that cooks for more than an hour. Most stop at 45 minutes. The other side of the coin is that all stock recipes are quite simple. Patience is the only ingredient that may be difficult to find.<br />I must say that all recipes look delicious and highly recommended. The `Daily Soup' recipes simply do not skimp on ingredients or the proper application of love and patience. Even the very simple Vichyssoise uses two types of potatoes and heavy cream. One last sale point is that the authors have converted several traditional non-soup recipes such as Peking Duck into soups. This gives added interest to the book, as if you needed it.<br />Highly recommended, serious soup making.

665982:US	39134375	R1O5R4TINFVWDV	0743224833	654617647	Celebration Breads: Recipes, Tales, and Traditions	Books	5	12	12	N	N	Excellent Special Topic Bread Book. Must Have for Bakers	I ordered this book by experienced and highly recognized bread baking author, Betsy Oppenneer, because I was having no luck finding a recipe for Eastern European Paska (Easter) bread in my many other weighty bread baking books. I had even looked into cookbooks of eastern European cuisines such as Hungarian, Polish, Russian, Slovakian and Ukrainian. I found only one, which was so simple, I was sure the authors did not give it a lot of thought, or, eastern European peasants really did make this kind of very simple bread because they simply did not have the money or access to saffron, dried fruits, and fresh butter.<br />I was pleased to find that Ms. Betsy had not one, but two eastern European Easter bread recipes spelled Paska in the Ukraine and Pashka (or Kulich) in Russia. As luck would have it, I had also found a Pashka bread recipe in the latest Easter issue of Gourmet magazine that was, of course, different from Ms. Betsy's recipe. Of course, Oppenneer anticipates this by saying that she often finds dozens or even hundreds of different recipes under the same traditional name. The problem is generally to find the recipe that most closely resembles your personal memory, especially if your Grammy didn't write this precious recipe down or your bakery source has gone out of business or moved its business to Orlando.<br />All of this is to warn you that even though a recipe you remember may be in this book, it may not be exactly the same as you remember from your childhood or from a trip to Prague or Marseilles or Casablanca. In spite of this warning, it seems to me that Ms. Oppenneer has done a real scholar's job of presenting a good take on a wide selection of the world's celebration breads. In the process, she has reminded us of how central bread is to many cultures' spiritual life. This alone, aside from nutritional questions, is enough for me to not give up my bread in all its varieties in the face of `low carbohydrate' diet doctrines. The best part of this book is that it does not limit itself to coverage of `Bread Central' running from Paris and Rome through Germany to Vienna and the Slavic lands in the Balkans and into the Ukraine and Russia to the Urals. There are interesting samples from northern Africa (Egypt and Morocco, of course), native America (and some European imports to the new world), the Middle East, Greece, Scandinavia, and a rather large contingent of breads from the British Isles, featuring the famous Irish soda bread, hot cross buns, and Shrovetide Pancakes. It should come as no surprise that there are no representatives from the Orient, as wheat, and therefore, bread, simply did not play a large part of their cuisine. I am just a little surprised that there are no samples from south Asia, as I know there are flatbreads common to Indian / Pakistani cuisines. No matter, as the author provides an excellent bibliography of books and that very new, very 21st century bibliography of Internet web sites.<br />All of these very good things would be of little value if the recipes and bread baking techniques in this MS were not up to snuff. Take my word for it. They are very up to snuff. The book does not give bread baking technique the great depth of treatment you may find in a volume by Peter Reinhart or in Rose Levy Beranbaum's `the bread bible', but I found the author's understanding of her subject and her skill with imparting that understanding to be as much or more lucid as these experts, who are dealing with the more difficult task of covering the entire world of bread, ingredients, and techniques. As far as she goes Ms. Oppenneer makes it all seem very, very easy, without skimping on any of the niceties. Her explanation of kneading and her rationale for that technique may be worth the price of admission for serious, amateur breadmakers.<br />As this is a book on specific breads and not on breadmaking in general, Ms. Oppenneer does not cover things like artisinal breads based on sponge, poolish, or biga. Infact none of these words appear in the index, even though I did find one recipe which used a sponge. One indication of this limited range is that Ms. Betsy gives four important steps to bread baking over four pages of text, while Beranbaum takes ten steps and about thirty pages to cover basic bread baking. This reinforces the fact that this book is not the only bread book you will need.<br />Aside from the interest in the subject of the book, the most interesting aspect of the book is that the author gives techniques based on up to four different types of equipment. These are your hands, a stand mixer, a food processor, and a bread machine. I never use a bread machine or a food processor to make bread so I cannot make any judgment on these techniques. I can say that the manual and stand mixer techniques are excellent, with many new twists on how to use this very versatile machine to make bread. Understandably, not every machine works with every type of bread. Next to manual techniques, the stand mixer is the most widely applicable method.<br />One somewhat disorienting position taken by the author is her not routinely blooming yeast before adding it to other ingredients. Just as I first learned to work with yeast by blooming active dry yeast in warm water and sugar, Ms Oppenneer says she first learned a simpler `standard' technique of simply suspending the active dry yeast in warm water. This is the method she uses in most recipes.<br />Highly recommended book for those who are looking for a traditional bread recipe. Also highly recommended for bread bakers in general.

668000:US	39134375	R1NYF5Z1S3ZLBK	0375404317	436983790	Julia and Jacques Cooking at Home	Books	5	54	55	N	N	French and American Home Cooking by two Masters	This book is a companion to a PBS television series on cooking demonstrated by Julia Child and Jaques Pepin where they concentrate on largely French home cooking, with much of the `meat' of the book being created by differences in approach between the two great culinary educators. Julia Child's justly famous `Mastering the Art of French Cooking' and the long series of PBS cooking shows are well known. It may be less well known outside the foodie world that Jaques Pepin is one of the leading authors of professional level books on cooking technique. The best known of these volumes is `La Technique' and `La Methode'. Pepin is also a professional educator in his role as dean at the French Culinary Institute in New York City.<br />It is probably pure destiny that these two culinary legends should collaborate on one or more projects. Pepin came to the United States in 1959 and almost immediately got a position as a chef at La Pavilion, based on his great good luck of being the chef to the family of Charles DeGaulle while DeGaulle was President of France. Three years later, Julia Child's book was published and Pepin was dumbstruck, as he felt that this is the book he should have written himself. Pepin was lead from the strenuous world of the professional kitchen to a career of writing and teaching when he was seriously injured in an automobile accident and he could no longer spend the long hours of standing.<br />This volume is a delight to read, even if you prepare none of the recipes in the book. In fact, the recipes tend to take a back seat to the dialogue between the two principles credited with the creation of the book. The book also enjoys one of the best possible support staffs available for culinary literature. Alfred A. Knopf publishes the book and the editor is Judith Jones, the same editor who convinced the Knopfs to print Julia Child's first landmark book. Knopf's artistic and production talent available for a major book publication has been applied to full effect. The text has the benefit of having been assembled by a professional culinary wordsmith, David Nussbaum, who culled the recipes and comments from the `authors' notes and the videotapes of the PBS TV series.<br />The general layout of the book is that each principle author provides a recipe on an important ingredient or dish such as mussels, shrimp, hamburger, or potato salad. Each major ingredient is accompanied by sidebars by one or both of the principle authors on either handling the ingredient or strategies for preparing the dish. Some of the most interesting encounters come when the principle authors do not agree on a technique. Some disagreements are surprising, as when Chef Pepin prefers the American technique of making a hamburger while Ms. Child prefers the French, where a savory shallot saute is worked into the middle of the hamburger patty. The index very cleverly color codes recipe titles indicating whether they were supplied by Ms. Child or Chef Pepin.<br />The point at which the recipes wrest your attention from the banter between the two authors is when the book offers a sample of French home cooking which has rarely if ever seen the inside of an American home kitchen outside of the world of professional chefs and professional foodies. The first such recipe is Jacques's Sausage in Brioche. This is a sort of French beef Wellington where sausage replaces the beef fillet and brioche replaces the puff pastry. This is not a recipe for wimps, as brioche dough typically must be risen overnight to fully develop the dough. Pepin does give a shortcut, but it is not recommended.<br />The topics of the recipe chapters are familiar to all who have looked through a French cookbook. These chapters are Appetizers, Soups, Eggs, Salads and Sandwiches, Potatoes, Vegetables, Fish, Poultry, Meats, and Desserts.<br />The photographic arts are put to very good use in this book. Not every dish is accompanied by a photo of the finished preparation, but every special technique is explained in great detail and demonstrated very effectively in pictures. And, the techniques are not limited to the usual cutting up a chicken and cleaning an artichoke.<br />If you have a happy collection of good cookbooks on classic French cookery, you probably already have recipes for many of the dishes in this book. You do not buy the book for only the recipes. You buy the book for the special insights these two major culinary educators can give you on dishes, ingredients, and techniques and for the riff created when their opinions are different.<br />The long and the short of it is that you buy this book for inspiration. I have yet to find a culinary teacher who can encourage me to try a difficult recipe as effectively as Julia Child. I can also not find a culinary teacher who can explain technique as well as Jacques Pepin.<br />Very highly recommended for foodies and fans of both principle authors.que is explained in great detail and demonstrated very effectively in pictures.

669146:US	39134375	RBZIL0CUBPLA1	047145043X	557603138	Cooking at Home with The Culinary Institute of America	Books	4	121	129	N	N	Textbook from Reliable Authority on Cooking. Some lapses	`Cooking at Home with The Culinary Institute of America' aims to arm the amateur cook with many of the tools of the professional and communicate the things which inspire a professional chef and set them apart from the amateur. The book comes to us with the authority of the foremost culinary school in the country and the aura of being a textbook with which it may seem to be sacrilege to take issue. This book does many very good things, but in popularizing it's subject, it does loose some depth and credibility.<br />The book does several very good things that almost entirely outweigh its few blemishes.<br />The first valuable lesson from this book is its characterization of the way students of professional cooking come to think about their vocation and its materials. In this way, the book can make you a more successful cook by adapting professional methods. The heart of the matter is to `learn to think critically about cooking' and `learn how to look at, touch, smell, and taste a dish to judge whether it is coming together'. A professional cook knows how to rescue a recipe when a step fails or an ingredient is unavailable. They know what Alton Brown calls the map of culinary facts and techniques, which surround recipes, and explains how they work. That is not to say that this book deals with culinary science a la Shirley Corriher. The terms `acid' and `gluten' don't even appear in the index.<br />The second valuable type of lesson in this book is the descriptions of general techniques and the explanations for how they work. An example is in the technique for preparing stocks where the book explains that flavors are extracted from vegetables within an hour after adding them to the simmering stock water. This means that if you expect to simmer your veal bones for four hours, you can wait for three hours before adding the vegetables. This measure is irrelevant, of course, for fish stocks, where the fish flesh and bones should be simmered for no more than 30 to 45 minutes. Much of this information is given in easily used tabular form as in the table of best cooking methods for cuts of beef, veal, pork, and lamb. My most useful suggestion regarding this information is to recommend you view this information with a critical eye. In one part of the book, it is said that analogous parts of animals are often best cooked by similar methods. However, the book cites braising as a preferred method for cooking beef chuck (shoulder), but does not give braising as a method for cooking lamb shoulder. While I see many recipes for grilling and broiling lamb shoulder, Chris Schlesinger and John Willoughby in `How to Cook Meat' specifically say that lamb shoulder is an excellent cut for braising. Regarding cooking temperature endpoints, the book is typically very conservative, largely following the USDA recommendations for reaching up to 180 degrees in chicken thighs when cooking whole birds. Reliable sources have recommended that reaching 165 degrees is quite enough, with less danger of drying out the white meat in the bird.<br />The third and possibly most valuable resource in this book is the collection of classic recipes with expert procedures which all but guarantee a satisfactory result. The pasta chapter, for example, begins with a basic tomato marinara sauce followed by such classics as pasta Puttanesca, pasta Primavera, pasta alla Carbonara, spinach and escarole lasagna, and (potato) gnocchi with herbs and butter. The collection does not contain every `classic'. You will not, for example, find coq au vin in the poultry chapter. But, the selection is very good. Each recipe contains a sidebar giving some insight into either an ingredient, technique, or serving suggestion. Each recipe also contains one or more references to other parts of the book where relevant techniques are explained.<br />One surprising weakness in the book is the cursory coverage of some basic cooking techniques. The chapter on poultry gives a description of how to cut a chicken into serving pieces, with only four steps and four pictures. A similar description in James Peterson's `Essentials of Cooking' takes thirteen steps with thirteen color photographs. The coverage of other basic techniques seems similarly skimpy.<br />One subtle but surprising lapse is in the description of basic cooking techniques. If you read the descriptions of shallow poaching and pan frying, it is quite unclear what the difference may be between the two methods. Neither method cites the most important fact that poaching is done in water and pan frying is done in oil and the difference in effect is based on the difference between 212 degrees of water cooking and 350 degrees or higher of oil cooking. The description of these methods does have some secrets to offer. I never before saw shallow poaching as an efficient method for creating a sauce by reducing the poaching liquid after the food has been cooked.<br />If you have no other cookbooks or no cookbooks that discuss general techniques, this is an inspiring introduction to cooking. Even if you have a small cookbook library, this book can be a worthy addition if you have no good books covering egg cookery or what this book calls `Kitchen Desserts'. These are dishes based primarily based of fruits, custards, puddings, cream, and prepared doughs such as puff pastry. The book does not cover breads, pastries, cakes, cookies, or other baked desserts typically done by a pastry chef. If you are interested in thorough discussions of cooking techniques, I recommend Alton Brown's `I'm Only Here for the Food'.<br />Recommended for sound, straightforward recipes and a great primer on cookspeak. Other books do a better job of explaining basic techniques.hicken into serving pieces, with only four steps and four pictures.

Bible Cookbooks)	Books	5	8	10	N	N	Authority on Regional Barbecue, and why Barbecue is Great	It is a little intimidating to take on the task of reviewing a 774 page book by the generally accepted foremost expert on grilling and barbecue in the country, especially since Steve Raichlens does such a good job of looking the part of barbecue expert. The job is doubly intimidating since I am among those poor 15% of all Americans who own no grill whatsoever. I don't even have the excuse of living in a cramped city apartment or, having once been a rather accomplished Boy Scout, having no expertise around an open fire. All of these in the face of Raichlen's claim that barbecue / grilling is the very best way to cook. Thus, in the face of the increased cost, skill levels, and inconvenience imposed by barbecue / grilling, I embarked on justifying to myself the accuracy of Raichlen's claim.<br />Before I do this, it is important to characterize exactly what barbecue is. As any more than casual viewer of Bobby Flay and other Food Network shows, it should be clear that the meaning of barbecue is very different depending on the traditions of different regions in the country. Regionality is so strong that barbecue even has two very different meanings in the North Carolina low country versus barbecue in the western hills.<br />One thing is certain. Even though cooking over an open flame is about as old as the taming of fire, the technique called barbecue, and the word `barbecue', did originate in the New World, first discovered by an early Spanish conquistador and published in Spain in 1526. From this simple American origin, the meaning of barbecue has expanded to the point where it is almost impossible to pin down with a simple definition. Some sources would say that it is not barbecue if there is no smoke coming in contact with the food. Others may connect barbecue with the use of rubs, marinades, or mop sauces, but by the author's including both baked goods, soups, and salads in a book on barbecue, I'm certain he does not limit the sense of the technique to any of these techniques. So, how can one characterize barbecue in a way which demonstrates why one may claim that it is the most desirable way to cook.<br />The first element one needs to barbecue is an open fire that may be fueled by wood, charcoal, or hydrocarbon gases. The second element is that the barbecue grill places the food above the fire on a grill in such a way that the food may be covered and that the heat may be applied to the food with cover in place or cover removed. The third element is that the grill is capable of creating smoke with different flavors by either adding aromatic wood directly to the fuel or to a stage where it can be heated by the gas flames. Barbecue involves hot smoking. Cold smoking used to create bacon is not part of the barbecue lexicon. The fourth element is that the grill is capable of creating cooking zones with low, medium, and high heat, and one can move the food from one area to the other very easily. Sauces, rubs, and marinades may characterize meat cookery, but they are not relevant to applying the barbecue techniques to baking, soups, or some vegetables. So, why is the barbecue technique so great, if, as some like me may be inclined to view it as a pain in the neck?<br />First, one can achieve cooking temperatures that may cause a meltdown in your kitchen Hotpoint oven. Second, with skillful maintenance of fuel, these high temperatures can be maintained consistently. They will not cycle as the oven's thermostat turns the heat source off and on to maintain a certain temperature. Third, it is (or at least should be) easy to move cooking food from one temperature to another. Fourth, the cooking method may add the flavor of smoke and cook at the same time, unlike indoor stovetop smokers or cold smokers. Varying the wood providing the smoke may vary this flavor. Fifth, a grill and supplementary equipment adds techniques for applying indirect heat, modified direct heat, and rotisserie cooking. The last thing I can think of is that the technique can be used for really large jobs such as a whole pig, deer, lamb, or other large animal carcass.<br />The other side of the coin is that in order to achieve this advantage; you need some cooking skills that you do not need on your trusty Hotpoint. That is where Steven Raichlen's book comes to the rescue. The book leaves no subject untouched. Chapters cover Salads, Breads and Pizzas, Beef, Pork, Lamb, Picnic Fare (burgers, hot dogs, and sausages), Poultry, Fin Fish, Shellfish, Vegetables for Vegetarians, Vegetables for the Rest of Us, Side Dishes, Barbecue Sauces, Rubs, and Desserts. The best part of this galaxy of recipes and techniques is that virtually all of them are traditional American recipes, for which Raichlen gives the source along with lots of sidebars and tips. The very best part of this lineup is that it pretty much covers all the different senses of `barbecue' in America.<br />While there are several expert sources on barbecue and grilling technique such as Bobby Flay and Chris Schlesinger, both of whom are credited in the book, I simply cannot see anyone choosing any other book as a starting point to take up barbecue. The information you need to get started at a low initial cost is complete and, need I say it, authoritative.<br />Very highly recommended.nique can be used for really large jobs such as a whole pig, deer, lamb, or other large animal carcass.<br />The other side of the coin is that in order to achieve this advantage; you need some cooking skills that you do not need on your trusty Hotpoint.

672531:US	39134375	R3I9MQ1WSWNMQD	0060198192	684968630	Welcome to My Kitchen: A New York Chef Shares His Robust Recipes and Secret Techniques	Books	5	13	13	N	Y	Restaurant Dishes with Restaurant Tricks and Tips	When Tom Valenti wrote his second book, ?Soups, Stews, and One Pot Meals?, he must have been concentrating on simple dishes to atone for the relatively complicated recipes he put in this, his first book. As always, ?simple? and ?complicated? are loaded words in culinary procedures. What appears complicated to some because it involves cooking several different components of a dish separately may be simple to others because each of the individual steps are simple and the end result leaves the flavors of the ingredients intact, or pleasantly accentuated by the cooking procedure and seasonings.<br />Valenti?s invitation to HIS kitchen is significant in that he is very fond of a few techniques which are uncommon among is colleagues in other restaurant kitchens. His most interesting twist is in the routine use of sugar as a seasoning along with salt and pepper. He is also exceptionally fond of using acids like citrus and white wine vinegars and bacon, especially smoked and double smoked bacon. It seems odd that a chef with Italian leanings and background is not dedicated to using pancetta; however, he finds it is a bit too salty to his taste. The author also shows an extraordinary respect for other common ingredients such as water. One comment on the author?s use of salt and pasta cooking water is to correct his adjusting the amount of salt to the amount of pasta. The proper technique should be to set the amount of salt by the amount of water. It is the concentration of salt in the water that is important, because that is the physical property that determines how much salt reaches the pasta.<br />While it is not Valenti?s object in this book to simplify recipes, he does make a special point of showing the cook the places at which it is appropriate to parts of dishes ahead of service. This doubles the value of the book. The primary value of cookbooks by talented professional chefs is to provide recipes with a lot of pizzazz for entertaining. Valenti adds the restaurant tricks which allow the prep chefs to do the kind of advance work which makes the line chef able to put together the dish quickly at the time of service. The author even succeeds in describing how to bring a risotto to an almost complete state, and hold it ?in stasis? until it can be finished for service.<br />Otherwise, Valenti does not skimp on the details. He provides a larger than average selection of stock and broth recipes, which impress me because they include a mushroom stock. Ever since I tasted the water left from rehydrating dried mushrooms almost forty years ago, I wondered why mushroom broth was not a more important ingredient in cooking.<br />Valenti?s selection of dishes is an entertaining mix of old standards such as Panzanella salad and a Cuban sandwich with inventive original (or at least unusual) dishes. There are also some dishes that give a very useful twist on favorite combinations. Broccoli Rabe and sausage is a classic Italian combination (See Lydia Bastianich?s Italian cookbook). Valenti adds variety to the dish by adding orecchiette, making it a full veg / starch / protein dish. He also adds interest by incorporating a recipe for homemade sausage to make the dish even more interesting. I may be inclined to find his method for creating loose sausage meat just a bit too simple, but as the author points out, the homemade sausage will make a huge impression on your guests. Speaking of sandwiches, this is one of the very few cookbooks which presents a good selection of recipes for sandwiches. And, these are not your typical deli style fare. Some recipes such as the classic Poorboy are fairly simple, but others are pretty involved. Most recipes use both fish and vegetables in unusual ways as in the grilled vegetable sandwich and the saut?ed spinach sandwich.<br />Aside from the chapter on sandwiches, the chapters are typical of almost every other Italian-centered cookbook, with chapters on Salads; Soups; Pasta and Risotto; Fish and Shellfish; Poultryand Game; Meats; Accompaniments; Vinaigrettes and Mayonnaises; and Desserts. The fish chapter is one of the largest, since fish and fishing is one of his passions. Valenti is true to his word at the beginning of the book as bacon appears in many recipes, even many fish recipes. Most of the desserts are fruit based and typical of an Italian sensibility.<br />One of the more distinctive characteristics of this book is the clarity in which the author presents recipes that may be just a bit on the complicated side for inexperienced cooks. Every recipe has an informative headnote that may explain the origin of the recipe or something of its attraction. All ingredients are neatly presented in a nicely shaded box with clear prep directions. The main attraction is the fact that the procedure is broken down into simple sentences, each beginning with the most important operative word in the technique. It is crystal clear that each step is to Warm or Add or Transfer or Lay or Repeat or Remove or do something Carefully of Gently. Valenti has done exactly what I do when I transcribe recipes by breaking everything down into simple steps.<br />Most dishes, especially main course dishes, are accompanied by a no nonsense wine recommendation.<br />Highly recommended for dedicated amateurs. The author does not compromise on technique.

675514:US	39134375	R2CX9K34SFYU2E	2080112511	542677719	Michel Biehn's Healthy Recipes: International Cuisine from a Provençal Table	Books	2	14	15	N	N	Enjoy the Experience of Reading a Really Bad Book	Reading this glossy volume from a culinary series by the French publisher Flammarion, translated into English by an Englishman is similar to watching a howlingly bad movie where the main interest is in locating all the mistakes in continuity, editing, and dialogue, in French, with English subtitles.<br />The odd thing is that this series includes an excellent, albeit glossy, survey of French cooking by the great Paul Bocuse, which I found to be a worthy addition to anyone's collection of French cookbooks.<br />The gaffs in the book range from minor to astronomical.<br />The important thing to remember is that this is a book on healthy eating. When Americans read a book on this subject, they expect at least some semblance of basis in accepted scientific findings of the day, even if the usual encumbrance of footnotes and other scholarly reference devices are absent. A quick look at such popular titles as `Nourishing Traditions' by Sally Fallon demonstrates my case. This excellent and popular book is simply dripping with scholarly references. The book being examined in this review has no references to scientific findings whatsoever. Even worse, the primary nutritional foundation of the author's culinary arguments is based on the conjecture that one should not eat animal protein and carbohydrates at the same meal. The author says he cannot remember from whom he heard this bit of wisdom, but that he thinks it was someone from California. I'm not kidding. This book really says that. The book follows this undocumented principle throughout, even to the extent of revising recipes for Salade Nicoise to create two, one with the potatoes and one with the tuna.<br />The very first thing that gave me a clue that we are not dealing with a serious cookbook here was the layout of the `recipes'. Almost every cookbook with recipes published for serious cooking (Including the contribution of Paul Bocuse to this series) are written with separate lists of ingredients and their amounts followed by a procedure. Good books further separate headnotes on background and sidebars on technique from the main procedure. This book does none of that. The entire description is in plain text, as if it were lifted from a novel, except that I think that if Tony Bourdain put a recipe in one of his novels, he would write it as if it were in a proper cookbook.<br />Another major gaff is in the author's statement that breakfast should be one of the largest of the day, with time spent to eat it sitting down, with some deliberation, with more food than you eat at dinner. This is followed with references to `an adequate breakfast' that is composed of nothing more than toast with peanut butter and honey, fruit juice, and tea. This fits our picture of a classic `Continental Breakfast' rather than a large meal.<br />Practically every other page seems to contain a little howler in either the text or the pictures. I suspect some may be lapses in translation. Others almost seem like they are due to the pictures and captions being done by someone who had not read the book, let alone wrote the book. One picture shows a glass of milk, apple, and cheese with blueberries with a caption citing a glass of orange juice and a bowl of muesli. Incredible.<br />It is not hard to form the opinion that the real rationale of this book is as a vehicle to display photographs of a very elegant, very Provencal chateau that it would seem the author had some role in renovating. It may almost seem that interior decoration is the author's true vocation. He just happens to write fluffy books on culinary subjects as a sidelight. The only thing which puts a lie to this picture is that the author's story of how he came to the decision to lose weight and his general techniques for accomplishing this have a ring of authenticity about them. Aside from the pretty pictures, one could get a fair amount of inspiration and hints about good eating from this book.<br />I suspect this book may have been done to fulfill some contractual agreements for a certain number of works between the publisher and the author. I give it two stars rather than one because of the entertainment value similar to the experience of watching a truly bad Ed Wood sci fi movie. Buy it if you like pictures of French chateau and can find it on the bargain pile for less than $10. The $35 list price is a joke.lfill some contractual agreements for a certain number of works between the publisher and the author.

Very Good First Italian Cookbook	This is the third \\"la cucina Romana\\" cookbook I will have reviewed in the last six (6) months. The first two were `Cooking the Roman Way' by David Downie and `In a Roman Kitchen: Timeless Recipes from the Eternal City' by Jo Bettoja. Both have been published within the last two years. A Roman cookbook certainly seems to be a growth industry.<br />The most important thing to know about this book is that it is more different from the other two titles than these earlier volumes are from one another. `Rome, at Home' by Suzanne Dunaway is a chronicle of the dishes the author cooks in her home in either Rome or Los Angeles. Being only the `Spirit of la cucina Romana' and not the letter of the cuisine, the recipes have a habit of wandering all over the map of Italy. The intent and the content of the two earlier books is to more carefully document Roman dishes as offered by specific restaurante and trattoria in Rome itself.<br />This book includes almost every classic Roman recipe I know, including<br />Cipolline in Agrodolce (Little onions in sweet and sour sauce)<br />Carciofi alla Giudia (Artichokes fried in the Jewish Manner)<br />Spaghetti alla Carbonara (Spaghetti with Pancetta and Eggs)<br />Pizza Bianca (White Pizza)<br />Gnocchi alla Romana (Semolina Dumplings)<br />Trippa alla Romana (Tripe in Tomato Sauce)<br />What is surprising is that the book does not include the very Roman dish `Saltimbocca alla Romana'. In its place are several dishes with origins in other parts of Italy such as Ragu Bolognese, Pizza Napoletana, and Ossobuco in Bianco (Milanese).<br />As this is a book on how the author cooks at home, the recipes follow the well-known Italian culinary practice of buying the very best, freshest ingredients, and doing as little as possible to them to bring them to the table. This is not to say the recipes are overly simple. The author quotes Einstein on this point when he said that the object is to make things as simple as possible, but no simpler. To this end, the author does not skimp on any steps that may surprise conventional wisdom. In a recipe for Caponata (Sweet and Sour Braised Vegetables) for example, she takes the time to salt cut eggplant to draw out some moisture and bitterness. I do sense, however, a few assumptions being made about the cook's knowledge of cooking, as I find no warning against burning the garlic when saut&eacute;ing, as in the recipe for Spaghetti alla Puttanesca.<br />The book's contents are organized in the same manner as almost every other traditional Italian cookbook with chapters on:<br />Antipasti<br />Primi, with Minestre, Pasta, and Risotto<br />Secondi, with Pesce (Fish), Pollame (Poultry), Carne (Meat), and Cacciagione (Game)<br />Contorni (Side Dishes)<br />Pane, Focaccia, e Pizza (Bread, Flatbread, and Pizza)<br />Dolci (Sweets)<br />Note that the author's primary vocation is bread baking, so the chapter on breads is not simply filler.<br />The glue which holds the book together is the story of how the author originally fell in love with the city of Rome, how she met her husband in Rome, the tempo of her life when in Rome, and her approximation of the world of Roman cuisine based on materials available in southern California. Like many other travelogue cookbooks such as Patricia Wells new `The Provence Cookbook', this volume includes a list of the addresses, telephone numbers, and pr&eacute;cis of local Roman eateries and food shops. These bits of lore can put you in the clever little Food Network promo that has a NY foodie ordering food to go from a restaurant in China. The author breathes some Roman air into the anecdotes by giving proverbs, phrases, and words not only in Italian, but also in the local Roman dialect. Thankfully, all local linguistic color is translated into English.<br />One symptom of how this book is less academically inclined is the fact that the index is definitely not bilingual, unlike the two earlier books. This means that when I tried to find Dunaway'srecipe for `Cipolline in Agrodolce', I had to do a little mental translation, as Dunaway's index only had an entry for `Cipolline in sweet and sour sauce'. This probably means absolutely nothing to the American home cook who is not trying to compare three cookbooks. In spite of the liberal seasoning with both the Italian and Roman language, this book is organized entirely in English. All recipes are titled in Italian, but consistently subtitled and indexed in English. Another small lapse may be the absence of eggs, celery, and mint from the author's otherwise very good list of Roman ingredients. Eggs pervade the recipes in many unusual ways and celery and mint are famously abundant Roman ingredients.<br />This book successfully evokes the sights and smells and sounds of the Roman market in words, with a friendly assist from watercolors of simple Roman scenes and food painted by the author herself. I am no fan of photographs of food in cookbooks. Rampant food styling tricks and fuzzy photography give no guarantee that you are seeing anything close to what you may actually make at home. I would much rather have my saltimbocca recipe back.<br />With a list price under $30, this is an excellent first book on Italian cookery. The recipes are authentically Italian, based on ingredients available to almost all Americans, wrapped up in a successful evocation of the Roman culinary environment. As such, it is as good as or better than Mario Batali's `Simple Italian Food', a much more appropriate paradigm than the two scholarly treatment of Roman cuisine cited above.<br />Highly recommended for simple ethnic cooking.ce', I had to do a little mental translation, as Dunaway's index only had an entry for `Cipolline in sweet and sour sauce'.

678257:US	39134375	R1XOHXL4NIHO3M	1579904610	506764798	The Artful Cupcake: Baking & Decorating Delicious Indulgences	Books	4	67	67	N	Y	Worthy Resource for baking AND DECORTATING cupcakes	I was delighted to find this book since, a few weeks ago, I looked through all my many books on baking for a simple cupcake recipe and I could find but one true cupcake recipe. And this was with a cake recipe on which I was not keen. I was doubly surprised to find not a single decent cupcake recipe at the Food Network web side at the time.<br />Upon reading this book, the first thing which struck me was that it was as much or more a craft book than it was a book on baking. The first clue is that the publisher specializes in craft books. It is not one of those major cookbook houses like Knopf, Clarkson Potter, Wiley, or even Ten Speed Press. The next clue is that the author's previous books are all on craft topics such as decorating with lights, gel candles, silk flowers, and scarecrows. The story becomes clearer when it is evident that the name on the front cover, Ms. Marcianne Miller, is probably much more a collector and editor of ideas than an author, let alone a baker. Among the fourteen (14) `Contributing Designers' names at the end of the book, her name appears last. A minority of the thirteen other individuals named and profiled here are professional bakers. Most are amateurs whose main vocation is in the arts, crafts, or non-baking part of the food service industry.<br />All this is to make the impression on you, dear reader, that this book is less about baking cupcakes than it is about baking AND DECORATING cupcakes. This is not to say this is a poor book. Just the opposite is true. This is a very good little book on baking AND DECORATING cupcakes.<br />The book begins, as expected, with basic baking. On this matter, the book is brief, but flawless in giving you the essentials of cupcake baking. As part of this introduction, it describes silicone muffin pans and mini-bundt pans, neither of which have I taken much notice until I saw them here. The section on basics includes an extremely useful instruction on how to convert all but sponge cake recipes into a cupcake recipe, based on the size of cake pan for which the recipe is scaled. The introduction continues with basic instructions on frosting and icing and how to use piping bags and other decorating equipment. The most important information in the intro is the three basic cupcake recipes for Classic White, Easy Yellow, and Chocolate Buttermilk cupcakes. This is followed by three basic recipes for classic buttercream, ivory buttercream, and cream cheese frostings.<br />Each of the remaining thirty-six main sections are a pairing of a cake recipe with a topping or decorating technique. Most of the cake recipes are familiar, but some such as the key lime tarts and the chocolate truffle cupcakes are quite a pleasant surprise. Not every section introduces a new cake, but every section does introduce a new decorating style, technique, or topping. Some of the toppings are borrowed from well-known standards such as a Maple Walnut Streusel and white chocolate roses. Many other toppings are elaborate. Some are elaborate in the extreme such as the chocolate domes which are worthy of a major pastry talent such as Jaques Torres or Pierre Herme.<br />The cupcake styling chapters are interspersed with sidebar sections on special techniques and ingredients such as baking with nuts, baking with fruit, fruit glazes, baking with spices, small decorative touches, and decorative sugars. I found no deep insights, or even any new facts in these sidebars, but they were often assuring me that my experience was not taking me off in the wrong direction.<br />If, like me, your primary interest is in baking and not in crafting, you will probably get your money's worth from the cake, frosting, and icing recipes. If you are primarily a craft person, you will get the straight scoop on the baking and lots of ideas for show-off decorations.<br />As a sturdy hard cover book for less than twenty dollars list, this book is a worthy addition to your library, as long as you have the need to make cupcakes, especially for kids, at least three or four times a year. The only thing the authors overlooked was to provide at least one cupcake suggestion for each major holiday where a cupcake might be an appropriate dessert such as New Years Eve, Valentine's Day, Easter, Mother's Day, Halloween, Christmas, and a child's birthday. I guess you will have to rely on Martha Stewart for this.<br />Highly recommended if you have the time and inclination to do fancy cupcakes., especially for kids, at least three or four times a year.

Not only does he simply write about dessert recipes, but he claims to write, in this book at least, exclusively about original recipes.<br />The story of how this book came about makes perfect sense to anyone whose mind has wandered. When Jeremy was testing and tasting an interminable queue of cornbread recipes for his first cookbook, he was daydreaming of potential book titles. This one lit him up like the famous lightbulb over the head. The task was then to come up with recipes that deserved the title.<br />By the author's count, the book contains sixty recipes. His objective is to avoid the situation he encounters with other cookbooks where a quarter of the recipes are good, a quarter of the recipes are so so, and half the recipes are filler. The challenge with these books is to find the recipes in the quarter of good recipes. While I suspect Jackson's estimate of average recipe quality may be just a bit more dismal than what we encounter among respectable authors, I think he has a point. The question about this book, then, is `Has Jeremy Jackson succeeded in publishing sixty original, better than average desserts?' As I suggest in my opening sentence, I believe the answer is `almost'.<br />On the easier question of originality, the very simple answer is that not all recipes are original, by the author's on admission. The very first recipe in the last chapter of nine `Basic Recipes' is attributed to the very good book by David Libovitz, `Room for Dessert'. I suspect that there is also not a lot of originality in the remaining eight basic recipes or their variations. People have been making pate sucree, pate brisee, and ganache for centuries. I doubt the author has anything startling to tell us about these. Several dessert recipes also have the look of being only small variations on well-known classics. The first traditional title which catches my eye is the Apple Galette.<br />In spite of the appearance of a few standards, I do believe that the majority of the recipes in the book deserve the label of `original'. I say this with the understanding that I have not read every dessert book ever written, so some of these recipes may be variations on recipes as old as Monsieur Careme himself. I will only say that the recipes which strike me as original seem, at the very least, to not be the product of the imaginary computer program the author concocts to visualize how many recipes in large cookbooks may be created.<br />The very first recipe in the first chapter on fruits immediately catches my attention as a very clever adaptation of the savory cooking en papillote to the construction of a delightfully surprising dish. The very next recipe gives us an Earl Grey applesauce recipe which I suspect never crossed the minds of the Pennsylvania Dutch who spent so much time perfecting apple dishes. In general, all but the last recipe for a banana smoothie in the chapter on fruit desserts has the strong smell of originality about it. The next chapter on custard based desserts show somewhat less pure originality and somewhat more variation on classics. The three lemon cheesecake seems like an especially delicious addition to the canon of cheesecake recipes. The chapter on pies and tarts opens with a delightful maple custard tart. In fact, the opening recipe in each chapter seems to be an advertisment for the author's originality.<br />I give the author extra credit for not dwelling on the details or explanations of what makes good pastry. Many very competant writers on pastry, most notably Sherry Yard in her new book `The Secrets of Baking' have covered this ground quite well already. The author does give just enough attention to being careful with your ingredients to insure that no one will shoot themselves in the foot by using an inappropriate substitution when making these dishes. I am a little surprised that he believes there is a big enough difference between Gold Medal all purpose flour and King Arthur all purpose flour to make a difference in these recipes. I know there is a difference, but I'm surprised that a 2-3% difference in protein will make that big a difference. But, he's the baker and I am not, so take his word for it.<br />One result of this light touch around the details of pastry practice and science is that this book may not want to be your very first experience with touchier techniques like cheesecake, caramel, and melted chocolate. I was surprised at the atypical techniques used in the cheesecake recipe where the recipe starts out with a very hot oven without the benefit of a water bath. I was especially surprised at the prediction of cracks in the cheesecake, until I saw that the cake was to be covered with a glaze which would heal all wounds.<br />As far as the overall quality of these recipes, I believe that most are very, very good. I did find some which may simply not be the very best use of it's ingredients. The rhubarb cobbler, for example does not come close to the delightful things Wayne Harley Brachman has done with rhubarb in a pie in his book `American Desserts. I don't even thing the recipe is a true cobbler.<br />The single most delightful aspect of this book is the fact that so many of the recipes are short and relatively simple, as long as you are the master of pastry dough and simple chocolate handling. The high quality of the recipes coupled with the very low list price make this book a sure thing.<br />Very Highly recommended, with many simple, easy delicious recipes.

681580:US	39134375	R3J2611NS0QO17	0743255216	465434359	the girl & the fig cookbook: More than 100 Recipes from the Acclaimed California Wine Country Restaurant	Books	5	22	26	N	Y	Another Star Practicioner of California Cuisine sans Pizzas	This book by restaurant owner Sondra Bernstein, with recipes by executive chef John Toulze represents the cuisine served at a chain of Sonoma County based restaurants after which the book is titled. Based on the passions of Ms. Bernstein and her staff, the book and the restaurants focus on figs; dishes based on figs; the produce of Sonoma County; the cuisine of Provence, France; and the similarity of the terroir of Sonoma with Provence.<br />One object of the book is to publicize the chain of restaurants and the line of products based on the owner's love of figs. This is not too unusual, as I am certain this is one of the motives behind every celebrity chef / restaurant owner's cookbook. Some, like Tom Colicchio are less obvious about this interest. Others, like Emeril Lagasse, are pretty out front about this objective. All restaurant based cookbooks aim at providing the reader with some twist to their cuisine or it's presentation which adds sugar to the bait to create an interest in the restaurant(s).<br />One special feature of this book is borrowed from Ms. Bernstein's distinguished California culinary neighbor, Thomas Keller of the French Laundry. This is the addition of sidebars on some of the restaurants' more important, or, at least, more interesting suppliers. This includes fig, mushroom, and cheese vendors, past and present. This highlights one weakness to the book, in that it is so thoroughly based on what is available from the gardens and vineyards of Sonoma County. Not everyone in the United States is blessed with access to wild mushrooms and the talented foragers who supply them, or to cheeses from artisinal cheese makers. Happily, the chef / recipe writer has supplied generally available products to substitute for his Sonoma pantry.<br />The cornerstone of the book's cuisine is the parallel between the Sonoma and Provence produce and the cuisine which can be based on that similarity. Therefore, it should be no surprise to see most recipes appear to be straight out of the pages of books by Patricia Wells and Lydie Marshall. One of the most pleasant parallels is that the Bernstein / Toulze cuisine is based on fairly simple recipes, often with the kind of recipe modularity of sauces and pantry preparations common to an influence from Julia Child. The recipes for stocks, for example are about as simple as they come. There is no Thomas Keller / Judy Rodgers obsessiveness about technique here. Most recipes follow a recent quote I heard from Wolfgang Puck who said that the trick was to start with great ingredients and try not to mess them up. There are some unusual twists, such as the cooking oil of choice, a `blended oil' of one part olive oil and three parts canola oil. I am totally baffled that disciples of Provencal cuisine should eschew pure olive oil.<br />The recipes are organized by size and role of the dish rather than by main ingredient. Recipe chapters are:<br />`a small bite' hors d'ourves with figs, radishes, mushrooms, olives, shellfish, charcuterie, and crackers<br />`from the garden to the stockpot' soups, including many Provencal classics<br />`in the salad bowl' with lots of vinaigrettes, figs, asparagus, beans, endive, beets, walnuts, and cheese<br />`large plates' 25 familiar dishs such as pastas, coq au vin, duck cassoulet, and lamb shanks<br />`sauce over and under' with lots of butter, aioli, pistou, rouille, citrus, shallots, remoulade, and figs<br />`on the side' with lots of balsamic reductions, familiar vegetable, polenta, couscous, olives, mushrooms...<br />`sweets' with lots of figs, apples, pears, nuts, lavender, cheese, and cream<br />The cuisine owes a fair amount to the exchange of cuisine between Provence and northern Italy, with a fairly substantial contingent of recipes involving pasta, risotto, polenta, cipollini onions and balsamic vinegar. This makes the abandoning pure olive oil in favor of the blended oil even more puzzling. In spite of this mystery, I am certain that these recipes, especially those based on figs, are superior to many and worthy of the authors' dedication to Provence.<br />One very serious aspect of the restaurants' connection to Provence is Ms. Bernstein's commitment to wines based on varietals originating in the Rhone valley rather than the wines which made Napa and Sonoma wines famous. These are the Carignane, cinsault, Grenache, Roussanne, Syrah and Vognier grapes. All but the Syrah are unfamiliar to me, but that's just a symptom of my ignorance of wine. Each recipe gives a very simple recommendation of wine selected from this list. The emphasis on simple is important to contrast it to the elaborate, sometimes arcane recommendations given by Patricia Wells and others.<br />The authors' dedication to their chosen cuisine and their featured product is genuine and fruitful, producing many simultaneously simple and worthy recipes. There are occasionally long recipes for standards such as cassoulet and coq au vin, but that should be no surprise. They have convinced me to look forward to a visit to their restaurants if I ever get to northern California.<br />Recommended recipes for even novice cooks. A good read at a fairly reasonable list price. If you already own 10 books on Provence cuisine, you may want to take a pass.ly those based on figs, are superior to many and worthy of the authors' dedication to Provence.<br />One very serious aspect of the restaurants' connection to Provence is Ms. Bernstein's commitment to wines based on varietals originating in the Rhone valley rather than the wines which made Napa and Sonoma wines famous.

682564:US	39134375	R2KC7ND1I3LZ8K	0394532643	319448537	The Way to Cook	Books	5	246	253	N	Y	Julia Child for Everyday Cooking. Excellent Teaching Source	`The Way to Cook' was written by Julia Child and published by Knopf about 27 years after the first publication of `Mastering the Art of French Cooking' which established Child's reputation. So, it was published when Julia Child was a household name for over two decades. It was meant to be her most important culinary work. It has never replaced Child's first book in the hearts and minds of America's foodies, in spite of the fact that the book opens with a statement that the book means to address Americans' new health consciousness and their diminishing time available to cook.<br />This is still a very, very good book. Unlike the more famous `French Cooking', this book is much more concerned with teaching the art of cooking. In fact, Ms. Child originates an idea here that has reached its fullest fruition in the style of Rachael Ray's 30-Minute Meal rubric. Ray succeeds in putting out fast meals not by using a lot of processed supermarket preparations, but by using knowledge of cooking to make the best of basic ingredients. This is not to say Ms. Child is doing fast cooking. Many recipes are pretty involved. I can still remember doing Julia's take on a barbecue recipe which involved making both a sauce and a rub from a goodly number of ingredients and a substantial amount of time required to slow cook the ribs. I got pretty hungary by the time I was finally finished.<br />Teaching is so important to the object of this book that it is one of the very few books I know which could easily serve as a good textbook for a course on cooking. The only other book I know in this category would be Madeline Kammen's `The New Making of a Cook'. It is important to distinguish both of these books from the `how to cook everything' titles such as the `Joy of Cooking', `James Beard's American Cookery' or Mark Bittman's `How to Cook Everything'. The purpose of these books is to give detailed coverage to a wide range of methods rather than simply be a repository of a large number of recipes.<br />The most distinctive feature in this book which supports it's object to teach cooking is the notion of the master recipe. A classic example of this approach is the master recipe for `Ragout of Chicken and Onions in Red Wine'. If this dish doesn't sound familiar to experienced cooks, it should be, because the very famous French recipe `Coq au Vin' is a variation of this master recipe. The classic simply adds lardons, mushrooms, and brandy and replaces sliced onions with `brown braized white onions'.<br />In addition to master recipes and variations, there is a wealth of notes on techniques to improve your results. In discussing the use of lardons, there is a note which recommends blanching bacon and salt pork before adding it to a recipe to remove salt and smoky flavor. I am certain this is an optional step, but it is welcome to me as I often avoid recipes using salt pork to avoid the somewhat noisome smell of smoked fatty tissue which may come from cooking smoked pork.<br />Another feature of the book which fits the master recipe model is that variations on the ragout master recipe are not limited to recipes for chicken. Rather, the same section includes ragouts of turkey and rabbit. The same principle is used throughout the book where foods are grouped by method of preparation rather than by source (pig, cow, lamb, calf, fowl).<br />Still, the chapters are true to a fairly classic organization, with some topics you may not find in the usual work. The chapters are: Soups, Breads, Eggs, Fin Fish &amp; Shellfish, Poultry, Meat, Vegetables, Salads, Pastry Doughs, Desserts, Cakes &amp; Cookies.<br />The chapter on Breads covers just four master recipes, but it will give you a thorough and satisfying experience which will tell you if you have the kind of love for baking which warrents exploring specialized works by such experts as Peter Reinhart or Nancy Silverton.<br />The chapter on Pastry Doughs also just covers four master recipes, Pate Brisee, Puff Pastry, Pate a Choux, and Crepes. I may not be willing to take on puff pastry any time soon, but I would expect that the other three master recipes should be enticing enough to remove a cooks fears about making pies, crepes, and eclairs. Crepes especially should be an entertainer's best friend in that the batter can be made well in advance and, if necessary, the crepes themselves can be made in advance and reheated. If you want them fresh, it takes but a minute or two to cook a crepe, and it makes great kitchen theater, especially if you master the technique of flipping the crepe.<br />I suspect the must useful chapter may be the one on eggs. Knowing ones way around egg cookery will take you a goodly distance toward being able to prepare really great dishes from standard pantry. I find that an author's discussion of how to make an omelette is often a good test of the quality of their book as a whole. I can say that Julia comes through for me by citing an omelette technique I have seen nowhere else. That is, the warning to limit oneself to two eggs when you have only a typical household burner available.<br />As the book is published by Knopf, the layout, editing, and photography are first rate. I was just a little surprised when I could not find `barbecue' in the index, yet there is clearly a master recipe for barbecue in the chapter on meats. The very best feature of the book is Julia's very familiar voice and attitude which carries you on with reassurances that you can do it and these techniques will do you great service in your life.<br />Very highly recommended.

The very best feature of the book is Julia's very familiar voice and attitude which carries you on with reassurances that you can do it and these techniques will do you great service in your life.<br />Very highly recommended. Lots of French recipes and lots of modern appliances put to good use.	2004-05-03

This book is very much about cooking for six to eight people when you have plenty of time to spend in the kitchen.<br />The first symptom that the book deals with seriously large scale cooking is in the stock recipes. They all recommend using a 16-quart stock pot. Most other recipes, even the fastidiously exact Alton Brown demonstrates stock making with only a 12-quart stockpot. All the stock recipes, including chicken, beef, veal, lamb, roasted vegetable, shrimp, and fish stocks are good. All the right gods have been satisfied, including the warning to cook fish stock for no more than 45 minutes (most authorities go for no more than 30 minutes). Some stocks even allow for cooking up to three days! I'm a little surprised Ms. Groveman doesn't pass on a tip for cooling down 8 to 12 quarts of stock from near boiling to below the danger zone of 40 degrees Fahrenheit.<br />The next symptom of the books primary direction is to cook for large family groups is the battery of pantry recipes accompanying the stocks. This includes recipes for roasted peppers, pestos, bread crumbs, barbecue sauce, marinara sauce, teriyaki sauce, cinnamon sugar, seasoning and spice blends, buttermilk pancake mix, muffin mix, cornbread mix, baking powder biscuit mix, compound butters, sweet fruit butters, quick puff pastry and pate brisee. I have made every single one of these preparations at some time in the last year, and, as I am retired, I have all the time I need to make these things, but I do not and will not make most of them because since I cook for only two people most of the time, I cannot guarantee that most of these preparations will be used up before their shelf life expires. I do make breadcrumbs when I have day old crusty bread available, but that is about it. I simply do not have the space or the need to make a lot of pantry preparations.<br />The lesson here is not that this is a poor book. The lesson is that this book is simply much more useful for the large family or even small restaurant cook than it is for a small or even an average family of 4.2 Americans.<br />The first chapter also presents a taste of the author's hubris in applauding her own recipes by giving them titles such as `The Best Barbecue Sauce' and `Killer Marinara Sauce'. This attitude of claiming to be presenting exceptional recipes appears often in the book. It appears often enough to put me off a bit. In contrast, Martha Stewart's much touted arrogance about her person simply does not extend to her public presentations, where she commonly expresses her personal appreciation for recipes and ingredients and assumes the modest attitude that `If I can do it, you should have no problems'. Ms. Groveman's tone has no bearing on the quality of her recipes, but it does have a bearing on the quality of your experience in reading the book.<br />Even with the elaborate pantry preparations, I find most of the recipes still have large ingredient lists and long recipe procedures. In contrast, I recall recipes in several books of recipes from provincial France by Patricia Wells and others which have all the cachet that source entails with remarkably few ingredients and simple procedures. In Ms. Groveman's book, for example, I am looking at a recipe for stuffed mushrooms alla Bolognese which has 23 ingredients, ten (10) of which require some preparation even before starting the oversize page and a half procedure. I am certain the result is tasty in the extreme, but this gives you the idea that the recipes in this book are the opposite of simple. This sample also shows that the book is the opposite of low fat and low calorie, as this recipe adds both butter and cream to the healthy olive oil in the ingredients.<br />Ms. Groveman's air of certainty about the quality of her preparations turns hollow when I run across statements about cooking technique which are not only wrong, but are accepted as wrong by many authorities. One misstatement is the stricture against salting beans early in their soaking time. The source of the refutation of this principle is in a February, 1994 article by Russ Parsons in the Los Angles Times. This information has been repeated by nerd team members like John Thorne and Alton Brown, and by Food Network icon Sara Moulton. Another misstatement is the description of glass as a fast conductor of heat as used in pie pans, in preference to metal. Any recollection of high school science should bring up physics experiments that show that glass is a heat and electricity insulator, while metals are heat and electricity conductors. This is not to say that glass is not in fact a superior material for pie plates. It is probably superior in that it holds heat longer than metal so crusts will not be exposed to variations in oven heat as much as if they were in metal. Another thing I find annoying with Ms. Groveman's recipes is that it is one of the very, very few cookbooks that routinely use extra large eggs.<br /><br />To be sure, there are many good things in this book such as the recipes for Challah and Matzos. The book also contains directions on how to make both hot dog and hamburger rolls, something you do not find in even comprehensive books on bread baking. All recipes appear sound, even if I have reasons to prefer recipes in other books.<br />This book gives many make ahead tips and tips for fast breakfasts and stressless entertaining but, ultimately, it is a book about cooking for six to eight on a regular basis. Recommended for people in that situation.ss statements about cooking technique which are not only wrong, but are accepted as wrong by many authorities.

Creole, Cajun, and Southern cooking in general are a very crowded fields of culinary writing. Therefore, Emeril seems to be laying claim to the niche of cookbooks for adolescents and teens, as this is his second book within this culinary genre. The first was `Emeril's There's a Chef in My Soup' which was aimed at pre-teens. The current book seems to cover the same territory, shifting the age range upward somewhat to reach pre-high school students. The language is definitely of a tone that would put off kids who will be taking Chemistry and Physics soon and who are lusting after a chance to get behind wheel of the family automobile.<br />I generally need to read several chapters of good cookbooks to get a handle on what should attract people to a particular book. I can find something noteworthy about very good and very bad cookbooks on the first or second page. This is true with Emeril's new book. The problem is, I'm not sure whether the things which stick out are good or bad. This is probably because I am not a kid, the primary audience for this book. So, I will simply report them and let you decide.<br />The first thing I noticed was the number of references to Emeril's restaurants, labeled products such as Emerilware from All-Clad and Wines from Fetzer Vineyards, and personal appearance events such as Food Network shows and Good Morning America appearances. The references to his food products such as Essence and hot sauces are very commonly cited as ingredients. I would object to these references in a book written for adults.<br />Most of the illustrations in the book are either crude line drawings or a composite of crude line drawings and photographs of Emeril or Emeril Homebase employees and families. The first questionable aspect of these illustrations is that unless you know what is being shown, there are many cases where I think the illustrations are too crude to be worthy of a document meant to teach. There is no question that drawings are often superior to photographs in that the drawing can focus on the essential aspects of the demonstration. Backgrounds and incidental objects can be omitted. These drawings, however, remind one of objects drawn in the cartoon `Ziggy' where many lines are crudely drawn to exaggerate some feature for humorous effect.<br />Most recipe write-ups cover two oversize book pages. Between a quarter to a half of this real estate is taken up by large `Ziggy' drawings of the dish plus, sometimes, a composite photo and drawing blending in a family scene admiring or interacting with the food. Some space is taken up by `Ziggy' drawings demonstrating a technique. A photograph of Emeril, generally seen from head to toe, appears with almost every recipe. His smile and gestures appear to be there to cheer you on to make the dish.<br />I believe the description of each recipe procedure is quite good. It is especially careful in advising the adolescent reader at each turn where there is some safety issue of which they need to be aware or need adult assistance. In this vein, the book does an excellent job of making the young reader thoroughly aware of the fact that between heat, flames, germs, sharp objects, heavy objects, electricity, water, dust, and various combinations of these properties, the kitchen can be an incredibly dangerous place. The other side of the coin is that the warnings are so pervasive that the typically cynical and sophisticated fourteen-year-old will soon be put off by the constant warnings. A perfect example of this is that every recipe contains a heading to the directions with icons that warn of these various dangers. Unfortunately, most recipes include most icons, so I generally find myself ignoring them.<br />The best thing about the recipe write-ups is that absolutely nothing is simplified. Rather, if a technique is tricky or dangerous, there are clear warnings to get grownup assistance. I also believe that the recipes, if properly followed, will produce delicious results. My concern about the recipes is that if I were writing a cookbook for kids, I would focus my selection of recipes on classics, each of which would teach some basic cooking technique. There are many basic recipes here, but there are also many unusual variations on standards. One that caught my eye was the recipe for French toast, which did not do your basic day-old brioche plus custard. Instead, it gave us an elaborate French toast casserole with blueberries, cream cheese, and orange juice. The range of recipes, including breakfast, breads, salads, soups, snacks, main courses, sides, and desserts, is very well done. These chapter titles are a bit corny, but then, I'm not 12 years old.<br />The introductory material on techniques, safety, and equipment is excellent. The trick is to get your budding chef to take the time to read it. I was a little annoyed at the `Ziggy' grade drawings of equipment for the lack of relevant detail.<br />If I were to grade this book, I would give it an A+ on teaching safety, an A- on teaching techniques, a B on recipe selection, and a C- for corniness and commercialism. I would not expect a young person to gain any math or science from this book. The author is Emeril, after all, not Alton Brown.<br />If your Emeril wannabe really likes watching Emeril on the Food Network or has any interest in any cooking shows, then this is certainly the book for him or her. If Emeril's enthusiasm succeeds in making the leap from the page to the young reader, the book will be a winner. I will be perfectly happy giving my copy of this book to my pre-teen nephew who has an interest in baking with the expectation that this book will nourish that interest.<br />Recommended.oncern about the recipes is that if I were writing a cookbook for kids, I would focus my selection of recipes on classics, each of which would teach some basic cooking technique.

684643:US	39134375	R3QO4M673N2FIZ	0767906810	745174054	Paris Sweets: Great Desserts From the City's Best Pastry Shops	Books	5	97	99	N	N	Creme de la Creme	Contemplating recipes in this new book from Dorie Greenspan, subtitled `Great Desserts from the City's Best Pastry Shops' is much like shopping for antiques in that furniture whose style and construction have survived either decades or centuries of wear and changes in taste is almost invariably of a higher quality than last month's great new thing. You don't even have the disadvantage of having to pay a premium price, as Ms. Greenspan's book list price is lower than many books containing mostly new recipes original with the author and her support team.<br />Ms. Greenspan is not only reporting recipes from what she believes are the greatest patisseries in Paris, she is telling us from which shops these recipes come, and where these shops are located. Happily, some of these shops even have satellites in New York City. Yum.<br />All of these recipes are classics. The Madeleine cookie is so important and so well known that Ms. Greenspan gives us three recipes from three different shops. Apparently, there are so many different recipes for Madeleines, she could have assembled a book from them alone.<br />Cookies are the subject of the first chapter. Following chapters cover cakes, tarts, `pastries and small treats', and `grand gateaux'. The `pastries and small treats' chapter includes such standards as Cr&egrave;me Brulee, Chocolate Mousse, Chocolate Bread Pudding, Ali-Babas (similar to baba au rhum), Tiger Tea Cakes, Soft Apple Cakes, Whipped Cream-Filled Meringues, Coffee Eclairs, Strawberry and Orange Flower Water Marshmallows, and Hot Chocolate. The `grand gateaux' chapter includes pastries such as Bacchus (raisin filled cake plus ganache and glaze), Opera Cake, Chocolate-Thyme Cake, Chocolate Temptation (ooh la la dessert), Blanc-manger (a very, very old French version of panna cotta), King's Cake (traditional after Christmas), Mille-Feuille (Napoleon), and Gate Saint-Honore. Decedent doesn't even begin to these homages to butter, cream, sugar, and eggs.<br />The final chapter of `Base Recipes' contains just a few important pantry staples. Even though they look very familiar and are probably in the repertoire of every experienced pastry chef, they deserve a look, as they may be a bit different than what you are used to. The recipe for pate sucree, for example, includes almonds and vanilla, things which are not commonly in American sweet tart dough recipes.<br />The recipes in this book are the main attraction, but they are not the only charm. There are lots of headnotes, asides, and sidebars on the recipes, the shops and their bakers who contributed the recipes, and the French take on classic ingredients such as butter, salt, vanilla, water, and eggs. A take on fleur de sel worth repeating is Dori's comparing it to extra virgin olive oil, the most desirable first yield from the olive oil harvest. The stories on the shops make me wish I was more in tune with French pastry when I was in Paris many, many years ago. Even the addresses of shops on streets such as the Boulevard Haussman and the place de la Madeleine bring back fond memories of time spent in Paris.<br />The final charm offered by the book is the collection of watercolors done by Florine Asch which decorate the text, the end pages, and the cover.<br />I am not at all surprised that the description of the recipes is quite clear and should be not at all difficult for an American amateur baker. Although all European professional bakers measure everything strictly by metric weight, the author has converted everything to the teaspoons and cups and English weight units. Many recipes make sensible use of a food processor for mixing dough. In spite of this all, do not be surprised that many recipes are two or more pages long. The result is more than worth the effort. Each recipe concludes with a supremely considerate note on how to best keep each result and for how long. Each recipe also includes a paragraph labelled `An American in Paris' on variations and options for serving.<br />Ms. Greenspan's credentials for writing this book are impeccible. This is her eighth book on pastry. Her previous books have included collaborations with Pierre Herme, Daniel Boulud, and the great Julia Child. It is quite appropriate that the book was suggested by the author of `The Paris Cookbook', Ms. Patricia Wells. Much credit to Ms. Wells for instigating this very happy result.<br />Highly recommended for both recipes and warm evocation of a sweet aspect of Paris.>Ms. Greenspan's credentials for writing this book are impeccible.

Even as a textbook, I would not recommend this book to non-professionals as a means of learning how to bake. For baking hobbyists who simply want to learn more in a systematic fashion about baking, I would strongly recommend that they get a copy of Sherry Yard's new book `The Secrets of Baking' and read it from cover to cover.<br />This does not mean this is a poor book. Only that it is pretty seriously oriented to teaching professional pastry chefs. And, there are ways in which professional chefs do things, which are not and should not be done by the home baker who prepares baked goods for their family and friends. The most obvious symptom of this fact is that most recipes are scaled to make many more pieces than a home baker is likely to want, unless they are baking for a church bake sale.<br />This also does not mean that the book has no value for the home baker. If you are a serious baker for your own consumption, this book is an excellent reference for just about any pastry preparation of which you can think. Not only will it have authoritative recipes for staple preparations such as batters, Panna cotta, sabayon, cr&egrave;me broulee, caramel, buttercream, chantilly cream, lemon curd, glazes, royal icing, pate brisee, pate a Choux and dozens of other standard recipes, it will have recipes for some preparations for which you may have a difficult time finding any place else. My favorite discovery is a recipe for strudel. I have made strudel with frozen philo dough, but I am not very happy with the result. But, I really like good strudel, so now all I have to do is find a counter large enough to prepare it.<br />Another serious asset in this book for the home baker is its explanation of why baking processes work the way they do. The explanations are very practical, generally easier to understand than the explanations you may find in a book by Harold McGee. The only puzzle I found in the book's background information is the fact that they said that whole wheat flour has a higher protein content than general purpose flour, yet GP flour must be added to whole wheat to provide enough gluten to produce a good rise from yeast. I suspect the answer is that much of the protein in whole-wheat flour is of a type that simply does not form glutinous strands. But, that has nothing to do with your baking techniques.<br />As a serious textbook, I would strongly recommend that anyone who is seriously considering a career as a pastry chef read this book from cover to cover, skipping particular recipe details on this first pass. This read will certainly show that professional baking requires a lot of practice and a lot of knowledge and a lot of work.<br />Getting back to the home baker, I would generally refer to this book whenever I simply could not find a recipe in any other source or a recipe is not working out for me, or I remember preparing something from an issue of Gourmet from three years ago and I forgot the recipe. These are all situations where I would run to this book before consulting anything else. I would also consult this book for tips if I am creating a new recipe and I wish to use a standard streusel topping in the recipe. Once I was more experienced with artisinal breads after going to school with either Peter Reinhart or Nancy Silverton, I would be more than happy to consult this book for the recipe for one of the very many types of breads in the book. It seems to pretty much cover everything from brioche to pretzels.<br />This book does not have everything, but then, no book on baking has everything. It has no recipes for a Hungarian nut cake or funnel cake or snickerdoodle cookies or Russian Easter bread. But it certainly seems to have just about everything else. It is an especially good resource for pastry plating. If you are a serious entertainer as well as a serious baker, there will be things for you in this book which you may not find elsewhere, even in Martha Stewart's better books.<br />One thing I would not do is take a recipe from this book to replace a recipe with which I am already happy. The carrot cake recipe in this book is pretty unexciting, as it contains neither pineapple nor `cookie spices' to jazz it up. The buttermilk biscuit recipe is pretty routine too, using both butter and shortening. I made this kind of biscuit for several years, until I tried an all butter recipe (plus White Lily flour) which gives me a much flakier result.<br />Recommended for the serious baker. Highly recommended for the budding professional. Recipes tend to be a bit more complicated than some, but no more complicated than the best you will see from Sherry Yard or Nancy Silverton.er as well as a serious baker, there will be things for you in this book which you may not find elsewhere, even in Martha Stewart's better books.<br />One thing I would not do is take a recipe from this book to replace a recipe with which I am already happy.

One of the first things you learn in this book is that there are as many, if not more subtleties and ambiguities in the marketing of chocolate as there are in just about any other basic food product such as flour or olive oil.\\"<br />This book has an equally skillful introduction to dealing with chocolate. I even believe this book is a better introduction to working with chocolate than the title from Ms. Medrich due to Ms. Brody's exceptional ability to explain potentially difficult techniques. She is especially candid in saying that the first time you try some techniques like tempering chocolate, you may simply not succeed. But, she insists that you keep trying and with due diligence, you will succeed. This combination of clarity and honesty is worth a lot.<br />This book is similar to Gale Gand's book `short + sweet' in the way it finds a place for itself in your daily family activities with partner and kids. It is also similar to Karen Baker's new book `Sweet Stuff' in its claiming to evoke a homegrown, American style of chocolate. All three books are worthy purchases that largely meet their objectives. But, they are not the kind of book which grabs you by the lapels and shakes you up with it's enthusiasm or insights or inspiration like, for example Wayne Harley Brachman's `American Desserts' or Sherry Yard's extraordinary new book `The Secrets of Baking'.<br />The first crack in the premise of `Chocolate American Style' is the suggestion that Americans eat more chocolate than anyone else in the world. I just saw a statistic that indicates the English eat three times more chocolate then we colonists eat. Another lapse in the book's premise comes when the author devotes an entire chapter `Old World - New World' to chocolate laden versions of European classics such as Mandelbrot, Rugelach, Biscotti, Scones, Panini, and the quintessentially Austrian Linzer Torte. Various other recipes also cite French inspirations and how they can show us colonials a thing or two. The final indignity is the recipe devised to immortalize Russell Crowe, which incorporates as many Australian products as the author could fit into one recipe.<br />Like Karen Baker's `American' baking book, a whole lot of the recipes in this book are author's originals rather than traditional American classics. In fact, one reality of contemporary cookbooks peeks out from some pages of this book in that it becomes clear that a lot of the recipes in the book are neither traditionally American nor written by the nominal author. Several recipes are original contributions by Susan Schwartz who is primarily credited in the Acknowledgments with Emmy Clausing as someone who researched, tested, and fine-tuned recipes.<br />None of these pet peeves diminish the quality of the book. It is not the best book you can get on chocolate, but it is very good in general and especially good for working with families. Like Gale Gand's book, it includes a chapter of recipes specifically written for kids to make. This alone may be worth the price of admission. In fact, it would have been much more appropriate to entitle the book `Chocolate Family Style'. The kids chapter includes recipes such as chocolate-covered graham crackers, chocolate cereal treats, peanut butter cups, and chocolate caramel popcorn. Makes you glad that chocolate is actually good for you. All the recipes taste very, very good and the author has a genuine, well-recognized talent for communicating them to you.<br />The book does include a number of genuine American classic recipes such as chocolate chip cookies, ice cream cakes, and chocolate ice cream sundaes. Yes, the book also includes recipes for ice cream.<br />Recommended. Some recipes are tough going simply because chocolate is just downright finicky. The author gives you the confidence to believe it will all come out in the end.he confidence to believe it will all come out in the end.	2004-04-29
689338:US	39134375	R75XV16SB2S1U	0936184752	83228355	Baking Illustrated: A Best Recipe Classic	Books	5	359	380	N	Y	Excellent Resource for Baking Enthusiast	This volume, `Baking Illustrated' is a compilation of articles and recipes from `Cook's Illustrated' magazine. This is the same source as many other volumes presuming to provide the `best' recipe for various dishes. Overall, I find the recipes in this book very good, but with several reservations.<br />I am really happy to see the `America's Test Kitchen' crew turn their attention to baking. Unlike savory cooking, baking is highly dependent on accurate measurements of weight, volume, and temperature. Therefore, it is an area where a scientific approach of varying various quantities will have a more beneficial result than in the savory world.<br />This book is subtitled `The Practical Kitchen Companion for the Home Baker'. This means the book is directed at the amateur home baker. This facet does not really distinguish the book that much from dozens of other baking books I have reviewed. In fact, I would warn occasional bakers who simply want recipes that this book might just be a bit too wordy for you. You may be much better served by a general baking book by Maida Heatter, Nick Malgieri, or even Martha Stewart. On the other hand, if you love `Cooks Illustrated' or simply reading about cooking and baking technique, then this is a book for you!<br />My biggest reservation with the whole `best recipe' approach by `Cooks Illustrated' is that a recipe is best only by a certain set of criteria. What may be the best FAST recipe may fall flat on its face for ENTERTAINING or for MOST HEALTHY. The `Cooks Illustrated' team generally goes for a good compromise between fast and tasty. A corollary to this reservation is the presumption that the `Cooks Illustrated' approach has a unique insight into baking truth. This is simply not true. I just finished reviewing professional baker Sherry Yard's new book `The Secrets of Baking' an I believe it is unequivocally the best book you can get for understanding baking technique. She spends no time on discussing failed approaches. Everything in the book is right to the point. With only slightly less enthusiasm I would recommend the `Bible' series of baking books by Rose Levy Beranbaum.<br />One clue to my preference for Yard and Beranbaum is the way they treat brioche and challah. Both deal with these two recipes as two variations on a common `master' recipe. Thus, when you understand how to make one, it is clear that you are very close to knowing how to do the other. This `Baking Illustrated' volume gives the two recipes side by side, but gives little other clue that the recipes are related.<br />Another symptom of where the `Cooks Illustrated' method may be less than satisfactory is in their carrot cake recipe. Carrot cake is a really interesting product, made even more interesting to me by Sherry Yard's explanation of why it is so good and so versatile. I have been making a three layer carrot cake for birthdays from a Nick Malgieri recipe for over a year now, and I am very happy with the results. `Baking Illustrated' gives a passle of advice on what works and what doesn't work and ends with a recipe for a single layer sheet cake. This simply does not have enough WOW quotient for an important birthday.<br />Yet another weakness in the `Cooks Ilustrated' method is illustrated by a recent Jim Villas book which has over a hundred recipes for biscuits, with over twenty for simple, unflavored biscuits. Each of these twenty recipes has their own charms. The current volume has only one `best recipe'.<br />After all these reservations, I must still say that for the person who treats baking as a hobby, this book is a rich resource for all sorts of recipes. Some few baking books such as those by Yard and Beranbaum do a lot of explaining and offering alternatives, but most books do not. If you really want the straight scoop on what is the best ingredient to use, this is your book. It is also a rare source of excellent pictorials on technique based on line drawings that focus on the important aspects of a technique and do not distract as many photographs may do.

Highly Recommended	Sherry Yard, pastry chef at Spago Beverly Hills, has written the very best book for the amateur baker. If you bake, I advise you to stop reading this review and order this book from Amazon. Do it now ....<br />If you are still here, I'll tell you why I believe this book is so good.<br />First, there is the simple, illuminating organization which breaks major baking products down into twelve master recipes and explains all the things which distinguish each category from others and explains the factors which make these preparations work and which actions can lead to unsatisfactory results. There are so many good books on baking that promise this kind of systematic treatment but don't deliver. I was disappointed, for example, in reading Nick Malgieri's book, `How to Bake' when I saw that it was not much more than an organized collection of good recipes. Another recently reviewed book did an excellent job of presenting `modular' recipes where various preparations could be mixed and matched, yet they failed to advance our understanding of baking technique by proper grouping of, for example, cheesecake with custards rather than with cakes.<br />The twelve topics in this book are Ganache, Caramel, Curd, Vanilla Sauce, Pate a Choux, Pound Cake and Genoise, Financier, Cookies, Pie and Tart Dough, Brioche, Laminated Dough, and Fruit.<br />Second, the grouping of recipes makes learning several recipes within a group much easier than if each were tackled independently. The discussion of each preparation begins with a `family tree' which shows the relation between different recipes which fall within that method and the variation to the method which produces the branches to the tree. The first general method, ganache, has three variations. The medium consistency recipes give us souffl&eacute;, fondue, truffles, and sabayon. The firm (more chocolate) consistency gives us tortes, frosting, and candy bars. The soft (more cream) consistency gives us whipped cream, hot chocolate, sauce, and mousse. This presentation reveals connections between old favorites and new possibilities. I am particularly fond of making and eating carrot cake, and I have been quite happy with my recipe from Nick Malgieri. But, I was delighted to find that carrot cake is just one species of a baking genus called `financier'. If I were a professional pastry chef and I did not know about the virtues of financier, I may be willing to sign over my next year's salary to Ms. Yard for revealing the secrets of this batter. It seems that financier batter can accept all sorts of leftovers when it is mixed. It can then be stored in the refrigerator for many days, to be pulled out in an emergency to be baked up into a delightfully moist cake. The fact about the recipe that creates this moistness is it's using unwhipped egg whites that have more moisture and relatively more stabilizing protein than either whole eggs or whipped whites.<br />Third, the book explains virtually everything important about the science of baking. It has quite effectively done for baking what Alton Brown and Shirley Corriher have done for savory cooking in providing a roadmap to baking technique. This is not mere handwaving. Most culinary authors make reference to acidic (vinegar, citrus, buttermilk, cream of tartar) versus basic (baking soda) ingredients. Some advanced writers may refer to the fact that untreated chocolate is acidic and this needs to be balanced by baking soda in recipes. Ms. Yard gives us the whole 14 yards, covering the entire pH scale from battery acid (1) to Drano (14) and how all of this is relevant to baking. One most interesting fact is the relative acidity of lemon juice to orange juice. The two practical advantages of this presentation is that it gives you the means for rescuing recipes from problems and it gives you a safe path to developing your own baking recipes.<br />Fourth, the book explains the reasons behind small differences in technique. I have read a dozen recipes for the pair of doughs, pate brisee and pate sucree and perfectly good explanations for what the two different doughs are best used. No one, up until now, has given me a really good explanation for the difference in technique based on the fact that the sugar in the pate sucree is replacing part of the LIQUID ingredients in pate brisee. My hero Alton has often explained that sugar is treated as a liquid ingredient, but he has never explained in such depth what it is that makes both sugar and butter act like liquid ingredients and not like solid ingredients.<br />After you contemplate dealing with all these details, you may fear that Ms. Yard's recipes will be more complicated than others. The opposite is true. After a dozen recipes for pate brisee have advised me to add water to flour and butter as if I were working with explosives, I am surprised to see Ms. Yard splash all the water into the blender in one fell swoop and pulse away with abandon. On the other side of the coin, her discussion of pate brisee versus pate sucree points out that the resting time in the fridge must be longer for the sugar dough than for the dough without sugar, due to the hygroscopic nature of sugar. Ms. Yard's recipes are no more complicated than any others and, by providing an understanding of what is going on, they can be done with more confidence in the success of the outcome.<br />The final chapter gives the reader recipes for combining preparations like puff pastry combined with vanilla sauce to give Mille-Feuille Napoleon for example. The book ends with superior appendices on baking terms, tools, and ingredients.<br />The book does not deal with every baking subject in detail. Only an excellent chapter on brioche represents bread baking. But, there are several excellent books on bread. Ms. Yard would be sure to recommend the book by Nancy Silverton.<br />If you bake, buy this book.

692268:US	39134375	R1GS6TR93LSC16	0060585366	364816388	The Whole Beast: Nose to Tail Eating	Books	5	116	126	N	Y	Great Modern Treatment of Very Old Techniques. Outstanding	Fergus Henderson, the chef author of this book subtitled `nose to tail eating' is a cult hero among foodies and among heroes of foodies such as Tony Bourdain, who writes the introduction to this new edition and Mario Batali, a major advocate himself of using the whole animal.<br /><br />For several reasons, this book is likely to have little to no value to the average person who cooks and who may refer to a cookbook now and then. The recipes commonly use ingredients that are simply unavailable outside better butcher shops and farmers' markets. The recipes also commonly use techniques that are the antithesis of fast cooking and low fat cooking. There are some recipes that literally require up to two weeks to complete.<br /><br />The true audience for this book aside from culinary professionals are those who religiously watch Alton Brown's `Good Eats' , read John Thorne's books and newsletter as if they were gospels, and study books by Paul Bertolli, Eric Rippert, Judy Rodgers, and Jeremiah Tower for subtle new techniques to squeeze the last ounce of value from their primo materia.<br /><br />Just to be sure it is clear to you what this book is all about, it's primary subject is preparing in a cuisine absolutely everything but the oink, as the saying goes, from a pig and other animals. To this end, the author presents us with recipes for pig's head, pigs jowls (Mario Batali's favorite guanciale), pig's ears, pig's tail, livers, hearts, tongues, and the most beloved stomach as used in preparing the old Scottish classic, haggis.<br /><br />If this were the limit of the author's novelty, there would probably be little interest in the book among chefs. The author pushes this point of view to cover culinary techniques which are either not commonly used by the average chef and which are generally unknown to the average cook. The two best-known methods are brining and preserving in oil as in a comfit. Brining has probably become much better known among American foodies thanks to the efforts of Alton Brown and Shirley Corriher. It is a method of soaking meat in a solution of salt, sugar, and aromatics to impart moisture to the meat. Creating a comfit involves storing meat in fat rendered from the meat and fatty parts of the animal from which the meat was taken. The method is best known as a method for preserving duck legs, but it may be applied to many other meats. The author applies both techniques to a wide variety of foods.<br /><br />If any part of this book may have use to the average reader who takes cooking seriously, it would probably be the author's lessons on the creation and use of stocks. Unlike chefs at the cutting edge of American haute cuisine such as Judy Rodgers, Henderson's stock techniques are beautifully simple. He does recommend the uncommon method of creating a raft to clarify stocks. I have not seen this method used outside of Culinary Institute of America texts, but the author presents it so simply that one need have no fear that it is too complicated for them. That is not to say it does not take time. This is an example of why the nonprofessional will want to read this book. It is just chocked full of unusual techniques, some as simple as they are unexpected. The author goes against a tidal wave of preference for the Italian flat leafed parsley and chooses to use curly leafed parsley in most recipes including an utterly simple method for flavoring salt with the herb and adding it to a simple sauce.<br /><br />While the focus of the book is on meat, it does cover the very typical range of dishes with chapters on Stocks, Soups, Salads, Starters, Main Dishes (mostly the odd body parts are here), Birds and Game, Fish and Shellfish, Vegetables, Sauces, Puddings, and Baking. The refreshing iconoclasm extends even to the discussion of routine sauces where the author is clear to all that aioli is NOT mayonnaise with garlic, but a thing onto itself. He probably also breaks a few hearts by mixing olive oil for both mayonnaise and aioli in a food processor.<br /><br />The book should also be a treasure for armchair foodies who get no closer to a Garland range than a read of reviews in `Cooks Illustrated'. This chef has a way with words. You may almost think of him as a literate Jaime Oliver who suggests you put terrines `in the fridge for 24 hours to allow it to find itself'. I sometimes find it tedious to read even good recipes. There is no such problem with this book.<br /><br />Highly recommended read for all professionals and foodies. Great source of ideas, even if you never make any of the recipes.a treasure for armchair foodies who get no closer to a Garland range than a read of reviews in `Cooks Illustrated'.

Highly Recommended	It is much easier to identify very good and very bad cookbooks than it is to identify the merely good or average cookbooks. I saw the beauty of this book with the first recipe I prepared from it. I have read two other books on soup by very famous cookbook authors Barbara Kafka and James Peterson and I would recommend this little book over both of their works. Both of these other works are good, worthy of five stars, but this volume by Paulette Mitchell is better for the price.<br />The fact that it is limited to only vegetarian and vegan recipes detracts not one wit from its value to the general cook. If this means anything at all, it means that the recipes will be less expensive and faster to prepare than recipes including meat. It especially means that you can make an appropriate homemade vegetable stock for these recipes very cheaply and easily, with no chicken sanitary problems to deal with.<br />The main body of the book with the chapters of soup recipes covers:<br />Creamy Soups featuring curried carrot, potatoes, squash, chestnuts, bell peppers, fresh peas, and peanuts<br />Chunky Soups featuring black beans, red lentils, chickpeas, asparagus, miso, minestrones and ribollita.<br />Chilled Soups featuring Vichyssoise, borscht, lettuce soup, avocado soup, and gazpacho<br />Dessert Soups featuring berry-wine, strawberry-rhubarb, gingered pear, and brandied pumpkin.<br />The chapter on chunky soups comprises about half the recipes. It should be clear from this list that most of the major soupy players are present. The only major type of soup one may miss is seafood chowders. For that, you can go to Jasper White's excellent book, '50 Chowders'.<br />Many recipes are vegetarian in that they include some dairy product; however, the author gives many tips on making the daried soups suitable to a vegan sensibility. The primary technique is to substitute soymilk for cow's milk and toasted breadcrumbs for grated cheese.<br />Before the main chapters of recipes, there is a short chapter on preparing vegetable stock. The book ends with an excellent chapter of recipes for `garnishes and accompaniments' which gives recipes for pestos, croutons, and various toasted nibbles. Many recipes also include a garnish which may easily be treated as a recipe in itself and a garnish from one soup can be grafted onto the serving of some other soup.<br />Aside from the excellent selection of recipes for soups and supporting cast, the recipes are written in a very appealing format. Rather than undistinguished text or simple numbered steps, the steps are broken down into major activities, with numerous checkpoints to indicate where in the preparation it would be best to freeze or how to do parts of the preparation in advance. Soup and garnish steps and ingredient lists are always separate to easily mix and match soup with garnish.<br />The book is loaded with tips relevant to the particular recipe, but which are also relevant to general cooking techniques. To this end, the author has provided a separate list of alphabetized names of tips, so that if you wish to use cr&egrave;me fraiche in a recipe but you have forgotten the recipe, simply look it up in the tips list. Surely, the index would do as well, except that it would not be as easy to browse the tip titles and let serendipity take its course.<br />To top it all off, this is a very attractively composed book. The pictures are not abundant. Only about one in ten recipes has an accompanying photograph, but all pics are done in a way which compliments the overall design of the book. The plain black typesetting is possibly not as elegant as the kind of treatment it may have gotten from Knopf, but it is a very nicely designed book. The literary quotes headlined by a famous quote on soup by Lewis Carroll sprinkled here and there simply add to the pleasant experience.<br />One advantage to meatless recipes is that they will take less time to prepare; however, I do wish to soft pedal the author's suggestion that the recipes are fast and easy. If you make both soup and garnish, you may be dealing with more than one separate steam, saute, or blanche step. Cream soups will require breaking out the food processor, blender, or stick blender. Chunky soups will require a fair amount of knife work. But, don't hold this against this or any other book. Just don't buy it with the notion that you are buying a fast recipe book.<br />Very highly recommended especially for the price. Not fast, but easy for novices.e recipes are fast and easy.

In summary, both books are great treatments of American desserts, covering very much the same territory. Brachman's book is funnier and it may explain some basic techniques a bit more thoroughly. Ms. Barker's book is a bit longer, covers some topics in somewhat greater depth. Karen's recipes  are centered in Southern desserts while Wayne's center of gravity is somewhere between Brooklyn, New York and Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. I suggest you get both if you are a big dessert maker. Brachman covers doughnuts and does a better job on teaching piecrusts. Brachman's volume may be better for the novice. Barker's book has more recipes overall.<br />I recently reviewed Gale Gand's new book `short + sweet' on fast desserts and it is quite a good book for working with kids. Karen has definitely done desserts for grown-up tastes, in spite of the large number of peanut and peanut butter recipes. The presence of rum, bourbon, and Jack Daniels as ingredients is just one indication of how this book is aimed at adult tastes.<br />The reciped chapters in this book are named:<br />The Basics: A Baker's Building Blocks<br />A Pie Primer<br />Fruit Somethings<br />Custards &amp; Puddings: Low and Slow is the Way to Go<br />Let Them Eat Cake<br />We All Scream for Ice Cream<br />The Joy of Cookies<br />Pancakes, Waffles, Fritters, and other Breakfast-Like Desserts<br />As cheesecake is actually a type of custard pie, you may be puzzled to find it discussed in the chapter on cakes. That aside, I found the Ms. Brown's recipe, techniques, and explanations for how and why a cheesecake can go wrong is quite the best I have seen. It agreed with and went far beyond Alton Brown's `Good Eats' cheesecake episode in achieving a primo cheesecake.<br />As with Brachman's book, the true subject of this volume is not as centered on historical American recipes as it is on recipes which are currently popular in the United States, whether they originated on these shores or are imports from England, France, or Italy. The book gives you a fair share of Cr&egrave;me Broulee, Panna Cotta, and Sabayon. It balances that with lots of true American classics like apple pie, `Sally Lunn' brioche like bread, Sumps, Crumbles, Cobblers, and Shortcakes.<br />The most distinctive strength of the book is it's very concentration on reusable techniques and preparations. It can very much be seen as an application of Ming Tsai's `Master Recipe' technique in the book `Simply Ming'. The approach starts in the chapter entitled `The Basics', but it permeates the book. The chapter `Fruit Somethings' in particular has several techniques for compotes, shortcakes, and syrups that may be used together with ice creams, cakes, and other pastries.<br />Please be careful to note that this book is not a general book on baking and does not cover a lot of baking topics. Conversely, it includes ice creams, sherbets, sorbets, and granitas, which may be a classic province of the pastry chef, but it is not baking. The book contains a great little bibliography with references to important modern works on baking.<br />My only disappointment was that the author chose to present only `New York' style ice cream, which is a frozen custard. A truer `American' dessert may be the `Philadelphia' style, which includes cream, but no eggs.<br />Highly recommended if you need only one book on desserts.

699370:US	39134375	R2FGJ57VXWJHL7	0755311183	223091519	Passione: The Italian Cookbook	Books	5	32	32	N	Y	Culinary Memories and Cuisine Of Jamie Oliver's Mentor	It is almost certain that this book was written and published because Gennaro Contaldo is a mentor and close friend to the very celebrated chef Jamie Oliver. While the connection with Oliver and with Gennaro's own UK / Italian mentor, Antonio Carluccio adds interest to the book and while it is unlikely that I would have bought the book without these connections, I can with complete honesty say that this book stands on its own two feet as a good Italian cookbook and a superior evocation of life growing up in an Italian family where raising, growing, fishing, and hunting animals and plants for food was the whole family's primary avocation.<br />The stories of Gennaro's childhood, especially those directly related to hunting, fishing, and animal husbandry succeed in painting a picture of life along the Amalfi coast which succeeds much better than several culinary memoirs of Italy which I have recently read and reviewed. Mr. Contaldo is not a strong writer and I suspect he received a considerable amount of literary help in transcribing his oral memories of life in Southern Italy to paper. But, the stories are so vivid and so heart-felt that I can almost smell the blood and the sea and the mushrooms that are the subject of so many stories.<br />From the vantage point of an American who has read many stories of the romance northern Europeans feel for Italy, it is truly surprising to see a reverse of this scenario. Gennaro had a great desire to live and work in England as he was growing up in Italy. Once in the UK, he worked with several restaurants, including a stint in one of Antonio Carluccio's restaurants. When he was head chef at one London restaurant, he trained the young Jamie Oliver, who treats him as his London dad.<br />For American readers, please be prepared to deal with a few English terms for foods such as `Rocket' for Arugula, `Aubergines' for Eggplant, and `Courgettes' for Zucchini. All weights are in both metric (litres, grams, and Centigrade) and English (pints, ounces, and Fahrenheit). As I can visualize amounts more readily in metric than in English (I was a chemist), I am quite happy to have both. This book has value as a very good introduction to cooking in metric for those of you who are metrically challanged. The one place where measurements may be a challenge to most of us is with the flour units. All flour measurements for bread and pasta are given by weight (grams and pounds). So, you will need a kitchen scale to handle these.<br />The chapters organize recipes in exactly the way you would like and expect an Italian cookbook to lay things out. The English chapter titles are soup; pasta; risotto, polenta, gnocchi; fish and shellfish; meat, game, poultry; vegetables; tomatoes; mushrooms; snacks; bread; and desserts. The cuisine is not purely of Campania. There are lots of beans and pestos and rice and corn meal from northern Italy, but there certainly seem to be a lot more sparkle in the tomato and seafood recipes than in other recipes. Like all good traditional Italian chefs, Gennaro is fond of cooking with mushrooms, especially wild mushrooms such as porcini, although Seignior Contaldo is always careful to recommend a `garden variety' replacement for the wild fungi. The same is true of cheeses. Genarro will recommend the preferred Italian variety and specify a commonly available replacement if the traditional product cannot be found.<br />There is nothing new or profound in Gennaro's pasta making. He uses the same technique you will see done by Molto Mario Batali or Mr. Naked Chef Jamie Oliver. His bread making technique is also very similar to what I have seen in Jamie Oliver's books. It is distinctly non-artisinal, as it uses a relatively large (three to four times what I have seen elsewhere) amounts of yeast and fairly short rise times. I find it a perfect balance in the book to see a single pizza recipe for a genuine Neapolitan pizza and a single recipe for focaccia. Most other bread recipes are thingslike pane rustico with salami, cheese and eggs baked into a roll for taking along for a lunch while at work.<br />In general, there is nothing dramatically new here. All the soups and sauces and stuffed vegetables and pasta dishes have been seen before. But, Genarro succeeds in breathing life into all of these classics with a hard earned respect for ingredients which I find more genuine than what you see written by others.<br />The color photography of the food and the principals who created the book is competent and a little less than perfectly professional. It is almost as if the photographer made a point of keeping the rough edges on his technique to match the hearty vitality of the recipes. As the author and photographer took the trouble to return to Gennaro's hometown to do the food styling and photography, I believe that effort was well made. Gennaro's black and white snapshots of his family lend a charm consistent with the tone of the book. Congratulations for having the thoughtfulness to provide captions for these family snaps.<br />Highly recommended treatment of traditional Italian cuisine, with a genuine, enjoyable picture of the author's family and childhood.

699986:US	39134375	R80XLSOLCEL6W	1401601383	126114571	John and Michelle Morgan's Famous Dutch Kitchen Restaurant Cookbook: Family-Style Diner Delights from the Heart of Pennsylvania (Roadfood Cookbook)	Books	4	19	32	N	N	An Very Good Book if You Like Central Pennsylvania Diners	This book appears to be the eighth `Roadfood Cookbook' by Jane and Michael Stern who also write a `Roadfood' column for Gourmet magazine. Aside from the fact that this book has just been published, I got a copy to review because I grew up on the same kind of Pennsylvania Dutch cooking described in this book. Thus, I was sure I was doubly qualified to evaluate this volume.<br />The value of this book to a reader will be directly proportional to the degree to which they really like diner food of eastern Pennsylvania. Like many other local cookbooks, the food is simply not as interesting as you will find in just about any cookbook by a professional culinary journalist such as Patricia Wells; top rated restaurant chef such as Tom Colicchio or Alfred Portale; or TV program host such as Sara Moulton or Tyler Florence.<br />All the recipes for non-Pennsylvania Dutch specialities are pale imitations of, for example, Italian or New England specialities. The recipes rely very heavily on canned products and the amount of butter used in many of the recipes would make a French chef blanche. Oddly enough, some recipes occasionally use margarine instead of butter for no apparent reason.<br />One example of a classic recipe done with an inferior recipe is the offering for creamed chipped beef. This book's recipe adds no spices whatsoever. A very good recipe in Craig Claiborne's New York Times cookbook uses a technique that is much more familiar to cooks who are used to making roux and bechamel sauces. It also suggests adding nutmeg, Worcestershire sauce, and cayenne.<br />Another classic with an inferior recipe is the cole slaw recipe. It is just one of a long string of vegetable and vegetable / protein salads where mayonnaise is a major ingredient. James Beard gives a far superior recipe for cole slaw with no mayonnaise. I am entirely familiar with the fact that there are hundreds of variations on cole slaw. I am only indicating that the version offered here is not the best.<br />All recipe instructions are fairly simple because so many of the dishes are fairly simple, relying on rich ingredients such as butter, mayonnaise, half and half, cream, or canned soups for their punch. The instructions for preparing most vegetables is to `chop' them, where most cookbooks would specify a quarter inch dice or smaller. Some recipes call for grating onions by a food processor. Most other writers would suggest a dice, as the food processor can turn onions into slime.<br />Most of my comments are really not relevant to true Pennsylvania Dutch specialities, as the book is pretty true to my experience of this style of cooking. The recipes for the famous `Dutch' relishes such as chow-chow are pretty close (although my experience is that the green beans are usually cut, while the authors put them in whole). The recipes for breakfast sticky buns are as good or better than I have seen from similar local sources, but not as good as the Julia Child book on baking.<br />One really surprising exception to the very ordinary type of recipe to be found here is the pancake recipe. This is one of the very few places where I have seen people take the trouble to separate yolks from whites and whip the whites and fold them into the rest of the batter. I am impressed.<br />If you want an ethnologic picture of central Pennsylvania diner fare, you cannot find any better source than this book. It is also a reasonably good book of Pennsylvania Dutch recipes, but it leaves out several classics such as stuffed pig stomach and apple dumplings.

The format of this book, `How to Peel a Peach' is a perfect fit for a recognized culinary authority. It collects into a single source all the facts, tips, opinions, and wisdom about food that you may get from a year's viewing the Food Network or a five-year subscription to `Martha Stewart Living'. This is not the kind of material you will typically find in a book by Tom Colicchio or Mario Batali or Eric Rippert or Joel Robuchon. These authors will provide great insights into applying great artistry to superior ingredients. They may even give good information on what makes a great artichoke or a great tomato, but they will not tell you much about the difference between fresh chilies, dried chilies, and chili powder.<br />The primary strength of the book is precisely in it's pulling together between one pair of covers just about any information you may commonly want about fruits and vegetables and starches and fats and fish and chickens and so on... Almost all of the information is presented in a question and answer format, which has an appeal, but which has some drawbacks in a book that attains its greatest value as a reference. I suspect the format leads to inconsistent coverage of similar topics and misses on showing the similarities in cooking, for example, squid, octopus, and cuttlefish.<br />Another major strength of this book is that almost all the information in the book is top quality. I was truly impressed by the consistent quality of the advice from page to page and from subject to subject. I failed to find any general statement with which I would argue. There were some specifics on which I suspect the author may have not been careful enough to avoid short-term changes in the marketplace. On mustards, for example, she quite correctly gives the same opinion as a recent `Cooks Illustrated' article, saying that Dijon mustard has a relatively short shelf life. A good mustard may hold its bite for maybe about three months. Like `Cooks Illustrated' nine months ago, Ms. Meyers endorses the Maille brand of Dijon and discounts the American brand Gray Poupon. As luck would have it, in a recent article, `Cooks Illustrated' revisited mustards and found that aging bottles of Maille could not compare to a fresh bottle of Gray Poupon. Culinary wisdom changes and my observation is that Ms. Meyers is up to date on almost every issue. On seasoning meat, the latest thinking is to do it before searing. Ms. Meyers endorses this.<br />Yet another strength of the book is that the author is clearly not relying entirely on her own opinion. For many questions, the author quotes recognized authorities such as Maida Heather and Shirley Corriher especially on baking issues on which Ms. Meyer honestly confesses to not be an authority. The reliance on experts extends to referring to their books for important recipes as when she refers us to Julie Sahni and Madhur Jaffrey for recipes of garam masala.<br />One general argument I have with the book one I pick with every author who makes recommendations on things you should keep in your pantry. Buying any product with the expectation you will use it on some yet to be decided recipe is an invitation to waste. Ironically, my opinion on this is backed by none other than Madhur Jaffrey who answered the question on what to stock in the pantry by saying `Nothing'. Her solution is to shop only for the recipes that appeal to you. Eventually, you are sure to build up a supply of things you really need. Another general weakness I find in this book is the recipes. They seem to have no connection to the Q and A, and their choice seems to have no pattern. There are also some rather serious copy editing errors as when the roasting temperature for a roast duck was not stated.<br />The value you find in this book will depend on how much you already know and your style of cooking.<br />(...)w much you already know and your style of cooking.<br />(...)	2004-04-16

Neat Variations on Classics	This book, `Gale Gand's Short + Sweet' is the fourth work of which Gale Gand has been a co-author or principle author. Gale has demonstrated several of these recipes, especially the recipes for kids, on Gale's Food Network show, `Sweet Dreams'.<br />The book focuses on recipes that can be done quickly with eight or fewer ingredients. With a few caveats, the book succeeds in providing interesting, workable recipes for people with few pastry skills which can be done in a relatively short time, with no expensive ingredients and no unusual ingredients.<br />The recipes are divided among four chapters covering recipes which can be completed with 15 minutes, 30 minutes or 45 minutes active time, plus a chapter on `kid doable' recipes. The book gives relatively quick recipes for some old standards such as hot fudge sundaes, Clafouti, scones, Panna Cotta, chocolate chip cookies, shortbread, cheesecake, Tarte Tatin, turnovers, semifreddo, Tiramisu, apple tarts, cr&egrave;me brulee, buttermilk biscuits (c/o Shirley Corriher), cinnamon-raisin bread, and my all time favorite snickerdoodles.<br />While all these names are familiar, Gale gives a new twist to almost all of them, leaving only the venerable Shirley Corriher biscuit tradition and the snickerdoodle recipe untouched. Thus, she is following the same tradition as David Lebovitz by producing creative variations on the standards. Ms. Gand does a little better in my mind than Lebovitz in `Ripe for Desserts' in that she has concentrated on recipes that can be done easily and cheaply. Unlike Lebovitz first book, `Room for Dessert', Ms. Gand does not give long discussions on technique or ingredients. Her effort is redeemed by her recipes' simplicity.<br />There is a really important caveat to the claim that the recipes can be done in 15, 30, or 45 minutes. This caveat is that this does not include baking times, which can be up to 30 minutes. It also does not include refrigerate time to relax or condition intermediate preparations. This time is not inconsequential when it comes to planning kitchen time. On the other side of the coin, the recipes are quite good in giving points in the preparation where intermediate steps can be refrigerated or frozen before finishing. This may not be a big thing most of the time, but when it helps, it really helps.<br />There are some things I found which may only annoy a frustrated teacher. These are errors in fact or errors in grammar. The most glaring error in fact I found was the statement that balsamic vinegar is made from red grapes. Since this is such an obviously easy mistake to make, it signals a lack of care by the publisher's copy editor. The same can be said of the few very obvious grammatical errors.<br />I generally have little interest in photographs of savory dishes, but desserts are a different story. Desserts are as much about eye candy as they are food for the sweet tooth. On average, the pictures in this book are good to very good, with a few stinkers here and there. It is beyond me why the publishers could not see their way clear to include a photograph of every recipe. Desserts, especially when done for kids or for parties, can often be chosen on the basis of a picture.<br />I am delighted to see Gale Gand come up with some new episodes for her Food Network show `Sweet Dreams'. I am not a big dessert maker, but Gale, along with some other Food Network hosts comprises my favorite comfort food for the mind. This may seem somewhat insubstantial, but the rapport between Gale and her son, Gio, adds a warmth to her printed and TV presentations which may be missing or slightly phony with other hosts. I would seriously add this consideration to your evaluating this book for purchase.<br />This book is recommended for anyone who likes to create with desserts.

707305:US	39134375	RWLAFWUCYA4WB	0060507829	488482444	The Provence Cookbook	Books	5	145	157	N	Y	A better book on Provencal Home Cooking	The cookbooks of `cuisine Provence' just keep coming. The latest is the new book by Patricia Wells, whose credentials for doing a cookbook on a cuisine of France are impeccable, as she has already written seven (7), including an earlier book on Provence entitled `Patricia Wells at Home in Provence'. I made a point of reviewing the earlier book  (as well as four (4) of Wells' other books) when I saw the notice of the new book's being published.<br />Madame Wells gives no clue in this book to distinguish it from the earlier title. She does indicate that it marks the occasion of her living at the farmhouse, Chanteduc, with her husband for the last twenty years. My biggest question about the current volume is, after all the books which have already been published, what new can be said about the cuisine of this singularly fecund culinary terroir? The answer in this book is `A lot'.<br />Like Wells' earlier Provence book, this book does not dwell on standards such as Bouillabaisse or Salad Nicoise. It presents recipes of local restaurants and bistros and recipes invented by the author herself. There are still lots of references to friends and acquaintances such as Joel Robuchon who happens to be great French chef, but the emphasis in this book, unlike the earlier title, is much more on the restaurants and food producers and vendors of her neighborhood in Provence than it is about Madame Wells and her contacts to the greats of French cuisine. This concentration on contacts in Provence sometimes seems a bit absurd to 99% of Madame Wells' potential audience. What reader / cook in Duluth will have any interest whatsoever in the telephone and fax numbers of `Restaurant Le Mimosa'  just outside of Montpellier in Provence? Only that reader who will happen to be traveling to Provence within the next year, I gather. This doesn't mean there are no such contacts of value to the general reader. There are names, addresses, telephone numbers, and e-mail addresses (of course) to many local vintners, truffle merchants, and olive oil producers. I'm certain that if someone were absolutely determined to obtain a bottle of primo olive oil from Provence, they could use this information to track down a source. Note that the references to these merchants is certainly not an afterthought. The subtitle of the book states that it is a book of both recipes and a guide to markets, shops, and restaurants. I will chalk this up as a plus, as 175 good recipes for a list price of less than $30 is a bargain. Throw in first rate intelligence on Provencal merchants and I think the interested buyer will be getting their money's worth.<br />In addition to addresses and other contacts to Provencal restaurants, the book contains a three-page presentation of major market days in Provence, by day and by department. The end of the book also has three solid pages of sources gathered from the body of the book.<br />Regarding the recipes, I will not verify that she did not duplicate any recipes from the earlier book other than recipes for aioli, vinaigrettes, stocks, and pistu. Actually, I did check and find that Mme. Wells does not even duplicate her aioli or pistu recipes. That doesn't mean aioli and pistu are not used in the book. They are so ubiquitous that they even appear together in the `Spaghetti a l'Aioli au Pistou' dish. There are chicken stock recipes in both books and they are very similar, yet the one in the current volume is `homemade' and somewhat simpler than the earlier recipe.<br />The older and newer books are almost exactly the same length. The older book has eleven very traditional chapters. The newer book has thirteen chapters. It has the same eleven titles as the older book plus chapters on `Potatoes' and `Eggs and Cheese'.<br />I compared the recipes in the `Breads' chapter and found no overlap. Both books contained recipes for Fougasse (French focaccia-like flatbread), but the older book's treatment was a general treatment of this type of bread while the newer book deals only with a single recipe incorporating black olives. Treatment of bread in the older book more thorough in general.<br />I compared the salad recipes in the two books and found one overlapping title for a `winter salad', yet the two recipes were for two different winter salads.<br />I compared the potato recipes from the index of the older book to the potato recipes in the new book and again found no overlap. I did, however, find support for Madame Wells' statement in her introduction that her cooking has gotten simpler over the years. As interesting and diverse as the potato recipes are, they are all utterly simple, but not without a clever technique to two. The placing of a bay leaf in a thin slit in new potatoes is certainly new to me.<br />This book includes wine recommendations for every dish where a recommendation seems appropriate. As with all of her earlier books, the wine recommendations can be pretty arcane and may only be for very general guidance. No apology is made for the obscure references. If wine is not your thing, just ignore them. If you are as fond of wine as are the fictional Drs. Crane, then enjoy yourself.<br />If you are a fan of Provencal cooking, then you want both books. If you feel the need for at least one book on Provencal cooking and don't want to spring for Richard Olney's oversize tome, then get this newer volume. It's index and table of contents are superior to the earlier book and I do believe the recipes are simpler. If you are traveling to Provence, this book is a terrific find.<br />Highly recommended.

Highly Recommended	Author John Ash's rare combination of a professional chef's experience combined with a teacher's ability to communicate has produced this remarkable and welcome tutorial on how to execute various cooking tasks. The book lives up to the many blurbs from culinary luminaries headlined by a quotable from Emeril Lagasse on the front cover. The book is so good, it enhances my opinion of the commending writers for having the foresight to endorse the book.<br />On a very glib level, the book is a cross between Alton Brown's knack for explaining with Tom Colicchio's depth of culinary insight. The first stroke of genius is the organization of the chapters into a section on `flavor makers', a second section on techniques, and a third section on important ingredients. Learning about cooking has often struck me to be very similar to learning about chess. For the millions of combinations of ingredients (moves) there are really just a few simple rules one can learn with hundreds of variations posed by the moves of your opponent. One simply cannot learn chess by studying. You can only learn by playing (cooking) and by slowly gaining first hand experience with ingredients and the results of applying techniques. The author has accommodated this analogy by dividing cooking into three areas of discourse, loosely comparable to the opening (ingredients), middle game (techniques) and ending (flavor makers). I am sure this analogy will not bear too much analytical weight. It succeeds if it highlights the fact that you must learn cooking by actually working with foods and experiencing its behavior, smell, and taste.<br />I have occasionally been disappointed by such promising titles such as Tom Colicchio's `How to Think Like a Chef', but my disappointment has been part of the lesson and not a failure of Colicchio's book. He gives lots of recipes and very few general principles. Ash's book is no different in that there are only a few general principles and plenty of recipes, although the genius of Ash's presentation makes the book satisfying all the way through. While Colicchio and Charlie Trotter and Eric Rippert, great chefs all, have written inspired books about cooking in general, Ash is a professional educator as well as being a talented chef.<br />One way of viewing Ash's book is to see it as a visit from the Snap-On tool supply truck. Reading the book furnishes your mental toolchest with eighteen (18) tools that can be used in a broad range of applications. My favorite example is the lesson called `Vinaigrettes: Not Just for Salads'. As the title indicates, vinaigrette is one of those `Swiss Army Knife' preparations like a marinara sauce. It can easily be used in a lot of different situations with great results. Ash doesn't limit himself to the olive oil / vinegar / mustard / shallot / salt and pepper classic and it's applications. He brings in citrus as the acid, stocks as part of the liquid, honey, miso, soy sauce, ginger, cilantro, and dried fruits. He extends the lesson to advice on how to pair vinaigrette to the composition of other elements in a dish or a meal. I also welcome his mentioning of a brand of corn oil prepared in a way which calls up the picture of artisinal olive oil production. The oil, he claims, actually tastes like corn. What a concept!<br />The lessons on the other four `flavor makers', Salsas, Pestos, Marinades, and Sauces all follow the same pattern of broadening our understanding of these preparations. The greatest contribution of all these chapters is not that they show you how to make these specific eight or ten or twelve recipes. The contribution is that they show you how to improvise with these ingredients. I can still remember the revelation I experienced when I realized that pesto / pistu is not just for pasta. I was amazed when for the first time I saw it being used as a garnish to soup. There is a lot of this kind of horizon expanding exposition going on in these pages.<br />The selection of topics for techniques and for ingredients is equally inspired. In a sense, there is even more illumination in these sections than in `flavor makers' since both sections contain at least one surprising topic. Techniques gives us a lesson on oven drying, a method which I have seen used here and there, now and then, and highlighted as a general tool only in books covering Raw Foods techniques. Ash brings the technique into the main stream as a routine tool for the home cook. The ingredients section includes a chapter on soy foods which has a distinction between Chinese and Japanese tofu, the first time I've seen this distinction made. This section also discusses miso, relatively new to American culinary vocabularies, and Tempeh, which may be quite new to most Americans.<br />I do not know much about wine, but I welcome it in all sorts of cooking applications. Therefore, I was delighted to find that the final essay was a concise, excellent discussion of wines as they are used in cooking. True to the end, the book's food facts are accurate in it's addressing the question of whether cooking drives off the alcohol. The book's discussion of the issue is deeper than any other I have seen, in that it gives estimates of how much alcohol remains after various cooking techniques heat the added alcoholic ingredient. The discussion is crowned by a clear explanation of what alcohol adds to dishes in language that makes sense to educated lay cooks. There is none of the meaningless statements that alcohol is `a conductor of flavor'.<br />This book is not a complete text on cooking methods. For that, see, for example, Madeleine Kamman's `The New Education of a Cook' But, this is an exceptional cookbook which really should be read from cover to cover.<br />Very highly recommended.

709185:US	39134375	R2O0AJMOEV49CT	0600607909	668260391	The Bread Book: The Definitive Guide to Making Bread By Hand or Machine	Books	3	14	21	N	N	Interesting If you are a Bread Machine Person	This `the bread book' by Sara Lewis is subtitled `The definitive guide to making bread by hand or machine'. This subtitle claim is definitively wrong, in that the book has only 140 pages of text to cover both manual and bread machine bread baking. In contrast, there are books on yeast breads alone that do not cover bread making machines or gluten-free breads that run to over 600 pages.<br />One may argue that the book achieves its `definitive' credentials by covering, however briefly, all bread making topics. This claim is clearly unfounded, as the book makes no mention whatsoever of sourdough, sponges, poolish, or any other type of artisinal breadmaking.<br />The `definitive' claim may be based on the dual focus on both manual and bread machine techniques. However, I believe this dual approach betrays the reader in that manual methods are severely compromised to fit the order of operations needed to use a bread machine in order that the procedures for the two techniques can be laid out in parallel. The clearest example is in the recipe for the `Farmhouse white loaf' where the first step in the manual procedure simply duplicates by hand what the machine is doing. In a procedure optimized for hand or hand plus stand mixer technique, the yeast is bloomed in warm water with sugar before adding it to the dough, salt is not added until the yeast and flour have been well mixed so the salt does not impede the yeast action, and the butter is not added until the dough has been thoroughly kneaded.<br />The dependence on the bread machine paradigm also leads to handmade recipes that would probably not pass muster with a anyone with a devotion to tradition. Every other recipe I have ever seen for brioche requires at least 8 hours for the dough to rise before baking. This book specifies less than an hour. If you make this recipe, it will probably be taste, it will probably simply not be brioche.<br />I also suspect that the book is ignoring the difference between two different types of US yeast packaging and labeling. Fleishmans and every other US producer call the type of yeast that is bloomed in warm water and sugar `active dry yeast'. The yeast for bread machines which does not require advance blooming is labeled instant or fast acting yeast. This book uses the term `active dry yeast' as if it were `instant' yeast. I suspect the recipes work if you use `active dry yeast', but I am not sure you will achieve optimal results.<br />It is very important for US readers to know that this book was written in England and uses a UK vernacular throughout. On the good side, this means that all measurements larger than teaspoon or tablespoon are given in metric weight or volume, Imperial weight or volume, and by cup. All oven settings are also given in Fahrenheit, Centigrade, and Gas Mark. This is all very ecumenical, but it means that the book may be just a little tougher reading for a Yankee than it is for a Brit. There is a very handy conversion table for UK to US terms at the beginning of the book, but the number of entries just goes to show how much mental translation us Yanks will have to do as we read the book.<br />After so many negative findings in this book, I think it deserves some positive comments. The first is that the range of bread types covered by the book is quite broad. It is impressive to see that a bread machine is capable of doing such diverse products as pretzels, spiral (roulade) breads, fougasse, and corn bread. The caveat is that for some of the more diversely shaped breads as pretzels and roulades, the bread machine simply does not do the whole job. Rather, it typically mixes the ingredients, kneads, and does a first or first and second rise. The final shaping and baking must be done in a conventional oven.<br />In summary, for UK savvy readers, the book is very readable, its instructions are easy to follow, and it will probably give acceptable results; however, its pretensions on being definitive are misleading, and it should probably only be used by those who have and like using a bread machine. For Yanks who don't want a bread machine, get any one of the dozen good books on breadmaking by Peter Reinhart, Nancy Silverton, Rose Levy Beranbaum, or Bernard Clayton.ould probably only be used by those who have and like using a bread machine.

Highly Recommended	Of all the single topics on which cookbooks have been written, it seems to me that fish is the most common. It is certainly true if you look at my library, where there are seven (7) volumes devoted to fish in general, fish of a particular region, or even one family of fish such as the salmon or oysters. Not only is it a popular subject, but it is a popular subject for prominent male cookbook authors. In my library alone, there are volumes by James Beard, James Peterson, Alan Davidson, and the current volume by Mark Bittman. All of these authors are simply dripping with awards for cookbook writing.<br />There are at least two different approaches one can take to a single subject cookbook. James Peterson in his books on Fish, Sauces, and Vegetables tends to take a deep look, with more details about a fewer number of recipes. Mark Bittman, in this book, tends to take exactly the opposite approach. His main selling point is that he is giving us `more than 500 recipes for 70 kinds of fish and seafood'.<br />Fitting this approach, the book is laid out very much like an encyclopedia, with all articles on fish labeled by their common names, placed in alphabetical order. Each article begins with a taxonomic section giving both common and scientific names, common commercial forms, general description, substitutions, and reference to buying tips. The scientific name may not be very informative, as a common name such as shrimp may be applied to not only multiple species, but also multiple genera covering thousands of species. The general description is also a mixed bag in that it may be anything from physical description to geographical distribution to economic importance. The most important item in this header is the `For other recipes see:' entry. This is where you see that a recipe that is good for conch, mussels, or oysters may also be good for clams. I get some sense that the author could have exercised some restraint here. As an example, consider that while squid and shrimp share the property of being done best by cooking very quickly, I may be reluctant to apply a long cooking squid recipe, the kind Mario Batali describes as giving a `bottom of the sea' flavor to any kind of shrimp.<br />The essay introducing each named fish can vary from three pages for `shrimp' down to three lines for `tilapia'. The longer essays are very informative and, as far as I can see, very accurate. I can also add that they can express very strong opinions about some fish. The very short entry for tilapia dismisses the flesh of the fish as having an undesirable, murky flavor. The author gives no recipes for this poor fish and simply leaves us to consult the recipes for porgy and sea bass.<br />The number of recipes per fish is roughly proportional to the economic desirability and availability of the fish. Shrimp, for example, gets twenty recipes including three different versions of curried shrimp. Other classic recipes such as crab cakes also get more than one treatment. Oddly enough, the best-known American shrimp dish, the shrimp cocktail, is not here. Not that I really miss it. The twenty recipes do seem to cover the world, with a just about right distribution of recipes from America, the Mediterranean, and the Pacific Rim.<br />Most recipes are concise without being overly sparse. The list of ingredients is better than many. For example, it goes to the trouble of specifying a `dry' white wine for a sauce and it is precise enough to say ½ cup minced parsley rather than the less precise `handful of parsley, minced'. The procedure is clear and I have yet to find any mistakes (I cannot say the same for the equally distinguished James Peterson's procedures). I prefer recipes written with numbered steps, with each step beginning on a new line, but I prefer good recipes to bad even more, and most of these recipes seem to be better than average.<br />As many, if not most of the recipes in this book are ethnic classics and not the invention of the author, the chance is good that they will appeal to those who are disposed to like the ingredients. If you don't like coconut, don't fault the author for giving recipes using coconut. Since there are so many different recipes from so many different culinary traditions, the chances that you will find something interesting to do with your lovely swordfish steak will be very high. As a food editor for `The New York Times', Bittman has greater access to current and historical information about fish dishes than most, so the depth and reliability of the information herein is very high.<br />This book is by no means a complete book of fish cookery. There are some entries for escabeche and seviche, but not a word about sushi or sashimi. Of all the books I mentioned on Fish Cookery, I may prefer James Beard for the last word on recipes from America or Alan Davidson for recipes from the Mediterranean, but Bittman has given us a book which gives a broad coverage to recipes from around the world. He succeeds admirably in achieving his goal `to teach you how to buy good, commonly available fish, and cook it quickly in a variety of basic and delicious ways.<br />Highly recommended.

712064:US	39134375	R2FE5E5SECBZI4	1558322221	511193330	Biscuit Bliss: 101 Foolproof Recipes for Fresh and Fluffy Biscuits in Just Minutes	Books	5	65	66	N	N	Great American Answer to Tapas and Mezes	James Villas is an old school culinary writer. He was a friend and confidant of both James Beard and Craig Claiborne. He was born and raised in North Carolina and many of his books have featured Southern cooking subjects and styles. This book is no exception.<br />The book is an almost perfect follow-up to his last effort, `Crazy About Casseroles' in that both books deal with a single subject which is at the core of both Southern and American cooking styles. I am especially fond of single subject cookbooks, whether the subject is a style of dish like gratins and casseroles or an ingredient like potatoes or eggs. Therefore, the score of this book starts with a score in my mind of four (4) stars instead of three (3) before I even read the first page.<br />The book's subject can be divided into two major topics. The first topic is basic biscuit techniques, covering all the variations in flour, leavening, fat, oven temperature, and dough versus batter. The second topic deals with how to apply all those various techniques to sweet and savory additions.<br />Techniques are covered in Chapters on `Biscuit Basics', `Plain Raised Biscuits', and `Drop Biscuits'. The greatest virtue of basic biscuit technique is its simplicity. This does not mean a person can make good biscuits, much less make good biscuits on the first try, after reading a single recipe that gives no insight into biscuit subtleties. The first batch of biscuits I made a few years ago was from Jim Villas' mother's recipes he published in his memoir `Between Bites'. I confess that the process had me puzzled, sticky, and a bit disappointed, even though I am sure I followed the instructions to a tee.<br />Part of the puzzle may be due to the fact that making biscuits is a lot more like making pastry than it is like making bread. While bread is vigorously kneaded to develop gluten and the starting mix of ingredients is often warm to accommodate the yeast or other organic starter, biscuits are worked with cold ingredients and low protein (soft) flour. The dough is worked hardly at all and is cut into disks while the fat is still in oatmeal flaked globs. Sounds like pastry to me.<br />As I have had a fair amount of experience with various recipes from both Southern bakers and baking experts, I can say with confidence that Mr. Villas knows his stuff when it comes to biscuits. I thoroughly endorse his recommendation to use a brand of Southern soft flour such as White Lily. I only have two disappointments with the discussion of techniques. First, Villas describes a classic Southern method of biscuit making wherein the cook empties an entire 5 pound bag of flour into a bowl, adds wet ingredients, salt, and leavenings, and creates a ball of dough in a depression in the dough. Yet, Villas does not give us the recipe for this technique. He doesn't even explain why he doesn't give a recipe. I know there are still serious Southern cooks who use this technique, as I saw one demonstrate the technique on Martha Stewart's show about a year ago. The second disappointment is that he has no basic recipe where the only fat is butter. I have used such a recipe by Nick Malgieri with White Lily flour and buttermilk, and I find it as good or better than Villas' mother's recipe. Otherwise, I think the coverage of biscuit techniques is tiptop. Were I writing the same thing, I may have included a table comparing the recipes. This may facilitate one's personal experiments in the technique. I would also argue that basic biscuit technique is a better starting point for adolescent bakers than the drop biscuit technique. I don't think drop biscuit technique is easier and the basic technique is more versatile.<br />The second main subject of the book is what you can do with biscuits and biscuit dough. This can be divided roughly into four areas: sweet additions, savory additions, scones, and biscuits as pastry. Appropriate to the title of this review, the range of variations possible in biscuits gives me the idea that a home entertainer can give all their books on French and Spanish and Italian and Greek `little bites' recipes a rest and spend several months experimenting with hors d'ourves / antipasti / tapas / Mezes based on biscuits. As soon as I write this, I confess that even the lightest biscuits may be a bit heavy to stand alone among the martinis and margaritas, but I do suggest that you give the pizza and foccacia a rest and give these recipes a try. As biscuits, like chowder, are very close to being a true American invention, they are perfect as part of American cooking menus.<br />While I am often surprised at how new many kitchen techniques such as baking powder are, I am also often surprised at how old some methods are. Many techniques such as cooking in a bag and using packaged dough as stew topping are touted as new ideas based on marketed products, when actually the techniques are centuries old. Such is the case with using biscuits as a topping for pot pies and casseroles. Villas raises the veil from our eyes in revealing the historical sources for these old biscuit techniques.<br />I liked this book a lot and I recommend it to anyone who wishes to master biscuits and who may find a gold mine of quick, relatively easy recipes with a big `wow' factor.<br />Highly recommended.

Excellent Read	Harold McGee is probably the most widely cited writer in American culinary writing today. Alton Brown literally genuflects at the mention of his name and complains that he is hard pressed to find a subject on which Herr McGee has not already explored at some length. His major work, `On Food and Cooking' appears to be on the short list of Culinary Institute of America references for their students, next to Escoffier and their own references.<br />This work, `The Curious Cook', is a bit different that the other work, in spite of the subtitle `More Kitchen Science and Lore'. The larger book is largely theoretical. This book is largely experimental and its subtitle should be the title of the first and longest section `Playing With Food'. The lesson taught here is probably the single most important lesson you can learn in any endeavor. That is, when in doubt, try a little experiment. When I was studying philosophy, this largely took the form of thought experiments, not unlike the development of a Science Fiction plot. `What would happen if there were artificial people who were indistinguishable from biological humans. The result is the story `Blade Runner'. When I worked with chemistry, this step was obvious. Oddly, I had to relearn the lesson when I became a professional programmer. It took a few years and more than a few books to learn the value of prototyping code, even for some of the most simple algorithms. All this means is that when you cook, YOU ARE ALLOWED TO TRY THINGS OUT WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF SEEING IF SOMETHING WORKS. My favorite example is in making and using a simple bechamel sauce to make macaroni and cheese or creamed chipped beef without having the sauce break.<br />I am constantly amazed at the blissful ignorance behind some common misstatements by very good professional chefs who have established themselves as celebrity educators on various TV cooking shows. I suspect the most common is the statement that laying meat into a hot saute pan sears the flesh to seal in the moisture. This misstatement is the subject of McGee's first chapter, where with a simple kitchen scale, he demonstrates what should be common sense to anyone with some knowledge of physics. Application of high heat reduces the moisture in the meat. This essay was published before the Food Network was a gleam in network entrepreneurs' eyes, yet Emeril and Tyler and Rachael and even Wolfgang repeat this misstatement on a regular basis. The lucky thing about this statement is that searing meat or any other food for that matter, has a very important benefit, in that it develops flavor through caramelization and the Maillard reactions. By design or by chance, the explanation of the Maillard reactions come in the very last chapter of the book, providing the reason we have been searing food for millennia.<br />There are other books that deal with food and science. Some of the most recent and most famous are `Cookwise' by Shirley Corriher, `I'm Only Here for the Food' by Alton Brown, and `What Einstein Told His Cook' by Robert Wolke. All of these works are exceptionally good books. But, none of these works give the kind on encouragement and the kind of clues you need to find culinary answers on your own.<br />One warning may be in order. Science, i.e., the method of experimentation and observation is the most powerful method developed to answer questions and acquire knowledge, but it is certainly not enough to make you a superior cook. For example, I really like Alton Brown's `Good Eats' shows and I often use his recipes, but whenever I see Mario Batali do something in a different way than Alton, I invariably use Mario's recipe or method rather than Brown's suggestion. The heart of the reason behind this is that Mario Batali is a very, very good professional chef and Alton Brown is not. Preparing food is a fine mix between knowledge and artistic expression. Professional chefs know the best ways to do things to achieve the most desirable culinary result, even if they do not know the scientific explanation for why they do things in a certain way.<br />I will warn you that some of the essays in Parts II and III are a bit long on reflection and a bit short on practical application. I may even go so far as to say some of these sections are just a bit dull. In spite of this, the first section on `Playing with Food' plus the essays on aluminum and the Maillard reactions are all pure gold for the dedicated foodie.<br />Very highly recommended for anyone interested in food.en if they do not know the scientific explanation for why they do things in a certain way.<br />I will warn you that some of the essays in Parts II and III are a bit long on reflection and a bit short on practical application.

A foodie must read.	`The Cook and the Gardner' by the young culinary journalist who has added a thoroughly enjoyable chronicle of seasonal cooking and gardening to that very small niche of books joining horticulture with gastronomy. The only other recent volume in this very small corner of culinary writing is `The Arrows Cookbook', a work dealing with the vegetable and herb garden attached to a three season Maine restaurant.<br />Like some other recent books on French life, this book develops a picture of a disappearing phenomenon, the chateau kitchen garden in rural France, tended by a dedicated gardener living on the premises. The chateau and garden is in Burgundy, owned by the renowned Anne Willen, the culinary schoolmistress of La Varenne Pratique. Oddly enough, Madame Willen never appears in this story and her works are cited less frequently than authors with a more historical bent, led by references to works by Elizabeth David. Willen appears primarily as the author's employer. The author's mentor, rather, is the Italian culinary authority, Nancy Harmon Jenkins. It is completely fitting with the antiquity of the context that most references in the book's exceptional bibliography are to works in French and Italian which were published in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.<br />The cook of the book's title is the author, herself. The gardener of the book is the garrulous, elderly (mid seventies) Monsieur Milbert who, with his wife, occupies the chateau's gatehouse and who works the chateau's traditional walled garden which appears to be a square of 50 meters or more to a side. The author's story begins in early spring and spans four full seasons at the Burgundy chateau kitchen where her `day job' is responsibility for meals served at the chateau for up to sixteen people at a sitting.<br />Monsieur Milbert on the face of it is a stock Hollywood movie character. He is very slow to warm to the young American interloper, in spite of the fact that they are colleagues in the employ of the same house. Eventually, of course, he begins working with Ms. Hesser and shares with her his thinkings on horticultural matters as she helps him with various tasks to work her way into his good graces. Unlike the Hollywood character, Monsieur Milbert never really breaks from his very, very provincial mindset. The gardener's horticultural practice is the oddest mix of superstition and practical experience. Almost every aspect of planting is governed by phases of the moon. Almost every expectation about future weather is based on a totally unscientific observation of unconnected phenomena. On the other hand, planting, pruning, weeding, and cultivating is based on sound wisdom gained from personal observation and hundreds of years of accumulated experience.<br />The culinary material in the book is ordered entirely by the season and by the location. In spite of the culinary pedigree of the landlord, the style of cooking appears to be derived less from `haute cuisine' than from `la cuisine Regionale'. The first clue is that there are very few references to drinking wine in the book. The only references to wine are as traditional ingredients to soups and braises. A sure sign that we are in Burgundy and not Provence is the fact that there are simply no recipes or even any references to eggplant.<br />Each season has its own section and introduction. For each season, there are recipes that are distinctive of the entire season. One of the most novel sets of recipes within this schema is the four seasonal recipes for stock. Spring opens with a stock based on beef bones. Summer contributes a vegetable stock. Autumn weighs in with a poultry stock (with a strict warning to not mix duck parts with other fowl). Winter completes the year with a return to a stock based on beef bones. On the matter of stocks, I am really happy to see Ms. Hesser rail against the stockpot as garbage collector for any odd piece of leftover gristle.<br />Within each season are three chapters onthe three months in that season. Each month is represented by about a dozen recipes. Appropriate to the garden at the center of the story, most recipes are vegetarian and many meat dishes are based on chicken, game fowl, and rabbit. There are virtually no recipes for seafood, although there is some North African influence in the appearance of salt preserved lemons. The chapters also spend a lot of time with the kind of culinary work you would expect in a rural farm kitchen. A lot of space is dedicated to making preserves, pickles, and comfits. True to the very provincial environment, space is also dedicated to unusual fruits such as medlar and persimmon.<br />This is a culinary work which is meant to be read from cover to cover. If you have your own kitchen garden in US horticultural zones four through seven, you are bound to find the suggestions doubly enriching. If you are tied to a city apartment, you will still find plenty to enjoy. There is much to learn about cooking, but the real gold is in the battle between the French gardener and his neophyte cook comrade against the elements, to harvest truly magnificent seasonal vegetables.<br />A classic culinary read.

It is one answer to my wish that every TV chef who is attempting to teach cooking to us foodies take a two semester course in chemistry. The book is not a rigorous approach to the chemistry of sugars, salt, fats, chemical leavenings, heat, acids, bases, and the like. Rather, it is a collection of enhanced answers to questions posed to the author in a regular newspaper column. This makes the book more interesting to read, if a little less available as a resource to applying its teachings to new situations.<br />The second chapter on salt is a perfect example of the kind of misunderstandings this book clears up. More than one TV chef (and more than one cookbook author) has spoken at great length about differences in salt, giving one the impression that there is a basic difference between table salt, kosher salt, and sea salt. There is, of course, a difference, but that difference is based almost entirely on the physical differences, akin to the difference between liquid and frozen water. All salt is sodium chloride. By weight, no type of salt gives a saltier result than another. The very small additional differences between, say, kosher salt and sea salt are in the presence of incredibly small quantities minerals in addition to sodium chloride. Even differences in taste may be due to the differences in physical form. I have a sense that these considerations may be just a little too subtle to be worth all this fuss. I'm inclined to agree, until it occurs to me that if someone hears a statement that `kosher salt' is less salty than table salt, they may use this as a reason to use more kosher salt and ignore the evidence of their senses that they are indeed eating a lot of salt. This becomes significant if one must lower their intake of sodium chloride.<br />This book addresses many such confusions, and addresses them accurately and persuasively. It does this so well that Alton Brown wishes he would have written this book. My suggestion to Alton Brown is that with the lesson of this book, he would be able to do a better job of it.<br />I may be stepping on an intellectual land mine here since I have not yet read Shirley Corriher's book `Cookwise' so I do not know if she has already been over this territory, but here goes.<br />I think the definitive book on food science for the masses has not been written yet. This book covers many of the right topics and I found no inaccuracies in the science. But, the book suffers from being a collection of edited columns. Science is about theories explaining facts. For example, a full explanation of salt would involve a discussion of what a salt is, in general, and use this information to show, among other things, why salt is dangerous to people with hypertension and how chemicals other than table salt can influence body fluid volume in hypertensives.<br />A scientific discussion would extend the notion of salts to what it means to dissolve a salt in water. By doing so, it would clear up the most seriously abused work in cooking explanations. That word is `dissolve' and it's various past, past perfect and pluperfect tenses. Almost every culinary demonstrator on TV and many writers in cookbooks misuse the term dissolve by applying it to the very different operations of creating an emulsion, melting, and creating a colloid.<br />I think what I am really recommending as some future Alton Brown project is a book that combines physics, chemistry, and physiology to give an UNDERSTANDING of food, cooking, and health. Understanding is the real goal of science, so that one can apply what one knows in one situation to cooking food in other situations. Strange as it may seem, this is an almost perfect characterization of what Herr Brown believes he is doing.<br />The subtitle of this book, `Kitchen Science Explained' is a perfect representation of how this book is not science itself, but the carrying of science to the `gentiles'. In itself, the title is a redundancy, since science itself is explanation incarnate.<br />This is a very good book. I found no errors (I was a professional chemist, so I would probably have found really bad errors if there were any) in science. I believe the writing is lucid and entertaining. I believe the author is always intellectually honest in saying when either he does not know the answer or if science in general does not yet have an explanation.<br />The only point of my ranting is that this is not the ideal book on food science which bridges the gap between the research of Harold McGee and the practical worlds of Alton Brown and Shirley Corriher. A book that comes a lot closer to this goal is McGee's book, `The Curious Cook'.<br />I recommend this book to anyone with any curiosity about food.

This book, the continuation of `Mastering the Art of French Cooking' by Julia Child and Simone Beck is certainly in that most unique position among cookbooks written in English and published in the United States.<br />This volume is truly a simple extension of the material in the original work, which was recently published in a 40th anniversary edition by its publisher, Alfred E. Knopf and its principle author, Julia Child. As told in Ms. Child's autobiography, the original manuscript brought to Judith Jones at Knopf ran to over a thousand printed pages. About two fifths of that material was put to the side and most of it appears in this second volume. All this means is that you are unlikely to really have a full coverage of the subject of French Cooking as intended by the authors unless you have both volumes.<br />The first chapter has a clear sign that this volume rounds out the work in that it gives soups a much more thorough coverage than the first volume. Most importantly, it includes recipes for that quintessential French dish, bouillabaisse. To complement this subject is coverage of seafood such as a tour of the anatomy of a lobster that would put seafood specialist cookbooks to shame.<br />The biggest single addition to the subject in this book is its coverage of baking and pastry. Here is one place where the book may be seen to diverge from its focus of the French housewife's cooking practice. As the book states clearly in the first chapter, practically no baking is done at home, since there is a Boulangerie on every street corner. I generally find the level of detail on baking in cookbooks specializing on savory dishes to be much too light to give the reader an adequate appreciation of the subject. This book covers baking with a level of detail which would make most baking book authors blush. A sign of this deep, quality coverage is the diagrams used to illustrate baking techniques. The line drawings typically succeed where photographs do not in that they can be easily incorporated into the text and the drawing can eliminate extraneous detail and show the reader only what is important in understanding the technique. The section on making classic French bread ends with a `self-criticism' section we may nowadays call a debugging section. It lists several different things that may go wrong with your product, and how to fix them. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in only baking, let alone the rest of us.<br />The quality of presentation continues with the coverage of pastry. Some books on pastry give one pie dough. Some good books on pastry may give three or four. This book gives eight, with a clear indication of the differences in when to use the various doughs. Some books on pastry describe how to make puff pastry. This book gives a really complete explanation, with abundant diagrams. I suspect that very few people want to make their own puff pastry, but anyone who uses store-bought pastry will benefit from knowing how it is made. This section is worth five different expositions on the subject on the Food Network rolled into one.<br />Another major subject untouched in the original volume is the long chapter on Charcuterie. That is, the techniques needed to make sausages, salted pork and goose, pates, and terrines. Like the description of puff pastry, this chapter contains a lot you may never need, but then again, I am a great believer in serendipity. You never know where you may hit upon an idea to add interest to you cooking practice. The simplest product you can garner from these techniques is the method for making breakfast sausage, which needs no casing. The subject really wakes up when you realize that the subject arose as a method for preserving meats, just like canning and pickling were developed to preserve fruits and vegetables. If economy and the old hippie / whole earth catalogue ethic areyour thing, this is something you will want to check out. And, I have seen this subject covered in recent books such as Paul Bertolli's `Cooking by Hand', and this book's coverage of the material is more useful.<br />Another gem in this book is the coverage of desserts, including frozen desserts, custards, shortcake, meringue, charlottes, and on and on and on. The guidance on novel uses of puff pastry has probably been a source for more TV shows on the subject than you can count on your fingers. The recipe for leftover pastry dough is just another indication of how practical the material in this book can be.<br />The appendices contain `stuff' that virtually no other cookbooks touch. One contains a cross listing of recipes for meat and vegetable stuffings. I did not have enough room in my review of volume one to cite the quality of the material on kitchen equipment. As both books have been updated several times since the early sixties, both contain modern tools such as the food processor and the latest heavy-duty mixer attachments. Aside from being as complete a catalogue of hand tools I have ever seen, I find the presentation done with the kind of good humor which was the hallmark of Julia Child's PBS shows.<br />The last major feature of this volume is a two-color index that covers both volumes. Please be warned. These books have neither simple cooking nor low calorie dishes. The object of this style of cooking was to make the very best of inexpensive ingredients.<br />Each page offers more reasons to be impressed by this work. Any true foodie should be ashamed if they do not own and read these volumes.your thing, this is something you will want to check out.

717218:US	39134375	R2FZDYS5HINGW8	0375413405	595899642	Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Vol. 1	Books	5	603	630	N	N	Most Important Cookbook of the Last 50 Years. Period.	Rarely are we able to say with certainty that a book is at the top of its subject in regard and quality. This book, `Mastering the Art of French Cooking' by Julia Child, Louisette Bertholle, and Simone Beck is certainly in that most unique position among cookbooks written in English and published in the United States.<br />With Julia Child's celebrity arising from her long series of TV cooking shows on PBS, it may be easy to forget how Ms. Child rose to a position with the authority that gave her the cachet to do these shows in the first place. This book is the foundation of that cachet and the basis of Ms. Child's influence with an entire generation of amateur and professional chefs.<br />It may also be easy to forget that this book has three authors and not just one. The three began as instructors in a school of French cooking, `Les Ecole des Trois Gourmandes' operating in Paris in the 1950's. And, it was from their experience with this school that led them to write this book. To be fair, Julia Child originated a majority of the culinary content and contributed almost all of the grunt work with her editors and publisher to get the book published.<br />The influence of this book cannot be underestimated. It has been written that the style of recipe writing even influenced James Beard, the leading American culinary authority at the time, to change his style of writing in a major cookbook on which he was working when `...French Cooking' was published. Many major American celebrity experts in culinary matters have cited Child and this book as a major influence. Not the least of these is Martha Stewart and Ina Garten. It is interesting that these first to come to mind are not professional chefs, but caterers and teachers of the household cook. Child was not necessarily teaching `haute cuisine', she was teaching what has been named `la cuisine Bourgeoise' or the cooking of the housewife and, to some extent, the cooking of the bistro and brasserie, not the one or two or three star restaurant.<br />The table of contents follows a very familiar and very comfortable outline, with major chapters covering Soups, Sauces, Eggs, Entrees and Luncheon Dishes, Fish, Poultry, Meat, Vegetables, Cold Buffet, and Deserts and Cakes. The table of contents does not itemize every recipe, but it does break topics down so that one can come very close to a type of preparation you wish from the table of contents. One of the very attractive schemas used to organize recipes in this book is to take a general topic such as Roast Chicken and give not one, but many different variations on this basic method. Under Roast Chicken, for example, you see Spit-roasted Chicken, Roast Chicken Basted with Cream, Roast Chicken Steeped with Port Wine, Roast Squab Chickens with Chicken Liver Canapes, Casserole-roasted Chicken with Tarragon and Casserole-roasted Chicken with Bacon. Thus, the book is not only a tutorial of techniques, it is also a work of taxonomy, giving one a picture of the whole range of variations possible to a basic technique.<br />The book goes far beyond being a simple collection of recipes in many other ways without straying from the culinary material. Unlike books combining regional recipes with anecdotal memoirs, this book is all business. Heading the recipes is a wealth of general knowledge on cooking variables such as weights versus cooking time and conditions. Headnotes also include general techniques on, for example, how to truss a chicken (with drawings) and many deep observations on professional technique. The notes on roasting chicken instructing one to attend to all the senses in watching and listening to the cooking meat in order to obtain the very best results. This may have easily come from the pen of Wolfgang Puck or Mario Batali.<br />The individual recipe writing is detailed in the extreme, and recipes typically run to two to three times as long as you may see in `The Joy of Cooking' or `James Beard's American Cookery'. The recipes are also very `modular'. A single recipe may actually require the cooking of two or three component preparations. This is not an invention of Julia Child. I believe she has captured here an essential characteristic of French culinary tradition. The most common of these advance preparations is a stock. More complicated examples are to make a potato salad, a dish in itself, as a component to a Salade Nicoise. What Child may have originated, at least to the world of American cookbook writing, is the notion of a Master Recipe, where many different dishes are presented as variations on a basic preparation. This notion has been used and misused for decades.<br />This book has become so important in its field that it seems almost irreverent to question the quality of the recipes. I can only say that I have prepared several dishes from these pages, and have always produced a tasty dish and learned something new with each experience. While there are other excellent introductions to French Cooking such as Madeline Kamman's `The New Making of a Chef', one simply cannot go wrong by using this book as ones entree into cooking in general and French cooking in particular.<br />The more I read other cooking authorities' writing, the more I respect the work of Julia Child and company. Observations on technique that went right over my head two years ago are now revealed as signs of a deep insight into cooking technique.<br />As large as the book is, the material presented to Knopf in 1961 was actually much larger and the second volume of the book is largely material created for the original writing. To get a reasonably complete picture of French Cookery, do get both volumes at the same time.<br />A true classic with both simple and advanced techniques.

As I have just reviewed a classic, `The Breakfast Book' from the widely recognized author, Marion Cunningham, it seemed only appropriate that I tackle this new breakfast book by an equally honored writer who is best known for her books on vegetarian cooking co-authored with the Moosewood Collective.<br />Before I loose you in my usually long discourse, let me say that this book can do more good for your eating and health than just about any three other books put together. This opinion is based both on the quality of the book and the special position of it's subject.<br />Most people give less attention to breakfast than to either lunch or dinner. This means that breakfast is the one meal where the room for improvement is the greatest. It certainly has a higher potential for improvement than lunch, as most people eat lunch outside of the home. Even if they carry lunch from home, the range of foods, which can be made portable without special equipment, is smaller than what can be prepared and eaten in ones own kitchen.<br />This book is directed not only at a very wide range of good breakfast food, it is also directed at giving you the information you need to eat a nutritious breakfast with few or no `empty calories.<br />The book starts with a brief essay on how the body deals with carbohydrates, especially upon eating the first meal of the day, or, `breaking fast'. The long and the short of this story is that you are much better eating whole grains with protein and good fats rather than sugars and quickly digested starches. The remainder of the book is dedicated to making this option appealing.<br />The recipe chapters are:<br />Beverages: The straight skinny on coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and smoothies.<br />Fruit, including fruit salads, dried and roasted fruits, and crisp or cobbler.<br />Grains, Cereals, and Porridges, including an excellent tabular presentation of grain cooking characteristics.<br />Muffins, Biscuits, Breads, and Buns, including all the classics plus great stuff with bran and whole grains.<br />Eggs, Tofu, Scrambles, Quiches &amp; Souffles, or Protein Central. Lots of basic methods.<br />Potatoes, Beans, Tempeh &amp; Hashes. Lots of Potato recipes and unusual hashes.<br />(Other) Vegetables for Breakfast, especially tomatoes, mushrooms, and spinach<br />Griddle Foods: Pancakes, Waffles, Blintzes, Crepes &amp; French Toast<br />Yogurt and Cheese: Lactose central with (mostly) ricotta and other soft cheeses.<br />Puddings and Custards: Sweeten up your egg protein and vegetable goodness.<br />Condiments, Sauces, Toppings &amp; Spreads with syrups, sauces, salsas Jams, Aioli, Ketchup, etc<br />Breakfast Bars, Coffee Cakes &amp; Sweet Somethings: Home for lots of nuts, berries, and seeds<br />Menus, or how to really do a healthy pig out on Sunday morning<br />The book is laid out with lots of sidebars on tips and techniques which make it very easy to read and to find what you are looking for. Each chapter title page gives a complete table of recipes in the chapter. Almost (but not quite) as good as a complete list of recipes in the front of the book. Be sure to check the index when you are looking for a specific recipe. French toast, for example, appears in Griddle Foods and not Eggs or Breads and Potato Pancakes appears in griddle foods and not under potatoes.<br />The author wins me over completely when she quotes the line on omelets by Elizabeth David that says that the perfect omelet recipe is the way you make it. Another good quote describes an omelet as nothing more than eggs, butter, and body English. Of course, she goes on to give detailed instructions on how to make a good omelet and says it is not easy. Moral of the story, read and emulate her directions, but don't get too hung up on the result not looking like something done on the Food Network.Just keep practicing until you are happy with the result.<br />Not nearly enough has been written about the economics of home cooking versus prepared foods. Ms. Katzen's recipe for granola is probably an excellent place to start. A quick look at the health food aisles of my local megamart shows designer brand containers with less than a pound of food for prices that would make a beef fillet blush. Granola is a product that is almost completely foolproof to make from ingredients that individually are very, very cheap. And, I checked out those same health food aisles in the megamart and I found every single ingredient in bulk.<br />To repeat, Ms. Katzen's book is probably one of the very best places to start in improving what you eat. It is a very nice bonus that the list price of the book is significantly lower than the average cookbook and the artwork done by the author is truly delightful.<br />Very highly recommended. Easy for people with little cooking knowledge.ou are happy with the result.<br />Not nearly enough has been written about the economics of home cooking versus prepared foods.

719323:US	39134375	R10D14UUO5OKS2	0060931647	860931841	A Passion for My Provence: Home Cooking from the South of France	Books	5	17	17	N	N	Another Excellent Culinary Evocation of Provence	On the shelves of most libraries and bookstores today, Italian themed cookbooks outnumber French themed cookbooks by about three (3) to one (1), as they do on my bookshelf. Of these Italian cookbooks, over half deal explicitly with a regional Italian cuisine, with Tuscany, Rome, and Emilia-Romagna leading the pack. Yet, the most common culinary region as book subject is Provence, in Southern France along the Rhone river. To many minds this is foodie central for the Mediterranean cuisine, being a location with a uniquely strong junction of olive, grape, and vegetable culture with the seafood of the Mediterranean. Not only are many books written specifically about Provence, but it is the spiritual center of inspiration for practically every major culinary writer in English, most prominently Julia Child, Richard Olney and James Beard, all of whom either maintained homes in Provence or visited the area on a regular basis.<br />Not only does Provence lead in pure numbers, I think it also leads in the quality of the writing and in the diversity of the cuisine. As evidence, I submit a book I reviewed earlier, `Patricia Wells At Home in Provence' and my current subject `A Passion for My Provence' by Lydie Marshall. The two books have very similar chapter headings and both deal with tarts, daubes, vegetable stews, and fish stews aplenty. Aioli and tapenade flows over their pages like water. Still, it was very surprising to me to find virtually no duplication in recipes in the two books. This is doubly surprising because when I reviewed two books on Roman cuisine, I easily found five different entree (not condiment) recipes occurring in the two books with identical Italian names and similar recipes.<br />Both authors conduct cooking classes in their homes in Provence. Ms. Marshall lives in an old chateau in Nyons, a small town on a small tributary of the Rhone in central Provence. Ms. Marshall is a native of France. Ms. Wells, a native American, spends most of her time in Paris, but she summers in northern Provence, where she and her husband have had a farmhouse for over twenty years.<br />All of this makes choosing between these two books very difficult, especially since I believe the sizes of each book is almost perfectly proportional to the list prices and the presence of color photos in the more expensive (Wells) but not in the less expensive. The absence of common recipes in these books can probably be explained by the fact that both books specifically advertise themselves as collections of home recipes. As the two homes are separated by quite a distance in a very provincial land, it is no surprise that the two writers have little but a general style of cooking in common.<br />Certain ingredients share the starring roles in both books. It would not be Provencal cooking without eggplant, onions, asparagus, tomatoes, cepes (porcini), monkfish, and chicken. Ms. Marshall has a great section on fowl of various types, but all recipes can be made with chicken if pheasant or guinea hen is not available. Ms. Marshall also surprises us by covering ingredients such as pumpkin that Ms. Wells does not even mention. Ms. Marshall also devotes a considerable amount of space to pissaladiere, `the Provencal version of pizza' which has its origins in Nice. The classic topping for pissaladiere is an anchovy and onion marmalade. The crust is quite thick, more like a Sicilian than a Neapolitan thin crust pizza. Ms. Marshall in fact makes her pissaladiere with potato dough. She devotes over twenty pages to pissaladiere and other recipes one can base on this dough. In contrast, Ms. Wells has recipes for pizza and fougasse (French foccacia), but nothing on pissaladiere.<br />On average, I find Ms. Marshall's instructions less detailed than Ms. Wells, but I find no resulting deficiency in the quality of her dishes. Ms. Wells, being a professional journalist who hobnobs with the likes of Joel Robuchon will certainly have more to say about ingredients and technique. But, Ms. Marshall even has her own Robuchon story in describing the great chef's solution to doing a salt baked fish where the salt coat comes off without excessive salt in the fish itself. Ms. Wells includes wines to match each dish and Ms. Marshall does not.<br />As both books are in paperback with a total list price below $40, I would buy both, especially if you are fond of French cooking. If your budget is tight, get the work by Ms. Marshall and wait for Ms. Wells soon to be published new book on Provencal cooking.<br />Highly recommended, especially for those on a budget.hnique.

The book endures by providing a super coverage of a neglected culinary subject. While there are dozens of books with chapters on breakfast dishes, there are only a small handful of books devoted exclusively to breakfast written in the last 20 years. This book, neatly typeset, edited, and designed by the Alfred A. Knopf crew, should grace your shelf for a long time, even if your space is limited.<br />This book among my favorite types of cookbooks to own, as it gives you easy access to a great number of recipes on a single subject. This is even better than books on fish or red meat or potatoes or chicken, as it covers a wide range of recipes for all flavors available to a single meal. And, Ms. Cunningham does touch all the bases. Her chapter titles are:<br />Yeast breads such as American White Bread.<br />Toasts, French Toast, and Breakfast Sandwiches.<br />Quick Breads such as biscuits, cornbread, scones, muffins, and fruit breads.<br />Cereals, hot such as oatmeal and corn, such as granola<br />Doughnuts and Fritters<br />Griddling, as in pancakes and waffles<br />Eggs, as in boiled, omelets, frittatas, souffles, baked, scrambled, poached, fried, and so on<br />Fruit Fixing, as in applesauce, poached apples, stuffed pears, fresh juices, rhubarb, pineapple, mango, etc.<br />Potatoes, as in oven fries, hash browns, potato pancakes, potato bacon pie, and potato custard<br />Meat and Fish as in steak, chipped beef, corned beef hash, bacon, ham, fresh fish, fish hash, and salt cod<br />Custards and Puddings, an extension of eggs or cereals, depending on how you look at them<br />Cookies, Pies, and Cakes as in yum, yum, cookies for breakfast<br />Condiments, as in jellies, jams, caramel, syrups, and salsas<br />Breakfast Beverages as in tea, coffee, hot chocolate ya da ya da ya da<br />Breakfast Menus<br />Some reviewers have stated that her recipes are easy. While this may be true of most topics above, it is not true of yeast breads. Even the simplest recipes, and Cunningham's are relatively simple, require a modest amount of skill and a fair amount of time, so I must say that Cunningham is more concerned with good recipes and completeness than she is with speed.<br />While Miss Marion covers all the bases, some are covered a lot better than others. The yeast bread chapter has only a few samples and an exceptionally picky person may feel that the book suffers by not having a brioche recipe, as this is a perfect ingredient for French Toast. I will only point this out and generally suggest that if you are serious about making bread, check out either `Baking with Julia' as an excellent general introduction to baking or Rose Levy Beranbaum's `The Bread Bible' for the straight skinny on everything bread. For the very best Southern biscuits, check out Nick Malgieri's `How to Bake'.<br />The coverage of eggs and toast and condiments and cakes and custards and puddings and pancakes is terrific. This represents the strongest reason to own a copy of this book, if you are especially fond of leisurely weekend breakfasts or brunches. There are dozens of recipes for things I knew people did actually eat for breakfast, but never came close to having them myself or even seeing them on restaurant menus.<br />As with the bread and biscuit recipes, do not believe Ms. Cunningham has absolutely covered all bases in chapters such as Meats and Beverages. She does not always cover the most common recipe for a dish. A perfect example is her creamed chipped beef recipe that includes mushrooms. A classic recipe would not include mushrooms and would include Worcestershire sauce and a little cayenne.<br />This aside, this book packs an enormous punch with 288 recipes for a list price of $20 and an Amazon discounted price of $14.<br />Very highly recommended, especially fora modest budget and a big appetite for big breakfasts.ppetite for big breakfasts.	2004-04-04
720507:US	39134375	R34LBEEPCL7086	0375710310	802913418	The Healthy Kitchen	Books	4	30	31	N	N	Good Mix of Healthy Culinary Advice.	`The Healthy Kitchen' by holistic medicine expert Andrew Weil, M.D. and professional chef Rosie Daley promises to be the very best union between expertise on food and health. It is not limited to simple weight reduction or to curing any other specific medical problem. It is true to the holistic doctrine of treating the whole person.<br />The book generally takes the form of a dialogue between the two authors. The contributions of the two different voices / areas of expertise are clearly delineated by printing them with a header indicating the speaker and differently colored pages to signify which voice is speaking.<br />Regarding the good doctor's contribution, I believe it is all sound, reflecting a synthesis of the most recent conventional wisdom on health and food. The value of this material will depend much on how much you have read in this area before reading this book. If you have read any of Weil's earlier books, especially the title `Eating Well for Optimum Health', you will have already read almost all of Weil's material reproduced on the his green pages in this book.  Much of this information has also appeared in other recent books on nutrition; however, I believe there are several tips in the book on kitchen practices which are unlikely to appear in a book general nutrition. One example is Weil's comments on cooking oils, especially the recommendation to never heat oils to the smoking point and to never breath the smoke of heated oil, as it is highly toxic. This is why he recommends grapeseed oil, as it has a very high smoke point.<br />I am especially happy with Weil's bringing out the distinction between simple and complex carbohydrates and that in spite of the current low carb diet fads, one should not avoid all carbohydrates. Even more important is his discussion of the glycemic index of foods, which is a measure of how fast a food is converted from the gut into glucose in the blood. High glycemic index foods such as most sugars and starches have the undesirable effect of quickly raising blood sugar, triggering the production of insulin. This also has the effect of making you feel hungry again, soon after eating. Low GI foods remain in the stomach longer and maintain satiation longer.<br />The culinary half of the partnership is shared by the two authors, with Ms. Daley providing the recipes and Dr. Weil providing `color commentary' and comments on the health benefits and risks of various cooking techniques. All recipes include a nutritional analysis, giving the weight in grams of calories, fat, saturated fat, protein, carbohydrate, cholesterol, and fiber per serving. The serving size is not indicated directly. Rather, the recipe gives the number of servings in the dish. Given the totally acceptable variability in the practices of home cooks and the variability of nutritional content of ingredients, I would use these figures only as a means of comparing one recipe to another. As usual, portion sizes seem to me to be rather small.<br />The recipes are divided into very familiar headings, giving us chapters on: Breakfast, Beverages, Appetizers, Salads, Soups, Entrees, Accompaniments, and desserts Desserts. The last chapter gives a week's worth of menus with a composite nutritional analysis for the entire day's menu.<br />The selection of dishes fits your expectations for a healthy eating book. There are no beef or veal dishes and the authors flatly state that they are excluded to avoid saturated fat and environmental toxins. On the positive side, there are several pasta dishes. Dr. Weil offers the very wise suggestion that he typically looks to Oriental cuisines for his pasta recipes instead of to Italy, as Oriental dishes have less fatty sauces. There are many fish, shellfish, chicken, and tofu dishes, plus an emphasis on grilling and roasting techniques.<br />Overall, the book borders on but does not enter the world of dietary extremism parodied by a menu of tofu, bean sprouts, and wheat germ. It celebrates things like garlic that many people enjoy and which are also good for you. It devalues carob as a pale imitation of chocolate and endorses chocolate in moderation, especially as an accompaniment to fruit.<br />If you have a limited budget for cookbooks and are concerned about food and health, this is a very, very good book. The list price is lower than almost any other recent hardcover cookbook you are likely to find and the recipes are very good. They are not simple. This is not quick cooking a la Rachael Ray. My only concern with the book's nutritional advice is that it may be just a bit dated. It touts the benefits of garlic; however, I think the nutritional value of garlic has been devalued recently. It is still tasty and quite safe.<br />My main concern with the culinary material in the book is that it does not adequately provide a good substitute for white bread. While bread appears in one chapter title, it does not appear in the index and the closest I can find to a bread recipe is a recipe for blueberry pancakes. This may be too much to ask from a $27 book, but it would have made the book a lot better.<br />Highly recommended, especially if you own no other books on nutrition by Dr. Weil. Requires some preexisting culinary skill. Not fast cooking.gs like garlic that many people enjoy and which are also good for you.

Both currently available books, `Serious Pig' and `Pot on the Fire', by John Thorne and wife Matt Lewis Thorne, are composed of essays cut from the same culinary journalistic cloth, the authors' food letter `Simple Cooking'. These essays as bodies of work do not quite fit any established form of culinary writing. It is certainly not `The Best Recipe' genre followed by the magazine `Cooks Illustrated' and some writers, although there is some element of this point of view. It is not culinary history, since it is so distinctly done from the authors' point of view. There are some essays that taste like memoir or nostalgia, but these serve more as chapters used to set the scene for text dealing with the food. It is certainly not food science a la Shirley Corriher or Alton Brown, although Alton Brown does credit Thorne as one of his biggest influences. In a nutshell, the Thornes simply provide interesting writing about food.<br />I love intellectual connections, so I was delighted to discover that one of the wellsprings from which John Thorne draws his inspiration is the writing of Richard Olney. This ties up a string of influence from Elizabeth David to Olney to Thorne to Alton Brown, one of the most influential popular voices in culinary journalism. Olney is one of the most intellectual writers on culinary matters writing in English and available in the United States. And, it is clear not only in Thorne's `Simple Food' motto but also in his intellectual point of view that he owes much to Olney.<br />The first thing which changed my reading Thorne from simple pleasure to respect was his essay on the Italian Panzanella salad, which he describes in great detail and with great attention to what Italians really mean when they make this salad, a combination of tomato, stale bread, red onion, mozzarella, cucumber, basil, and salt and pepper. The subtle intellectual honesty that caught my attention was when Thorne created an adaptation using fresh bread and remained true to the original nomenclature by calling his invention Panzanetta salad. Contrast this to Alton Brown's borrowing the same Panzanella term and applying it to a twist on the BLT sandwich by adding bacon and forgetting the onion and garlic. Not Panzanella at all, I think. Not much to most people, but to a person schooled in the principle that language was something to be respected, I was impressed.<br />The second thing that caught my attention was the tale of how Thorne fell into the vocation of cooking and culinary journalism. Like so many things, and like myself, it was by accident and necessity. In Thorne's case, it was because he was a dropout with little money who needed to feed himself with as few dollars as possible. If this was the prime mover in his career path, a strong influence seems to be his Maine roots. More than one essay has the feel of Maine's Stephen King writing about food. Popular subjects are his old residences, Maine crops such as potatoes and blueberries, and Maine cuisine featuring the lobster and other seafood, and Maine restaurants. One of my favorite series of essays deals with the origin of chowder. I will never again respect a chowder recipe that does not include some potato or biscuit as a thickening agent. Maine does not monopolize the story.  A long series of essays covers Cajun and Creole culinary topics from New Orleans. This is where he proposes the theory that a great cuisine such as the Cajun or Italian cuisine is based on emulating a memory of greatness. I think there is a germ of truth here, but I believe Paula Wolfert offers a much fuller picture in her Morocco book.<br />The third and most enduring attraction of Thorne's writing is that it is simply entertaining stuff. A writer could provide the recipes on these pages with no explanation or commentary and they would be good recipes, but the writing would be like the food with the salt and pepper left out. Similarly, the history / memoir / commentary would not be nearly as interesting without the instructions for preparing the dishes on which the essays expound. The very best example of a perfect mix of culinary technique with storytelling is the essay on `Perfect Rice'. It all starts with John Thorne's claiming that he makes a pretty good pot of rice, followed by a derisive response from Madame Thorne, who had studied the issue at some length before Sir John touched on the subject early in their joint lives. Thorne proceeds to relate the story of their mutual investigations into making perfect rice. In the process, we learn much about the world's rice varieties and why rices behave like it does. After seeing how much care one can devote to such a simple subject, I mentally demote people like Sara Moulton for posing as a teacher of culinary matters when they confesses to not being able to properly cook a pot of rice.<br />Both volumes are available in midpriced trade paperback editions with no pictures. It is a sure test of the fact that pictures are not necessary in works on cooking in that I never miss them. A really important addition to books of this type is a list of recipes in addition to the index and table of contents. Both volumes have this important tool.

723560:US	39134375	R2RDX8VSEBQ5KB	0618329749	990536001	Getting Thin and Loving Food: 200 Easy Recipes to Take You Where You Want to Be	Books	5	97	106	N	Y	More Pep Talks and Good Recipes from Chef Kathleen	Kathleen Daeleman's new, second book deals with exactly the same issue, with exactly the same solution, as her first book, `Cooking Thin with Chef Kathleen'. The message in a nutshell is that you can loose weight and you can keep it off and still eat delicious food. The solution in a nutshell is that you take small positive steps each day guided by an instinctual knowledge of what is good for you and what is not, aided by a systematic study of packaged foods' nutritional labels.<br />So why buy another book with the same message? The first consideration is that the book's list price is well below that of most other celebrity chefs, including most of her Food Network colleagues. From Ina Garten, you will typically get 30% fewer recipes for a 25% higher price, and no feel good healthy eating pep talks. That leads to a second reason. While Ms. Daelemans' 52 pages of introductory material may repeat a lot of her message from her first book, it still has punch, much like a heart to heart pep talk from an wise older sister. This is basically old wine in a new bottle, but still good wine.<br />On Kathleen's principles for loosing weight, I can argue with only one. This is the reliance on that little inner voice of conscience that tells you that a certain indulgence, such as the remainder of a rich German chocolate cake she takes home after her birthday, is simply not good for you. As a one-time professional philosopher trained in the nature of knowledge, I can tell you this intuition is a myth. This knowledge is built up from a lifetime of reading, listening, and connecting things in your own mind. This means that there are a lot of food land mines out there of which you simply are not aware. My favorite is the Jewish soul food dish of oversized bagel, cream cheese, and lox. At one time, I could easily down two of these dietary blockbusters at a sitting without realizing I was eating enough calories for two days at my level of (in)activity. Another surprise is the nutritional danger of eating excess carbohydrates from highly processed foods such as white flour. I applaud Ms. Kathleen's grouping the low carb plans with other fad diets with their danger of failure through boredom. But, I contend that `that little internal voice of intuition' is not robust enough to support the path to a healthy lifestyle. This does not kill Daelemans argument. It only means that while you are following Ms. Kathleen's culinary techniques, read books such as `Superfoods Rx' by Dr. Steven Pratt and `Nourishing Traditions' from Sally Fallon and `Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy' from Dr. Walter Willett. These books will feed your little voice of conscience with information while Chef Kathleen feeds your tummy.<br />Following the introductory pep talk on building your motivation, Ms. K has a chapter on pantry and kitchen equipment. All pantry lists have the same problem. They talk you into buying things with a limited shelf life and you have no immediate recipe in which to use the ingredients, so something ultimately goes bad. Even such robust looking foods such as fish sauce and rice wine can loose their punch. Buy only what you will use THIS WEEK. Stock up on only stuff you yourself actually use routinely in recipes. Note to the publisher's proofreaders: The pantry list is missing a heading somewhere between Soy sauce and baking powder. Tsk, Tsk.<br />Ms. K's list of kitchen equipment is much better. I think even Alton Brown would admire its sparseness, yet full attention to essentials. I use everything she mentions. I would only go with AB's suggestion to stick with inexpensive nonstick pans with ovenproof handles. These would be midrange priced, not high end priced.<br />The recipe chapters in Ms. K's first book were very familiar. Kathleen has gone in an entirely different direction in this book. Chapter titles are based on a mish-mash of different ideas.<br />The first chapter is for fast dishes when you have little time and the urge to hit the takeout window is strong. Embedded in this chapter of fast at-home meals, a la Rachael Ray are a number of very clever tactics for making dishes more healthy by combining prepared foods with fresh vegetables. I like these ideas a lot.<br />The next chapter is for foodies who what to spend Sunday afternoon cooking, but need to avoid all those calories in classic French, Italian, and Chinese dishes.<br />The third chapter is for `Barely-Any-Meat' meals. This section is filled mostly with soups such as Rice and Tomato, Potato, Potato and Green Bean, Broccoli-Parsnip, Corn Chowder, Corn and Tomato, etc. You get the picture. All seem to be first rate recipes with the role of fat being filled by that perennial lipochampion, olive oil.<br />The fourth chapter is Ms. K's answer to Mezes and tapas. This is the world of flatbread, dips, salads, and eggplant.<br />The last four chapters have more conventional titles covering breakfasts, Side dishes, condiments, and desserts (Fruit and Chocolate).<br />The recipes in the first book were centered in the western Mediterranean. This book wanders further afield, including a lot of eastern Mediterranean, Mexican, and Oriental dishes. For this variety alone, I endorse this book. The dessert chapter is especially inventive, giving some very creative combinations such as Plum and Rhubarb and Rhubarb and Apple. Warms my Pennsylvania Dutch heart to its core.<br />The low list price, the perky advice (and picture) of Ms K., the creative food tinkering advice, and the broadened range of recipe sources makes this book a worthy tool in taking it off and keeping it off.<br />Highly recommended for all sorts of lipidly challanged couch potatoes.ow is strong.

Excellent	This book by Paul Bocuse, arguably the most distinguished French chef alive today, translated from the French into English, is akin to Stephen Hawking's writing a popular work on the history of physics. Unlike similarly formatted works by Joel Robuchon, this book aims at presenting relatively straightforward instructions for preparing classic French regional cuisine. What is missing are the details of proper selection and handling of seasonal ingredients. This is replaced by a very high level tour of the major culinary regions of France.<br />I am surprised that such a distinguished culinary figure would do this kind of book, but I am supremely delighted that he did. The book includes literally every traditional French dish I can think of, with recipes that are quite easy to follow by the average American amateur cook. The book includes recipes for pot-a-feu, cassolet, crepes, coq au vin, salade Nicoise, Vichyssoise, onion soup, stuffed cabbage, Provencal fish stew, Burgundy Beef, tapenade and aioli. The list of recognized classics goes on and on. There is even a gratin recipe for macaroni and cheese and a confession that it was the Romans and not the Lyonnaise who invented macaroni.<br />I confess that some ingredients, such as the Lyonnaise sausage with pistachio may be a little hard to find, but the author graciously provides several serviceable substitutes for each ingredient not commonly available in American markets. Kielbasa, for example is an acceptable substitute for the saucisson pistache.<br />I am simply delighted with the simplicity and clarity of the instructions. The potato and sausage salad dish is French to its core yet the author succeeds in making the recipe read like something out of a Martha Stewart book. The instructions are clear, unpreachy, and workable. Aside from the sausage, there are no unusual ingredients and no unusual equipment needed. No trace, for example, of a food mill, china cap, or bain marie. The same can be said of almost all recipes in this book.<br />This is not to say there are no interesting recipes in the book. While there are so many classic dishes here, many have a special twist which is not due to the invention of the very talented author, but rather due to the author's using a recipe which is closer to the original roots of the dish rather than the dish's most famous incarnations. The recipe for onion soup, for example, is quite unlike the dish I had at Les Halles in Paris at 5 AM. Bocuse's recipe is from the Lyon area where, as he says, they put onions in virtually everything.<br />There are only two minor complaints about the book. First, this is a book about foods from specific geographic regions, yet there is no map to assist one in visualizing where in France these regions occur. While many foodies may be familiar with the location of Provence, is probably the rare American who knows that the Alsace is in the East, bordering on Germany. This explains similarities between food in the Alsace chapter and common German dishes such as sauerkraut. Second, as the author states himself, there was much Procrustean lumping together of different geographical regions to form a single culinary identity. The author blames this on his editors. I am willing to believe this, and register my complaint to the editors that I am really surprised that they could come up with only six culinary regions (Lyonnais, Provence, Bordelais, Perigord, Brittany-Normandy, and Alsace).<br />These two complaints aside, this is hands down the very best introduction to French cuisine I have seen for the casual reader. Be sure to read Julia Child and Elizabeth David and Patricia Wells, but read this book first. It will clearly whet your appetite for those other classic authors.<br />Very highly recommended.ecipes in this book.<br />This is not to say there are no interesting recipes in the book.

726167:US	39134375	R2PGR94BS7YVCP	061822632X	345054992	Cooking Thin with Chef Kathleen: 200 Easy Recipes for Healthy Weight Loss	Books	4	21	23	N	Y	Effective, Easy to Read Strategy and Tactics for Weight Loss	This book's title is based on the author's Food Network television show, where Ms. Daelemans concentrates teaching basic lifestyle changes rather than major diet changes for quick weight loss. As such, the premise of this book is immediately more attractive than just about any past, present, or future fad diet you care to name. In that theme, the book is also much more than just a cookbook. It begins with over 75 pages of easy to follow, common sense advice, presented in a breezy, easy to digest style. It is no great surprise that the very first suggestion is that fad diets don't work.<br />As you see from Ms. Daelemans' TV show, she is in a good position to know this, as she had a long struggle with overeating herself until a career turn forced her to find `the true path' to healthy eating. It may a little presumptions, but I suspect her message may boil down to `eat all different kinds of foods, but in a carefully considered moderation'. This is not to say that simply eating in moderation is easy. I found that out in a big way when I discovered that a typically oversized New York bagel, cream cheese, and lox had half again as many calories as I should eat in a normal day. Thus, you cannot eat in moderation unless you know the facts about what you are eating. That's why another early rule is to pay close attention to the nutrition labels of items at the grocery store. You may find some surprises like when I discovered that turkey hot dogs had higher sodium and cholesterol levels than their deli style beef and pork franks in the neighboring bin. An amendment to the rule of moderation is to eliminate junk calories.<br />In her introductory chapters on good eating strategy, I'm sure Ms. Daelemans doesn't cover absolutely everything you need to know about healthy eating. For example, she does not really deal much with nutrition in general or with exercise and nutrition. But, I am also sure that nothing she says will lead you in an unhealthy direction and you will have a very good chance of loosing weight over the long run, without feeling especially hungry or deprived of tasty food. Now to the recipes.<br />The recipes are divided into very conventional, easy to access chapters entitled:<br />Breakfast<br />Soups<br />Sandwiches, Pizzas, and Frittatas<br />Side Salads and Savory Slaws<br />Vegetable Sides<br />Pasta, Polenta, Beans, and Rice<br />Sauces, Condiments, and Other Really Cool Things you Ought to Make<br />Light Meals, Vegetarian Entrees, and Entr&eacute;e Salads<br />Fish<br />Meat<br />Desserts<br />As Ms. Daelemans apprenticed with Judy Rodgers of the famous Zuni Caf&eacute; in San Francisco, she certainly knows what she is doing when it comes to putting together a tasty dish. Most of the dishes are slimmed down variations of classics, without the conceit of using the classic names when the changes in the recipe really mean you are looking at a new recipe. A good example is her `BLT Salad' which a less honest person may be tempted to label a Panzanella salad.<br />A quick look at the `Light Meals' chapter tells us that Miss Daelemans really likes her potatoes and other winter vegetables. This at least should offer some comfort to those who may be afraid of being deprived of tasty food. The variety in this section covers a wide range of classics, with a heavy influence of preparations from Italy and Provence in France.<br />As a true disciple of Judy Rodgers, Kathleen opens her soup chapter with two different recipes for chicken stock, without all the fussiness from Ms. Rodgers, which is proper to a first class commercial kitchen, but not necessary in the average home kitchen. I am especially fond of Kathleen's instructions for making a vegetable stock. It is a greatly improved version of the hundreds of suggestions you see for saving your vegetable scraps for stock. In general, the Soups chapter also has a strong western Mediterranean flavor to it, as it is heavy on the beans, tomatoes, and cabbage. The chapter on homemade pizzas is almost worth the price of admission. The Salads chapter continues the love affair with the potato and the tomato. I confess I sometimes wonder if there is a touch of evil in cookbook authors' minds when they load their books with recipes using fresh tomatoes, when this product is available with acceptable quality for two or three months out of the year.<br />There are occasional tips on shortcut cooking. I read them, but do not dote on them. I use them when they make sense to me, but they are not a compelling reason to buy the book. I think the `Guyometer' ratings are a complete waste of space. I have yet to find any that are usefully negative.'<br />This is a healthy eating book that is fun to read, which provides tasty dishes to eat, and which has a fighting chance of helping you loose weight. I would recommend this over most others and I wish the Food Network would find a way to commission more shows from Miss Kathleen. Those same old 16 shows are wearing a little thin.<br />Highly recommended. Miss Kathleen is not preaching to you. She is in the fight with you.the price of admission.

727929:US	39134375	RQMUE9JW4O43I	1841881341	674332979	La Cuisine De Joel Robuchon: A Seasonal Cookbook	Books	5	10	11	N	Y	Insight, Fine Recipes, and Gorgeous Presentation. Great Buy	This book of 52 articles on food products, both natural and man-made, is a perfect model of what can be done with culinary subjects in books with a lot of commitment to quality of both the intellectual material and the production values in its presentation.<br />Be perfectly clear that this book, as available from Amazon by the item within this review appears is most definitely in English, with a lot of care taken so that units are also translated into those familiar to American and UK readers. There is even a little list of synonyms for translating European terms such as aubergines into the more American friendly term, eggplant. I was so interested in seeing this book that I was willing to put my college French to the test and read it in French. That exercise is unnecessary.<br />The best thing that can be said about the book is that it lives up to Joel Robuchon's rather considerable reputation. He is probably even better known to Americans than his eminent countryman Paul Bocuse through his occasional appearances on the Food Network show `Iron Chef'.<br />The 52 articles in the book are divided into thirteen (13) articles per season. Of the 52 articles, 48 deal with raw foods such as Asparagus, Lamb, Lobster, and Grapes. Two (2) deal with refined products, salt and olive oil. Two deal with primal `compound' products, leavened bread and pastry crust. As the book was based on a collection of journalized articles first printed in a French periodical, it is entirely understandable that the selection of products is based entirely on products raised or gathered in and around France. The varieties of fruits and vegetables and the sources of meats are also all French. This is not parochialism; it is simply that the material was originally written for a French audience.<br />The first thread running through all the articles is the emphasis on what constitutes the very best samples of each product, how to judge the best products, how to pass on lesser samples, and how to do the very best preparations of these products. The chapter on haricot beans is a perfect example of how best to treat this very, very French product. As Robuchon states in this article, these are little things, but that is what excellence in cooking is all about, an attention to a lot of little details.<br />Let me not give the impression that the book is a collection of dry details on cooking techniques. Whether through Robuchon's skill with words himself or through the efforts of an excellent (albeit uncredited) translator, the text is a very easy read, quite capable of holding ones attention, as long as one has the least amount of interest in the subject at the outset.<br />I must also say that I have rarely seen any book so well served by its color illustrations as this. The first comparable work that comes to mind is the Larousse Gastronomique. The French (Europeans?) really know their stuff when it comes to creating an evocative mix of photographs, color plates, and black and white engravings to pair the best possible picture with the text and achieve a mix of media which entertains the eye as much as the text engages the mind.<br />Each of the 52 articles is accompanied by a recipe featuring the subject of the article. Some recipes such as the one for leavened bread is quite involved, it being a method for creating the leavening from natural yeasts rather than using brewers yeast. Other articles, especially those for vegetables, are very simple such as with the simple glazed carrots. Yet, even these most simple of recipes include techniques which expand one's appreciation of matching techniques to the product.<br />When the legions of culinary workers and writers babble as if by rote about the best and freshest ingredients in season, this is what they are really talking about, if they would just apply the level of care Monsieur Robuchon has put to his subject.<br />Very highly recommended for the library of anyone interested in food.the very best preparations of these products.

729300:US	39134375	R2UHGEZ7Y9NAL5	0060569891	904172217	The Doughmakers Cookbook: 125 Recipes for Success in Baking and Business	Books	4	17	18	N	Y	Story of Two Sisters, their Business, and some Recipes	This book of baking recipes may not match your expectations, as it's true contents surprised me a bit, having bought it on line, primarily on the strength of its title. It's authors, Bette Laplante and Diane Cuvelier, are not professional bakers and they are not specialists in making dough. As serendipity would have it, the book is still a valuable and enlightening read, just not for the expected reasons.<br />The authors are sisters who, with the help of Laplante's husband, the owner of a small Terra Haute, Indiana metal supply company, start from scratch a company whose business is fabricating and selling solid aluminum bakeware. The name of the company is, of course, `Doughmakers'. Hence, the recipes in the book comprise a greatly extended brochure that the gals may have given away with their bakeware. The source of some recipes is given as family members, friends, and `Doughheads', groupie fans of their bakeware. But, the heart of the book is not in the recipes, it is in the 74 pages of introductory chapters which tell the story of how these two gals started the company, what they had to do to make it succeed, and the joy their family has experienced with their success, in spite of some close calls with poor health in one of the two founding partners.<br />This book should really be read by anyone who has the least inkling that they would like to start up a company involving manufacturing and sales. The first hand experiences of what the sisters, their family members / colleagues, and sons and daughters went through to reach a reasonable level of success is a real eye opener. This is really hard work. This would have been a tragedy of the first order if they did not succeed, but they did.<br />As most businesses like this, the sisters Cuvelier begin in the garage and spare bedroom of Bette's house, with simple equipment and aluminum a blank from Bette's husband's metals business. There is no surprise there. The big surprise is that the company did all their marketing through booths at craft shows, county and state fairs, and professional shows. The first `secret' should become obvious to anyone who has wandered around the aisles of craft shows where over half of the booth's clerks create a little nest at the back of the booth and either work on their crafts, eat, or watch a portable TV. These girls had a rule that no one ever sits in their booths. They very quickly acquired the ability to run off a short paragraph of material to an interested passerby in a single breath, within a few seconds, in order to catch their attention. And this was, as they say in military parlance, the tip of the spear. Behind this customer contact is hours of manufacturing, traveling, booth setup, and booth restocking. The most striking aspect of this story is that this craft / fair method of marketing can be so successful and, relatively speaking, so much easier than making a start by getting your product into local chain stores, let alone Sears and Walmart.<br />Not having ever seen their product, I have to believe that their bakeware is of a higher than average quality. I can easily see how they are superior to untreated steel, but I have a little difficulty with the value of their dimpled surface that they claim prevents sticking. But, the book is about the authors and their recipes and not really about their product.<br />According to the dust jacket, there are only 125 recipes in the book. This may be a bit thin for a 270-page book; however, the first quarter of the book is taken up by the story of the sisters' company. The remaining 190 some pages are filled by eight (8) chapters of recipes, being:<br />Bar Cookies such as brownies, fudge, and pecan tassies<br />Breads and Rolls such as white bread, foccacia, and strawberry shortcake<br />Breakfast Breads such as fruit flavored breads, scones, and cinnamon rolls<br />Cakes such as devils food cake, pound cake, zucchini cake, carrot pineapple cake and gingerbread cake<br />Cookies such as oatmeal raisin cookies, Biscotti, cheese straws, and peanut butter oatmeal chocolate chip<br />Muffins such as blueberry, sweet potato, cornbread, apple butter, and porter peach<br />Pastry and Pies with `perfect piecrust', pumpkin pie, chocolate pecan pie, coconut cream pie, and so on<br />Pizza with long rise pizza dough, quick rise pizza dough, flatbreads, and pizzettes<br />Most of the recipes are pretty conventional. The Southern Buttermilk Biscuits recipe, for example, uses all vegetable shortening rather than all butter or shortening and butter mixed. I've tried both alternatives, and I am sure butter will give a better result than shortening or butter and shortening. The carrot cake does not use freshly grated carrots, it uses jars of carrot baby food. I'm afraid I will stick with my fresh carrots and my Nick Malgieri recipe. The cookies also use shortening and margarine instead of butter. Again, I will stick with my butter and my belief that I prefer the dangers of butter I know about to the dangers of margarine I do not know about. Besides, butter tastes better.<br />This book will not replace my dozen or so books written by professional bakers and professional baking teachers, but I am really glad I didn't miss the authors' story of their company and what they had to do to get it to succeed. I will consult this book for unusual recipes such as the pecan tassies, but it will not be my first stop in a search for a recipe.<br />This book has a very good story and some interesting, but average recipes.aisin cookies, Biscotti, cheese straws, and peanut butter oatmeal chocolate chip<BR>Muffins such as blueberry, sweet potato, cornbread, apple butter, and porter peach<BR>Pastry and Pies with `perfect piecrust', pumpkin pie, chocolate pecan pie, coconut cream pie, and so on<BR>Pizza with long rise pizza dough, quick rise pizza dough, flatbreads, and pizzettes<br />Most of the recipes are pretty conventional.

A rare Arab oriented book	This second book by nutritionist Sanaa Abourezk deals with the two very timely topics of good nutrition and Eastern Mediterranean, specifically Syrian, cuisine. The subject in itself was interesting, but the interest in doing a review of the book was piqued by the uniformly poor reviews the book has been given up to now on Amazon.<br />A common theme in the reviews is that the nutritional information is good, the Syrian material is welcome, but the culinary information is poor. Of these three issues, I cannot judge the authenticity of the Syrian ethnic material, but I do have a somewhat different opinion on the other two issues.<br />In the introduction on nutrition, the author comes very close to quoting from influential works on `the new nutrition' such as `Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy' by Harvard's Walter C. Willett. On that point, her statements are probably quite safe and as close to good contemporary thinking as she can be. I am inclined to believe the author is a little too close to orthodoxy than she needs to be. On the issue of cholesterol, for example, I have it on good medical authority that high cholesterol levels are largely a result of a genetic heritage. Your body is producing too much or it is not eliminating bad cholesterol efficiently, and no amount of diet will change that fact. Cholesterol you may take in with animal fats is probably much less dangerous than the internal imbalance. On the other side of the coin, there is a lot of important nutrition to be gained from at least some reasonable measure of animal fat and protein. So, eliminating animal fat from one's diet may have some risk associated with it. It will also make one's food much less palatable.<br />Abourezk's presentation of her rather narrow interpretation of nutritional doctrine is also weak. How can her readers reasonably understand the difference between two pyramids, if you don't show pictures of these two pyramids. Her octopus metaphor for explaining saturated and unsaturated fats is also a bit weak. She should take a few lessons on effective explaining from Alton Brown. I am also a little suspicious of her chronology of the two food pyramids. I know the USDA picture came out in the early 1990's, but I was under the impression that the `new and improved' Harvard pyramid came out later. Dr. Willett's book with its `All-New Food Pyramid' was published in 2001, not 1984.<br />On the bright side, I thought Abourezk's suggestions on reducing the amount of animal fat in one's cooking were informative, as I was seeing some of them, such as parboiling vegetables before sauteeing to reduce fat absorption. Common kitchen technique, especially French technique, would have you do this anyway. Now you have another reason to do it.<br />On the culinary side, I must say I am pleased to see the Table of Contents with a complete list of recipes. Regardless of how good the recipes are, this increases the value of the book to the reader. I also think the chapter on Herbs and Spices is a better than average treatment in a general book. It is especially refreshing to see the Arabic names of the spices. I was a bit annoyed with some of the little stories, especially those associated with garlic, which gives one the impression that the myth of garlic as a vampire repellant originated in modern America. I think Bram Stoker, the author of `Dracula' in 19th century England would be surprised at that statement.<br />On the recipes, I think the nutritional value per serving was a waste of effort. The variation in ingredient contents and the variation in cooking styles means this can vary as much as 50% from person to person. On the contents and cooking instructions, I compared several recipes in this book to the classic `The New Book of Middle Eastern Food' by Claudia Roden and, of course, I found differences. If I had not, I would have suspected Ms. Abourezk of plagerism. The differences are probably more due to differences in sources (Egyptian versus Syrian, for example) than to lapses in reporting. I do feel, however, that these differences make Ms. Roden's versions of Middle Eastern standards more appetizing. I was very surpised to see, also that while Ms. Roden put the Arabic names of dishes in her index, Ms. Abourezk did not. Too bad.<br />On balance, I have to say that if you want a good book on Middle Eastern food, stay with the classic from Roden. But, if you want something specifically from Syria with a distinctly Arabic point of view, this book will have some value for you, especially at the relatively modest list price.ple) than to lapses in reporting.

732762:US	39134375	RLP60PZCPO205	0743246632	589079733	Weir Cooking in the City: More than 125 Recipes and Inspiring Ideas for Relaxed Entertaining	Books	5	36	40	N	N	Excellent Source for Entertaining with Food and Wine	This new book by author, teacher, and PBS TV chef show host is aimed at helping people entertain at home when they are in an environment such as downtown San Francisco, where virtually every type of foodstuff imaginable is a few blocks walk away. At worst, you may have to take a cable car or motor scooter trip for a mile or so to reach your objective. Life is tough.<br />That last cynical remark is not fair. This is a very good book on both cooking and entertaining. It is as good as Sheila Lukins' new book `Celebrate', but complimentary to that book as Lukins is focusing on inexpensive family entertaining and Weir's target is more for young couples with few children to eat up disposable income. Both books gain from offering food / beverage pairings. Weir is more parochial in that her beverages are all modest to higher priced wines. Weir's book is clearly better than Ina Garten's book on parties, as Weir offers a really valuable instruction on a lot of the nuts and bolts of organizing and prepping a party. It is not in the same league as the classic Martha Stewart `Entertaining', which is really directed at large, catered parties.<br />The first feature about this book which impresses me is a table of contents which lists every recipe in the book, in chapter and page order, and chapters are arranged by course. This feature is doubly valuable in that chapters are based on very logical courses familiar to modern American families. These chapters are:<br />Firsts (Weir knows her stuff here, as she wrote a book on Tapas and Mezes)<br />Salads<br />Soups<br />Mains and a few Sides (Why not go to the very small extra effort to split these up?)<br />Desserts<br />Weir's cuisine is centered on the Mediterranean, with some East Asian and Latin American dishes added for variety. Interspersed with main dishes are recipes for pantry preparations such as salsa, preserved lemons, dashi, and potato chips. Many dishes are familiar such as spaghetti and meatballs, or variations on familiar themes such as Panini Caprese (the old familiar mozzarella, tomato, and basil combination).<br />All the cooking instructions are mindful of tips and techniques familiar to most Food Network junkies, such as being careful not to burn the garlic when you do a saut&eacute; beginning with garlic in olive oil. The author is also brave enough to recommend making your own chicken stock and her recipe may not be worthy of Judy Rodgers, it is quite good for the home cook.<br />My biggest problem with the book is with the section on pantry items. I have never seen anyone succeed with a viable pantry-stocking list, leading me to believe that no fixed pantry list will work for anyone other than the person who makes it up. By all means, buy this book if you like to entertain at home, but avoid the author's advice on pantry items. Her giving us three (3) different lists compounds the error. One for the Mediterranean cuisine, one for a Latin American cuisine, and one for an Asian cuisine. Heaven forbid if you want to cook from all three. Let me just cite a few errors in the Mediterranean list.<br />Does not recommend salt packed anchovies and capers over products packed in olive oil.<br />Does not give any warning on spoilage risks for nuts, nut oils and whole grains.<br />Puts phyllo dough on the shelf. I believe this must be frozen to preserve beyond a few days.<br />Pictures mozzarella as a pantry item, while authorities I know say this must be a serve on day made item.<br />The pantry notion is doubly misguided since the book is aimed at city dwellers who are both short on living space and long on availability to nearby markets and specialty stores. Best strategy is to simply buy what you need when you need it, keep a careful eye on shelf life, and never, never buy anything because you may make something with it in the future. You never do.<br />A cookie cutter blurb from Alice Waters graces the dust jacket. I give Alice credit for supporting a former employee, but I suspect the value of her endorsement may be wearing itself a little thin by now. More surprising is a rare blessing from Madeline Kamman. Not bad.<br />This is a superior book if you like to entertain at home and you do not have the time to wade through books devoted to regional cuisines to pick out suitable dishes (although I suggest Patricia Wells' books are an exceptional resource on this matter).<br />Highly recommended for people who entertain at home and wine and food fanciers.her endorsement may be wearing itself a little thin by now.

Foremost among these are Elizabeth David, Claudia Roden, Paula Wolfert, and Clifford Wright. And that doesn't include the many writers specializing in particular countries, such as Penelope Casas on Spain, Diane Kochilas on Greece, and Patricia Wells on France.<br />Each of these writers gives us a slightly different perspective on the same subject, so they rarely overlap in their general essays on the Mediterranean. Roden is the historian, Wolfert is the ethnologist, and Wright is the taxonomist. Jenkins' role seems to be the dietitian and synthesist, explaining what it is that makes Mediterranean cuisine distinctive and, in other works, what makes it as healthy as it appears in demographic studies of peoples and diets.<br />Of all the works I have read by these authors, this book is the most interesting to people interested in history and current events, but with only an average interest in cooking. The primary object of the book is to identify those foodstuffs that are central to the Mediterranean diet, and how they achieved that status. The main characters in this story are salt, olives, wheat and its products, wine and vinegar, legumes, peppers (chiles), tomatoes, pork, seafood, and milk (giving cheese and yogurt).<br />The first item, salt, may seem unexciting since every culture has used and valued salt. But, salt has played a larger role in Mediterranean history than in other cultures because the Mediterranean Sea happens to be a lot saltier than the broader `seven seas'. This means that it is a lot easier to harvest sea salt, which means that salt preserved foods become much more common. A perfect example of how simple things can make enormous differences.<br />Olives and olive oil are a no-brainer and anyone who has read at any length on Mediterranean food will not find a lot of new information here. The chapter on wheat was a major surprise on at least two counts. The first was biological. I knew there was a significant difference between durum wheat and other wheats, but I had no idea the difference was at such a deep genetic level and that durum wheat represents less than 10% of world wheat crops. The second surprise was historical. I am well aware of the difference between soft and hard pastas from the north and south of Italy respectively, but I had no idea that hard pasta (macaroni) was almost entirely limited in its production and distribution to southern Italy until after the end of World War II. This makes it clear that as important as bread is today as a Mediterranean starch, it once was much more important in Italy.<br />Almost every chapter had its little surprises. While I was skimming my way through the chapter on Old World beans, I was surprised by the discovery that there is a significant genetically based allergy to fava beans and that none other than Pythagoras banned their consumption. This may only be exciting to an avid reader of history and philosophy, but it certainly puts a new twist on how I think about fava beans the next time Mario Batali breaks them out on `Molto Mario'.<br />The list goes on. This book clearly fills a void in food writing by clearly defining a subject people often talk about without being really clear about their subject. As a result of the nutritional findings cited earlier, it becomes pretty important to know what it is that makes all those southern Italians so healthy.<br />One concern is that most of the book deals with Italy, southern France, and Spain. The author even concedes this point at the beginning, with the totally understandable statement that she is dealing with what she knows. On the other side of the coin, the range of the author's sources is very broad, including source material from many historical documents on peasant life in the Mediterranean in the last thousand years.<br />In addition to the essays on foodstuffs, the book offers recipes featuring each item. All are worthy, but the real value to the book is in the essays. That being said, I was really disappointed to find that although the book had a very good bibliography, there were references to authorities' names with no mention of them in the bibliography. The chapter on legumes for example refers to the anthropologist Sidney Mintz, yet no work by Mr. (Dr.?) Mintz appears in the bibliography. Not good reflections on Harper Collins' copy editors.<br />This is a small annoyance. Overall, the book gives a fresh, insightful view of Mediterranean cuisine. Almost all the recipes are classics, with relatively simple, straightforward instructions. Maybe not as authentic as Paula Wolfert, but definitely more authentic than Good Housekeeping.<br />Highly recommended for any foodie or even for History buffs.cipes featuring each item.

This volume essentially covers her journalistic career in California from the late 1970s through the early 1990s. One sure sign that this volume is a memoir and not an autobiography is that the story gives few clues about the dates on which the various episodes take place. Another sure sign that this is a memoir of her professional career is that it seems to spill a lot more ink dealing with office affairs than with her first marriage and its failure.<br />Make no mistake about it. The writing in this volume is as good as the narrative in the first, and probably a lot more interesting to the average adult reader.<br />My favorite story in this book is the episode where Ms. Reichl and a number of colleagues are treated to a cooking demonstration by Danny Kaye who had a first class kitchen in his house arranged specifically to enhance the ability of observers to see the ebullient Mr. Kaye demonstrate unvarnished culinary genius. This is the first I heard of Danny Kaye's culinary skills, but several other reporters have confirmed them since I read this story. Reichl's recipe she developed from memory even appeared in a volume of the `Best American Recipes' series. I have been looking for more details of this aspect of Danny Kaye's talent ever since. Unfortunately his biographies have virtually nothing on the matter.<br />The saddest event in the book is the telling of Ms. Reichl's visit to China at the time her father was very ill. He insisted Ruth make the trip in spite of his perilous condition, and he died while she was deep in mainland China, well away from easy contact with her family.<br />I am quite disappointed with the fact that by some great coming together of coincidences, I acquired a copy of this book from Amazon with Ms. Reichl's autograph. When I saw this, I felt a great disappointment in owning a souvenir of an event that never happened.<br />Ms. Reichl's encounters with other notable American food figures include meetings with M. F. K. Fisher and James Beard. As avid a reader of culinary writing as I am, I confess I have never been charmed by Ms. Fisher's writing. It is something I must explore, but I find it odd when Reichl is compared with Fisher, yet I find Reichl's writing far more engaging. I even find Elizabeth David much more enlightening than Fisher does. Must be me. Reichl's encounter with Beard is typical of other James Beard encounters with less important women. At the time, he was an aging lion with no interest in women, so he was brusque with a young female California journalist, our Ruth.<br />This is a book which one is sorry to see come to an end. Since it really deals with maybe a dozen anecdotes from her life, one can hope there is much more material available for some future volume. Unfortunately, Ms. Reichl has a full time day job as Editor in Chief of `Gourmet'. So, I guess I have to be satisfied with her monthly magazine columns and occasional restaurant reviews.<br />A very tasty read.event that never happened.<br />Ms. Reichl's encounters with other notable American food figures include meetings with M.

All The Good Stuff	The colossal irony of the Food Network series on which this book is based is the heart felt statements in the author's previous book `Kitchen Confidential' that he will never get his own Food Network series. He goes on in that book to say some rather unflattering things about Emeril Lagasse that seem to be a guarantee that his prediction will come true.<br />Well, Anthony Bourdain got his own Food Network show, and it is, to my lights, the most enjoyable travelogue style show they have ever done. I will warrant the prediction that it will also be the most enjoyable travelogue show they will ever do. I think the original 16 to 18 episodes are even better than the `second season' episodes he did which were not in this book. In the follow-up episodes, Bourdain (or his handlers) tend to start parodying themselves and make more coy, self-referential statements such as the cute business when Tony is in New Orleans and he gets slugged by matronly women for dissing their favorite son, Emeril.<br />In case you are not familiar with the Bourdain persona, I can quote a local paper's comparison to Emeril as the Food Network's star student, Alton Brown as the class nerd, and Tony Bourdain as the perennial juvenile delinquent. That is not to say Bourdain's view of things is juvenile. It is, in fact, as insightful as any other culinary commentary. The difference between Bourdain and other culinary travelers is that Bourdain is telling us about things from the inside, from the point of view of palate, tongue, nose, ears, and tummy. He is also talking from the inside in that he has been a working cook and chef for his whole life, who has seen just about everything the other culinary journalists have seen and more, including a stint at a childhood in France. The sardonic twist which gives Bourdain's reporting an outlaw flavor just adds to the entertainment value.<br />One of the more successful realizations of this book is the author's interpretation of `Extreme Cuisines' in the subtitle. This includes all the expected venues such as a boatride up the Southeast Asian River to Cambodia, with more than a few references to `Apocalypse Now' and trips to Spain, Morocco, Russia, Mexico, Japan, and Scotland.

Highly Recommended	Ruth Reichl is one of the most influential figures in American culinary journalism today, as Editor in Chief of `Gourmet' magazine for the last several years. Her influence may not be as great as that of Craig Claiborne, but that was probably a once and gone opportunity. The American culinary scene is too big for any one or two people to dominate it the way Claiborne and Beard did in the 1960's, 70's and 80's.<br />This book, `Tender at the Bone' is the first of two memoirs by Reichl. Their charm will be eagerly anticipated by anyone who reads Reichl's monthly editor's column in `Gourmet'. These two books are cut from the same primal stuff, with the additional spice of material too personal to warrant the pages of a national magazine.<br />Reichl grew up with a mother with habits which offer as compelling a motive to land in the food business as the very skillful cook / hospitality businesswoman who bore James Beard. In Reichl's case, her mother was just the opposite. She was quite capable of serving food so poorly preserved as to poison her guests. Reichl, as a little girl, had to become skillful in preparing food just to protect her own life and the lives of visitors to her family's house.<br />In many other regards, as one reads this tale of Ruth's life as a small girl in the early 1960s through her start in culinary journalism in San Francisco in 1977 just at the time when the zeitgeist was leading people such as Alice Waters and Jeremiah Tower to create California Cuisine at Chez Panisse and other venues.<br />Two fascinating questions are raised in my mind by this book and its sequel `Comfort Me with Apples'. The first is what it is about Reichl that compels her to reveal so many intimate details about her life and family. I am wondering if there is a writer's gene that propels one to lie out for all the world to see what an odd life one has lead. In spite of the wonder, I am immensely grateful that Ms. Reichl has done so, as the revelations are immensely entertaining. The second question is the wondering of how I may have turned out with the same experiences.<br />I encourage you to bring Ms. Reichl and her very odd family into your experience. You will be richer for the encounter. Since I regret I cannot know Ruth personally, this is the next best thing. Like many other culinary memoirs, this book includes recipes to highlight incidents in Ms. Reichl's life.

With this book, Tony Bourdain has turned himself from an average New York City chef and a below average mystery novel writer into a very much above average reporter on the American culinary world. The book is basically a memoir, starting with several chapters that chronicle Bourdain's introduction and early career in the food service industry. Oddly enough, as different as Bourdain seems from your typical Food Network celebrity, he does actually seem to fit the mold of many, those as different as Mario Batali, Bobby Flay, and Alton Brown. If you are to believe the public persona of these swells, they all share the same early exposure and infatuation with culinary skills, an adolescent wildness (maybe not with Alton), and a blossoming into a successful, inspiring career when they find their proper niche in the culinary world.<br />The overriding message of the book is the same I have seen in all books written from the inside. Cooking in a busy restaurant kitchen, especially for the executive chef working the line or the expediting table is very, very hard work. Looking in from the outside, it is so hard, it is sometimes hard for me to appreciate how anyone would actually want to do it, let alone revel in it. This is especially true because we are not talking about Daniel Boulud or Charlie Trotter here. Bourdain may have been considered a `master chef', but he was in charge of the kitchen in a relatively undistinguished New York City brassiere lookalike. He is not creating new cuisine at his job, he is recreating classic French cuisine in a restaurant named after a famous French market. Not very much room for improvisation here.<br />Bourdain's tales of his early career are an enjoyable first course, but the real meat of the matter is in his tales of New York City restaurants behind the scenes. His trademark revelation is the fact that, in general, the fish served by restaurants on Monday is left over from deliveries made on Friday, but his most interesting stories revolve around a real restaurant owner whose identity Bourdain hides with the nom de guerre of `Bigfoot'. Bigfoot succeeds in the very difficult restaurant business with a passionate attention to the details of purchasing, chef's operations, and kitchen design.<br />My favorite story is the one of an artisinal bread starter, sometimes known as a poolish or sponge maintained by a singularly irresponsible baker who, with fermented hunks of this sponge made some of the best bread to be found in five states, including New York City. The introduction to this character is a desperate call to Bourdain in the middle of service from the baker requesting that someone in the kitchen feed the sponge. The name he gave the sponge would probably not make it through Amazon.com's automated review censor. I had no sense of what the role of this kind of sponge played in bread baking when I first read this, but after having read several books on artisinal bread baking, I appreciate the humor and irony even more than I did on first reading.<br />I have read many books on the culinary world since I first read `Kitchen Confidential' and most of the names like Rippert, Bouley, and Luongo unfamiliar to me on first reading are now counted as spiritual intimates. This makes Bourdain's book the sort of work which rewards rereading after two or three years have passed.<br />This book may be a classic in the very small field of culinary journalism.volve around a real restaurant owner whose identity Bourdain hides with the nom de guerre of `Bigfoot'.

He goes on in that book to say some rather unflattering things about Emeril Lagasse that seem to be a guarantee that his prediction will come true.<br />Well, Anthony Bourdain got his own Food Network show, and it is, to my lights, the most enjoyable travelogue style show they have ever done. I will warrant the prediction that it will also be the most enjoyable travelogue show they will ever do. I think the original 16 to 18 episodes are even better than the `second season' episodes he did which were not in this book. In the follow-up episodes, Bourdain (or his handlers) tend to start parodying themselves and make more coy, self-referential statements such as the cute business when Tony is in New Orleans and he gets slugged by matronly women for dissing their favorite son, Emeril.<br />In case you are not familiar with the Bourdain persona, I can quote a local paper's comparison to Emeril as the Food Network's star student, Alton Brown as the class nerd, and Tony Bourdain as the perennial juvenile delinquent. That is not to say Bourdain's view of things is juvenile. It is, in fact, as insightful as any other culinary commentary. The difference between Bourdain and other culinary travelers is that Bourdain is telling us about things from the inside, from the point of view of palate, tongue, nose, ears, and tummy. He is also talking from the inside in that he has been a working cook and chef for his whole life, who has seen just about everything the other culinary journalists have seen and more, including a stint at a childhood in France. The sardonic twist which gives Bourdain's reporting an outlaw flavor just adds to the entertainment value.<br />One of the more successful realizations of this book is the author's interpretation of `Extreme Cuisines' in the subtitle. This includes all the expected venues such as a boatride up the Southeast Asian River to Cambodia, with more than a few references to `Apocalypse Now' and trips to Spain, Morocco, Russia, Mexico, Japan, and Scotland. How can you expect an exotic foods show not include haggis. But Bourdain also includes the very tame and very safe venue in Napa Valley called the French Laundry. While this site may be free of iguana meat or eels or lamb testicles, it is not safe for Bourdain's psyche and self-respect. This is the home ground of Thomas Keller, arguably the most distinguished chef in the country.<br />To insulate himself from facing the Olympian cuisine of Keller alone, and to insure that he gets his invite for himself and his camera crew, Bourdain sits down to the meal with three very well-connected colleagues. These three musketeers are Scott Byron, the chef at the New York City restaurant Veritas, Michael Ruhlman, a journalist / chef and co-author of Keller's cookbook, and Eric Rippert, one of the most highly regarded chefs in New York City. As predicted, Bourdain is humbled by the French Laundry tasting menu. As an at best journeyman chef in a somewhat better than average New York bistro, Bourdain ponders his wasted talents when he sees what Keller has done with food. I'm sure Bourdain is crying all the way to the bank with proceeds from his journalistic products.<br />One of Tony's colleagues has said Bourdain is a better writer than he was a chef. I believe it, because his writing is as entertaining as the professional writer Ruhlman, and even a touch more insightful due to his true insider's point of view.<br />Not quite as good as `Kitchen Confidential' but it does have all the stuff the Food Network could not show on television.

The book contains three long essays that chronicle parts of the careers of three different chefs at three different levels of achievement. Thus, the journey toward perfection is more the journey of the author than it is a journey by a single chef.<br /><br />The first essay is a telling of the events in one examination for the title of `Certified Master Chef'. The certification is carried out and bestowed by the Culinary Institute of America, often characterized as the Harvard of American cooking schools. The examination runs for more than a week when, on each day, the candidate must complete a particular task. The candidate knows the object of each task at least a day in advance, so they may at least mentally prepare for their challenge. Almost all tasks are taken from the pages of classic French cuisine, some lifted almost directly from the pages of Escoffier's books on the subject. Out of about a dozen qualifiers competing at each session, held once every six months, usually only two or three candidates pass the test and are awarded the title. The author participates in the competition under the ruse of being an inspector from a fictional qualifying organization that is verifying that the tests are worthy of an imaginary certification. In that way, the author can observe and interview all the candidates without arousing suspicion or apprehension in the candidates. Thus, this book picks up the narrative on American culinary careers at very much the same place the author left off at the end of his first culinary investigation `The Making of a Chef'. Most candidates have been chefs for a few years and are looking to add to their credentials and marketability, especially those who work as consultants to food service organizations. In many ways, this chapter is the most interesting, as it holds your interest to see if the featured candidates in the narrative will achieve their certification.<br /><br />The second essay had a much weaker hold on my interest, although the quality of the writing was equal to that in the first essay. The essay title, `Lola' is the name of a major Cleveland restaurant whose owner and head chef is Michael Symon, a CIA graduate, who may be familiar to some of you as one of the co-hosts on the Food Network show `Melting Pot' where he and Wayne Harley Brachman explore eastern European cuisines. In addition to this distinction, Symon has been recognized as a `Food and Wine' best new chef, so he really does not need the kind of recognition one achieves by earning the Certified Master Chef award. Symon's position in the middle essay is a sign of his rank above the CIA Master Chef candidates and below the very top of the American culinary scene represented by the chef in the last essay. The most interesting episode in the tale of Symon and `Lola' is in the story of a visit by John Mariani, a major American restaurant critic where it seems as if just about everything goes wrong. The moral of this story to me is its demonstration of how difficult it is to maintain 100% food quality in a very good restaurant. There is a very good reason why the executive chef stands at the expediter's table and checks on outgoing dishes. The connection between the second and third essays is the fact that Symon and his new wife go to Napa Valley to dine at the French Laundry restaurant for their honeymoon.<br /><br />The third essay takes us to the very top of the American culinary hierarchy of achievement. It deals with the career of Thomas Keller, the owner and executive chef of The French Laundry. He has been recognized as the best chef in California, followed by recognition as best chef in the country by the James Beard awards. His quest for perfection is legendary. It is no coincidence that Ruhlman is the co-author of Heller's `The French Laundry Cookbook' as I am sure this essay was done at the sametime as he was working on the cookbook. Keller's reputation is well known among foodies, so I won't dwell on it here. I will only recommend this essay, plus a chapter in Tony Bourdain's `A Cooks Tour' as excellent profiles of this very important American chef.<br /><br />For knowledgeable foodies, this book is a pure delight. Just knowing how to make pasta Puttanesca enhances one's enjoyment of the story in the second essay. For non-foodies, the book will appeal as well or better than other famous journalistic essays such as Tracy Kidder's `Soul of a New Machine'. The book contains some recipes.<br /><br />Highly recommended reading.on the cookbook. Keller's reputation is well known among foodies, so I won't dwell on it here.

The most fascinating thing about the book is in learning with Ruhlman, as an outsider to the culinary profession, exactly how demanding a job in the culinary arts can be. What is taken as a matter of course by people like Daniel Boulud and Jaques Pepin comes as a surprise to outsider Ruhlman. The surprise is in the commitment to performance which chefs are expected to make to maintain a service to their customers.<br />The book is a reporting on Ruhlman's taking an abbreviated version of the full curriculum at the Culinary Institute of America (CIA), where only the President of the school and a few select senior instructors know of the author's real role at the school. This means that when the author did attend classes, he attended the full class, from start to finish, and was expected to perform as well as any other student. While the CIA has many of the appearances of a liberal arts college, it is much closer in practice to a trade school. One symptom of this is that the stocks produced by the basic kitchen skills classes are then used by other classes at the school and they are used by each of the four restaurants run by the school for students, faculty, and outside guests. In a sense, this is a mix of trade school and graduate school, where it is expected that no one will do work worthy of a grade less than a B-.<br />The epiphany that reveals how serious the culinary profession is about uninterrupted service comes early in the first year when the school is hit by a serious snowstorm and the author considers whether or not he should attempt the difficult trek into the school. The great revelation is that the school and the instructor of Ruhlman's class on that occasion did not expect it to be above and beyond the call of duty to make it to class, and they would have not thought twice about lowering Ruhlman's grade had he been a true, full time student.<br />When I left school, I was surprised at how much easier life at a job was compared to life in school. I am sure that had a lot to do with the fact that I entered a largely intellectual avocation where so much about how things are done and how long they will take can change from job to job and even lowly technicians are give some opening to contribute to setting target dates. Culinary trades are a much different kettle of fish, literally.<br />In a professional kitchen, the line cook is totally at the mercy of who happens to walk into the restaurant that day, and how many people walk into the restaurant that day, and at what time. The challenge is to prepare so well and exercise one's skills so often that making six or eight different dishes to perfection at a saut&eacute; station becomes second nature. Since it is the job of the CIA to teach you how to do that, the classes can be very demanding.<br />The first 30% of the book covers the introductory class on basic skills and the main character is the instructor of that class. The last 30% of the book covers time spent in two of the CIA's four practice restaurants. The middle of the book covers experiences in specialized classes for Garde Manger, baking, and other specialities. If you do not already know the serious difference between savory cooking and baking, the books chapter describing the baking class will clear this up in a big hurry.<br />I confess that I am very fond of this type of book. To me it represents a successful presentation of material that reality TV shows can never hope to achieve. The paradigm for this kind of writing is Tracy Kidder's book `The Soul of a New Machine', to which I would favorably compare this work. You should find it doubly interesting if, as I do, you have an interest in the how and why of the culinary arts and personalities.<br />Very highly recommended.ng Ruhlman's grade had he been a true, full time student.<br />When I left school, I was surprised at how much easier life at a job was compared to life in school.

Leading this group with Walter is Maida Heatter, the queen of cakes, Rose Levy Beranbaum of the baking `Bible' series and Susan Purdy, also a writer on both pies and cakes. I suppose we should give an honorable mention to Nick Malgieri, who has written on pastry, cakes, cookies, and breads. The book in my library which most closely compares to Walter's cookie book is Nancy Baggett's `The All-American Cookie Book'.<br />These two books are of similar length, these two authors have both won awards for their books on baking, and, of course, both are devoted entirely to cookies. Both books have sizable bibliographies. Both books have general chapters on technique. The scope of Baggett's book is somewhat limited in that it is focusing on cookie recipes born or nurtured in America. For that reason and for her larger bibliography, I give a few points to Baggett at the outset.<br />Baggett's introductory chapter on technique is, I believe, a little gem. Walter gives a much larger chapter at the end of her book on ingredients, tools, and techniques, which has a much more academic air about it. To even things up and actually come off ahead of Baggett in the pedagogical arena, Walter has page long sidebars with pointers on making each different type of cookie.<br />The chapter headings are quite different in the two books. Both divide cookies by type. Baggett's classification is largely based on ingredients. Walter's classification is largely based on technique. If I owned neither, I would pick Walter's book for this reason alone.<br />Both authors give entertaining headnotes to each of their recipes. This feature is a wash. Baggett provides photographs for a small minority of her recipes. Walter provides a very effective, arty but informative picture for each and every cookie. A big plus here. Photographs in cookbooks do generally not sway me and many great ones have been with us for decades with no rotogravure at all. But, I think good pictures are a definite plus to cookie books. Score a big plus to Walter.<br />Walter gives an excellent thumbnail guide to each recipe by giving an `at a glance' table of `Pan', `Pan Prep', `Oven Temperature', `Baking Time', and `Difficulty' ranking of 1, 2, or 3. Another big score for Walter.<br />I compared the recipes for two cookies I know well, Snickerdoodles and Chocolate Chip cookies, in the two books and I found some interesting differences, especially in the Snickerdoodles recipes. Walter uses half butter and half vegetable shortening while Baggett uses all butter. Baggett includes corn syrup and Walter does not. Baggett includes nutmeg and Walter does not. Walter evens things up by providing a delightfully simple way to achieve uniform spheres of cookie dough to roll in the cinnamon and sugar. Aside from this rolling technique, I would tend to prefer Baggett's recipe to avoid the vegetable shortening and get the nutmeg. The chocolate chip recipes were less different. I am sure all four recipes give good results.<br />The prices are identical for roughly the same number of recipes.<br />I would not feel overly redundant if I owned both, as both are excellent books. But, if you are looking for a single good cookie book, get `Great Cookies' by Carole Walter. Very Highly Recommended.no rotogravure at all.

This book is different in many regards, although it has its own charm making it equally worthy as a light read.<br />The first difference is that there is very little in the book about food itself. The blurb by Eli Zabar, who may have known the family business better than he knew the inside of the book, reinforces the impression that the book is about food. The book is simply about people whose business happened to be food. The fact that the author is a writer of fiction rather than a culinary journalist should have been the clue that gives away the game. The chapter titles, named after major foodstuffs (including bacon, of all things for a Jewish family) maintains the ambiguity long into the middle of the book. I kept looking for the recipes (not really).<br />The second difference is that the book is much less about the author (and her parents) than it is about the entire Volk / Morgan / Sussman / Lieban vereinshaft (extended family in Yiddish).<br />Three themes permeate the book. The first is the success at various endeavors, primarily the building demolition business and the restaurant business of various male family members.

A look at the table of contents shows at a glance where the major differences lie between the two cuisines. Where `Bistro Cooking' had a chapter on potatoes and one chapter on pasta, `Trattoria' has two chapters on pasta (dried and fresh) plus chapters on `Rice and Polenta' and `Breads and Pizzas'. While `Bistro Cooking' desserts concentrated on pastries, `Trattoria' desserts concentrate on granitas, sorbets, and ice creams. The French book also seems to give more attention to eggs and cheese than the Italian book.<br />Recipes for a large number of Italian standards are presented in this book, but not all classics make an appearance, since this book does not deal with all of Italian cuisine, only that food you would most commonly expect in a family-run Trattoria. This means that the book gives a lot of attention to antipasti, salads, vegetables, soups, pastas, sauces, and condiments. The most common land based protein is chicken. Veal, so common in many classic Italian dishes, just barely manages to make an appearance in a recipe for veal shanks. There are no expensive veal dishes here. Some pork and lamb dishes make an appearance, but chicken is definitely the star of the show. There are also few long cooking beef braises like ragu Bolognese either. I was surprised to see that even gnocchi was absent, in spite of a healthy representation of other dishes from famous Roman Trattorias.<br />The classics which do show up are things like marinated, grilled, and fried artichokes; panzanella and other salads featuring arugula, celery (puntarelle), and spinach; and pasta such as spaghetti alla Puttanesca and lasagna. One of the real stars of the book is the selection of chicken dishes, including chicken cooked under bricks and the chicken cacciatora dishes.<br />Although Ms. Wells specializes in French cuisine, she has really done us a service with this book in making these Italian classics available in such an effective manner. The nature of the subject means that almost all recipes, especially those for vegetables, starches, and seafood are very straightforward. Still, the author does not skimp on important details. This is no more evident than in her chapters on pizza and breads. In reviewing books like this, I typically advise people to refer to books by specialists in baking, but I make an emphatic exception with this book. I am delighted, for example, to find a really effective recipe for ciabatta, a rustic type of bread which is superb for making panninis, not to mention a killer Philadelphia cheese steak sandwich (See Tyler Florence's book for an over the top recipe).<br />For those who are unfamiliar with bread baking, do not be surprised at the long waiting times for some types of bread baking, especially the artisinal yeast breads and natural yeast breads such as sourdough. Ms. Wells suggestions on bread baking techniques are repeated by every bread expert I have read. Do not skimp on her resting times or on her suggestions to have doughs rise in a cool location. Also, I strongly suggest you get a baking stone if you do bread, at least for your pizza. This is not to say that all bread recipes take days. The previously mentioned ciabatta and a recipe for olive rolls are relatively fast. Wells's chapter will not turn you into a professional baker, but it will certainly turn on the bread-baking gene, if you have it.<br />In the chapter on desserts, I was particularly happy to find a recipe for the ricotta cheesecake, a very chic pastry with as much panache as a Brooklyn cheesecake with much fewer calories.<br />If you like cooking Italian food without a lot of fuss, this is the book for you. If someone asked me for a recommendation on a book with which to have fun, I would recommend they get both `Trattoria' and `Bistro Cooking'. Together, they are less expensive than many recent celebrity written cookbooks.<br />Highly recommended.r, they are less expensive than many recent celebrity written cookbooks.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-03-15

Warm, Easy, Delightful	This is Patricia Wells' third book on French cooking and the fourth of her books I am reviewing. Of her four books I have seen, this seems the most accessible and most useful to the largest number of people. This book presents recipes from small eating establishments from all regions of France, including Paris, Lyon, Provence, and southwest France. Therefore, it's contents are a much broader sampling of recipes than the books I have seen on Joel Robuchon, Paris restaurants, and Provence home cooking.<br />Like all of her other books, the table of contents and selection of recipes therein follows a conventional pattern with chapters on Appetizers, First Courses, and Palate Teasers; Soups of the Day; Market Basket Salads; Pastas; Seasonal Vegetables; Potatoes; Eggs, Cheese, Terrines, and Tarts; Fish and Shellfish; Poultry, Chicken, Duck, Guinea Hen, and Rabbit; Meats, Roasts, and Daily Specials; Homemade Desserts; and Pastries, Bread Dough, Sauces, and Stocks.<br />The first thing that stands out is the wide variety of dishes. The next is the relative simplicity of the recipe techniques without sacrificing anything to quality and respect for ingredients. I compared Wells' pot-au-feu recipe in this book with the recipe in Julia Child's `Mastering the Art of French Cooking' and found the attention to detail was as good or greater in Wells' book. At the same time, Wells is not entangling us in a lot of complex preparations. I was pleasantly surprised to find that Wells and Child agree on a method for making Cr&egrave;me Fraiche that does not require day or more to wait for the result.<br />Wells succeeds in evoking the feeling of the bistro experience in the selection of her recipes, the chatter in the headnotes explaining the source of the recipes, the consistent presentation of a French title for each recipe, even if the dish is a local favorite at a small establishment (such as `Maggie's Roasted Red Peppers') and not an established standard dish. The photographs and layout of the book also enhance the subject, making the book a lot of fun to read without going too far, destroying the utility of a book you have to read and follow it's directions.<br />The emphasis on simplicity and utility extends to the pantry recipes in the last chapter. I especially like the distinction between the three different types of pastry crust. If you are new to pastry, however, I recommend you consult a book such as Alford and Duguid's `Home Baking' specializing in a discussion of pastry to become aware of the subtleties of pastry dough. I also suggest that for stocks, the reader consult a fuller discussion of the subject such as Cooks Illustrated's volume `The Best Recipe'.<br />One thing I did not find in this book which I expected was an explanation of the distinction between a bistro and a brassiere. Wells cites several recipes that originate from brassieres and includes bistros, brassieres, and restaurants in her list of establishments in the back of the book.<br />Three other small aspects of the book did annoy me. One was the numerous references on unfamiliar terms to an index which, in some cases, did not include the term on which the reference was made. Another  was the inaccuracy of some English to metric unit conversions. I found a few which were consistently off by about 10%. A third was the use of the metric unit centiliters in place of milliliters. Almost all American metric measuring devices for the kitchen are graduated in milliliters. I can anticipate a lot of blank stares at the abbreviation `cl' for metrically challenged cooks.<br />All of these caveats are small matters when weighted against the great good fun to be found in preparing recipes from this book. This book will go to the top of my list when I am looking for ideas to fill out a menu and I have no clue to what I want to eat. At the list price of less than $14, the cachet of genuine bistro food makes this book a real gem.<br />Highly recommended to all.of the book also enhance the subject, making the book a lot of fun to read without going too far, destroying the utility of a book you have to read and follow it's directions.<br />The emphasis on simplicity and utility extends to the pantry recipes in the last chapter.

As people who write these one-topic books are usually experts on that particular field, the likelihood that the book will be of a high quality is very good.<br />James Peterson does not disappoint us in this book all about the various methods for cooking salmon. Peterson is a culinary writer of the first water to begin with, having written many award-winning books already, including a book on fish and shellfish.<br />Since Peterson has already covered salmon in his seafood book, one can wonder what else there is to say. It turns out there is very much else to say.<br />One of the most valuable parts of the book appears before we even start thinking about cooking. Peterson describes all of the commercially available species of salmon you may find in your fish market, the relative price of these species, depending on whether they are farm raised or caught from the wild. This is important because there is a very big difference in price between the least and most expensive, and the difference in price is not fully returned in difference in value.<br />Another chapter in the book gives detailed instructions on how to both cold and hot smoke salmon. This is a doubly section in that I suspect the same techniques could be used for most types of finfish. Be warned, however, that unless, like Alton Brown in his popular Good Eats episode `Junkyard Chef', you are exceptionally handy, cold smoking can be rather expensive and messy.<br />Peterson is always an engaging writer, as his opinions and personal tastes often come through in his writing. One may object to this if these opinions are unfair or needlessly critical of other writers, but they are not. They simply leaven the discussion and make his work more fun to read. One example is that while he claims to have covered virtually every method of cooking salmon, he does leave out steaming, as this is simply too boring to deal with. I will not miss this discussion.<br />The presentation of techniques he does cover is very, very thorough. In dealing with poaching, he covers techniques and special equipment needed for poaching a complete fish as well as salmon steaks and salmon fillets. He is especially careful to warn the reader about overcooking while poaching. The anomaly with poaching is that if the poaching liquid is heated to a boil, the fish will actually be too dry when removed from the liquid for service. The treatment of saut&eacute;ing, grilling, curing, roasting and baking, broiling, and other methods, including serving raw as with sushi and carpaccio are equally thorough.<br />The book includes sources for special materials required for smoking, as well as good sources for spices and the like.<br />This book is doubly important with the recent findings on the food value of salmon. The book was published before the recent concerns with farm raised salmon, but it does give intelligent information on what kinds of salmon are available farm raised and what species are available caught wild.<br />My only complaint about the book may be that Peterson describes how to create a medallion from a steak, but provides no pictures of the technique, even though he has published pictures of this technique in other books. He does not even refer one to these other volumes.<br />Highly recommended. Better than his book on duck cooking.e example is that while he claims to have covered virtually every method of cooking salmon, he does leave out steaming, as this is simply too boring to deal with.

This book on `home cooking' in the Provence region of France falls, it seems, at the end of a series headed by the book `Simply French' which expounds on the cuisine of Joel Robuchon. This volume covers the high-end `haute cuisine' end of the spectrum. A recent book, `The Paris Cookbook' covers the less Olympian subject of cooking by Paris bistros, restaurants, and purveyors. This is closer to Child's classic subject, `la cuisine Bourgeoisie'. The subject of this review reflects cooking done by Wells herself in Provence, based on the influence of local sources and her own invention. It is a combination of Curnonsky's `la cuisine Regionale', and `la cuisine Improvisee'.<br />Since many, if not most of the insights into cooking in this book can be traced to the earlier book on Robuchon, it was harder to identify the value of this book in its own right. But, I think I can safely say that this volume stands on it's own two feet by combining the simplicity of home cooking with the healthy ingredients of the Mediterranean ingredients and the cachet of Provence, being an intersection of some of the best of both France and Italy.<br />My strongest visceral reaction to these recipes is the wealth of things to do with common, inexpensive ingredients such as potatoes, celery, carrots, and tomatoes. My next delight was the variety of bread recipes. The star of this act was a version of brioche that is based on olive oil rather than butter. The reputation of butter has undergone something of a revival since this book was published in 1996, but if you have gotten into the habit of looking for ways to have olive oil to replace butter, this is a recipe for you.<br />Like all of her other books, this volume's organization follows that most classic of orders, with chapters on:<br />Appetizers, Salads, Soups, Vegetables, Pasta, Bread, Fish and Shellfish, Poultry and Game, Meat, Desserts, and Pantry.<br />As the Wells homestead is a fair distance from the Mediterranean, the coverage of fish and shellfish is a bit light, but this shortfall is more than made up by other chapters, especially the chapters on vegetables and pasta, which broadens ones range defined by classic southern Italian cuisine. The most interesting seafood discovery is Wells' combining mint and crabmeat. My Baltimorean friends are rolling their eyes already.<br />The star of the chapter on meats is the daube of either beef or lamb. This is a fascinating technique with a French name which, however, seems to be characteristic of northern Europe. German dishes like sauerbraten use the daube technique, but, to my knowledge, there is no daube style dish in any Italian cuisine. A daube is basically applied to a dish that has marinated for a long time, a day or more, in a sauer medium, either wine or vinegar. Browning and braising follows the marinade. The recipe may even call for a further day's resting to mix together the flavors.<br />As with her other books, this volume includes recommendations for wine to serve with each savory dish. Unlike the very specific suggestions in `Simply French', these are fairly generic, simple enough for the least enlightened of liqueur store clerks to interpret. For those who live and die by the very best choices of wine, specifics are included with the general suggestions.<br />As books on French provincial cooking go, this book is at the opposite end of the spectrum defined by Elizabeth David's classic in that all instructions and descriptions of ingredients are detailed and crystal clear. Virtually everything in all the dishes should be available at a good urban supermarket.<br />My only complaint, which I bring up only because Ms. Wells is a culinary teacher as well as a journalist, is the inaccuracy of conversion between pounds and kilograms. A kilogram is 2.2 pounds, but Ms. Wells consistently treats the conversion as two (2) pounds to the kilogram. Fortunately, such approximations do not appear in the baking recipes, where she is extra contentious about the accuracy of her metric to English conversions of weights and volumes.<br />I strongly recommend this book to anyone who loves French or Mediterranean cuisine and who needs a new source of recipes from these sources. I strongly recommend it to anyone who loves to read about food. I recommend it to anyone who cooks. There will be several simple recipes here for inexpensive ingredients that I know you will enjoy.uld be available at a good urban supermarket.<br />My only complaint, which I bring up only because Ms. Wells is a culinary teacher as well as a journalist, is the inaccuracy of conversion between pounds and kilograms.

Her first two books, the two volumes of `Mastering the Art of French Cooking' influenced two generations of home cooks, caterers, and restaurateurs. Her PBS television series did not invent the TV cooking show, but they made such an indelible impression on the genre that I am sure their influence will be felt long after Julia is cooking for St. Peter. Her generous support of charities and freedom from commercial influences should be a model for other culinary professionals who wish our respect.<br />After all that, I confess a certain irony in expecting to give this book a cautionary review. It is certainly a joy to read a new work by Ms. Julia, but I anticipated a few things you should consider, based on the fact that this is a very short book.<br />First, there are 105 pages of kitchen wisdom for a list price of $20, not including introductions and index. Short books leave things out. The book very wisely advocates a slow rise to bread dough to get better development of flavor, but it doesn't explain why. Another area where the book is clearly leaving things out is where it mentions the five French mother sauces, but only gives details on making two of the five.<br />Second, it seems to concentrates on the faster rather than the tastiest result, as this requires less space. One example I found is in the recipe for creating a cr&egrave;me fraiche at home. Almost every recipe I have found asks you to let the mixture of cream and sour cream or yogurt to sit in the fridge for at least 24 hours. Some have it sit for up to three days. This book allows for no waiting time. I confess the book does not always take the shortest route, as the recipe for pie dough (pate brisee) recommends a rest period of two hours in the fridge. Most writers suggest at least 30 minutes.<br />I bought this book over a year ago and I do not use it for anything except for its crepe recipe, which I find to be both effective and simple. Rereading selected sections a year after reading it the first time shows me that in spite of it's small size, it simply does not mislead by omission. When an important detail is needed for a technique, the detail is there. I expected the book to skimp on the discussion of the omelet, for example, but it did not. It stated that there are many ways to make an omelet and the method presented was simply Julia Child's preference, not the Gospel. I was especially fond of the fact that on the matter of fresh vegetables, Julia was closer to Nigella Lawson's common sense approach to using goods out of season than to the stoic `only fresh and local' dogma. She does confess that we have not yet corrected the insipidness of tomatoes out of season, but almost all other produce is as good as gold, and healthy to boot.<br />The lesson I take from the change in my impression of this book over the last year is that one may not be able to appreciate this book or be comfortable in using it unless you are already comfortable in the kitchen and know why you do certain things in certain ways. To use an Alton Brown metaphor, this book is excellent at giving you directions, but it leaves out all the details of alternate routes in the event you stray from the straight and narrow.<br />I highly recommend this book, but I urge you to not take it as a shortcut to kitchen wisdom. The best way to use the book is to have studied these techniques in more detailed books and to come back to this book for a reminder. The irony in this advice is that Julia herself says that once you know a technique, you rarely have to refer to a recipe again. To those of you who are reading the book without a wide reading in other good books on cooking, please take my word for the fact that this lady knows what she is talking about.<br />Very highly recommended for all amateur cooks.ons a year after reading it the first time shows me that in spite of it's small size, it simply does not mislead by omission.

Outstanding	This new book by husband and wife team Jeffrey Alford and Duguid succeeds in being that one in a hundred culinary works which both integrates ones knowledge of cooking and inspires one to press on to new and more interesting achievements.<br />The object of the book is to examine home baking around the world with recipe and anecdote and to encourage its preservation. As such, the book makes a rare good use of large, lush photographs to evoke a sense of time and place in this oversize format. The publisher, Artisan, has used this format several times before with works authored by Eric Ripert and Thomas Keller. While these volumes have been attractive, they have not succeeded quite as well as this volume.<br />Needless to say, all this good eye candy would have been of little value in a $40 book without good content. And this content is very, very good. This book will easily join my other favorite `go to' baking book `Baking With Julia' as the first stop when I want to try something new.<br />It is not surprising to find a book of such quality from these authors, as they have produced other books that have received high critical praise. What may be surprising is their subject, after having done two books centered on Asian savory cooking. The surprise disappears when you realize that their very first book, less well known than `Hot, Sour, Salty, Sweet' and `Seductions of Rice' was a book on flatbreads of the world.<br />As good as this book is, it is important to be aware of its range. At about 440 pages, it is smaller than the shortest of Rose Levy Beranbaum's three `Bibles' of baking. It is also shorter by far than the very good King Arthur `Baking Companion'. So, it's value does not come from technical depth, although what general technical material it covers is an excellent introduction to various baking modes, and a delightful invitation to explore the subject more thoroughly in the more detailed books like those by Beranbaum. The discussion on pastry crusts is a perfect example. Dozens of books give different kinds of tie and crust recipes, but never explain with any authority the whys and wherefores of all the different options. This book explains why some crusts have shortening and some do not; why some crusts have egg yolk and some do not; why some have water and some do not. And, the key to the presentation is that it gives just enough information to pull together what we have read in a dozen books on piecrusts. To acquire more details, the authors have included one of my favorite features, a very good bibliography.<br />The authors always remain very pragmatic in their recommendations. Like the taxonomy of piecrusts, they discuss the influence of different flours on baking results, but do not get into some of the gritty details. They say that as much as you may benefit from using pastry or cake flour or vegetable shortening, you will probably always have all purpose flour and butter, so that is the pairing of choice for many ingredients lists. As important as buttermilk is as an ingredient, the authors effortlessly include a substitution in recipes where necessary, saving one an extra trip to the megamart. Also, while I have applauded recipes using weights in other books, with equal enthusiasm I congratulate these authors for leaving this technical detail below the horizon. I do urge you, however, to be aware of the issues in measuring and suggest you consult Ms. Beranbaum for the scoop on measuring.<br />All this is not to say that the book is simplistic. Some of it's recipes include some of the most challenging products of baking known to chronic Food Network junkies. It stops short of giving a recipe for phyllo dough, but it does include recipes for strudel dough and puff pastry. It also includes many less well-known local favorites. My personal favorite is the Hungarian walnut cake which is made primarily of finely ground walnuts and breadcrumbs rather than with any flour.<br />The chapter organization follows ourtraditional understanding of the major kingdoms in the world of baking. The four principle titles are `Pastry', `Bread', `Smaller Breads', and `Cakes and Cookies'. This manages to cover everyone's favorites, including sweet and savory pies, festive breads, artisinal breads, rolls, bagels, pancakes, cakes, cookies, and sweet buns. While the introductions to each of the four major topics are inspiring and informative, all the recipes are self-contained. You do not have to do a lot of flipping around to get all the information you need.<br />For those of you unfamiliar with baking recipes, be warned. By their nature, baking recipes are much longer than the average recipe for savory cooking, and they should be followed with greater attention to detail. Another surprise may the time it takes to achieve superior results. A workable pie crust can probably be put together in 30 minutes, but a great pie crust needs a lot of resting and care to get it to come out right. And, that doesn't even touch the surface of the time required to work up a good artisinal bread starter. The authors do not let this deter them and offer encouragement at every turn, explaining how some long waiting times can be put to your advantage, such as the fact that the waiting time for a dough's rise may not be critical and that a longer time unattended will actually improve your result.<br />If you have any interest at all in baking, this book is a must.

753181:US	39134375	R2Q3D2CVDG5H31	0399150722	206443691	The Junior League at Home	Books	4	41	52	N	N	A very good source for family meals and entertaining at home	This `Junior League' cookbook is almost exactly what you would expect from such an organization, where all recipes appear to come from home cooks. I give this book four stars (with a caveat) instead of three because it surpasses expectations in at least two ways. First, it provides four complete entertaining and family menus per month, with instructions on day before and other advance preparations to prepare for the meal. Second, the range of dishes is very international. I was surprised to find a good recipe for Filipino spring rolls. This is not exactly Iowa church supper fare.<br />My biggest caveats about this book follow.<br />First, while the recipes are arranged by month, I believe no thought was given to whether or not fresh ingredients were appropriate for that month. The first menu is serving artichokes in January. I know the recipe calls for canned artichokes, but the sense of oddness persists. The presence of green beans and green grapes on the same menu is a testament to the incredible food distribution network which can bring California and South American produce to a Pennsylvania produce market in virtually any month of the year. But this market still does not have artichokes in January.<br />Second, the recipes are from many different sources, and these sources are neither professional chefs nor professional food writers. This means the quality of the recipes will be very uneven. One cannot depend on the fact that all recipes will have a uniform reliability as you would if the book in your hand was from Ina Garten or Sheila Lukins or Rachael Ray. This is important if your objective is to improve your cooking skills. As an amateur who wishes to learn new techniques from most dishes I make, I would sooner go to a book by Mario Batali or Jaques Pepin.<br />Third, there are a lot of prepared food ingredients in the recipes. If, like me, you are adverse to ingredients which come from the Merck Index rather than the farmer's market, I would just as soon stay away from such recipes.<br />Lastly, the organization of recipes is a little odd in that types of dishes are overlaid onto the monthly chapters. This would have been much better done by having 24 chapters rather than 12 which address two different purposes.<br />I must say this book is printed and bound so that it is very easy to use in the kitchen, as long as you have plenty of room for it's 8 ½ by 11 spiral bound format in your kitchen. This format lies flat and is very easy to photocopy pages. It also has a good index, which you may not find in most volunteer / fund raiser books of this type.<br />Recommended for home cooks who are not `foodies' intent on learning cooking techniques or food lore.ay away from such recipes.<br />Lastly, the organization of recipes is a little odd in that types of dishes are overlaid onto the monthly chapters.

She has a doctorate in English literature, has graduated from a major culinary school, and was an associate of M. F. K. Fisher, and is a biographer of that writer. She is also a chronicler of Poetry by American women. Oysters deserve no less a scribe. A small reward for these academic credentials is that unlike many other writers, the author gives the correct translation of the French term `hors d'oeuvres'. I feel I am in the hands of someone whose opinion I can trust.<br />At the very least, this book is a classic single topic cookbook similar to recent books done on duck, salmon, potatoes and eggs, the kind I find eminently useful in one's permanent culinary library.<br />The chapters cover all the usual topics, these being:<br />Appetizers<br />Soups<br />Salads &amp; Vegetables<br />Breads and Pastries<br />Oyster Entrees<br />Oysters and Entrees<br />The book ends with a glossary of oyster species, pests, preservatives, sources, and terminology.<br /> The book succeeds better than many other single subject cookbooks in that many general guidelines are given to each chapter. But these introductions don't stop at simply informing you of interesting culinary tidbits. Each is an essay celebrating its topic in a way I have rarely seen outside some early writings by Elizabeth David and Paula Wolfert. The paean to bread ranges from Chaucer to the Chinese. Some of the culinary suggestions in the bread chapter I have never seen, even in books specializing in sandwiches.<br />Each chapter is also leavened with appropriate quotes from everyone from Julius Caesar to Shakespeare to M. F. K. Fisher. In many hands, this feature may have no more impact than some badly done drawings or photographs. But Reardon makes them work.<br />Most dishes are provided a pairing with an alcoholic beverage. Suggestions are not limited to wine. They include sake, tequila, beer, and other notable potables.<br />The central section of color photographs provides a gallery of oyster species with their geographical source.<br />This book is a joy to read and a delightful culinary resource. There are books at this price which offer half as many recipes and none of the literary delights. Very highly recommended.sake, tequila, beer, and other notable potables.<br />The central section of color photographs provides a gallery of oyster species with their geographical source.<br />This book is a joy to read and a delightful culinary resource.

These books are not like `The Joy of Cooking' or `James Beard's American Cookery' where you get a lot of advice on cuts of meat, types of potatoes, and techniques for making an especially good pie crust. This type of book contains mostly bare bones recipes. They are one of the most common to find on the discount pile in the Borders foyer.<br />But, this book is a little different from most books of this class.<br />First, it is a collection of recipes from Craig Claiborne and Pierre Franey, and that is something special. As Paul Prudhomme states in his introduction, Craig Claiborne is one of the three most influential figures in American culinary writing in the last fifty years, along with James Beard and Julia Child. I suspect Claiborne's influence worked as much or more behind the scenes and may be less durable than the works of Beard and Child. What was public was almost entirely done in daily newspaper columns and reviews. Much of his other work was in the support of charity events and in the support of the careers of up and coming journalists such as Jim Villas and chefs such as Jeremiah Tower.<br />Second, this collection gains cachet by being the best of newspaper columns in the New York Times. Some very discerning editors picked them over at least twice. First, they were selected to appear in the paper. Then, they were selected from the best of these to appear in this book.<br />Third, the variety of dishes in this book is outstanding. The range of dishes is far better than, for example, a collection of 1000 Chinese dishes or the best 800 Jewish recipes. These come from around the world, from some of the best chefs in the world. My favorite finds are recipes culled from Danny Kaye, who has the reputation of being quite literally one of the finest Chinese cooks in the world, in his time. The sad fact is that the only remains of that talent are in the occasional recipe in collections such as this.<br />Fourth, unlike earlier large `New York Times' cookbooks edited by Claiborne, these recipes contain headnotes citing the source of the recipe and tips on their execution. The book also gives an excellent index of recipes by contributor, which is the way in which I was able to locate the recipes from Mr. Kaye. I'm certain these headnotes came from the newspaper articles in which the recipes were embedded.<br />If you like to have access to a large variety of dishes but do not wish to have a large cookbook library, this is the book for you. The closest competitor to this book may be `The New New York Times Cookbook' that has even more recipes, but no headnotes. This was my first cookbook and I believe every recipe I made from it was sound.<br />Highly recommended for all, especially those with a budget.the occasional recipe in collections such as this.<br />Fourth, unlike earlier large `New York Times' cookbooks edited by Claiborne, these recipes contain headnotes citing the source of the recipe and tips on their execution.

All that means is that this book is fun to read and may be worth a purchase from the deeply discounted pile of books at the entrance of Borders. But, it adds little of substance to one's permanent cookbook library.<br />At the top of my list of reasons not to pay list price for this book is the fact that it gives no criteria by which the editors choose their best of winners. You have nothing like the closely reasoned thinking you get from the Cooks Illustrated magazines or books. You do not even get any rationale for how sources are chosen. On top of this is the very few recipes from Cooks Illustrated or other `best of' sources.<br />Next on my list of complaints is that when a recipe comes from a periodical, the editors do not give enough information about the source which would enable you to find that particular issue. This may be useful especially for recipes from Savour or Gourmet, where recipes often accompany articles on countries or restaurants and you may be interested in reading about the recipe's source.<br />Another irritation is that all the copyrighted sources show that they were published in 2002, not 2003. This irritation is doubled when I find recipes from republished material, such as new editions of works by M. F. K. Fisher or memoirs including old material such as `Between Bites' by Jim Villas. I really like both authors and I think they deserve every credit coming their way, but I already own their works, so I don't need to see their old material rehashed here.<br />Yet another irritation is in the Foreword by guest contributor Alan Richman. Like Tony Bourdain before him, he was primarily enlisted to provide some opening comic relief. The problem is, at least some of his humor is based on plainly false observations such as a mythical difficulty in finding shallots at an American grocery. Unlike the author, I find shallots at every store stocking vegetables in my middle-sized city. Bring back Tony Bourdain. At least I know where his cynical sense of humor is coming from.<br />I always look forward to some insights from the editors' trends of the year. This year, I flatly disagree with their identifying a movement toward can opener cooking exemplified by Sandra Lee's `Semi-Homemade' rubric. I think that with the recent popularity of Rachael Ray's books and TV show, I would more likely identify the trend as a strong interest in cooking at home and the search for ways to do it quickly without having to rely too heavily on prepared foods. The observation about Sandra Lee is doubly ironic in that her Food Network TV show started in 2003, and, as cited above, all the recipes presumably reflecting this trend are from 2002.<br />The last annoyance with which to burden you are my finding inaccurate statements in the editors' notes to some recipes. One I found was the statement that scallops are stored in solutions of sodium to preserve them. Sodium cannot form a solution. Only sodium salts can form a solution, and, I believe the salt used to preserve scallops is not the most common sodium salt, sodium chloride, but some less common compound.<br />In spite of all these nuisances, this book is fun to read, if not worth the expense to own it. If I were to fall back on a quote from Joseph Conrad, which says that the sole purpose of a cookbook is to increase the amount of happiness in the world, I believe this book can do that, especially if acquired at a deep discount or from the library.<br />In the books defense, I cite with favor the editors' notes accompanying each recipe. This levels the quality of the entries, balancing sophisticated stuff from Jeremiah Tower with material found on the back of a bread crumb can.<br />Recommended, with reservations.e the author, I find shallots at every store stocking vegetables in my middle-sized city.

756607:US	39134375	R2ZCAYFEQT15QE	0060184698	486991602	The Paris Cookbook	Books	5	18	23	N	Y	Dangerously Enticing Resource for Fine French Meals	This recent book by Patricia Wells is a selection of the author's favorite recipes from the restaurants, Boulangerie, and patisseries in Paris. In a sense, it broadens her focus of the book `Simply French' from the single restaurant of Joel Robuchon to look at many leading Parisian establishments. While being broader, it is also just a bit less deep in it's exploration of complicated recipes, as very few in this book match the complexity of the typical recipe in `Simply French'.<br />I would place this book as my third or fourth French cookbook after Julia Child's `Mastering the Art of French Cooking', Richard Olney's `Simple French Food', and Madeline Kamman's `The New Making of a Cook'. While these are some of the best texts on the principles and techniques of French cooking, this book by Wells is real world application of the principles. As it looks at the real world, it offers the reader some pretty unusual dishes in giving us a variety you may not find in a single restaurant cookbook, even one so good as the recent `Balthazar Cookbook' from the chefs at the New York restaurant of the same name.<br />While this book is not a teaching book, it is still true to the style of cooking you will find in Paris and, as such, it is primarily a book for the gourmet, the entertainer, the traveler to Paris, and the wine lover. Like `Simply French', the book gives wine suggestions for all savory courses. These wine suggestions are a bit more generic than those in `Simply French', so it will be easier to find something to match, even in the oenologically backward state of Pennsylvania.<br />Before you get the impression that none of the recipes in this book have any general currency for the average cook, I must say that many are really very easy, especially the salad, vegetable, and soup recipes. Even some meat recipes are fairly simple, such as the braised lamb shank recipe Wells did on `Emeril Live' when she made a promotional appearance after the book first came out. Everyone does braised lamb shanks, but Wells does it just a little differently, and offers some good suggestions on choosing the best cuts. But, there are some real novelties, such as the Arpege Eggs with Maple Syrup. I will be content to simply read about these dishes.<br />The organization of recipes is classic, following almost exactly the same chapter headings as in `Simply French'. These are:<br />Appetizers, Starters, and First Courses<br />Salads<br />Breads<br />Vegetables<br />Potatoes<br />Pasta, Rice, Beans, and Grains<br />Soups<br />Fish and Shellfish<br />Poultry<br />Meats<br />Desserts<br />The Pantry<br />The first two chapters plus the third and fourth are real gems. At the $30 list price of this book, they are worth the price of admission. The Breads chapter is a little teaser with only six recipes, each fairly complicated, but very rewarding. Just enough to whet your appetite for a book by a bread heavyweight such as Nancy Silverton or Peter Reinhart. The chapters on protein dishes are surprisingly simple. They are certainly less complicated than the soups and desserts. The desserts chapter is quite large, with many recipes for apples, cherries, and ice cream. The Pantry chapter gives all the expected recipes for vinaigrettes, mayonnaise, spice mixes, stocks, and sauces. This is somewhat better than average.<br />In spite of the utility of cookbooks that organize by menu for occasions and themes, this is still my favorite organization for a cookbook covering many types of dishes. One entertains once a month, maybe. One cooks for your small family in a single household every day. This is better for the latter situation.<br />I am not a fan of splashy color photography in cookbooks. When it is there, I rarely look at it except to judge its quality for a review. To my mind, the photography in this book is just right. Its occasional black and white pictures of people and places have informative captions and decorate the book with views of Paris and its people.<br />If you are traveling to Paris or love French food or need new recipes for entertaining with a lot of ta-da, this is the book for you. Be aware, however, that basic cooking skills and a well-equipped kitchen are a must in order to accomplish many of the recipes in this book.<br />You may also find yourself developing irrational urges to visit your favorite travel web site for plane tickets to Paris. Highly recommended.traveling to Paris or love French food or need new recipes for entertaining with a lot of ta-da, this is the book for you.

Others are Better	This is Ina Garten's second of three cookbooks and the one most closely patterned after the flagship work of her mentor, Martha Stewart. It presents ideas and recipes organized for small scale entertaining at home. As such it is no match for Stewart's `Entertaining' volume, to which I would direct you if you need to plan any serious parties with more than eight guests.<br />Garten's first book was simply recipes from her catering business. They were probably the best she had. This book adds value to a simple collection of recipes by organizing courses into party menus designed for sixteen different family and close friend occasions. The third book seems to be composed of leftovers.<br />The choice of events to celebrate is a bit quirky in that traditional occasions such as Christmas, Graduation, Thanksgiving, Fourth of July, Mardi Gras / Carnavale, and St. Patrick's Day are not included. Rather, ten out of the sixteen are `moveable feasts' in that the menu is appropriate to just about any occasion. Some are limited by season such as `Outdoor Grill' and `Canoe Trip', but many are generic indoor excuses to have a good time, such as `Sunday Breakfast', `Pizza Party', and `Fireside Dinner'.<br />Unlike Stewart's book, there is really not much serious advice on how to organize for parties. Much of it is common sense plus clever ideas for special events, such as the idea to pack picnic portions in Chinese takeout cartons.<br />Garten has the advantage of claiming with full justification that her recipes are all specifically developed and test to work in a small party environment, as she has been in the catering business doing just this thing for many years. On reading her recipes and seeing many of them done on her Food Network TV show, I believe almost all of these recipes are simple and short in prep time, if not very cheap. The few recipes which take more than a page of large type are the baked goods. As Garten says herself, many are more a matter of `assembling' than they are of cooking.<br />Next to books from publishing house Alfred A. Knopf, cookbooks from Clarkson N. Potter have the most distinctive style. Where Knopf's books tend to follow the sedate style of Julia Child's classics, Potter's books for Stewart and Garten go for lots of large, glossy, very good photographs. Following the maxim that one eats with their eyes before their mouth, this may even help sell cookbooks with it's appeal to the visceral. Unfortunately, a rational look at the content versus the price suggests this book is a bit short on value. I will give Garten credit for referring to recipes in her earlier book rather than filling pages in this book with repeated recipes. I may be visually challenged, but photographs in cookbooks rarely create a positive impression and often create a negative impression if they are poorly done. In this book, I think they are a wash. They are too caught up in being artistic to give great value to the culinary, but they are not bad photos, so, they do nothing for my appreciation of the recipes.<br />At $35 list price for sixteen menus and about eighty new recipes, I say this is only a modest value for the cost. The tie-in to the TV show adds some value, but not much. I would recommend Sheila Lukins' book `Celebrate' as a serious resource for family gatherings. I already suggested Martha Stewart's book as a better source for larger events.<br />I recommend this book to any Ina Garten fans plus anyone who already has the other volumes recommended in this review, and simply needs more ideas. Professional caterers are an obvious choice. The book delivers the expected content in an attractive package. Nothing more.they are of cooking.<br />Next to books from publishing house Alfred A.

759311:US	39134375	R17OZ6JAGDE6LG	0688143563	119737053	Simply French: Patricia Wells Presents the Cuisine of Joel Robuchon	Books	5	58	60	N	N	Classic Addition to the Understanding of Fine Food	This third book by food journalist and teacher, Patricia Wells is a presentation of the Cuisine of Joel Robuchon, who is, next to Paul Bocuse, the best known French chef alive today. As Bocuse appears to have retired, the book touts Robuchon as the best working chef in France.<br />I am always suspicious of a book's quality when I can't find something new or remarkable to me in the first few pages. I had no such problems with this book. The depth of insight into fine cooking from Robuchon was easily equal to some of the best I have seen from Thomas Keller, Jeremiah Tower, and Richard Olney. Robuchon's contribution to the words `simple' and `French' together is an emphasis on a style of cooking which preserves and enhances the flavors of each individual ingredient rather than letting their properties be lost in a great gemish (that's German, not French) of indistinguishable flavors. Robuchon cites this as one of the great contributions of `nouvelle cuisine', although he claims that French cuisine has moved on from the excesses of this movement and now seems to be on more rational ground. He makes the remarkable observation that French cuisine before 1950 was intent on making food soft enough to satisfy a population with poor teeth. This is the reason for all the thick, smooth sauces and probably the reason why the braise is the most distinguishing method of French cooking. One may say that the braise is to French cuisine as stir frying is to Chinese cuisine.<br />This book is filled with little techniques that seem so unusual at first encounter. Given the least amount of thought, the methods become so obvious one cannot see why they (I) did not think of them ourselves. One example is in the preparation of a simple pastry crust (Pate Brisee). The problem is that no matter how closely I follow Martha Stewart's or Wayne Harley Brachman's or Nick Malgieri's instructions, I always seem to get some shrinkage of crust when I blind bake it in a tart pan. Robuchon's solution, which I have seen nowhere else, is to begin the blind baking BEFORE trimming of the excess dough around the edge of the crust. By baking with the overhang still on, the shrinkage will draw in some of the overhang to compensate for shrinkage in the pan. On the other hand, the recipe for Pate Brisee in general is not nearly as fussy as many other techniques when it comes to quickly working with cold butter. I will have to try this on my next crust.<br />There is no lack of truffles and foie gras in these recipes, although one of Patricia Wells' objectives in translating these recipes from the French restaurant kitchen to the American home is to remove as many of the hard to find and expensive ingredients as possible. My impression is that she has done a brilliant job of making the recipes accessible to the home cook. That is not to say that these recipes are easy. As Wells says on the first page of her essay on the cuisine of Robuchon, `good food is no accident', meaning that it takes work to achieve good food. She immediately says also that good food is not impossibly difficult.<br />The recipes in the book all seem to be classics. There is no evidence of fusion ingredients or techniques and there is little evidence of any other type of invention. The chapter contents are purely traditional, being: Salads, Warm First Courses, Cold First Courses, Fish and Shellfish, Poultry and Meats, Vegetables, Side Dishes, and Pasta, Desserts, Basic Recipes (Pantry), and Basic Pastry Recipes. The procedure description for many recipes is fairly long. For poultry, this may be simply because poultry techniques can be tricky. For many other dishes, it may be because the preparation of a vegetable garnish may be included with the preparation of the protein. In all cases, the recipes are a bit longer than most due to the extra attention to maintaining ingredients' integrity.<br />The recipe for the old standard Ratatouille is a perfect example of Robuchon's attention to detail and hisdevotion to bringing out the best in fine ingredients. One difference from conventional wisdom is that he does not draw moisture out of vegetables (disgorging) with salt, as he claims this makes the vegetable too soggy. Typical techniques that mark the gourmet dish are slicing vegetables to fine sticks and cooking vegetables separately to preserve their individual flavors.<br />The book contains several sidebars on general techniques. These notes are rich in explanations for why particular techniques are important. Each course includes a modest little wine suggestion. These will certainly be useful to anyone who uses this book as a resource for entertaining; however, making the most of these suggestions may require an exceptionally well-stocked  and knowledgeable wine merchant. Residents of Pennsylvania with our rather ill informed State Store clerks might have a problem with this.<br />This book is a `must have' source for anyone who wishes to improve their understanding of fine food preparation. It is a fine resource for anyone who is looking for small dinner party dishes. It is a fine companion to works by Julia Child, Richard Olney, and Elizabeth David. It is probably the next best thing to being able to read Robuchon's works in French. I am looking forward to seeing what Patricia Wells can do in her later books on less demanding subjects.<br />Very highly recommended.devotion to bringing out the best in fine ingredients.

Yan provides a foreword to the book where he also finds the objective and organization of the book to be its most attractive feature. He also applauds the wine and food pairings cited in the book, a very unusual feature for a cookbook for home and family. This material is done by Eric Little, a local wine expert rather than by the author herself. This can only improve the quality of the book, as wine expertise is a whole game unto itself and I applaud the author for calling in expert assistance. Since I have virtually no knowledge of wine, I will simply applaud the author's including the material and her use of an expert to cover wine. I will also note that the book's editor or layout designer did a great service by placing each wine tip on the margin to the left or right of the recipe where it could either be sought out or ignored with equal facility. Again, with no knowledge of wine myself, I find the wine tips singularly informative, much better than similar material in books by many a nationally known writer / chef.<br />Within each chapter, recipes are divided by traditional `Entrees', `Side Dishes', `Soups and Salads', `Desserts' plus special chapters where appropriate such as `Afternoon Tea' and `Halloween Treats'. The contents of these sections sometimes strays from concept like the case where a valuable page early in the book is taken up by a recipe for maitre d'hotel herb butter used in the preceeding recipe. Another example in the same section is a recipe for a marinara sauce. At the same time, some recipes cite a `to be served with' recipe such as spaetzle or noodles, yet no recipe for the dish appears in the book, or at least in the index to the book. On the other hand, the Index does appear to be especially friendly in assisting one to find a recipe. This is important in a book like this where similar recipes are spread out in several different chapters.<br />The recipes are well written, yet they are not for the novice cook. The book uses and does not explain many common cooking terms such as deglaze, consomme, bouquet garni, and dice. Cases like this often came up when I was developing software when something did not work quite as expected, the issue was whether this was a feature or a bug. In this case, I am more than willing to give the author the benefit of the doubt and say this is acturally a feature. Other books which include sections on culinary instruction tend to give just enough to appear to add value to the book, but not enough to work as a good text on techniques. These features just end up taking space away from the recipes.<br />I give this book four stars because it succeeds in it's objective and goes an extra step in making the book valuable with the addition of the wine pairings. It does not get five stars because its culinary content does not impress me as much as the volumes `The Way We Cook' by two Boston writers and `Celebrate' by Shiela Lukins.rved with' recipe such as spaetzle or noodles, yet no recipe for the dish appears in the book, or at least in the index to the book.

Works less well as a cookbook	`Simply Tuscan' is one of several books based on Tuscan cuisine by restaurateur / author Pino Luongo. While his latest book, `La Mia Cucina Toscana' is pointedly about dishes at his restaurants which are based on Tuscan dishes or at least ideas about Tuscan dishes, this book would appear to simply be about Tuscan dishes. If you read the fine print, however, you see that recipes in this book are also not authentically Tuscan. They are also not authentically Pino Luongo, as they are credited to the author's executive chef, Marta Pulini.<br />These little dissemblences can, of course, all be explained away, especially since this book is intended to be as much a memoir and invocation of life in Tuscany as it is a cookbook.<br />The best way to conjure up an image of the author's depiction of life in Tuscany is to see Hannibal Lector's lifestyle in Florence at the beginning of the movie `Hannibal'. Through skillfully placed photographs; watercolor paintings; pen and ink drawings on sepia colored, water streaked paper; and flip-flopping between an artistic, Arabic looking font and a crude Courier font, the book gives a rustic background to narrative on the pleasures of living in Tuscany. I have no doubt whatsoever that Tuscany is simply one of the more beautiful places on Earth. As the author points out, it is also one of the fountainheads of the Renaissance.<br />But if Tuscany is such an idyllic location, why did the author emigrate to the murky canyons of New York City. The author routinely travels back to Tuscany, however I suspect it is as much to mine a business resource as it is to be refreshed by the Tuscan sun. Part of the author's business organization is a shop of Tuscan merchandise in Rockafeller Center.<br />The book's culinary content is organized by season and, within season, by menu fitting various occasions. This enhances the flow of the book as memoir of Tuscan life, but it does not help those of us who wish to mine the book for authentic Tuscan recipes. The arty layout of recipes in crude Courier font intermixed with pictures with no captions compounds the difficulty to use this book as a culinary tool.<br />The culinary memoir which, in my experience, comes the closest to this book is Vincent Schiavelli's `Many Beautiful Things'. Schiavelli's book is immensely more successful as a memoir by being much more modest in its graphics and much more personal and informative in its narrative.<br />Luongo's book also has some odd inconsistencies in recipe weights and measures. In most cases, flour is measured by cup, but in some, it is measured by weight, with no explanation of the difference.<br />Luongo's book deserves a browse for the charming drawings. I would look elsewhere for sources of authentic, useable Tuscan recipes.The arty layout of recipes in crude Courier font intermixed with pictures with no captions compounds the difficulty to use this book as a culinary tool.<br />The culinary memoir which, in my experience, comes the closest to this book is Vincent Schiavelli's `Many Beautiful Things'.

When I embark on a review with this objective, I almost always find something. In this case, I did not.<br />This doesn't mean this is a bad book, only that it may not have that much to offer to someone who is already steeped in Italian culinary lore. It is inferior to, for example, David Downie's book on Roman cooking as a snapshot of an Italian regional cuisine. It is less genuine on a personal level than Mario Batali's `Simple Italian Food'. It is less of a cookbook than Lydia Bastianich's two books accompanying her PBS series on Italian food and Italian-American food. I will recommend this book as a source of classic Tuscan recipes over books by Pino Luongo, who clearly states that most of his recipes are original with him or his restaurant staff. They are not Tuscan; they are inspired by the Tuscan cuisine.<br />Part of the problem is that, unlike Lydia's books, this one has recipes in chapters which follow the episodes on the TV show rather than recipes organized by course as is typical of most Italian cookbooks. This awkwardness is not offset by a supplementary table of contents listing all recipes by food or by course.<br />Another part of the problem seems to be that unlike Mario's book, the experiences of Tuscan culture are all second hand. Most life experiences are not of the author but of the owner and employees at the Tuscan villa, Spannocchia, at which the PBS crew is housed. Ms. Espositio's experiences feel like a tourist's experiences.<br />One thing that impressed me about the creation of this book is the number of people it takes to put on a cooking show, even on PBS. There must be a dozen principle contributors at least in the Acknowledgments. In comparison, Julia Child started her show at the Boston PBS station with nothing more than her husband, a cameraman, a soundman, a producer, and herself.<br />I really wish I would have seen the PBS series on which the show is based, as I am sure that would have increased the value of the book for me by two or threefold. My experience with books by the `Frugal Gourmet', Jeff Smith show that books like this can be very attractive if you are not familiar with the wider world of cookbooks. Twelve (12) years ago, I thought Jeff Smith was something special. Now I know he was simply a decent communicator with a gimmick. I don't even think he was especially frugal. Since this book does accompany a TV show, I am really surprised at the dull photographs. The sepia coloring even seems to obscure some details in the picture.<br />There is no problem with the recipes in this book. Many classic Tuscan dishes are here and all of the recipes give competent instructions on how to prepare them.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who plans to travel in Tuscany anytime soon. The book has a strong travelogue flavor about it and its recommendations about where to eat in Tuscany are not doing anyone any good unless you go there. The price of the book rescues it from a below average rating. As I stated at the outset, the book provides what is expected and nothing more.

Hard to Beat that.	This book by Dr. Walter C. Willett is the second of two very good books on nutrition I am reviewing. The first was `Nourishing Traditions'. Both works have fairly impressive documentation for their claims from scientific literature. I just wish they would agree on all major points. The irony of the disagreement is that both appear to be railing against the same establishment that is based on endorsing a diet heavy in empty carbohydrates and demonizing fats.<br />Dr. Willett differs from Ms. Fallon and co-authors in his recommending as small as possible an intake of animal fats from butter, eggs, and meat. The basis of their difference lies in the effect of dietary intake of cholesterol (in contrast to cholesterol manufactured by the body) and in the nutritional value gained from both animal proteins and fats. Dr. Willet's position, backed up by the authority of the Harvard School of Public Health seems more in accord with today's conventional wisdom. Oddly enough, Ms. Fallon's principle demon is another Harvard professor pictured as being in the pay of major American food processors.<br />The two authors agree on most other things, especially in endorsing whole grains, mono-unsaturated oils, and fish for their omega-3 fatty acids. They also agree on the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet. Dr. Willett goes further to clarify this issue by pointing out that it is not enough to concentrate on any regionally based diet. The Mediterranean diet happens to be healthy due to the conjunction of olive culture, seafood, and grape culture. Those Italians and Greeks just lucked out, I guess. I can confirm this observation by mentioning that two ethnic American diets, the Gullah diet of the Carolina islands and the Pennsylvania Dutch diet appear to be particularly unhealthy due to the high concentration of animal fat, butter, processed flour, and processed sugar in these diets.<br />While I have an enormous respect for Ms. Fallon's book and I would probably adopt it's recommendations wholeheartedly if I lived alone, the recommendations in Dr. Willett's book appear to be more conservative and easier to follow. Given the great complexity of any reasonable model for human nutrition, in a world of less than perfect knowledge, the simpler course certainly seems to be the more preferable. Happily, both authors agree that one secret to good nutrition is variety. While Willett doesn't say this in so many words, he comes close to characterizing the great American meal of red meat and potatoes as a step removed from poison.<br />Willet's great adversary is the US Department of Agriculture's food pyramid that he says, quite correctly, I believe, is simply wrong. The three greatest sins are:<br />Placing carbohydrates at the broad base of the pyramid with no distinction between valuable whole grains and nutritionally empty processed wheat and sugar.<br />Placing oils at the top of the pyramid with no distinction between harmful fats and healthy olive oil, fish oils, and other healthy lipids.<br />Placing potatoes, another source of empty carbohydrates in the large stage near the bottom with other, much more healthy vegetables.<br />The scariest thing about processed carbohydrates is not only do they provide no value, they actually steal things from your body and create dangerous situations. The author balances this warning with a wealth of information on alternate grains, starting with whole wheat and covering the entire repetoire of ancient grains such as spelt, millet, quinoa, flaxseed, and buckwheat.<br />In place of the USDA pyramid, Willett and allies create a new pyramid correcting these errors. It also adds a strong recommendation for exercise, an endorsement of a multivitamin, and a confirmation of the beneficial properties of small amounts of alcohol, primarily red wines. More of that Mediterranean thing!<br />As someone who has always been fond of both bread and pasta, my biggest puzzle over these recommendations is that how can, for example, the southern Italian diet be seen as being so healthy when it is literally loaded with these two sources of carbohydrates. I suspect the answer lies very much with portion size and the wisdom of several courses spread out over a longer time at the table than most Americans seem to afford.<br />Please read this book and consider its recommendations very carefully. I suspect some of these recommendations will change as science moves on and I hope the prospects for animal fats improve. But meanwhile, this is as good as it gets for recommendations on nutrition.le, the southern Italian diet be seen as being so healthy when it is literally loaded with these two sources of carbohydrates.

Wonderful	This book by Sally Fallon (with Mary Enig, Ph.D.) is an inspiring polemic against both commercial, prepared food trends and some governmental and research leaders who appear to be making recommendations on nutrition under the influence of commercial interests.<br />My first impression of the book is that it shows exactly how hard nutritional science actually is. The authors are citing hundreds of technical works from both demographic and controlled experiment studies regarding thousands of different food components in their way to painting a complete picture of good nutrition. Their starting point in painting this picture is the common sense assumption that historical, natural diets are invariably more healthy than those laden with commercially processed foods. This assumption is backed up by demographic research done in the first third of the last century. This is the import of the `traditions' in the title.<br />It turns out that the potential allies of the authors' approach come from such different quarters as the Atkins diet advocates who endorse eating meat, eggs, and other proteins in preference to (processed) carbohydrates and the `Raw Food' wing of the vegetarian / vegan movement. The latter camp would wholeheartedly endorse the authors' issues with eating foods that retain their original enzymes to aid in digestion. I'm sure the vegans and the Atkins camp will not join forces any time soon, but their appearance in the same metaphorical room on the side of the authors' position is another indication of how multi-sided complex scientific theories can become.<br />I have no facts to confirm or challenge the authors' claim of corruption on the part of some academics in endorsing a nutritional position to back commercial interests. I will only say that it is irrelevant to the central tenant of the book, which in very simple terms is `Eat the way your great grandparents ate'. Some of the more important details are:<br />1. Avoid processed fats, starches, sugars, and proteins. They are not of no value. They are unhealthy.<br />2. Eat animal protein and their accompanying fats.<br />3. Eat whole grain products.<br />4. Eat foods prepared in such a way that avoids loosing important nutrients.<br />Almost all of the authors' statements on individual nutritional facts are backed up by published scientific research. One or two or even ten percent of their references may be flawed, but the overall weight of their evidence is truly impressive. The only problem I find in their characterization of the way things are today is in not giving full credit to medical science in lengthening our lifespans through the suppression of infectious diseases. This is likely to be the reason behind the increase in the frequency of deaths by degenerative diseases like cancer and heart disease, not a catastrophic loss of nutritional value in our diets. That is not to say their claims about the drop in the quality of our diet are not true. Always remember that these gals are making a case, they are not simply publishing scientific results.<br />While I think the authors have a strong case against processed foods, I find it difficult to fully endorse their next step. Their solution takes us close to the land of food extremists such as both traditional vegetarians and the more radical proponents of `raw' diets. What this means is that they raise up foods which are hard to find or difficult to prepare or are prepared in ways unfamiliar to American kitchens. This may not necessarily be a bad thing. It tends to appeal to my `Whole Earth Catalog' mentality of the home-brew lifestyle. But this lifestyle is simply not practical for the millions who work long, stressful hours followed by time devoted to kids and spouses.<br />My skepticism regarding their solutions is reinforced by some culinary misstatements such as the suggestion to refrigerate tomatoes after they ripen, to not add garlic to hot fat, and that artisinal breads are not good for sandwiches. Thesecond and third statements are refuted daily by traditional Italian cooking practice. Their condemnation of all aluminum cookware and the microwave also seem more extreme than they need be.<br />What I take from this work is the very cautious and undramatic conclusion that the safest (and most interesting) culinary path lies in the study and emulation of historical diets. This gives a strong theoretical underpinning to my admiration of educators such as Mario Batali and Paula Wolfert who examine and promote historical cuisines based on the `what grows together, goes together'. This could easily be a subtitle of this book. It also gives support to practitioners such as Rachael Ray who promote fast cooking without resorting to overly processed ingredients.<br />I love a book that pulls together and validates a wide range of (my) opinions. While this book may not always be right, it is supremely valuable in its provocation to thinking. It is also supremely valuable in it's demonstrating the value of some less common foods such as sauerkraut, cr&egrave;me fraiche, and kim chee. This value doubles in that it actually tells you how to make this stuff. Lest it be overlooked, it is important to note that the lions share of the book is a fairly large cookbook of recipes with methods and materials that follow the book's doctrines.<br />At a list price of $25, the catalogue of vegetables chapter alone is almost worth the price of admission. I'm happy that here, the authors part company with both the advocates of `raw' and the old Adele Davis doctrine of saving veggie cooking water. They reinforce again the conventional wisdom of old school culinary practice which rarely leaves veggies raw. Some raw vegetables contain some bad things and cooking almost always makes the good things more available to digestion.<br />I recommend this book to everyone as the very next book you need to buy about food.and third statements are refuted daily by traditional Italian cooking practice.

This very small (75 pages of recipes) cookbook warrants a fair evaluation because of its very low list price (about 10 dollars). Without that feature, one would not think twice about getting such a small book on such a large subject as Italian Cooking.<br />Weighed against my standard for evaluating cookbooks, this gets only three stars because it does almost exactly what you would expect from a book this size. Even there, I may be giving it a few free points, as my experience with thin, oversize books is that they are heavy on good graphics and clever summaries of their subject. This book has neither.<br />The book is simply a collection of approximately 120 recipes organized in haphazard fashion. The chapters are:<br />Antipasti<br />Pasta<br />Pizza<br />Rice and Gnocchi<br />Meat<br />Fish<br />Vegetables and Sauces<br />Desserts<br />Cakes and Breads<br />One oddity is that pizza is typically treated as bread in most books. Another is that gnocchi are more commonly treated with pasta than it is with rice. Given the reverence and importance Italians give to vegetables, it is unusual to lump it together with sauces, another subject worthy of its own chapter. It is also odd that the antipasti chapter includes both soups and salads.<br />Each recipe includes a headnote. These are generally accurate, but at least two contain errors of fact. That raises the question of how many others may be mistaken or misleading.<br />Many of the recipes are odd for a book like this, or just odd. As this is a `Best of' recipe book, one would expect the best available recipes, yet the recipe for Tagliatelle Bolognese is a simplified version of the classic. Not what I want from a `Best of'  book. Another recipe with eggplant asks for a small eggplant, chopped, in the ingredients list. Then, in the preparation, it asks us to dice the eggplant. They provide no insight into how to dice a chopped eggplant.<br />Another annoyance is that some recipe titles are in English and some are in Italian and some are a mix of both. As every good book on Italian Cooking I have read manages to give Italian names for all their recipes, with an English translation, I find no excuse for this.<br />None of these annoyances are big in themselves, but they all add up to a picture of a shoddy job. With so many good books on Italian cooking available by Bastianich and Bugialli and Hazan and Caggiano and a dozen others, why bother with this one.

A Good Read	Having been born and raised on the fringes of the Pennsylvania Dutch heartland in Lancaster County, and having grandparents who were close enough to the Pennsylvania Dutch lifestyle as to consider myself half `Dutch', this book deals with a subject very, very close to home for me.<br />The most important thing for a prospective reader to know about this book is that it is as much, if not more so a book of Recollections than it is a book of Recipes. In fact, one will get much more from this book if they approach it as they would Jacques Pepin's book `The Apprentice' rather than as they would a book of Pennsylvania Dutch recipes by Betty Groff or Mary Showalter.<br />The book most similar to this that I have read recently is Sallie Ann Robinson's `Gullah Home Cooking the Daufuskie Way'. Both books describe a subsistence farming way of life, with recipes that reflect that fact. In reviewing Robinson's book, I thought it was unlikely I would ever actually make any of the recipes in the book. The very same thing is true of the recipes by Elizabeth Coblentz. That is not because I don't like Pennsylvania Dutch cooking. I like it as well or better than Southern cooking or Spanish cooking or Irish cooking. Coblentz' recipes are pictures of how an Old Order Amish family lives. As such, they contain a lot of surprises for us `English'. On the one hand, when a recipe calls for mayonnaise, it specifies homemade mayonnaise. No surprise there. But, on the next page is a recipe that calls for a can of condensed cream of mushroom soup and American cheese.<br />Equally surprising is the use of margarine. Not surprising is the large amounts of white bread, bacon, potatoes, lard, processed cheeses, butter, and sugar in the recipes. Missing are recipes with oysters, recipes for chow-chow, and recipes for corn pie. All this means is that the book is about the Amish and how they actually eat and live. It is not especially about providing you, dear reader with yet another recipe for Snickerdoodles.<br />The real reward from this book is in the stories of life in this Amish family. These people seem to be immensely wealthy with the riches that come from a very large, closely-knit family. Ben and Elizabeth Coblentz have eight children and, at the time the book was written, 33 grandchildren. Their daily life begins at 4:00 AM and that is accepted as a matter of course. They don't even have alarm clocks. That is just the time they naturally get up.<br />Many Amish are no longer full time farmers. Several family members work at trades or in local factories because of rising land prices and falling farm produce prices. This leads to some odd twists in customs designed to keep technology at arm's length. But, it does not seem like hypocrisy, as the heart of the matter is that regardless of how close technology comes to their life outside the home, it is always kept outside the home.<br />Much of the book is facsimile copies of Ms. Coblentz' columns published in some 90 newspapers around the country. Ms. Coblentz' sentence structure and choice of words in these columns is worth the price of admission. Sometimes it sounds like it is coming straight from the 16th or 17th century. Other times it is as drolly modern as you would not expect from an Amish pen. That must be the influence of the Bic ballpoint Elizabeth uses to handwrite each column.<br />The book also contains many sidebars on various phases of Amish life. All are informative. Most are surprising to those with a conventional picture of the Amish.<br />The story of how the co-author, Kevin Williams, enlisted Ms. Coblentz to do this column and how he managed to sell the column and create this book are nifty stories too. This is all genuine stuff.<br />The photographs are all skillfully taken, however, many photographs of cooking tableau are obviously staged. The remaining photographs are of farm buildings, hanging laundry, birdhouses, and growing crops, all under a bright blue sky. The Amish do not allow themselves to be photographed.<br />Shirley Corriher gets it exactly right in her blurb on the dustjacket when she says `This is a beautiful and moving book that you will remember for more than just down-to-earth recipes'. Put this book next to your Showalter volumes and read it to warm your insides with words.<br />Recommended.

They were as good or better than I have seen from recipes in other books.<br />I would still warn the reader that `Best' is a very loaded term which means different things to different chefs. See my earlier review for the details. Meanwhile, go buy this book. It is an excellent addition to a cookbook library.	2004-02-24
772033:US	39134375	R25K6OIHEPET0H	0471323675	254390296	Garde Manger: The Art and Craft of the Cold Kitchen	Books	5	59	72	N	N	Encyclopedic Authority on Cold Food Prep and Service	One could compare this book, `Garde Manger' by the Culinary Institute of America to Martha Stewart's `Entertaining' like a comparison of Richard Feynman's Lectures on Physics to a popular history of 20th century physics. Unfortunately, that comparison does not hold up. The more appropriate comparison would be between a technical work on wood joinery to a glossy `This Old House' imprimatur book on cabinet making. The difference between the classroom and the home kitchen is simply not that large. One can even bend the simile around on itself to say that the laboratory in which new culinary thoughts arise is in the home kitchen and not in the teaching classrooms of the Culinary Institute of America.<br />All this playing with comparisons is simply meant to make the point that while this book is presented as a textbook by the most prestigious culinary training institution in the country, it's material is simply not that different from a book with more obviously commercial origins.<br />This book does have a lot of material you will not find in a Martha Stewart or Ina Garten or Paula Deen book. High on the list of interesting background information is the history of how the French Revolution may have been a major contributor to the rise of restaurants and the great strength and variety in French cuisine.<br />The real story here is cold food and how it is prepared and served in (French) restaurants. On this subject, this book is a delightful source of both recipes and Alton Brown / Shirley Corriher type background. Honestly, the true culinary counterpart to Feynman's lectures would be Harold McGee's oft quoted books on food science.<br />This CIA book gives a wealth of recipes for salad dressings and other cold sauces, cold salads, sandwiches, cured and smoked foods, sausage, forcemeats, cheese, hors d'oeuvres, appetizers, condiments, and basic recipes (spice mixes and the like). One thing that immediately endeared me to the book is its treatment of vinaigrettes, which easily outdoes even Martha Stewart's better than average treatment. This material is worth the price of admission. Another service it supplies, with the authority of a teaching institution, is to simplify some culinary terms. For example, it always bedeviled me to know the difference between, for example, a relish, a salsa, and a chutney. Turns out that they simply are three different words for the same basic preparation. Like `plains', `veldt', and `pampas', they are different words for the same thing reflecting three different ethnic sources.<br />The chapters on curing and sausage may interest fewer readers than most, but there is much you can get from these chapters even if you never make a sausage. I was particularly struck by the fact that government regulations require that pork used in sausage making be `certified'. That's a little fact that people like Emeril and even Alton leave out of their little how to shows on sausage making. As a great believer in serendipity, I believe you never can tell what inspiration you can get from unfamiliar material.  Here lies the greatest value to this book. It tells you a lot of the things which more popular treatments of the same subject can easily overlook. This includes things like sanitation, shelf life, and equipment care. As an aging hippie whose fantasies were fueled by the `Whole Earth Catalogue', I find the chapter on cheeses to be worth a month's run of `Good Eats' shows.<br />One can say that this book is really meant for the restaurant professional, but I believe it has many uses for the home cook. The most important use is as a resource for making pantry items like prepared catsup, mustard, relish, crackers, spice mixes, salad dressings, and stocks which one may typically buy at the supermarket. If you put your mind to it, you will certainly attain a better tasting product. What may be more important is that you will also certainly attain a better tasting product with no laboratory chemical ingredients.<br />For the real foodie, this book is a treasure. It gives recipes for lots of things few other books take the trouble to cover. The danger to the newbie is that they may not see those points at which the book's coverage is not complete. One area is in the recipes for stocks. These recipes are `bare bones' instructions with none of the usual cautions and explanations given in some other books. If you are really serious about stock making, consult `Jeremiah Tower Cooks' or Judy Rodgers's `The Zuni Caf&eacute; Cookbook' or even the CIA's `New Professional Chef' text. One can excuse this somewhat since these are hot preparations in a book about cold food. I would have preferred a reference to a work that gave the subject a more complete coverage.<br />One irritating thing I find in some reviews is a complaint about something which is outside stated range of the book. This book is about cold food. Do not expect details on baking or hot cuisine. Any material on those matters should be taken as a convenience to the reader.<br />I was a bit surprised to find at least one typo in this textbook by a respected school, published by textbook specialist Wiley. I found no errors that will mislead the home cook.<br />The book has several features I consider essential in a textbook. One is an bibliography. Another is a list of sources. Another is a glossary of terms. Another, very important, is an index of recipes.<br />This book is excellent if you are building a culinary library or do a lot of entertaining or are especially fond of salads and sandwiches, or simply like to read about food. The only reservation an interested reader may have is the price. The $60 list price inhibited me for several months, but I believe the book is worth it if you do any entertaining or make any quick cold lunches in your kitchen.

773658:US	39134375	R2Y50HWP812LYT	0684813483	911059235	The Pie and Pastry Bible	Books	5	51	58	N	N	A True Baking Treasure. Very Professional.	One would expect such an authoritative volume on baking to come from a chunky Frenchman with a very tall toque and an accent you can cut with a pastry knife, not from the ever so sweet and coy face smiling at you from the back of the dust jacket of this very large book on a very serious subject. But, this book from this author should be no surprise at all, as it is the middle volume on a trilogy that does for baking what Tolkein did for epic fantasy in `Lord of the Rings'.<br />Before I even start to talk about the virtues of the book, just consider the difference in content you are receiving from Rose Levy Beranbaum's three books when compared to Ina Garten's three cookbooks. For a 30% addition to the price, Beranbaum is giving you approximately 300% more information. Another comparison is to compare Beranbaum's 2000 pages with the very authoritative sounding `King Arthur Flour Baker's Companion' weighing in at a mere 607 pages. That is just to put these works in perspective.<br />To most newbies, cooking may seem relatively easy, but one glimpse at what you need to make a decent pie crust has most novices running to the megamart refrigerated cases for those premade Pillsbury pie crusts. First, you have to pick the right ingredients. Can I use all-purpose flour or should I use pastry flour. Can I use King Arthur or should I use White Lily? Should I use butter or vegetable shortening or lard? Should I add vinegar or not? Should I add an egg yolk or not? Then, you have to be concerned about the weather. Is the barometer rising or falling? Is the air humid or dry? Then comes the technique. Do I use a pastry cutter or do I use my hands? How long do I work the flour and fat before adding the liquid? How much do I work it after adding the liquid? How long do I rest it before rolling it out? How do I lay the crust in the pan to avoid shrinking? What kind of pan do I use to bake the pie? Do I blind bake the crust for this pie? How long do I bake? What do I look for to know the bottom crust is done?<br />I'm exaggerating a little because many of these variables are usually well enough in control that they don't ruin a pie. But, every variable offers a way for things to go wrong. Now, millions of people, myself included, have successfully made good pie crusts without having read Ms. Beranbaum's book, but millions of people, myself included, have made pie crusts which just didn't make the grade. Rose Levy Beranbaum tells you why, and gives you all the information you need to avoid each and every problem.<br />One of the very few problems I find with Ms. Beranbaum's work is that there is so much information, it is difficult to whip out a simple recipe or find the solution to a simple problem without literally studying the information for some time. But, the only thing that means is that this book, however good, may not be for everyone. For the casual baker of pies, I strongly recommend Wayne Harley Brachman's `American Desserts'.<br />Ms. Beranbaum's book is for the serious baker and for people who really like to read about baking in order to troll for ideas and projects. The depth of information exceeds virtually every other work I have seen so far. Where other books give you measurements by both weight and volume, Ms. Beranbaum gives you measurements in both Metric and English system units. Where others recommend a fat to use, Ms. Beranbaum explains why the fat of choice should be used and how to make intelligent substitutions with various kinds of ingredients. While I have not yet read Shirley Corriher's book `Cookwise', Rose gives me the same kind of intimate knowledge of my ingredients and techniques as I would expect from Shirley. Rose even quotes Shirley's recipe for Southern biscuits as the model recipe for same.<br />Speaking of biscuits, if I were to write a tutorial on pastry making, I would probably start with biscuits. As Beranbaum points out, the techniques and results when making biscuits stand you almost exactly halfway between pastry crusts and cake making. I would add that it also puts you very close to the bread baking world, with a product where the time between cracking open the flour canister and pulling the finished product out of the oven can be less than 30 minutes. This makes biscuit baking a perfect intro. to baking in general. Needless to say, Ms. Beranbaum covers biscuits with her usual thoroughness.<br />I would very strongly recommend this and all of Ms. Beranbaum's books on baking as a perfect second book on their respective subjects. As a first book, get `Baking with Julia' and follow the directions with the diligence of a Viennese pastry master. Very highly recommend to those in love with baking. How can you possibly resist so sweet a smile on Ms. Beranbaum's face as she kneads her dough on the dust jacket?between pastry crusts and cake making.

Please Buy	I happened to pick this book up while needing something to read on a traveling layover. I instantly recognized the name of the author and the size of the volume promised to add little to the weight of my baggage, so I chose it over the hundreds of other cookbooks at the out of town Barnes and Noble I happened to find in my travels.<br />In the back of my mind was the opinion that this was an exercise in exploitation of the actor's fame in movies and on the stage. Although Vincent Schiavelli has had relatively minor roles, they were in some major films such as `Amadeus' and `One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' and a major TV show, `Taxi'. The blurbs on the back cover from Martin Scorsese and Danny DeVito did nothing to change this prejudice. But here was also a blurb from Alice Waters. Not exactly your typical show business paison. Rather, a culinary heavyweight of the first Water (sic). The watercolor painting on the cover also enchanted me. Not exactly the sort of thing used by Patti LaBelle or Al Roker on their tie-in culinary efforts.<br />The first thing which gave the lie to my prejudice was the fact that the bio at the inside bottom of the dust jacket briefly mentions that Schiavelli is an actor and goes on to focus more on the fact that this is the fifth book he has written, all apparently on Sicilian / culinary topics.<br />This book is very much about both food and Sicily, specifically a small hilltop town in north central Sicily named Polizzi Generosa. The book opens with the story of the town's rather odd name. The town was founded in Roman times and the full name came to be in the thirteenth century. Read the book for all the spicy details. The relevance of the town to the author is that Schiavelli's family came from this town and some distant relatives still live there.<br />It took less than two pages to be hooked on the story in the book that provides a framework for the recipes. I often judge cookbooks by how interested I am in making the recipes after reading them. A comparable `gut level' criterion for non-cookbooks is how interested I am in reading other books by the same author. Schiavelli made me very interested in reading his earlier books. Unlike most other culinary memoir writers, Schiavelli also succeeded in my wanting to make the recipes in his book. Most of the recipes are absurdly simple and certainly inexpensive to make. The potato gratin recipe, for example, has immediately become my recipe of choice for this dish, avoiding all the headaches of dealing with curdling dairy products by replacing it with olive oil. This is Sicily, after all.<br />Not leaving things at that, Schiavelli adds significant value to the book by including a supplementary table of contents which list all recipes by category, since the primary table of contents is ordered more to events in the author's visits to Polizzi Generosa than to things culinary. The categories are Antipasti, First Courses (usually pasta), Second Courses (usually protein), One Course Meals (pastas with hearty ragu, for example), Side Dishes (conturni), desserts, and liquers.<br />The book is a true gem at a list price of $27. Given a reasonable discount, the book is a real treat. Highly recommended.reading them.

775425:US	39134375	R321IFDS4YHTC9	0881505811	832266075	The King Arthur Flour Baker's Companion: The All-Purpose Baking Cookbook A James Beard Award Winner (King Arthur Flour Cookbooks)	Books	5	175	181	N	N	The First Baking Book You Should Buy	This volume, subtitled the `All Purpose Baking Cookbook' perfectly fits the criteria I typically apply to a book in order to decide if I want to give it five stars. A book gets three stars if it meets my expectations. A book gets four stars if it meets my expectations in a very successful way. Typically, that means that it has few or no detected mistakes. A book gets five stars if it exceeds my expectations. This book certainly exceeded my expectations.<br />What I anticipated when I opened this book was a dry, technical work steeped in discussions of the effects of gluten and altitude and humidity on bread making, similar to some of the more detailed parts of better books on bread baking. All of these discussions are here, plus others on the finer points of measuring flour and types of flour, but with a difference.<br />The biggest surprise in the book was the light, personal touch of the writing. It all has the tone you may expect in a very good book on regional cooking. And, lo and behold, there is a hint of regionality and local tradition in the selection of materials in the book. In spite of the fact that King Arthur products are available throughout the country (unlike White Lily, for example), the book retains a very New England tone to it's selection of recipes. One prominent example is in the recipe for biscuits, where it advises all experienced Southern biscuit makers to simply skip that page, as since `we don't want to shock you with the way we make biscuits up north'.<br />That doesn't mean the book does not touch on every subject you may expect it to cover. As I said in my opening paragraph, it easily covers much more than what I expected. The very first chapter dealing with breakfast foods covers material not commonly covered in conventional baking surveys. Pancakes, waffles, crepes, French toast and their allies are not covered in either of my favorite general baking books (Julia Child's `Baking With Julia' and Nick Malgieri's `How to Bake'). If that were not enough, it presents recipes in such a way that you can prepare baking mixtures ahead to much the same effect as if you were laying in a supply of Bisquik. One of the secrets is in the use of dried buttermilk. I have seen this product in my local megamart, but have not until now had a clue as to how to use it.<br />The homey, comfortable feeling of the book extends to even that most difficult subject of breads made with wild yeasts (Sourdough, Pain au Levain). The book does not cover every different type of artisinal bread you may find in such books as Carol Field's `The Italian Baker' for instance, and it does not cover such important French specialties as brioche as deeply as Rose Levy Beranbaum's `The Bread Bible', but it does cover them, and so much else as well. Another contributor to the warm feel of the book is the layout. Pages are airy with well positioned sidebars, titles, and tables. Technical information is always at the same place, accessible, but unobstrusive to the browser.<br />In the long run, the greatest value of the book is in it's encyclopediac coverage of just about every kind of baking you can do, extending the definition of baking to things outside the oven to include the griddle (pancakes, crepes, etc) and the deep fryer (doughnuts, beignets, etc). In fact, just about the only product made with wheat flour which this book does not cover is pasta, although it comes very close in it's chapter on dumplings.<br />The more technical aspects of the book are quite up to snuff in spite of the warmth of the presentation. Where appropriate, all measurements are given by both weight and volume. The importance of measuring by weight is also discussed in detail at the beginning of the book. The book also includes a nutritional analysis of each and every recipe, giving portion size, calories, fat, protein, complex carbohydrates, dietary fiber, sodium, potassium, vitamin A, iron, calcium, and phosphorus. I'm impressed. I confess that it is slightlyeasier for this book to provide this as they can make the very safe assumption that it is their brand of flour which is being used.<br />The sixty pages on ingredients at the end of the book are easily worth the price of admission all by itself. It is no surprise that it gives a deep discussion of wheat and flour. What is surprising is that it also gives fairly detailed discussions of other products used in baking such as milk products, eggs, fats, sugars, fat substitutes, and sugar substitutes.<br />The very nice section on baking tools is an equally valuable resource. In one page the book gives you everything you may see in a much larger three page article in `Cooks Illustrated'. I am really amazed at the value you get for a list price of $35 for this book. Just consider a comparison to an Ina Garten book 1/3 as long with much less authoritative information for the same price. Amazing.<br />I am not at all surprised to see an endorsing blurb on the back cover from Alton Brown. I strongly suspect that he will be cribbing material from this book for one or more `Good Eats' shows, if he has not already. The only thing I find missing in the whole book is a decent bibliography. This type of encyclopedic reference really deserves one.<br />This will easily be my new `go to' book for baking. I will not give up the recipes I have come to love from other sources and I will probably still consult other sources for artisnal bread recipes, but I will definitely come to this book first for any new baking task I have in mind. I will not expect every single recipe to be perfect, but I will consider everything I find here with respect.

Many Leftovers	This is Ina Garten's third cookbook. It leaves the caterer's shop and party platter to concentrate on meals, which do well made at home.<br />One of the first things I sense is that there is little difference in the style of menu in this book than there is in the first two. The second and more revealing aspect of this book is the degree to which it is visiting old material rather than trying to present something new.<br />There are three signs of this tendency in the book. The first is the number of references to sources of recipes in both classic cookbooks such as Julia Child's `Mastering the Art of French Cooking' and recent, well known cookbooks such as Danny Meyer and Michael Romano's `Union Square Caf&eacute; Cookbook'. Other cookbooks are quoted as well. The second is the appearance of patently classic recipes, which have appeared in many other books. Two of the most common are a recipe for a Caprese Salad (Tomato, Basil, and Mozzarela) and roasted leg of lamb. Repeating classic recipes like this becomes more of an issue in a book of this size (88 recipes) and price ($35 list). This book has very little new in the way of basic recipes to offer a person who already owns ten (10) cookbooks, let alone someone who owns over 200. The third is the number of recipes for relatively simple staple items which have the feel of being added to bulk up the page count. These are chicken stock, croutons, iced tea, mashed potatoes, and saut&eacute;ed carrots. To be sure, each of these has some twist to offer, but that twist is a bit expensive at over $.40 per recipe. Especially given the fact that many of these recipes have appeared on Ina's Food Network show and are therefore available on the Internet on the Food Network web site for free.<br />There is an up side to this book, especially for people with few cookbooks and little time to watch the Food Network.<br />First, as with the earlier books, these recipes are typically easy to make with virtually no expensive or difficult to find ingredients.<br />Second, the book has a recipe index, something that every cookbook should have.<br />Third, the book has a healthy number of breakfast food recipes. This would seem to be the main feature which sets it apart from the other two books and which places it `in the home'.<br />Fourth, a large percentage of recipes are for desserts. If one has no interest in having a dessert book laying around, this book will put you in good stead with recipes for some classics like key lime pie and angel food cake plus some very good special event desserts such as an American Flag cake. If you want the read deal on desserts, I strongly recommend Wayne Harley Brachman's latest book, `American Desserts'.<br />Ina Garten' three books together will run you over $100 list price. For less than $20, you could get an excellent general purpose cookbook such as `The Joy of Cooking' or `James Beard's American Cookery' with over 1000 recipes. The extra tariff buys you the cachet of recipes from a well-known culinary celebrity who should know what she is doing to keep things both simple and economical in the kitchen. You also get full page, average or less than average quality photographs of all recipes and chatty commentary on the recipes from Ms. Garten.<br />Basically, Ina is simply running out of original material, just like her Food Network colleague Paula Deen, whose second cookbook also had a lot of filler. The difference is in the relative price Ms. Garten and Ms. Deen are charging for leftovers.<br />Again, this is a good book if you simply do not own other cookbooks and you can get it at a good discount. For the rest of us, I give it only four stars so you think twice before buying the name, again.ingredients.<BR>Second, the book has a recipe index, something that every cookbook should have.<BR>Third, the book has a healthy number of breakfast food recipes.

777862:US	39134375	R3R6EWSVI0QZ70	0609602195	362558610	The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook	Books	5	12	16	N	Y	Careful selection of durable recipes. Good first cookbook	This first cookbook by Ina Garten, the founder and once owner of the Long Island catering and upscale deli, `barefoot contessa' is a delightful cross between the high end Martha Stewart `Entertaining' and the very local and very Southern `The Lady and Sons' by Paula Deen. By delightful coincidence, all three have shows on the food network. This book shines by being more accessible than Martha Stewart's work for large scale entertaining and by being more selective in its recipes than Paula Deen's books. Deen and Stewart's works both have their virtues, but Garten shines in making the best of its particular strengths.<br />Both Stewart and Garten claim Julia Child as a culinary godmother, and both do us a service by making Child's style of food easier to make for the non-foodie.<br />The greatest value of Garten's selection of dishes and her recipes for same are that they were all prepared at `the barefoot contessa', so there is no question that the recipes work. This claim is boldly made on the dust jacket. I will add the opinion that since the dishes were a staple of Garten's store and catering business, they were popular with a fairly discriminating clientele. Having seen pictures on Garten's TV show of `the barefoot contessa', I can see the store's customers probably had pretty high expectations of their food purveyors.<br />I can back this observation up by the opinion that I find almost all of Garten's recipes very appealing, reasonably healthy, and reasonably easy to make. This is so true that I expect this will become my first choice book when I simply do not know what I want to make, and do not want to spend a lot of time, or at least a lot of effort in the preparation.<br />That said, I have to recommend this book as both an excellent first cookbook and an excellent resource for entertaining. By being restaurant and catering recipes, most recipes have the added virtue of being able to remain appetizing after 8 hours in a chilled display case.

780820:US	39134375	R95LEHU10NLQG	0060535679	767956835	SuperFoods Rx: Fourteen Foods That Will Change Your Life	Books	5	284	307	N	Y	Good for what ails you, and tasty too	This excellent new book by medical doctor Steven Pratt pulls together a lot of recent nutritional research in an easily digestible format by focusing on the fourteen most healthy foods, the foods which can be grouped with these fourteen to provide variety, and some basic methods for preparing these foods.<br />This is a presentation to the layman of scientific results. By it's nature, this leads to simplifications and potentially misleading statements. My biggest concern with any book of this type is that it is overstating its case. There is no question in my mind that eating these 14 foods (and avoiding worthless foods) will improve your health. The book is very careful in not quantifying potential gains, but it does come dangerously close to making medically unfounded statements. One I detected is the suggestion that eating cholesterol-reducing foods such as oats and cabbage family vegetables will remove the need for drugs to reduce cholesterol. When I posed a similar question to my physician, he kept to the medically sound albeit very conservative line that the tendency of the body to produce cholesterol is genetic and keeping cholesterol within safe levels for me requires medication, probably for the rest of my life. This is a case study of why books like this tend to overstate their cases. Response to improvements in diet is determined by one's genetic makeup. What works for some may not work for others. The bottom line for the skeptic's view of this book is to take all the statements on benefits from these foods with a grain of salt. They may be right for you, and they may not.<br />Having made the skeptic's case for this book, I turn to the advocate's case. The advantages of the book's simplifications is that you can cruise your megamart with these fourteen (14) foods at the top of your list and focus on those products which are on the list or are allied to the items on the list. While I am not a clinical scientist, I am an informed layman, having developed information systems for medical professionals for 35 years. With those credentials, I believe that eating these foods will, in the long run, be better for your health than not eating them.<br />One of the best aspects of this book is the list of `sidekicks' to each of these fourteen foodstuffs. Having been a big fan of green vegetables from way back, the list of sidekicks to broccoli is positively erotic, including my favorite Brussels sprouts, cabbage, turnips, and Swiss chard. The only food without a sidekick is tea. Sorry, coffee doesn't make the list. Another favorite sidekick is peanuts. Nuts are on the list, but peanuts actually makes the list because it's a legume, like beans, and not a nut. A little misdirection there.<br />The best thing about this list is that, to my mind, only three of these foods (oats, soy, and yogurt) are uninteresting. I personally find all the others to be range from being pleasant (broccoli, salmon, spinach, pumpkin, tomatoes, beans, and turkey) to being positively delightful (blueberries, oranges, tea, turkey, and walnuts). One great thing about the tasty foods such as blueberries and walnuts is that they can brighten up the taste of the bland stuff (oats and yogurt especially).<br />With the warning that I am neither a medical nor a nutritional professional, I believe this book tends to raise questions about the currently very popular low carbohydrate diet doctrines. I say this not because many of the foods on this list are high on the devil's list of low carb advocates, but that high carbohydrate foodstuffs are often the best of mates to some of these foods. Two famous pairings are beans and rice and berry jam and bread.<br />The book contains a very nice section of recipes by a very talented and recognized spa chef. They are all very tasty looking and the notes to the recipes contain a lot of hints, such as the most nutritious varieties of sweet potatoes and the method for making yogurt cheese. But, I will probably never make anyof them. Instead, I will file away all of the food combinations and use them when I select recipes from other cookbooks or improvise recipes on my own.<br />If these fourteen foods represent a `kosher' or best selection, it would be nice to see a selection of `parve' foods. That is, foods which fall into a neutral to good category. Two prime candidates would be olive oil and red wine. The book mentions and recommends both and is wisely careful in citing wine as a beneficial food. This interest is addressed to some extend with the Lifestyle Pyramid which endorses whole grain products, healthy fats, and reasonable portions of red meats and eggs.<br />In spite of the opening skeptical paragraph, I believe this is a delightfully promising book which gives easy to follow guidelines without oversimplifying things too much. For those who are not already fond of spinach and turkey and tomatoes, I recommend they establish a relationship with a good book on Italian food and start with turkey Florentine (turkey and spinach) and vegetable lasagna.<br />With a list price under $25, I recommend this book to everyone.y of them.

Joe Famularo's book `A Cook's Tour of Italy' gives you almost exactly what the title promises. It is a travelogue of meals enjoyed by the author and his companions on many different trips to many of the major regions of Italy. The book is definitely not like Claudia Roden's more systematic `The Foods of Italy' which treats all 20 regions equally. Famularo spends almost all of his time and attention on the nine most popular locations, Rome, Tuscany, Liguria, Lombardy, the Veneto, Emilia-Romagna, Umbria, Naples, and Sicily / Sardinia / Calabria.<br />The organization of recipes by menu and by location is not done to make the material more accessible and useful to the reader, it is done to more closely parallel the author's actual trips. Most menus even cite actual restaurants where the meal was eaten.<br />The book contains additional, very valuable information on general techniques and sources. The book opens with a useful glossary of Italian ingredients. I always have reservations about book sections like this one embedded in general cookbooks. It is always so easy to find something they do not include. I give this book good marks for including the Italian translations for English terms; however, the presentation of the translated terms is not done in a consistent presentation.<br />The opening chapter covers broth recipes, bread recipes, pasta recipes, and guidance for cooking pasta. Here again, the author is giving sound information, but the material seems a bit thin for the real devotee of Italian food. If I want a good Italian bread recipe, I will go to Carol Field's `The Italian Baker'. I will give the author high marks for the broth recipes. I can find no missteps and there I am pleased to see the addition of mushrooms to the vegetable broth.<br />The bottom line is that this is a book with good recipes and information, but its material is spread to thinly and organized in a style that is not helpful when you are looking for `an Italian recipe with veal' for example.<br />I would recommend this book to:<br />Someone who has or will be traveling to Italy soon.<br />Someone who knows nothing of Italian cuisine and would like an engaging introduction.<br />Someone who collects books on Italian cuisine.<br />Someone who needs Italian menus such as a caterer, restaurateur, or frequent home entertainer.<br />One of the best features for most of these audiences is the bibliography and the list of sources.<br />I recommend this book, especially at its relatively reasonable price, but only if you know it fits a clear need. As other reviewers have noted, it is very readable, has good recipes, and is well organized for finding menus for a Italian entertaining. Since its coverage of many topics is a bit light and it is not organized for optimum use, I give only four stars to this worthy book.xample.<br />I would recommend this book to:<br />Someone who has or will be traveling to Italy soon.<BR>Someone who knows nothing of Italian cuisine and would like an engaging introduction.<BR>Someone who collects books on Italian cuisine.<BR>Someone who needs Italian menus such as a caterer, restaurateur, or frequent home entertainer.<br />One of the best features for most of these audiences is the bibliography and the list of sources.<br />I recommend this book, especially at its relatively reasonable price, but only if you know it fits a clear need.

It is the foundation of Martha Stewart's reputation, the starting point of her magazine, TV shows, and Kmart product line. The book is worthy of that reputation, as I am hard pressed to think of how any book could do a better job at its chosen task.<br />I chose to review this old, now classic volume because I recently reviewed two new books on entertaining menus and I felt I could not do the subject justice without consulting the established authority on the subject. I also felt compelled to visit this book because in spite of Martha's well-publicized problems, I have believed she is very good at what she does. Her success is not built on hype, marketing, or fluff. This book demonstrates that fact.<br />As pointed out by a recent biographer, Christopher Byron, in the book `Martha, Inc.', Stewart has largely invented her persona of talented amateur who happens to be very good at classic `homemaking' tasks. This `handmade' aspect of her character comes through in all her works, and it is not seen as phoniness or pretend knowledge. I believe it is seen as an attitude of `Look, even I, an untrained (fill in what you will) can do this. You can too.' In fact, on one of her TV shows, Martha says her job is really `learning fast' from experts. She constantly praises and quotes from genuine experts such as Julia Child without assuming any credit for having the smarts to have borrowed from such a well-recognized source. In decorating, a constant theme is doing clever things with inexpensive materials to achieve a `Wow' effect. Many of her recommendations can lead one to a fairly hefty price tag, but then, you are foolish if you plan a party for 12 or 24 or 48 or 100 and wish to have it come off well, and not expect a pretty sizable cost. Stewart's first priority is for you to succeed. And, for her, success, is that you please your guests and have fun yourself. She succeeds in providing ample materials for doing that. Her second priority is to be smart in finding economical solutions, such as in hiring help for both wait staff and musical entertainment.<br />The talented amateur persona is entirely genuine. The best thing about her Food Network show is not what she does, but the quality of her guests and what they can do. That did not stop her from assembling a first rate book with professional grade instruction in some very important cooking and baking skills. There are, for example, exceptionally well done full page illustrated tutorials on making pie crusts, making French bread, creating wedding bouquets, building a gingerbread mansion, and creating a crudite platter. The general quality of these instructions surpasses most features in her magazine and rival step by step instructions by Jacques Pepin.<br />One may think that if Martha is copying recipes from Julia Child, why not simply get `Mastering the Art of French Cooking' and be done with it. This would work if you had the time, as Martha did, to work your way through this book and pick out those recipes which fit various occasions. I may also note that while they are true classics of cookbook writing craft, Julia Child's recipes are not for the novice. Martha succeeds in making the recipes she has chosen much more accessible to the inexperienced cook. This is not to say Martha Stewart expects a homemaker with average kitchen skills will actually prepare meals for 12, let alone 100. Her recommendations are as much a means of preventing caterers from pulling the wool over the client's eyes as they are recipes for the solo chef. Realistically, for the self-catered party, the recipes are source materials with the bonus that it gives recipes, which work well together by look and by taste.<br />One important aspect of this work which the prospective reader cannot forget is that this is NOT `Entertaining Lite'. This is how to go the full nine yards without breaking the bank. If there is a trade off between quality and economy, quality wins. The heart of the tutorial on how to entertain is a detailed lesson on how to plan and check preparations.<br />I am certain wrote much of the material in the book, but I am also sure that she had a lot of professional help from Clarkson Potter layout artists and her credited photographers in the design of the book. Whatever the source, the outcome is worthy of the classic mantle which has been given to the book. It is a worthy standard by which to judge other books on similar subjects. While over a dozen different photographers contributed pictures and most are simply good, the overall effect is excellent. The layout staff really earned their money.<br />In spite of the battalion of assists Martha must have had in putting this book together, she constantly maintains the illusion that she is personally guiding you through the details by having many scenes photographed at her house and her events with her family members and heirlooms on center stage most of the time. This point of view is familiar to anyone who has read her magazine with its schedule of things Martha will be doing this month.<br />Be sure to buy the paperback edition of the book published in 1998 as the original hard cover edition published in 1982 would not have the Internet web sites for the Sources.<br />Regardless of Martha's reported corrosive persona `off camera' and her allegedly illegal dealings, she knows how to throw a good party and she succeeds at passing that information on to you.<br />Highly recommended.The heart of the tutorial on how to entertain is a detailed lesson on how to plan and check preparations. <br />I am certain wrote much of the material in the book, but I am also sure that she had a lot of professional help from Clarkson Potter layout artists and her credited photographers in the design of the book.

Not as authoritative as expected	Nick Malgieri's book `How to Bake' is not perfect, but it is a very, very good survey of baking methods and baking recipes by one of the most widely respected and referenced baking experts in the country. That some reviewers have observed that he is a less than nice man to students and admirers in book signing lines is irrelevant. I have baked several recipes from this book and all have produced very successful products. In each case, I have also baked the same product from an alternate recipe and Malgieri's recipe has produced a superior result. To those who have not had any luck with his recipes, I would suggest they try some of the simpler recipes first.<br />While Malgieri is a widely recognized teacher of baking at some important culinary schools and this book's title may lead you to believe it is a textbook covering all aspects of baking, I believe it does not succeed as a textbook on several counts. The most important is that Malgieri makes several statements, which are scientifically incorrect. One was that glass conducts heat much faster than metal. This is patently false. The odd thing is, he uses this statement to give a false reason for using glass pie plates, which may still be the best choice for other reasons. Another false statement is that yeast is mixed with warm water until it dissolves. Strictly speaking, the proper word should be `incorporated' or `combined'. Microorganisms cannot dissolve in water. Again, while the statement is false, it has no effect on the efficacy of the recipe. I only point these out because Malgieri is an educator and should know better.<br />There is another sense in which I believe this cannot be a textbook for baking. This is the fact that I believe the coverage of bread baking is rather light. For breads, I would refer you to either Rose Levy Beranbaum's `The Bread Bible' or Peter Reinhart's `The Bread Baker's Apprentice. This doesn't mean you will not find a lot of good stuff here. In fact, I go to this book before any other when I want to bake something (other than bread) to see if Malgieri has a recipe for the product I'm interested in. This book is very similar to the book `Baking With Julia' in that both are surveys of a lot of different baking techniques giving some very commonly baked goods as models for those techniques. This makes these two books my first and second choices when I want to bake.<br />Therefore, the subtitle on the front of the book, which calls itself a `Complete Guide', is a bit of a stretch. You should still buy this book if you enjoy baking. In fact, the most accurate reflection of the book's value is in Nick's introduction where he quotes a colleague who says `Bake something, You will feel better.'

It predates her regular Food Network series and may predate her first appearance on any Food Network shows. Unless you look carefully to notice the imprimatur of the giant publisher Random House, you may take this for a local, self-published cookbook done by a church or women's social group to raise money, because that is exactly how the recipes come across. They represent your basic southern meat and potatoes and grits and collard greens menu and succeed very well in filling that niche.<br />That is almost exactly the same opening paragraph I used for Paula's first book. It is as true of the second book as it was of the first, even down to the plastic amateur binding which makes the Random House imprimatur so surprising.<br />One of the few differences between the first and the second books is that the second adds more details to how Paula and her sons came to establish their restaurant. Another difference is that only a very few of the recipes are cited as dishes served at Paula's restaurant. A third difference is that Paula strays a bit outside the standard Southern culinary canon. Some distinctly French and Italian standards such as steak au pauvre and pasta Puttanesca sauce have found their way into the book. My humble opinion on the Italian dishes is that a few important details of the proper techniques are missing, but your result from following these recipes will be quite acceptable.<br />Like the first volume, almost all of the recipes call for a reasonable number of easily obtained ingredients and require a relatively few steps. Many recipes call for prepared or processed ingredients such as canned soups, packaged rice dishes, and Velveeta.<br />Like the first book, I would open this volume if I wanted to find something to make for a person whose fussy zone excludes things like curry, lemon grass, hosin sauce, wines, and leeks. This would be a fallback source if I wanted something to fit a Pennsylvania Dutch palate, but the Pennsylvania Dutch cookbooks on my shelf fail to inspire.<br />I would not go to Paula's books for baked goods. I am certain her recipes work. I have tried several and find them too long on butter and eggs and too short on fruit. If you, dear reader are an inexperienced cook, I would put this book to the side and start with a cookbook specifically written to teach techniques such as Madeline Kamman's `The New Making of a Chef'.<br />If you like basic American Cooking done with the cachet of a Food Network celebrity chef, this is an excellent source at a very reasonable price. Many of the recipes have been featured on Paula's Food Network show, so this book gains value if you are fond of following her show. I would also agree with other reviewers that her first book is preferable to the second, but the second is worthy of her style.t the Pennsylvania Dutch cookbooks on my shelf fail to inspire.<br />I would not go to Paula's books for baked goods.

Books	5	36	39	N	N	Seriously Fun Book for Cooking Up Entertaining Menus	This book by veteran cookbook author Sheila Lukins is an excellent cookbook for the home cook who likes to cook and to entertain, but who is not a foodie who does not want to spend a lot of time pulling recipes from books by celebrity authors or the `Joy of Cooking'. The book is also superior to other recent books written to the same theme such as `Around the Table' by Ellen Wright.<br />There is a great divide between books written for foodies and culinary professionals and books written for everyone else who needs to prepare food and simply needs some straightforward guidance in how to go about the work in the kitchen. The latter type of book generally specializes in cooking fast, cooking thin, or cooking to other special purpose. Lukins' book covers entertaining menus and recipes in an exceptionally thorough treatment of 43 different events. To my lights, she has done a superb job of selecting recipes, which are appropriate to the occasion. I may miss the special paska bread at the Easter menus, especially since there are two different Easter menus, but I respect Lukins' decision as the book contains no recipes for bread, and the menus contain nothing, which is not made in the home.<br />While this book is not a foodie book, it succeeds far better than many other general audience cookbooks in selecting recipes, which are genuinely interesting to gourmets. The Salad Nicoise, for example uses freshly saut&eacute;ed tuna rather than the traditional canned tuna. The chile recipe uses diced beef like most `competition grade recipes', not ground beef. The recipes for stock are reputable. Expert sources like Cooks Illustrated or Jeremiah Tower may prefer fewer vegetable ingredients or more chicken bones, but Lukins' recipes will give flavorful results without an excessive amount of trouble. The recipe for a standard pastry dough leaves out a few of the finer tips found in books dedicated to pastry, but here too, the recipe supplied will work. I do suspect one may be well served by going to a specialist for baking.<br />I tried my best to find a menu where an ingredient was clearly used out of season and I could not. Fresh corn was used in recipes slated for summer events, while frozen corn was used in recipes requiring fresh corn at Thanksgiving. Unlike foodie oriented authors, Sheila does not preach to us about using local, seasonal foods, but she is practicing that doctrine gently, without burdening us with the gospel according to Alice Waters. Lukins does, however, tip the hat to intellectual honesty by citing her expert sources. She has a Moroccan menu and, sure enough, she credits Paula Wolfert's authoritative book on Moroccan cuisine as a source.<br />Lukin's book is primarily about providing worthy recipes to people who want to have fun. Each menu includes an alcoholic beverage recommendation. I am no expert on this, but it makes perfect sense to me to include these recommendations in a book of entertaining menus. Leaving it out would have been a deficiency in the book. The book also includes recommendations for music appropriate to each occasion. While I pretend to know much more about music than I do about wine, I will not object to any of the recommendations except perhaps to the omission of Moussorsky's `Night on Bald Mountain' from the Halloween lineup. Anyone who recommends Duane Eddy as a listening option certainly has their heart in the right place.<br />The selection of recipes in each menu are appropriate and the recipes are serious. There are no second rate pot luck event recipes here from the back of Hamberger Helper boxes. I recommend this book over any other of books on the same subject. The paperback price for a book of this size and quality is doubly attractive.ed by going to a specialist for baking.<br />I tried my best to find a menu where an ingredient was clearly used out of season and I could not.

One of the first things you learn in this book is that there are as many, if not more subtleties and ambiguities in the marketing of chocolate as there are in just about any other basic food product such as flour or olive oil.<br />On this matter, I am slightly concerned that Ms. Medrich, in an otherwise superb book, does not simply drop all vagueness in chocolate labeling and go with products which are boldly labeled by percentage of chocolate liqueur to sugar. My guess is that while very high-end (expensive) product lines such as Vahlrona do this kind of labeling, more commonly available product lines do not do it. But then, we still wouldn't have leeks and shallots or organic products in our grocery stores if people such as Julia Child and Alice Waters hadn't started making a fuss about it. But I digress.<br />Another regret I get from reading this book has nothing to do with the quality of Ms. Medrich work. It is the fact that the great American chocolate producer Hershey has so little to contribute to those of us who wish to bake with high quality chocolate.<br />The significance of the book's title is that bittersweet chocolate is the most commonly used form of chocolate for baking. This brings up another issue with chocolate cooking. Unlike white wheat flour, a relatively simple product, chocolate used for baking, that is, bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, is a rather complex product, being an emulsion of solids in an oil, cocoa butter. This means that the general warning about following procedures exactly becomes even more important. Another subtlety in chocolate products is the formulation of chocolate chips used in Toll House cookies. It would seem so easy to zip open a bag of chocolate chips and melt them instead of chopping down a block of semisweet with a knife. The problem is that those little chocolate chips are specially formulated to not melt like normal chocolate so they hold their shape in cookies. Melting them like conventional chocolate will just give you a mess.<br />The most important warning one can take away from this book about chocolate products is the difference between conventional cocoa powder and Dutch Process cocoa powder. On the face of it, removing some bitterness from cocoa through the Dutch Process may seem like a good thing. But, the author points out that the process acts like a filter on music which removes all the high notes, so you end up with a less interesting flavor. Also, since there is a big difference in pH between conventional and Dutch Process, you cannot substitute one for the other safely if your recipe includes baking soda or baking powder.<br />The stories about the problems with melting chocolate probably outnumber all other calls for culinary advice. The stuff is finicky in the extreme. The irony is that the properties which make it finicky around heat are the same things which give it such a lush and rich mouth feel. That is, since cocoa butter melts at human body temperature, it will melt and be on its way to being scorched long before other products such as butter or olive oil even start to be ready to cook. Ms. Medrich gives excellent guidance for this most basic operation on chocolate by describing the three most successful methods for melting chocolate, the water bath, the double boiler, and the microwave oven. Medrich even succeeds in describing the difference between a water bath and a double boiler and the advantages of the former in a manner much clearer and more illuminating than the great Jeremiah Tower, who seemed to become especially tongue tied over the matter.<br />Ms. Medrich covers a wide range of chocolate preparations including Ice Cream and Brownies, Tortes, Truffles and Mousses, Souffles, Cakes and Glazes, Cookies, and selected savory dishes.<br />The book ends with several useful appendices on recognizing the various typesof chocolate and their use. It is probably a virtue that this book often repeats the same information in two or three different contexts. This can only be to the good, especially for the spelunker who dips into selected chapters rather than reading the whole book. I definitely recommend that if you are really interested in working with chocolate, you read the whole book. Ms. Medrich's biographical anecdotes are both entertain and inform us about how she came about some of her successes with chocolate.<br />Highly recommended.of chocolate and their use.

The fact that the two authors are recognized experts on their subject makes the job even easier, because it generally means you can sit back and take their advice with the assurance that they know what they are talking about. These are not two interior decorators who write cookbooks as a sideline. One thing to beware of regarding the authors' reputations is that unlike their earlier books, this book is not exclusively about grilling meats. In fact, grilling is a relatively minor part of this book.<br />By `meat' the authors mean the flesh of domesticated cattle, sheep, and pigs. This follows the conventions of almost all other cookbook authors I have read. It does not mean flesh of fowl, rabbits, or game such as venison. One advantage of this distinction means that many methods useable for one `red meat' animal can often be used for a similar cut of meat from another red meat animal.<br />The main object of the authors in writing this book is to deal with the fact that while eating a large amount of meat may lead to ingesting an excessive quantity of undesirable fats, eating a reasonable amount of meat provides a high amount of complete proteins essential to human nutrition. The object, then, is to make these reasonable portions as desirable as possible to eat. One result of this objective is to make as wide a range of meat cuts accessible to the home cook as possible. Limiting oneself to steaks, pork loin, and lamb chops will not only become dull after a while, it is also expensive.<br />An important insight from the authors is that the cost of a cut of meat has nothing to do with the (food) value of the cut. In fact, many writers have claimed that most of the less expensive cuts are actually the most flavorful. I think it is fair to say that the cost of a cut of meat is inversely proportional to the amount of time and effort required to convert the meat into a tasty dish. While an eight dollar a pound fillet can be saut&eacute;ed and pan roasted in 20 minutes, a three-dollar a pound cut of chuck may take two hours to brown and braise. The reward, however, is that the braised chuck will taste great the next day without any help while the cold beefsteak may need some help to be appealing.<br />My favorite part of this book is the fact that I share with the authors a love of lamb. This means the authors have devoted a sizable portion of the book to recipes for various cuts of lamb, conveniently divided into a number of chapters based on the types of cooking methods most appropriate to the lamb primal.<br />The first such chapter deals with the large tender cuts of lamb. This includes the very expensive rack of lamb, the crown roast, bone in and butterflied leg of lamb, lamb saddle, lamb loin and a shoulder roast, prepared in a fashion very similar to the leg of lamb methods.<br />The second lamb chapter presents recipes for large tough cuts of lamb including lamb shanks and two recipes for braised or barbecued lamb shoulder (you didn't think you could keep these guys away from the barbecue for the whole book).<br />The third lamb chapter is for small tender cuts such as loin chops, rib chops, lamb tenderloin, leg steaks, and Denver Lamb ribs. This chapter concentrates on grilling techniques for lamb, especially for lamb on skewers.<br />The fourth chapter is my favorite, after roasted leg of lamb, in that it gives stewing and braising recipes for small tough cuts of lamb. This includes Irish stew, Shepherd's pie, and curried lamb dishes.<br />The last chapter on lamb has two recipes from `the fifth quarter' otherwise known as offal. It has a recipe for lamb kidneys and lamb tongues.<br />Between this book and constant harping from my hero Mario Batali, lamb shoulder has come to replace leg of lamb as my favorite lamb cut. They have convinced me that it has better flavor while being substantially less expensive. I have also discovered that it is becoming much easier to find than it may have in the past. Check out farmers market butchers.<br />In addition to excellent recipes, the book offers general tips on various cooking methods and many tips for making requests of butchers to have them do some of the hard work in preparing the meat for the pot. When roasting a shoulder, I would recommend asking the butcher to fillet the shoulder after it is weighted for sale and give you the bones separately to make lamb stock. Speaking of stocks, this book gives no recipes for them, which I actually consider a plus, as there are more than enough good books with excellent stock recipes. No sense taking up space here for a well-worn subject. Check out Judy Rodgers Zuni Caf&eacute; cookbook for the best stock recipes I've ever seen.<br />I always look here first when I want a recipe for lamb or veal or pork or beef. It not only gives me the right stuff on what to look for at the butcher, but also how to get the best value from what the butcher can do for me.<br />This book is highly recommended.lamb cut.

791042:US	39134375	R3U0IDOQXX9V4	1558322523	730692913	Around the Table: Easy Menus for Cozy Entertaining at Home	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Warm Book of Good Recipes in Helpful Menus for Home	This book on entertaining menus and recipes by the interior designer Ellen Wright provides almost exactly what you would expect, but nothing more. It gives us thirteen (13) menus for cold weather situations and eleven (11) menus for warm weather situations.<br />Most of the menus are tailored to fit a particular situation. Cold weather menus fit situations like TV viewing, a small Thanksgiving gathering, Christmas, `home with a cold', New Years Eve, Super Bowl Sunday, Valentine's day, and a hearty breakfast. Warm weather menus fit a Bridge party, and engagement dinner, the Fourth of July, a teenage date dinner, a dinner outside on the grill, and a menu suitable for preparation by an inexperienced cook (the daughter?!).<br />Reflection on this lineup leads me to think that the book may not be as useful to the frequent entertainer as it may appear on first blush. Most of the menus are more appropriate to very specific functions and not to general entertaining. This book is much more specialized in it's audience than, for example, Martha Stewart's famous first book `Entertaining'. The audience most interested in this book may not be the frequent entertainer of friends and business colleagues as the person with an active family life around the home.<br />There are two sure signs that the best audience is the large home centered family. First, there are few alcoholic beverage recommendations. If this book were oriented toward adult guests, this is a serious oversight, especially in the matter of wine. I have no knowledge or serious interest in wine and food pairings, but I do know that this is an important dimension to dining and entertaining. The author doesn't even mention the subject of wine. The few mentions of alcoholic beverages I found were recipes for Pimm's Cup, Bloody Marys, and Margaritas. Second, most of the recipes are relatively simple with a generous use of prepared ingredients from the supermarket's freezer case and cake mix aisle. A much more valuable use of space in this book would have been to remove the mixed drinks recipes and add recommendations for wines and simple references to mixed drink names.<br />Since the book presents recipes in menus, where most menus have a salad and a dessert course, you are getting more salad and dessert recipes than you would in the more conventionally organized book. For this imbalance, you are getting important information on putting together interesting menus.<br />I am not overly impressed by the distribution of ingredients by warm weather and cold weather menu. It is more accurate to say that the recipies are selected to fit the occasion than the season. Otherwise, the selection of recipes is fairly broad, covering classic American fare such as franks and beans and chili, to imported classics such as pasta Puttanesca and Gaspacho. None of the recipes violate any major culinary practices and the sidebar tips help you to make the best of your ingredients, but there is little there which an experienced cook does not already know.<br />The photographs in the book are all very good. The irony is that the photographs do as good or better job of highlighting the author's day job of decorator than they do of featuring the food. Serving plates, table decorations, and tablecloths get as much attention as the food. A perfect example of this is one photo which features not one wit of edible material. In the place of the food is a recent `New Yorker' cartoon flanked by elegant serving ware, napkins, and tablecloth.<br />I am always interested in influences on the author and I am pleased to find this writer refer more than once to the solo work of Simone Beck rather than Ms. Beck's more famous colaborator, Julia Child. Ms. Wright also refers with reverence to an association with James Beard. All this indicates that Ms. Wright is a very talented person for which home entertaining (and this book) is a sidelight, for which she has taken one or more short classes with old school culinary celebrities such as Beard, Child, and Madhur Jaffrey.<br />If you do a lot of entertaining and are an only modestly skilled cook, this is a worthwhile book. It gives good ideas and it will not take you into deep culinary waters.brities such as Beard, Child, and Madhur Jaffrey.<br />If you do a lot of entertaining and are an only modestly skilled cook, this is a worthwhile book.

793738:US	39134375	RO05U9BFASGZE	0393020436	372371276	The Zuni Cafe Cookbook: A Compendium of Recipes and Cooking Lessons from San Francisco's Beloved Resturant	Books	5	31	34	N	N	A must read for foodies	This excellent book by Judy Rodgers is an addition to the growing body of works by prominent American chefs who learned their craft in France and whose doctrine on food and cooking has been reinforced by the writings of Richard Olney and transformed by the California doctrine of using fresh local foods. The foremost of these writer chefs are Thomas Keller, Alice Waters, Jeremiah Tower, Paul Bertolli, and Judy Rodgers herself. The Italian wing of this group is represented by Tom Colicchio and Mario Batali (In spite of Mario's antagonism to the `F country', he is a true student of this group, having been a chef at Stars under Jeremiah Tower).<br />This book won two James Beard awards and Rodgers garnered a third Beard Award for best chef last year, making it a true hat trick for Rodgers and the Zuni Caf&eacute;. From what I have seen in this book, it earned every bit of recognition it has garnered.<br />The only recent American book I know which is comparable to this book in the quality of its lessons is `Jeremiah Tower Cooks'. This book succeeds at an even higher level than Tower since the older writer has some strong opinions on some not entirely universally held opinions. Tower redeems himself by making his book just that much more engaging by so energetically endorsing these controversial opinions.<br />Rodgers engages in no controversy. Her lessons in cooking follow the straight and narrow of French technique mellowed by her beautifully plain doctrines about using simple equipment. Before I get too far, I must warn the reader that what people like Rodgers and Colicchio mean by simple is much different from what the fast cooking maestros such as Rachael Ray, Sandra Lee, and Ann Byrn mean. Rodgers and Colicchio are talking about simplicity within the world of haute cuisine as defined by Richard Olney in `Simple French Food'. Basically, simple to this school means using well-understood techniques without excessive or overly architectural ornament. This style still requires many years of training to become familiar with one's materials and techniques.<br />There is at least one pleasantly surprising joining of opinions between the haute cuisine Rodgers and the English popular food writer Nigella Lawson. Both make the point, that to really know your materials and procedures, it is essential that you repeat the same few dishes rather than doing something different every time you turn on the range. While Lawson uses this principle to recommend a list of recipes she considers important to master by repetition; Rodgers gives a more methodological approach by advising us how to make little variations in one's practice to teach oneself the variations in your prima materia.<br />The instructions and explanations on stock making alone are worth the price of the book. Here, Rodgers is following Olney's lead by explaining why you do things this way rather than that way. The explanations are leavened by anecdotes on Rodgers experiences in training and in her kitchen at Zuni. Especially delightful is the tale of a pig's head being used to make a pork stock. Among the stories are some experiences in the kitchen of the Troigros brothers in France. These legendary chefs are often mentioned together with other modern greats of the French kitchen. This is the first look I have seen into the basis of their renown.<br />Among the very many lessons about basic cooking techniques, the most dramatic and most useful is in the application of salt to food. While Food Network junkies may not find this lesson too dramatic, it does give one a new respect for this most simple of culinary techniques.<br />Every chapter in the book dishes out not only Zuni Caf&eacute; recipes, but also a California gold mine of techniques and explanations on why these techniques work. Even the single page on vinaigrettes offers ucommon wisdom on a very common subject, such as the relevance of the dish to be dressed on the ratio of oil to acid in the vinegrette. The star of the latter portion of the book is `A Lesson in Sausage Making', comparable to some of the more lovingly detailed chapters in Bertolli's `Cooking by Hand'.<br />This book should be on every foodie's short list of must reads. Unlike excellent books on various methods and materials, this is a book you will want to read from cover to cover. The attitudes and knowledge will infuse and improve all your thinking and working with food.<br />If you are the book buying public, you can tune out now so I can talk to the book designers at W. W. Norton.<br />After the most beautifully composed photograph on the dust jacket, you seemed to drop the ball in laying out parts of the inside of the book. The photographs are too close up and are taken from an angle which does not present the food in the best light. The Table of contents is very poorly done. It is just about the worst I have ever seen in the way it is layed out. And, the tiny black and white photos used on the chapter title pages are simply a waste of money and space. One has absolutely no idea of what they are. The pictures on the `Stocks' title page could be from a restaurant, a hospital, or a laboratory. To your copy editors, I warn that Harold McGee is probably cringing at the many uses of `dissolve' where you really should say `bring into suspension' or simply `incorporate'.<br />To all foodies, this is a must have book.tion of the book is `A Lesson in Sausage Making', comparable to some of the more lovingly detailed chapters in Bertolli's `Cooking by Hand'. <br />This book should be on every foodie's short list of must reads.

Food was Beard's consolation.<br />One major change in my view of the world due to my reading this book together with a reading of a biography of Julia Child is that I believe that Child and not Beard is the preeminant influence on American eating habits in the 20th century. Whether this is real or a failure of this book to communicate Beard's influence I am not sure. This question makes me feel this book is less than what it could have been. It almost seems as if the book were written about Hemingway without dealing with the foundations of Hemingway's literary art. An easier analogy may be that it is like a biography of Richard Feynman which makes no attempt to explain to the intelligent layman what it is about Feynman's work which made him a great physicist.<br />In spite of this reservation, the book succeeds in communicating the facts of Beard's life in a highly readable, sympathetic presentation. Like other reviewers, I could not put the book down as long as I had the free time to read it. I cannot make the same unqualifiedly positive statement about the aforementioned biography of Child.<br />One of the most interesting things about Beard's career is that were it not for his failure in front of the TV camera in the fiftys, he may have stolen a march on Child and had a greater impact on his American audience. He may have even become even more like the kind of trademark that Martha Stewart has become, in that many of the writings attributed to him were done by a staff of ghost writers, many of whom have become major names in American food writing. These include Marian Cunningham and Barbara Kafka.<br />Another similarity to Stewart which tends to diminish him in comparison to Child is his very common practice of endorsing products and letting that endorsement interfere with his work. I may even give Martha Stewart the nod here in that Stewart has always taken an active interest in the quality of the products to which she has lent her name. A third similarity to Stewart is the fact that both began their career in food writing as caterers in the New York area.<br />In the final analysis, this book does succeed in showing how Beard came to represent American Cookery at its best, even if it does not manage to show why he succeeded.

796113:US	39134375	R16W2YF9AA5UDZ	0395926165	380197456	Zingerman's Guide to Good Eating: How to Choose the Best Bread, Cheeses, Olive Oil, Pasta, Chocolate, and Much More	Books	5	3	3	N	N	An Extra Virgin Reference of Superb Artisinal Advice	This delightfully informative guide from the owner, Ari Weinzweig, of the major Ann Arbor, Michigan delicatessen Zingerman's tells us just what the dedicated foodie needs to know about how to recognize and acquire good food products.<br />This is just another sign that over the last forty years, the range and quality of foodstuffs available in the United states has not only improved, it has actually, in some regards, become even better than the current state of affairs in Europe, where other reporters have said that rural food production is falling on hard times in France and Italy.<br />The first service this book performs is to make one aware that there is a wide range of quality in some very common ingredients and products, which one may easily take for, granted. Since I do a fair amount of bread baking, my favorite example is commercially available `artisinal bread'. The difference in quality for a generically labeled `Italian bread' between a loaf from a local commercial bakery or a local supermarket bakery and a loaf from a high quality upscale megamart bakery is dramatic for about 30 cents difference in price. The difference between the high quality megamart and the product from the La Brea bakery in Los Angles or the Sullivan Street bakery in Manhattan is somewhat less, but definitely measurable. The fact that I can get a superior artisinal bread from my local megamart is very satisfying, especially since the author has stated that the average shopper in Paris may have a harder time to find a high quality bread than I do.<br />The second service from this book is to give us criteria for distinguishing the best products from the rest of the pack. A requirement for making these distinctions is to taste the products. The corollary to this principle is that one should make a point of shopping at stores which offer the customer the opportunity to taste samples of the product. An alternative is to purchase a range of products and organize home taste testing sessions. The modest cost of the test products can be distributed across many different people by inviting friends to join in with the testing. Once this lesson is learned, it is important to know the right way to taste. As we probably learned in eleventh grade biology, the tongue can distinguish just four (or five, if you subscribe to some recent doctrines) different tastes, while the nose can distinguish hundreds of different fragrances. Thus, flavor is really made up of a combination of taste and smell, and when one senses a food, it should be done in a way, which will give the nose its share of the action. The author describes the best techniques for tasting for each product.<br />A third service is to make us aware of the great differences one may find in materials collected at different times of the year or in different regions. The difference in olive oil between oil producing regions is sometimes dramatic. This was brought home to me when I was buying olive oil from Luigi DePalo and I asked him to name the best brand in the house, and he said it depends on the region from which you want the oil. Estate produced Tuscan oil is greener and more peppery tasting, for example, than an equal quality estate oil from Apulia. It may be less well known, but similar regional and seasonal differences exist for coffee, tea, chocolate, and cheeses. With cheese, the most dramatic difference may be the time of year. The milk producing animals are eating grass in the summer and dried feed in the winter, and it all shows up in their milk.<br />These seasonal and geographic differences in quality are sometimes subtle. There are other differences of which the newbie may not be aware which may have a much more dramatic effect on one's cooking. It is important to know the differences between `light oil', `olive oil', `virgin olive oil', and `extra virgin olive oil' but it is also important to know the best olive oil season, the methods of extracting oil, and the effects on storage. Theeasiest way to simplify all of this for olive oils at least is to buy two different oils. One should be a high quality commercial brand such as Colavita, which should be used for all cooking. The second should be an estate-bottled oil used in salads or as a final dressing to food after cooking is done.<br />The last major feature of the book is the 100 recipes, which end each chapter. I would not buy this book for the recipes, but they are all worthy. The information on how to assess the quality of ingredients is more than worth the price of admission.<br />The value of the book will depend a lot on how much you already know. As a dedicated viewer of the Food Network and a constant reader on things culinary, much of the information in this book was not new to me. The fact that I have seen many of these facts stated elsewhere gives me the authority to say that Ari Weinzweig knows what he is talking about, as if the gaggle of testimonial blurbs on the back cover were not enough. The value of this book is that all this information about many different products has been gathered together in one place. If you are new to the world of fine food products, this book is worth its weight in truffles.The names, addresses, telephone numbers, and web sites of sources for great foods is the icing on the cake. The bibliography is a fitting garnish to a very informative book.<br />Highly recommended to all readers interested in eating and making better food.easiest way to simplify all of this for olive oils at least is to buy two different oils.

It predates her regular Food Network series and may predate her first appearance on any Food Network shows. Unless you look carefully to notice the imprimatur of the giant publisher Random House, you may take this for a local, self-published cookbook done by a church or women's social group to raise money, because that is exactly how the recipes come across. They represent your basic southern meat and potatoes and grits and collard greens menu and succeed very well in filling that niche.<br />It may be no surprise to many of you, but there are adults who do not like green vegetables and rice and zucchini and chicken and cooking with wine and pasta with any kind of sauce except a simple bottled tomato sauce. These people are very fond of Paula Deen's recipes, which use Bisquik and Lemon Pepper and Velveeta. I know because my mother is one of them.<br />I'm becoming a dedicated foodie whose heroes are Thomas Keller and Mario Batali and Tom Colicchio. Being presented to eat anything created in Provence or Apulia, let alone Bangalore or Damascus annoys my mother. Her poverty food was baked beans and mashed potatoes. Her delicacies are Pennsylvania Dutch recipes such as corn pie and stuffed pig stomach or anything, which includes cabbage.<br />While my mother is not especially fond of grits or leafy green vegetables, almost every other southern speciality is right down her alley. As far as she is concerned, Emeril can't cook, Martha is too bossy, and Sara is just OK.<br />I'm covering all of this simply to illustrate that while Paula's cookbook has practically nothing in it with a French or Italian accent, it is all very good and it has a large audience on whom creations at The French Laundry or Gotham Bar and Grill are simply showing off to no good purpose.<br />So, if you want that basic, no nonsense, stick to your ribs, feed those love handles kind of food, this is the book for you. The rather inspiring story of how Paula Deen and her sons got into the restaurant business and how they succeeded is a bonus.<br />For the foodies among us, I did find a few things over which to quibble. At one point, Ms. Deen says that she uses new or red potatoes for everything, including mashed potatoes. Since I cook for someone who loves mashed potatoes, I can tell from both reading and personal experience that russet (Idaho) potatoes may be the best for mashed potatoes, and Yukon Gold do well, but that waxy potatoes like many red skinned varieties just do not do as well. And, Ms. Deen goes and uses russets in several recipes anyway. On the other side of the coin, Ms. Deen has a useful little suggestion for keeping a supply of cooked and diced potatoes on hand in the fridge for quick salads. I also would have preferred that better specifications were given when 'lemon pepper' are used as an ingredient. This looks like a generic reference to a commercial product, yet no brand is specified. A brand or a recipe for 'lemon pepper' would have been good. A worse offense was a reference to 'Jane's Krazy Mixed Up Salt' with no entry in the index whereby one can locate the recipe for it. If the recipe for this stuff is in the book, I can't find it as I write this.<br />This is not, however, a book worth picking nits over. These are the kind of dishes which appeal to a very large number of people, so I am happy to inform them that this is their kind of cookbook. All the recipes are relatively easy with few steps and a very manageable number of ingredients. I like the fact that Paula indicates which of the recipes are actually served at her restaurant.

Since I cook for someone who loves mashed potatoes, I can tell from both reading and personal experience that russet (Idaho) potatoes may be the best for mashed potatoes, and Yukon Gold do well, but that waxy potatoes like many red skinned varieties just do not do as well. And, Ms. Deen goes and uses russets in several recipes anyway. On the other side of the coin, Ms. Deen has a useful little suggestion for keeping a supply of cooked and diced potatoes on hand in the fridge for quick salads. I also would have preferred that better specifications were given when 'lemon pepper' are used as an ingredient. This looks like a generic reference to a commercial product, yet no brand is specified. A brand or a recipe for 'lemon pepper' would have been good. A worse offense was a reference to 'Jane's Krazy Mixed Up Salt' with no entry in the index whereby one can locate the recipe for it. If the recipe for this stuff is in the book, I can't find it as I write this.<br />This is not, however, a book worth picking nits over. These are the kind of dishes which appeal to a very large number of people, so I am happy to inform them that this is their kind of cookbook. All the recipes are relatively easy with few steps and a very manageable number of ingredients. I like the fact that Paula indicates which of the recipes are actually served at her restaurant. I am more inclined to try that first.<br />This is your 'average Joe' kind of cookbook which should win the day.	2004-02-05

This consideration can be nullified by the fact that the book's contents are much better than the run of the mill oversize picture book if that were the whole story. A second consideration is that Ken Hom has a similar oversized many pictured book published at roughly the same time by Dorling Kindersley (DK) entitled `Foolproof Chinese Cooking'. This book is superior to the `Quick Wok' in many ways. First, the `Foolproof' book gives much more detailed recipe instructions and the many pictures are specifically dedicated to assisting in the communication of the recipe steps. Second, much of the introductory material in `Quick Wok' is duplicated in `Foolproof'. Thus, if one were interested simply in a good introductory book on Chinese cooking, the `Foolproof' book would be the one to choose.<br />There are some reasons to own both books. The `Quick Wok' book focuses not only on recipes done in a wok, but also recipes which are fast even by the standards of wok cooking, which are normally as fast or faster than a saut&eacute; in French style cooking. Another reason to consider this book is that wok cooking is not all about stir-frying. It includes deep-frying and steaming and the book even includes some dessert recipes done by steaming.<br />The major chapters on recipes in this book are:<br />Starters and appetizers<br />Soups<br />Fish and shellfish<br />Poultry<br />Meat<br />Vegetables<br />Noodles and rice<br />Desserts<br />Unlike the `Foolproof' book, the table of contents does not list the names of all dishes. Another strike against it.<br />There are two other observations, which may weigh on whether this is the book for you. First, since the theme of the book is fast cooking, there are a large number of prawn recipes, since these cook extremely fast. If you are not fond of shrimp, you may want to consider this. Second, while the pitch of the book is speed, I question some of the prep timings. I'm sure a professional chef can prep seven vegetables in 20 minutes, but I can't. I also discount the claim of fast cooking when the recipe involves a long marinade. That immediately discounts the recipe as suitable for a quick after work preparation.<br />There are tips in the back of the book on entertaining and menus, which have the feed of something being copied from some other work. They all appear to be common sense. I would go to Martha Stewart for more detailed recommendations. The photography and food styling are competent, but not up to the quality one would expect in an oversize format with lots of pictures.<br />The author has a great reputation in his field, but this is by no means his best effort. I recommend the contents of this book, but give some alternatives some thought as well.re a large number of prawn recipes, since these cook extremely fast.

Byrn praises slow cooking as one technique to achieve `doctored' meals with less trouble and includes an entire chapter on the subject. She also makes the point that she is not interested in holding a stopwatch to the reader to beat.<br />One should be clear that Ms. Byrn is not entirely a throwback to the style of cooking praised in the fifties where virtually all meals were seen as something out of a box or a can. Healthy food with only a reasonable amount of unnecessary additives is her objective.<br />The author to which she is the most similar is Sandra Lee of `semi-homemade' fame. Both of these writers could be compared to Rachael Ray's style of cooking, but it is important to recognize the differences. While both Byrn and Lee are concerned with `easy', Rachael is mostly concerned with quick. What is so amazing about Rachel's results is that they are achieved with so few prepared ingredients. I think Rachael succeeds so well at what she does because she relies on a certain level of kitchen skills which may be more than whan Ms. Byrn expects. Almost all of the commercial preparations Rachael uses are achieved from packaged skinless and filleted meats, cleaned and cut vegetables, and canned rather than dry beans. Ray achieves her results by modifying classic recipes to use smaller dices and grilling or stovetop braising in place of oven roasting or braising.<br />The differences between Anne Byrn and Rachael Ray are exactly where I have reservations about Byrn's approach. At the outset, I disagree with her suggestion that one should stock a pantry with a wide variety of dried, bottled, canned, and frozen ingredients. As I have said with every other writer who makes this suggestion, the best approach is simply to get the ingredients for dishes you definitely plan to make in the next week, so in the case you don't like that dish, you don't have ingredients you may not need. I have it on the authority of no less than Madhur Jaffrey that this is a wise thing to do.<br />I also have the vague suspicion that Ms. Byrn is too concerned about always creating dishes with a great complexity of flavor. I got this idea when I read her suggestion about enhancing deli potato salad with several supplementary ingredients to improve the `bland' salad. Since I happen to like simple potato salads with no more dressing than a bit of oil and garlic and parsley, I was really wondering why she thought a simple potato salad needed any help in the first place. The irony of this is that she was so proud of the story she told about a meeting with Julia Child where Ms. Child created a salad simply by washing and drying some lettuce, salting the lettuce, and tossing the greens with some olive oil, and that was it.<br />In spite of my reservations, this is a very worthy book for the right audience. Judjing from the number of five star ratings and review, this book has found that audience. It does the excellent service of giving estimates of how long each dish will take to prepare and cook. Also, these recipes are very easy to read and follow. If you are looking for tasty dishes with little trouble to prepare plus some general suggestions on getting in and out of the kitchen quickly, this book will work for you. Just be sure you are aware of the trade offs. This food will, in general, be more expensive, have more additives, and be slightly more fatty (note the high use of grated and processed cheese) than if you worked entirely from scratch. I give the book high marks for giving you a large number of recipes for a very reasonable cost.onable cost.	2004-02-04

This is an excellent example of my favorite kind of book. It deals exclusively with recipes based on a single main ingredient. This makes it the book to go to when you have that last pound of spuds in a ten pound bag or you need some starch recipe to round out a meal and you can't face another rice dish, or you just want to do something a little different for mashed potatoes. Therefore, I am always inclined to give a good rating to this kind of book as long as the authors don't drop the ball between the kitchen and the word processor. These authors, Roy Finamore and Molly Stevens, have kept a firm grasp on the ball throughout the game.<br />It is not entirely true that the book deals exclusively with recipes containing potatoes, as it also contains recipes for sauces, dips, and fillings for potatoes. One way or another, every recipe supports a course with a potato dish.<br />The book is divided up into chapters which suit it's star player and the list of chapter titles shows just how versatile our little spud can be. The chapters are:<br />Appetizers and First Courses with roasted and dressed potato skins with appropriate fillings, dips, spreads, and sauces. It also includes the famous Spanish tapas called tortillas plus potato stuffed pastries such as knishes, samosas, and pierogies.<br />Soups with all the usual potato and leek soups and recipes for various stocks. It also contains several chowders and potato soups with other root vegetables.<br />Salads include just about every kind of potato salad you can dream of. As one of my favorite types of spud dishes, salads are one of the things potatoes do well which simply can't be matched by it's starchy competitor, rice.<br />Main Dishes includes potatoes joined up with some form of protein. Some dishes are famous such as corned beef hash and shepherd's pie and gnocchi. Some dishes are obscure, but no less interesting.<br />Mashed Potatoes contains 29 recipes for mashed white and sweet potatoes, but other chapters include additional recipes for mashed potatoes such as Colcannon, which is listed under baked and roasted recipes.<br />Fried Potatoes gives another host of recipes, which cannot be matched by rice. All the favorites such as French Fries, Home Fries, Hash Browns, Potato Pancakes, and potato chips are here.<br />Baked and Roasted Potatoes contains all the usual classics for both white and sweet potatoes, including oven fries, pommes Anna, candied sweet potatoes, and roasted potatoes with other root vegetables.<br />Gratins and Scalloped Potatoes is another of my favorite spud styles. This is one of the few corners of the book where I find a recipe missing. There is nothing similar to the Sicilian potato gratin made with chicken stock and olive oil rather than with cream.<br />Boiled Potatoes includes a lot of sauces to `kick up' the bland boiled spuds and includes German Potato Dumplings.<br />Breads and Rolls includes the famous use of potato in foccacia plus all sorts of breads where the gluten free potato starch makes the breads more tender.<br />Desserts is a rather short chapter wherein potatoes are primarily used as a starch addition to pastry doughs.<br />As suggested by some of the contents above, the book covers both white and sweet `potatoes' even though the two plants are not closely related biologically. They are closely related in their culinary applications, since you can do to a sweet potato almost everything you can do to a russet.<br />It should be no surprise that the book deals with the three main types of potatoes in great detail and is very careful to specify which type of potato is best with each dish.<br />The chatter in the headnotes and introductory sections to each chapter are engagingly written. They are informative without being cluttered with gushing emotions about beautiful vegetables. These are spuds after all. One of my favorite sidebar sections discusses the `Art and Craft of Tourner', a nearly forgotten technique which rounds the `sharp' edges and corners of sliced potatoes to create shapes which will cook more evenly. Burning the edges of potatoes just once when you roast sliced potatoes is enough to convince you that this synonym for tedium may just have a point.<br />The photographs are few, but of very good quality. As I would expect from a house like Houghton Mifflen, the simple, straightforward layout and fonts are very easy on the eyes.<br />This is not a classic and will probably go out of print in five years, which is all the more reason to get your copy now. A worthy addition to the library of anyone who cooks often and needs good sources of variety in inexpensive ingredients. Good recipes which are cheap. That's a winner.motions about beautiful vegetables. These are spuds after all.

801112:US	39134375	R2LQE88ECO4QTN	1592281834	782623710	Creating Chefs: A Journey through Culinary School with Recipes and Lessons	Books	4	8	9	N	N	Lush Culinary Metaphors Gush Love about Food	This new book by the photographer and writer Carol Maybach, with (culinary) contributions and writing credits by Glenn Humphrey is an ambitious attempt to document culinary passion and culinary education in a novel fashion, different from the journalism of Michael Ruhlman and Tony Bourdain on the one hand and the culinary memoir / recipes of, for example, Eric Rippert and Thomas Keller on the other.<br />Since the authors have set their sights very high, they are less successful than the works of the four authors mentioned above. Their shortcomings are primarily due to a concept, which just doesn't seem to work and a failure by the primary author to succeed in the very difficult subject of talking about an artistic endeavor rather than simply doing it. Where Ruhlman and Bourdain succeed so well by talking about people and classes and techniques and their own experiences, Maybach tries to reach some metaphysical level of understanding which any journeyman philosopher of the last several generations will tell you is simply an impossible task to do with any real success. What happens, to quote the book, is to `become intoxicated by culinary metaphors'. All the text attributed to Maybach has a breathless quality about it. She sounds like she is almost overwhelmed by the beauty and effervescence of dealing with food and it's preparation. There comes a time when you have to remember that we are talking about turnips and pork chops. This activity is roughly comparable to fine cabinet making and not to the still life paintings of Cezanne.<br />Note that the primary author's occupation is writer and photographer so it is probably reasonable to believe she is responsible for the photographs in the book. All of the photographs are in black and white and have the look about them of all being taken in ambient light with no staging or dressing. They all look like stills from a lost Cinema Verite work by Francois Truffaut on the drudgery in the life of an aging prep chef in a no star Paris bistro in Montmarte. Well, maybe not, but they are arty and contribute practically nothing to communicating the culinary information to you dear reader. Oddly enough, they are not out of step with the arty tone set by the primary author. They are brooding and heavy with photographic artistry and import. They simply do nothing to support the recipes being discussed on facing pages, as in the case of a cr&egrave;me broulee recipe facing what looks like a split coconut shell and roses still life or a recipe for Kobe beef facing a picture of radishes.<br />If this book had set it's sights a bit lower and left the writing to the chefs and the copy editors, this would have been a more rewarding book, especially at the budget list price asked for by this totally unknown (to me) publishing house.<br />All the recipes in the book are interesting. They are also all examples of haute cuisine restaurant fare, but that should not discourage you, as restaurant practice has a lot to teach the amateur chef. Each of the thirteen chapters contains a featured recipe by a culinary school instructor / chef plus additional, complimentary recipes fitting the theme of the chapter. The chapter also contains one or more essays by the featured chef plus `lessons' on important techniques such as stock preparation. One conceit of the book is to include in each chapter a double page spread of `notes' handwritten in block letters and illustrated by drawings which contribute much more to the value of the book as a culinary instruction than do the photographs.<br />I found no statements about culinary practice which I felt were entirely wrong and I found many which I believe are right. I was especially happy to find the authors echo the Richard Olney belief that achieving simplicity requires a lot of hard work and practice. There are several other little accuracies which other writers overlook or get wrong such as the rejection of the statement that searing meats does something to seal inthe juices of the meat. There are a few places where some generalizations may mislead one. In the `Advice from a Student' section there is a recommendation to heat pans completely before adding fat to saute. There are times when you do not want to do this and this is not recommended for Teflon coated pans.<br />I think the publisher's copy editors could have done a better job at several places in the book. At one point, a recipe calls for a quarter inch by quarter inch cube. The odd expression of giving the length of two sides of a cube would have been better done by simply saying a `small dice' as this is defined elsewhere in the book as a quarter inch cube.<br />I give this book only four stars to warn the prospective buyer that this book may have less substance to it than a cursory look may reveal. The greatest value for this book is as a survey of what one can expect from a good culinary education. The actual lessons contained herein are worthy, but you will get a better coverage of basic culinary techniques by getting the latest edition of the Culinary Institute of America's manual `The New Professional Chef'. I recommend this book to anyone who is considering a culinary education and who knows nothing about it. An even better text would be Daniel Boulud's `Letters to a Young Chef'.<br />Ironically, another reviewer who gave the book five stars got it exactly write when they said the book boils over with enthusiasm.

But, I ran across the author's name cited in `Pot on the Fire' by John Thorne, who cited him, Ken Hom, as quite an authority on Chinese cooking. Hom has published quite a few longer, presumably deeper books on Chinese cooking, but most of these appear from Amazon.com to be out of print or otherwise not immediately available. So, I am check out this very presumptuously titled book, `Foolproof Chinese Cooking'.<br />The first clue that this book has much to offer is the fact that the author is not your average restaurant chef or journalist who happens to specialize in writing about Chinese food. His dust jacket biography states that he is widely regarded as one of the world's greatest authorities on Chinese and other Asian cooking. I have read his book and I am entirely willing to believe the publisher's buildup.<br />Hom appears to be the BBC counterpart to Martin Yan on PBS, as this book is the companion to a BBC food series and he has done several other such books / TV series.<br />If you have any interest in the techniques of Chinese cooking, this book is for you, especially if you do not have a lot of experience with Chinese techniques. I say this not only because this book is so good, but also because many other highly regarded Chinese cookbooks are not that accessible to newbie Chinese cooks. I don't say this because important books on, for example, French cuisine are so accessible, but because the average American simply has no exposure to this style of cooking outside of the occasional Food Network show and Martin Yan's shows which, I confess, do not show up on my local PBS station.<br />The current volume succeeds primarily because it does not try to do too much, and what it does, it does very well. It is not limited to stir-frying and it is not limited to Cantonese or Sichuan cuisine. What it does is give you the Jaques Pepin step by step, picture by picture presentation of a goodly number of basic techniques. It starts with a basic chicken stock which, based on my just having made a French style chicken stock, I can say is right on target, without being too fussy. It avoids, for example, the step which recommends that you blanche the chicken before cooking, while being very careful to have you not bring the preparation to a boil to maintain a clear stock. By the way, the Chinese chicken stock is different from a French stock in that it includes ginger and garlic and excludes the French mirepoix. The book follows up with several recipes for soups before getting into the details of stir-frying.<br />The book includes many classic Chinese dishes, including Peking duck, chow mein, fried wontons, lemon chicken, and sweet and sour pork.<br />I think this cannot be the only Chinese cookbook you will need, but it should certainly be your first. Highly recommended.it is not limited to Cantonese or Sichuan cuisine. What it does is give you the Jaques Pepin step by step, picture by picture presentation of a goodly number of basic techniques.

The first three things which strike one about the book is that it is a smallish book for a fairly sizable subject, the author is neither a chef nor a culinary journalist, and that the design and illustrations in the book are exceedingly well done.<br />I always have problems rating small books which commonly give half the value for about two thirds of the price of full sized books. Since this is Ms. Blonder's second book on a culinary subject, and since her first book won an IACP Cookbook award, her being an apparent culinary amateur should cause no concern about the quality of the book's contents.<br />The book is divided into the following chapters:<br />Steamed Dumplings<br />Boiled and Pan-Fried Dumplings<br />Breads and Baked Dishes<br />Rice and Rice Flour Dishes<br />Greens and Pan-Fried Dishes<br />Deep-Fried and Bean Curd Sheet Dishes<br />Meats<br />Sweets<br />Sauces and Condiments<br />The book also contains small sections on types of tea, planning a menu, equipment and supplies, resources, and bibliography.<br />In a book this small, the bibliography becomes an important resource. The text states that some Dim Sum restaurants offer over a hundred dishes, yet this book has barely 110 pages devoted to often two page recipes. The book makes up for this sparseness in two very important ways.<br />First, it spends much of its space dedicated to Dim Sum cooking methods and equipment for steaming and deep-frying. It also gives excellent recipes for dumpling doughs and wrappers plus methods for folding dumplings.<br />Second, this book succeeds very well as a `feel good' book based on both the text and the color drawings, and the exceptionally good job of designing the book.<br />The greatest personal attraction of the book is the fact that it includes excellent recipes for baked `char siu bao' dumplings, something I often got at New Jersey Asian Markets, but which seem totally alien to the backwater Lehigh Valley. Having taken up cooking, this is one of the first things I wanted to try. The instructions for these baked filled rolls is a clean and you may wish. I have seen recipes in other books, which seem to require instructions on how to read the recipe.<br />If you love well-designed books or Chinese cooking, this book will warm your heart and your tummy.ally alien to the backwater Lehigh Valley.

Child is the great popularizer who succeeded in communicating `la cuisine Bourgeoise' without compromising on the techniques used by housewives in Paris and Lyon and Provence. David was the `culinary anthropologist', possibly less interested in culinary technique as in rustic culinary traditions and thinkings. Olney is the ambassador of haute cuisine to American restaurant kitchens. He was a colleague of James Beard, who recommended Olney to Time Life to edit their popular series on world food. The California gang, Alice Waters and Jeremiah Tower also cite him as the ultimate authority on French cuisine.<br />Olney's notion of `simple' is quite different from what you may expect from modern fast home cooking proponents such as Rachael Ray and Sandra Lee. His explanation of `simple food' requires a rather closely reasoned seven pages in his Preface. Olney's position is like my favorite anecdote of Mario Batali commenting on a trainee's `rustic' dice job, he says `No dude, that's just lazy'. Olney recognizes that what many people call simple is really an excuse for the lazy cook. At the other extreme, Olney dismisses fancy architectural constructions on the dinner plate. This is certainly not lazy, but it is not simple either. Although Olney does not dismiss expensive ingredients like truffles and foie gras, he does indict them as crutches used to replace imagination in the kitchen.<br />Some people may promote being true to simple tastes as being the hallmark of simplicity. Olney rules this out by citing the many rustic methods used to transform base, inexpensive ingredients such as many vegetables into `something transcendental'. Here, he identifies the source of perceived complexity not in the kitchens of the Sun King (Louis XIV) or even in the Lyon three star kitchen, but in the efforts of peasants to turn marginally tasting ingredients into good food. Olney quotes Curnonsky's statement that `In cooking, as in all arts, simplicity is the sign of perfection.' Olney adduces from this the notion that the value of simplicity is not in the method but in the outcome. He is definitely opposed to efforts to make a leg of lamb imitate venison. One of his primary concerns is that we have respect for our materials.<br />In a nutshell, he says `Simplicity-no doubt-is a complex thing' and finally arrives at what he considers the essence of the issue of simplicity and, irony of ironies, ends up sounding like Alton Brown, that glib satirist of the doctrines of French cooks. Olney says that understanding your ingredients and understanding the logic of your procedures is the thing which turns disasters resulting from blindly following recipes into great results. Olney says that like all art, cooking rules can be broken, but they can only be broken to good effect if you know them in the first place and know why they are the rules! This, then lays down the basis for how Olney presents his material. Unlike most books, certainly unlike those by Child and David, Olney addresses a culinary subject very much like Alton Brown in giving a roadmap to a general subject such as terrines, gratins, and egg dishes.<br />This is not to say Olney would disagree with Child or David. In fact, I almost fell over when I ran into Olney's introduction to making an omelet where he says that `no method is better than any other'. This comes straight out of the mouth of Elizabeth David who says that the best omelet recipe is the one which works for you. One must be fair and say that both authors still have a pretty clear idea of what an omelet is and how it is different, for example, from scrambled eggs, for which, by the way, Olney gives an excellent recipe.<br />Olney's book is like many of David's books in that you can read it from cover to cover and feelmuch richer for it without having made a single recipe. But, unlike David, Olney's recipes are as finely detailed as Childs, with the added attraction that he explains what is going on and why. One of my favorite examples is his explanation of why finely sieved hard boiled egg yolks go so well with bitter greens, as they perform a function very similar to salt in balancing the bitter with the fatty and making the combination that much more worthy to eat.<br />Olney is a great fan of vegetables. His discussions and recipes for vegetables are some of the best and this must be one of the things which attract Ms. Waters to his writings.<br />This book is a classic and easily high on the list of choices for my ten best. The Preface summarized above is a bit tough but if you have any interest in food other than something you need to keep you alive, this book will reward you.much richer for it without having made a single recipe.

This is David Lebovitz' first of two books on desserts. The second is devoted entirely to desserts made with fruits. This volume is more general, including recipes for just about every different type of dessert you may think of. The collection is weighted in favor of recipes which would work well in a restaurant, so the number of recipes typical to the home are less common than you may find in a more general book on dessert baking. That is not to say this is a poor book. In fact, I am happy I reviewed Lebovitz' more recent book first, so I was able to appreciate the virtues of this book which were missing from the second volume.<br />Lebovitz' introductory chapter on `Essentials' is divided into three sections, each an extremely useful tool to the home baker. First, is a discussion of equipment, which seems to me to be one of the best around for baking tools. The ingredients section is similarly useful, although I wish the author, who is so careful to be precise about other items would avoid the descriptions of `bittersweet' or `semisweet' for chocolate and use, instead the percent cocoa grades as used by Vahlrona, a brand which Lebovitz endorses. The third section of essentials on Fruits is the star of this part of the book. The author not only gives the best season and the best properties and uses for a large number of fruits, he also supplies an extremely useful picture of each and every fruit, although the picture for coconuts is a bit puzzling. There must be varieties of coconut I have never seen in the very untropical northeast.<br />Lebovitz must be especially fond of fruits, as this general book has a very large portion of its pages devoted to fruit, with a wealth of interesting information on various varieties. I was especially surprised to learn that the grapefruit is a human invention developed by crossing the pomelo with the orange. Who know. Lebovitz is true to the traditions of current and former Chez Panisse writers such as Alice Waters and Jeremiah Tower in that he is especially careful to note the variety names of various fruits and sometimes, like both Alice and Jeremiah, go so far as to specify the botanical species names. This is all very good, except that few markets distinguish types of fruits beyond apples and pears. I have never, ever seen any peaches labeled Carnival, Suncrest, Elegant Lady, Elberta, Flamecrest, or Cal Red. More importantly, I have never seen persimmons distinguished by variety, even though persimmon variety is much more important to the way it is used than with most types of peaches. But all of this is not a reflection on the book, only on the author's access to better than average greengrocers. Bottom line is that the pages on fruits in this book are worth the price of admission.<br />The various types of desserts discussed, each in their own chapter, are:<br />Cakes<br />Custards and Souffles<br />Fruit Desserts<br />Sorbets, Sherbets, Ice Creams, and Gelees<br />Cookies and Candies<br />Liqueurs and Preserves<br />As noted above, the author is positively in love with fruits, as they appear in virtually every type of dessert in every chapter. The chapter dedicated to fruit desserts has an especially good discussion on how to make fruit compotes. I confess the author has endeared himself to me by pointedly avoiding the pairing of fruit and chocolate. I have never liked the popular raspberry and chocolate combination, as all those gritty little seeds just seems to spoil the chocolate experience. Lebovitz does cross the line just once in combining blueberries with white chocolate in a tart. I'm good with that.<br />The book ends with a very worthy chapter on basics which includes separate recipes for tarts, pies, and galettes where many other authors would simply give you a single recipe for all three. As other authors such as Wayne Harley Brachman point out, these three pastries simply have different requirements from their doughs. The basics also includes a section on caramelizationguidelines. As this is an extremely scary topic for anyone like myself who has seen just enough Food Network shows to know what can go wrong, this section is invaluable.<br />The book's list of sources for equipment is better than average as it gives web sites, telephone numbers, and addresses, plus a detailing of what the organization supplies. The photographs are competent and add to the attractiveness of the book. The color scheme is much better than the glaring pink and orange used in the later book. The Bibliography is a delightful addition. I wish every cookbook had one. The entries point to many titles familiar to me and many which are not, which is even better.<br />This book is strongly recommended, especially for folks who are looking for new desserts for entertaining..

Once that is said, there are some things which are disappointing about this book.<br />First, the book only covers Christmas and New Year. I would hardly expect Molto Mario to cover Thanksgiving, but what about Easter? There are also the hundreds of festivals in both Italy and the United States where food is a major element of the festivities. The whole point of `carnevale' is food, as the meaning of the word is `a farewell to meat'.<br />Second, the book only covers Campania. What about the other 21 provinces of Italy? The best part of this selection is that it is the region from which the Italian food most familiar to America comes. I think Mario would have been much better to name the book `Holiday Food of Campania'. Joe Bastianich contributes some notes on the wines of Campania, reinforcing the impression that the book covers a limited range.<br />Third, the book is two-thirds the price for less than half the book you can find in Mario's first and third books.<br />If you are really interested in Italian Festival Food, check out the book of that name by Anne Bianchi published by Macmillan. It even includes a blurb from Mr. Molto himself on the dust jacket and I got it at a deep discount. Highly recommended.<br />All is not lost. This is still, after all, a cookbook by Mario. It's best feature is to give us recipes in order that we may do a Christmas Eve feast of the seven or ten or thirteen fishes (take your pick). It strikes me that this is another example where Italian food traditions depart broadly from the more formalized doctrines of France or Japan. While Richard Olney, our most analytical writer on French cuisine, dispairs of writing on improvisation in cooking, the Italians seem to revel in it. Like the Japanese, the Italians seem to really enjoy small portions of a lot of different dishes, at least at holiday meals. Mario warns us that because of this, portion sizes may be tricky.<br />The photographs of the food are much more colorful and more plentiful in this book than they are in Mario's first. They add some value to this rather slim offering. The list of sources at the back of the book is very good for a resident of New York City. I am especially happy to see DiPalo's cheese shop included.<br />If, like me, you are a Mario fan, you must have this book. This is especially true if you live vicariously through books and enjoy writers' tales of their holidays. If you are really looking for something with more meat on it's bones, check out the volume by Ms. Bianchi.sizes may be tricky.<br />The photographs of the food are much more colorful and more plentiful in this book than they are in Mario's first.

Now??<br />For those of you who are not swayed by emotional arguments, here goes the real review.<br />Jeremiah Tower has packed more useful, controversial, and scholarly material into this book than any three other celebrity chef cookbooks combined. There is much here with which many respected chefs would take issue, but that just adds to the pleasure of reading the book.<br />One issue on which I disagree with chef Tower is in replacing some French terms for common cooking items or practices with ?American? translations. As a cook, I will never have a thousandth of the credentials of Monsieur Tower, but I am something of an expert on language, and Tower is simply wrong on this point. For example, he substitutes the phrase ?aromatic vegetable mix? for the French term ?Mirepoix? meaning, 1 part chopped onion, 1 part chopped celery, and one part chopped carrot. Tower adds a bay leaf to the standard definition, with which I have no argument. The mistake is twofold. First, he is substituting his new usage for all vegetable mixes, including soffrito, sofregit, and picada. Well, each of these terms means something different from mirepoix, yet he is subsuming these different meanings under a new word. Second, this new term is unknown to his audience, while mirepoix is learned upon first opening one?s first book on French cooking. On more than one occasion while reading Tower?s recipes I had to scratch my head and think twice when he said ?aromatic vegetable mix?. If he would have used the word, mirepoix, I would have sailed right through that text with no confusion whatsoever. The same argument can be made for the terms ?Au Jus?, ?Bouquet Garni?, Mesclun?, and ?Duxelles?. Tower?s claim has some merit when it comes to using ?blue? in place of ?bleu? and ?cream? in place of ?Cr?me?, depending on context. So Tower is not a linguist, but he is a cook. His following section on the meaning of conventional English cooking terms is entertaining and dead on accurate.<br />Tower?s recommendations on standard techniques are impeccable, and there are a lot of them. His descriptions of brining, sweating, toasting, parboiling, and pureeing are fussy enough to make Alton Brown turn green with envy. The little essay on brining brings out another rich dimension to this book in that it identifies the source of current enthusiasm for brining to be Jane Grigson?s book ?The Art of Making Sausages, Pates, and other Charcuterie?.  Scholarly references like this may not mean much to some, but to me they are positively titillating. The book is packed with references to works going back to the seventeenth century, with a heavy concentration on the French classics by Careme, Escoffier, and Curnonsky. Unlike most other writers, it reminds the reader that there is not a whole lot in cookery which is really that new. My great regret on this theme is that Tower neglects to add a bibliography to this book so that one does not have to page back through the text to find the exact name of a fondly remembered reference. See his book ?California Eats? for an excellent bibliography.<br />Tower?s great hero among contemporary writers is Richard Olney, famous primarily as the editor of the Time-Life ?Good Cook? series and as the author on some of the most influential books on French cooking in English. Tower praises Olney for his search of quality, simplicity, and proper scholarship. It is clear that Tower has acquired the same values. However, some people, myself included, may be very puzzled by what the author calls simple. I will forego any long discussion of this until I read Olney?s famous interpretation of ?simple? in French cuisine but I will say that cooking is hard work and what is simple to Jeremiah Tower is just not so simple to amateurs like me. This does not, however, lessen the value of this book, it enhances it. Great results require exacting procedures and great respect for ingredients.<br />Tower?s attitudes about techniques and materials fits exactly into one of my favorite Mario Batali doctrines. If you make small improvements in the quality of your ingredients and your techniques, you will surely end up with dishes superior to those done without attention to these little details. While Mario and Tower have an enormous respect for one another, I am sure they have a lot of differences. One which stands out is Tower?s preference for fresh tomatoes in making tomato sauces. I?m afraid I have to side with Mario on this one and be happy with canned San Marzano tomatoes.<br />One of the most instructive of Tower?s obsessions is his recommending the mortar and pestle and the food mill over the blender and the food processor. I am certain he is right on these points.<br />Tower?s selection of recipes is largely from the French. All recipes show the same attention to detail. Some recipes and sidebar discussions give more than usual attention to ingredients like lobster, lettuce, and truffles, among others. Some recipes are truly simple and the novice should not dispair that the book has nothing for them. The instructions on stocks are dead on accurate. This man knows what he is doing. An interesting twist to this is that in more than one place, Tower prefers water to stock in order to bring out the tastes of the primary ingredients of the dish.<br />The book has no photographs of completed dishes, and I did not miss them. The impressionistic paintings by Donald Sultan add an ample visual quality to the work. The index is flawed. There are two references to Julia Child and I found at least three different references.<br />This book is a must for people with any interest in cooking., it enhances it.

This, together with Alice Water's substantial reputation sets the bar of expectations very high for this book.<br />Waters has established a niche for herself in the culinary world, which is not unlike that of Martha Stewart. She is the flag bearer for a culinary style which endorses using fresh local produce for both their health benefits and the economic benefits to small, artisinal farmers, ranchers, and fishermen, followed by a loving handling of these ingredients in the kitchen in order to draw out their best properties. Her similarity to Miss Martha is that both are vocal in their support of their lifestyle choices, yet they are not necessarily the most gifted craftsmen in their chosen fields. Both enhance their own standing by hosting true stars in the culinary world. Martha does it on her TV show with Mario and Eric and Jean-George and Daniel and a long line of other justly famous chefs. Alice does it in her kitchen where she has launched the careers of Jeremiah Tower and Paul Bertolli.<br />Ms. Waters' efforts may not have been as lucrative as Miss Martha's, but Alice has succeeded in establishing a leader's reputation in her field with no blemishes other than a few for possibly hogging a bit more credit than may be her due for the success of Chez Panisse and the creation of `California Cuisine'.<br />This book seems to answer one question puzzling me about California Cuisine. I have always wondered whether it was Miss Alice or Wolfgang Puck who first installed a pizza oven and started selling pizza in a distinctly un-Italian venue in California. Alice herein claims that Wolfgang got the idea from a visit to Chez Panisse. If Alice had any regrets about the glamorous Austrian's stealing her thunder, she can get satisfaction in having referred her incompetent German oven bricklayer to Wolfgang.<br />As I indicate in my title to this review, the book contains much more than you would expect to find in a conventional cookbook. It's content is much richer than Alice's book on vegetables, for example, in that it opens with a little history of the Chez Panisse Caf&eacute; and its style of service, clientele, and suppliers. The level of detail about the ingredients even matches the more specialized Vegetables book. After a while, it starts to read less and less like a cookbook and more and more like a culinary travelogue, the most famous of which is Patience Gray's `Honey from a Weed'. The travelogue aspect adds value for the reader, but it is not enough to carry the book to a full five star rating.<br />The culinary aspects of the book, the recipes, give a loving treatment of their ingredients, making every effort to respect the attributes of each foodstuff. The book does not, however, spell out every little detail of every technique. It does not, a la Alton Brown for example, give you careful steps for dealing with beets. It's mission is not to teach prepping, it is to communicate a knowledge and appreciation for all of the different types of beets available to you, once you have established your connections with local farmers. I have not found any extremely difficult recipes in this book, but an amateur with a fair level of skill will enjoy the book much more than it will by a rank newbie.<br />Just as with Patience Gray's book, not having a source of nettles for my pasta will not detract from my pleasure in reading about how nettles are prepared. I am truly amazed at the extent to which foraging for `weeds' continues to this day in some European societies. But back to Alice.<br />I give this book good marks for giving the name of every recipe, not just chapter titles, in the table of contents. This little feature always enhances the value of a cookbook. This value is further enhanced by listing recipes by major ingredient rather than by course. This fits the style of the earlier book on Vegetables and makes finding an appropriate recipe even easier. This organization is taken to it's logical conclusion in that even pantry recipes commonly put into a separate chapter are slotted by ingredient so that chicken stock is in the chapter on chicken and so on.<br />The recipes cover the most simple salads to some of the most unusual products such as boudin blanc, a French white sausage of chicken and pork. The range of recipes is simply a result of Alice's staying on message. These are all the recipes made at the Chez Panisse Caf&eacute;, and only recipes made at the Chez Panisse Caf&eacute;.<br />While several recipes may be beyond the skills, time constraints, budget, or ingredient availability of many readers, the book succeeds in providing great value. As a source of salad recipes alone, the book is first rate. Salads are one of Alice Waters' most passionate subjects. While my title to this review holds back any claim that this is a classic like `Honey from a Weed', it is the equal to the very similar, recent book `The Vineyard Garden' to which I gave five stars. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who shares Alice Waters' ideals.

816505:US	39134375	R1MGXEO51QNAUE	0375508910	234523199	Live, Love, Eat!: The Best of Wolfgang Puck	Books	5	16	18	N	N	Wolfgang Delivers More Than I Expect. Sound Cooking	On the face of it, Wolfgang is unquestionably one of the best-known names in the world of culinary celebrities. To the great general public, he is probably the only name and face to outshine Emeril Legasse. But, the celebrity of both men seems to be based more on media exposure than on sound culinary achievements. While chefs such as Thomas Keller, Charlie Trotter, Daniel Boulud, and Tom Colicchio are less well known, their reputation with foodies is soundly based on culinary achievement, even if only known through their writings and reputation through media reviews. Puck's reputation to the world at large is based primarily on his position as caterer to the Academy Awards and other high visibility Hollywood events. He has a fairly large network of successful restaurants, including some middle end chain style establishments. I have always had the suspicion that he stole some thunder from Chez Panisse in the popularization of `California Cuisine', especially since Jeremiah Tower, the self-proclaimed inventor of this movement looks down his nose at Puck in his book `California Bites'. Similarly, Tower buddy Jim Villas, not known for having any California stripes, thinks little of LA's Puck while praising New Orleans' Lagasse. Lastly, Wolfgang has gone the budget route in lending his name to a low end line of cookware, competing with Martha Stewart's everyday ware rather than with Emeril's high-end All-Clad lines.<br />So does Wolfgang have real chops in the kitchen?<br />The evidence of this book is that his written cuisine is at least as good as Emeril's, his teaching approaches the quality of Jacques Pepin, and his creativity with the fusion of Latin American and Oriental cuisines with European concepts appear no less tasty than those of Norm Van Aken. The only thing the book lacks is that little twist most celebrity chefs give their books nowadays. The twist here is simply that it is from Wolfgang Puck.<br />The good things about this book are:<br />1. Listing of all recipe names in the Table of Contents. This feature automatically makes a good cookbook more valuable, especially a mid-sized celebrity chef book like this. This fits the best use of the book as a resource for finding dishes for entertaining to fit a particular theme or taste.<br />2. The emphasis on the sensory queues to the progress of cooking rather than on blind timings. All good chefs repeat this principle, but Wolfgang puts it front and center. This is a central skill of the professional chef whose work would be simply impossible if she worked by time with half a dozen dishes fired at a saute station at the height of service. It is also one of those professional tricks which should be learned by the home cook. The problem of the amateur is that while the recipe may have been written using a gas range and a zinc clad copper saute pan, the cook at home is probably using an electric range with a Teflon coated aluminum pan. And that is just one of the variables.<br />3. Puck's chapter on basics is first rate, including very useful pictures at all the right places. It covers all the usual techniques for artichoke surgery, but it also includes recipes for court bouillon, puff pastry, and fish stock. I am of two minds with material like this. There are books which include a few pages of worthwhile material and try to give the impression that this is all you need to know, when people such as Jaques Pepin and James Peterson have written whole books on this subject and have not exhausted the subject. So wouldn't the author have been better off devoting this space to more recipes? On balance, I think Wolfgang did us a service and his material here makes me want to seek out his earlier books to find more of the same material.<br />4. Wolfgang's recipes are a pretty fair mix of the traditional, such as the oft repeated Pasta Puttanesca and the chicken pot pie, to the trademark neuvo Pizza with smoked salmon and caviar.<br />On the negative size, Wolfgang's English writing seems to have the same Austrian accent as his speech. I'm really surprised that a publishing house such as Random House couldn't supply a copy editor to smooth out some of the more mangled wordings. Also, the subtitle of this volume is `The Best of Wolfgang Puck', but it doesn't make clear whether that means the best material from his earlier books, the best recipes from his restaurants, or the best material from his TV shows. This is a small matter, but it would have added value to the material.<br />As someone, like Wolfgang, of Austrian background, I am often disappointed that the second most prominent Austrian-American (after Arnold Schwarzenneger) who also happens to be a famous chef does not do a book of Austrian food. But, this book is no slouch. I would recommend it to anyone who has few cookbooks and is looking for an entertaining menu resource or simply for a wider variety of recipes. It is just slightly pricy at list price for 125 recipes, so look for it at a discount. For foodies, this book gives good value in honing one's pantry ingredients and prep skills.<br />As other reviewers have noted, these are not quick or easy recipes, but they are worthy of anyone with the time and interest in improving their cooking skills.ng seems to have the same Austrian accent as his speech.

818127:US	39134375	R5J8JV1IR2QT3	047145141X	31238846	America's Best Chefs Cook with Jeremiah Tower	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Chef's Sampler Menu of Some of our Best Chefs	This book reprises the Julia Child PBS series with chef Jeremiah Tower taking the place of Ms. Julia in working with a selection of chefs selected by their having won a James Beard award for best chef, best regional chef, or best restaurant, or more than one of the above. Since the selection can in no way be considered all of the very best chefs in the country, I suspect their availability and willingness to participate had a lot to do with the selection.<br />The book delivers a little more than what I expected in that recipes are arranged by course or main ingredient rather than by chef. This means the book is less a chronicle of the PBS series than it is an aid to the reader in finding useful recipes therein. The chapter titles are:<br />Snacks, First Courses, and Sandwiches<br />Salads and Soups<br />Pasta, Breads, and Grains<br />Fish and Shellfish<br />Poultry, Rabbit, and Foie Gras<br />Meats<br />Vegetables<br />Desserts<br />Basic Recipes<br />The book begins with a one to two page biography of each chef plus a listing of all awards won by their, cooking, their restaurants, or their books. Charlie Trotter is the hands down winner in this category, as he is probably also the best known name among all the chefs in the book. Tower also provides a one to two page sidebar of thoughts on each chef, primarily what it is like to cook in their kitchens. The TV show and Tower traveled to each chef's restaurant in order to tape each episode.<br />Tower also provides all the recipes for the pantry preparations such as stocks, sauces, and doughs. To my lights, the techniques for doing the stocks is fussy enough to get good results but not so fussy as to discourage you from doing it. The chicken and veal stock procedures correctly instruct you to blanch the bones and to discard the blanching water before cooking the bones in earnest. The fish stock recipe very wisely keeps the cooking to less than 30 minutes. Other authorities have stated that a longer cooking time will turn the stock bitter. Let no one think that Tower does not know his stuff and he is not dumbing it down for the amateur chef.<br />Tower is less the writer than he is the chef. I found a few awkward sentences that were not caught by the publisher's copy editors.<br />My favorite thing about books like this is the insight they give to the way great chefs think about ingredients and techniques. Like great athletes whose eye to hand coordination seems almost superhuman or like great chess players who see possibilities in positions which totally escape mere mortals, great chefs seem to be able to compose recipes from an accidental coming together of ingredients as easily as they breathe. This is the premise behind Tom Colicchio's book `How to Think Like a Chef' and it is the mantra that all chefs repeat when they talk about developing their courses for the evening based on what is available in the market that day. Tower gives a few demonstrations of this skill as he provides about 10 percent of the recipes in the book in addition to his contribution of pantry recipes.<br />The guest chefs largely supply recipes, which are staples at their respective restaurants. I was surprised at some of the omissions. For example, there was neither a bread recipe or sandwich recipe from Nancy Silverton, who has done a whole book on sandwiches. Of the recipes, which do appear, none are ordinary or especially easy. And, since almost all dishes were from the classic American, French, or Italian canon, there were few hard to find ingredients, although some did show up. People living a day's drive from the Pacific coast may have a hard time getting Dungeness crabs. Some dishes such as Alain Ducasse's BLT, Michael Romano's chicken Saltimbocca, and Gail Gand's Hungarian Crepes were tricked up versions of simple classics. Some dishes were `restaurant only' recipes such as Ken Oringer's Roast Suckling Pig.<br />There are several reasons for acquiring this book:<br />1. All recipes promise tobe delicious, although many are pricy and involve a fair amount of skill.<br />2. There are a large number of lamb recipes. A major plus if that is your favorite meat.<br />3. It gives excellent techniques for pantry preparations.<br />One drawback is that if you already own a fair collection of cookbooks, you will get substantial overlap of basic recipes such as the aforementioned saltimbocca and crepes. A small annoyance is Tower's less than perfect wordsmithing and lapses in the Index. The chicken saltimbocca was missing from the Index.<br />This book delivers on the quality of recipes what it promises.ough many are pricy and involve a fair amount of skill.<BR>2.

819475:US	39134375	R3IJQFSYL84W6M	0060185058	690545449	New World Kitchen: Latin American and Caribbean Cuisine	Books	5	22	24	N	N	A Rich Sampler of Pan American Cuisines	The multi-award winning Norman Van Aken of the restaurant `Norman's' in Miami has done us a great service by providing us this survey of New World Latin cooking plus a precis of the many influences which have borne on these cuisines. The geographic range of the recipes is truly impressive. The countries or regions to which the recipes are attributed are:<br />Pan Caribbean  19 recipes<br />Pan Latin  19 recipes<br />Cuba  19 recipes<br />Mexico  18 recipes<br />Peru  14 recipes<br />Brazil  12 recipes<br />Colombia  9 recipes<br />Venezuela  8 recipes<br />Nicaragua  5 recipes<br />4 recipes: Argentina, Chile, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Trinidad<br />2 recipes: Ecuador, Guatemala, El Salvador<br />1 recipe: Bahamas, Bolivia, Central America, Dominica, Martinique, Panama, Uruguay<br />The book also includes several pantry, sauce, and mixed drink recipes not attributed to any specific region. The pantry recipes owe much to classic French technique, which Van Aken taught himself early in his career. The recipes for chicken and pork stock follow traditional methods, but they include a lot more ingredients than the French classics. Most notable additions are wine, mushrooms, tomatoes, and chiles.<br />The large number of recipes from Mexico and Cuba are expected for a chef working in Miami, especially with the acknowledgments he gives to Rick Bayless and Diana Kennedy, our leading experts on Mexican cuisine. The emphasis on Peru becomes obvious when you see the references to Nobu Matsuhisa, who worked for many years in Peru and who has popularized many dishes based on Peruvian themes and foodstuffs.<br />The sizable body of congratulatory blurbs on the back cover of the book from the likes of Nobu, Mario Batali, Charlie Trotter, Todd English, and Emeril Lagasse attest to the quality of his cooking and, more importantly for you the reader, the quality of his researches into this `New World Cuisine'. I think the most important quality of the book is not culinary invention. Van Aken is not taking any credit for creating these recipes. His accomplishment is in the collecting and exposition of these recipes and their most important ingredients for us.<br />Van Aken is especially wise to not call this Latin American cuisine, as he makes it clear that the cuisine of the lands south of the Rio Grande have been created by an amalgam of Native American, Spanish, East Indian, Chinese, Japanese, African, Portuguese, Italian, and Polynesian influences. While Van Aken claims credit for inventing the phrase `fusion cuisine' it is plain that `fusion cuisine' has been going on in the New World since South American (Polynesian?) mariners carried plants from Pacific Islands to South America's Pacific coast. This activity expanded with a vengeance in both the old and new worlds as American foods such as corn, tomatoes, potatoes, and chiles were taken to both Europe and Asia and Old World foods came to America. For example, Italian and Sechuzen cuisines changed dramatically with the introduction of tomatoes and chiles respectively.<br />One of Van Aken's contributions to these recipes is to replace original peanut or palm oils with canola or grape seed oil. It's interesting to note that deep frying was never done in pre-Columbian America, as the natives, even the Aztecs and the Incas did not refine oils in sufficient quantities to use it as a deep frying medium. Another addition by Van Aken is wine and beer pairings with recipes. It is possible that he also contributed to the use of European fortified wines in recipes, although that may very easily be a Portuguese addition.<br />The background information on major ingredients and major influences is almost worth the price of admission. This is not a scholarly book, a thorough study of one or a few cuisines in the style of Diana Kennedy on Mexico or Paula Wolfert on Morocco. But its contents have much of the authority of a scholarly work. It is a sampling of recipes from many lands which makes this a much more valuable book to the typical foodie. All the recipes are first rate stuff, presented by a passionate and talented chef.<br />I highly recommend this book as an introduction to the cuisines of the Caribbean and of South America. The bibliography will also offer many sources of additional information on this cuisine. This book is worthy of Norman's colleagues' praise.arly work.

Through his show `Molto Mario' on the Food Network, he exposed me for the first time to Italian regional and microregional cuisines and the `if it grows together, it goes together' doctrine. This is called `terroir by the fans of cooking from `the F country', which Mario loves to hate. This also brought into full light the doctrine of `buy the very best of what is fresh today and that will determine what you cook tonight.' Mario does not give you the cerebral approach of someone like Paul Bertolli or Tom Colicchio or, ultimately, like Thomas Keller, but Mario gets all the important stuff right, in a way we can appreciate and use.<br />I love the way Mario quite honestly confesses to having lifted most of his recipes from Italian grandmothers, as he believes that the best Italian cooking is done in the home and not in the Restaurante. In spite of his heart being with Italian cuisine, he is never disrespectful of American food and produce, especially when the American product is superior to the Italian.<br />This book is comprised of recipes primarily from the extended three-year stage he served in a little trattoria in Emilia-Romagna, a stones throw from the border with Toscana. But, it does contain several recipes from other parts of Emilia-Romagna, Toscana, Lazio (Rome) and even Sicily. His two `villages' are Porretta Terme in Italy and Greenwich Village in Manhattan.<br />The book has six chapters of recipes, these being:<br />Antipasti, 43 recipes including crostini, bruschetta, polenta, pickled vegetables, mushrooms, and cured fish.<br />Primi (pasta or rice), 49 recipes including recipes for fresh pastas, gnocchi, couscous, and risottos.<br />Seconde (main dish)<br />  Pesce (fish), 27 recipes including scallops, calamari, prawns, crabs, lobster, snapper, and even frogs' legs.<br />  Carne (meat), 32 recipes including rabbit, pheasant, lamb, veal, beef, sausage, liver, and sweetmeats.<br />Contorni (side dishes) 26 recipes including polenta, many vegetable dishes, grilled, fried, and pickled.<br />Formaggi &amp; Dolce (cheese and sweets) 27 recipes including fruit and confections with funny names.<br />Each section includes pantry recipes for sauces and dressings not included in this count.<br />I would recommend this book primarily for the reading of Mario's unvarnished enthusiasm for food and the Italian dedication to (relative) simplicity of method and freshness of your `prima materia'. I would also highly recommend his basic tomato sauce (I make it all the time) and his recipes using fresh pasta. As he points out, there is a big difference between the fresh pasta of the north and the dry pasta of the south both in the way they are made, in the types of flour used, and in the sauces appropriate to each. Mario's recommendations on making and dressing pasta are worth the price of admission.<br />The black and white or sepia photographs of Mario and his colleagues at the trattoria lend a warm `gemutlichkeit' (sorry, I don't know the Italian word) to the proceedings. The color photos are better than average, in that the photographer succeeds in getting the entire dish in focus.<br />I highly recommend the book for the authenticity of the recipes and his introduction into a deeper appreciation of Italian food. It is not a complete presentation of Italian dishes, but it is a great partner to a broader treatment done by Marcella Hazan, Lydia Bastianich, Giuliano Bugialli, or the Cooks Illustrated volume on Classic Italian recipes. I agree with those who warn that the book is not for novices, but is the sort of book which can show the way from innocence to experience.liver, and sweetmeats.<BR>Contorni (side dishes) 26 recipes including polenta, many vegetable dishes, grilled, fried, and pickled.<BR>Formaggi &amp; Dolce (cheese and sweets) 27 recipes including fruit and confections with funny names.<br />Each section includes pantry recipes for sauces and dressings not included in this count.<br />I would recommend this book primarily for the reading of Mario's unvarnished enthusiasm for food and the Italian dedication to (relative) simplicity of method and freshness of your `prima materia'.

There is probably no other similarly sized region on earth with so many world class foodstuffs. At the top of the list stands Parmigiano-Reggiano, Balsamic Vinegar, and Prosciutto de Parma followed by a long tradition of salume, wines, and classic ragu and pasta recipes. The interest of the region is doubled by the fact that Emilia and Romagna have two different cuisines. The former is more traditional and is based primarily on butter. The latter is more adventuresome, more seafood, and more olive oil. This all contributes to a major head start for this book as a major culinary resource.<br />Ms. Caggiano is a native of Bologna and still has a substantial family living in and around the city, so her recipes have a certain cachet, which may be missing from the average Italian cookbook. Her chapter subjects are very traditional, being:<br />Antipasti<br />Savory Breads and Savory Fritters<br />Soups<br />Pasta<br />Risotto, Gnocchi, and Polenta<br />Seafood<br />Poultry and Meat<br />Vegetables<br />Salads<br />Cakes, Tarts, Fritters, Biscotti, Ice Cream, and Fruit Desserts<br />While it may not be an entirely fair comparison, I matched this volume to Lydia Bastianich's book `Lydia's Italian Kitchen'. Although Ms. Bastianich is covering all of Italy, her strength is in northern Italy, as is Ms. Caggiano. Both books have about 400 pages at $30 for Ms. Lydia and $38 for Ms. Biba. The indexes for both books are friendly to both Italian impaired and those who know and relish all the lovely Italian names for recipes. Ms. Bastianich takes the slightly more scholarly approach of having complete duplicate listings with separate listings, for example, of `frico con ripieno di patate e funghi' and `potato and mushroom filling for frico'. Ms. Caggiano gives the Italian name with a reference to the English translation, as in `cacciatora, see hunter-style'.<br />The two books give almost identical coverage to major topics such as gnocchi. I would give a slight edge to Ms. Lydia for her gnocchi, although I will concede that differences in recipes may be due to regional differences. For some reason, Ms. Lydia includes egg in her potato gnocchi and Ms. Biba does not. To break the tie, I referred to Waverly Root's book on Italian cuisine. He says a very little egg is typically included. Mario Batali's book on Emilia-Romagna gives a potato recipe almost identical to that of Ms. Lydia. Ms. Biba does have some recipes such as cacciatora style dishes, ragu Bolognese, and baccala (salt cod) that are not in Ms. Lydia's book.<br />In general, I believe Ms. Lydia gives more complete instructions on general topics such as artichokes, although their treatments of fresh pasta seem comparable. I would really like to have both available, as it is clear that both know what they are doing.<br />Sidebars and headnotes in the two books are equally entertaining, with no overlap. If Ms. Biba's book were the only one available on the cuisine of Emilia-Romagna, I would welcome both books on my bookshelf. At the moment, I know of no other book, which claims to cover the whole province. Mario's book, 'Simple Italian Food' only covers recipes from a single trattoria on the boundary of Toscana and Emilia-Romagna. To those without any Italian cookbook, I would recommend Ms. Lydia's book, as it claims to cover the whole country.

823622:US	39134375	R1W8USAOLC2A40	0811816869	642253514	The Bread Bible: Beth Hensperger's 300 Favorite Recipes	Books	4	165	176	N	N	A Bible for the Home, but not for the Seminary	This is the first of two books by the same name `The Bread Bible' written by Beth Hensperger and published by Chronicle Books in 1999. The second book with this title, written by Rose Levy Beranbaum and published by W. W. Norton &amp; Company in 2003 I have reviewed earlier, before I discovered this title.<br />This occurrence is actually a rare good fortune, as it gives us a chance to compare two essays of exactly the same subject and pick that effort which does the better job on the subject. Both authors appear to have ample credentials for the chuzpah required to write a book with such a pretentious title. Ms. Hensperger has written five other books on bread baking and Ms. Beranbaum has written three other large, well received books on baking, two of which are also `bibles' on their topics.<br />Ms. Hensperger gives us 473 pages of text and 21 pages of index at $32.50 while Ms. Beranbaum gives us 608 pages of text and 21 pages of index for $35.00. Ms. Hensperger gives us 25 very useful introductory pages on equipment, flour, and general techniques. Ms. Beranbaum gives us 62 pages of what I considered to be a model of culinary writing on the ten essential steps to making bread. This is the first sign that Ms. Beranbaum is aiming at a much more sophisticated audience than Ms. Hensperger.<br />Ms. Hensperger gives us no color photographs or diagrams illustrating techniques. The few line drawings seem to be primarily for decoration. Ms. Beranbaum's book provides four sections of full color photographs of the baked products essayed in the book. She also provides many pages of expertly done line drawings illustrating baking techniques such as the `business letter fold', layering foccacia with herbs, and making sticky buns. Other line drawings give very good pictures of baking equipment.<br />Ms. Hensperger's Table of Contents with the name of each and every recipe spelled out is much more to my taste than Ms. Beranbaum's simple chapter headings. Fitting Ms. Hensperger's home baker orientation, she has two whole chapters devoted to using a food processor and a bread machine for bread recipes. Ms. Beranbaum discusses bread machines, finds useful things they can do, but ultimately keeps them on the sidelines due to their small capacity and the tendency of most to heat the dough, causing a too fast rise in the dough for optimum taste. Rose is certainly not a Luddite, as she makes extensive use of  the KitchenAid stand mixer and its big brother the Hobart stand mixer. I prefer to not use bread machines. If you are comfortable with them, Ms. Hensperger may have more to offer you.<br />It is no surprise that both authors deal with brioche. Ms. Hensperger includes four recipes for brioche and three variations. All are embedded in a chapter on egg breads including Challah. Ms. Beranbaum devotes a whole chapter of 45 pages to brioche, including Challah, cinnamon buns, panettone, and a provocatively named `stud muffin'. Lots of variations on each recipe are given. As with all recipes, Ms. Beranbaum's approach is much more detailed and precise. The most obvious sign is that all of Rose's recipes give ingredients in both volume and weight in imperial and metric units. This feature alone would swing my choice in favor of Ms. Beranbaum's work. Another example of Rose's precision is that she specifies the high gluten brands of all-purpose flour rather than simple `all-purpose flour. I am constantly amazed at the variety in recipes for brioche. Like every other authoritative recipe, both recommend an overnight rise, but the two recipes start the sponge in much different ways, with Ms. Beranbaum using a much more finicky approach, being very careful to avoid exposing the yeast in the sponge to salt than Ms. Hensperger. When separating the dough to be put into molds, Ms. Hensperger is unconcerned about differences in size. Ms. Beranbaum is not compulsive about same sizes, but does recommend a scale to achieve uniform amounts of dough in the molds.<br />Neither author oversimplifies her procedures, but Rose Beranbaum consistently gives a much more professional instruction and a deeper understanding about what is going on along the way. Both have an ample amount of passion and love for what they are doing. If you are a home baker and can find Ms. Hensperger's book at a good discount, you will not go wrong. If you are a baking hobbyist or even aspiring to being a professional baker, then Ms. Beranbaum's book is the one you want. Both are excellent. Ms. Beranbaum and her publishers seem to have invested much more energy, money, and precision into their volume.<br />Judging from other reviewers comments, some errors have been detected in this book. The same is true of Ms Beranbaum's book. This issue is a wash and I have stopped holding a small number of minor errors like that against cookbooks.br />Neither author oversimplifies her procedures, but Rose Beranbaum consistently gives a much more professional instruction and a deeper understanding about what is going on along the way.

The first thing which most impressed me about the book was how fascinating and charming it was to read about the author's life with her many siblings, parents, grandmother, and neighbors. The second thing, which impressed me, was how dull her recipes were from a strictly culinary point of view.<br />An example of the monotony is the eleven salad recipes in the first chapter. The first recipe is a simple version of the Waldorf salad and the second salad is a simple cole slaw. The remaining nine recipes are simply variations on the same mayonnaise, pickle relish, celery, and sweet pepper salad combined with a protein and appropriate spices. The recipes for sweets and pastries are similarly very common versions of recipes we have all seen a dozen times over.<br /> This is not to say the recipes had no interest. As a case study of culinary anthropology, it is fascinating to compare this cuisine with the rustic Italian cuisine, which is heavily based on `the fifth quarter' of the pig plus cured pork products. The differences are even more interesting. In spite of a life based greatly on subsistence farming, fishing, hunting, and gathering, there is no mention of curing, preserving, or cheese making or any other activity which would come to elevate Italian food to it's high place in the world's cuisines. This is not to belittle this rural South Carolina cuisine, but to point out the genius behind food in Italy.<br />The industry, pride, and ingenuity involved in the collection of raw foodstuffs on Daufuskie are truly amazing in light of the slim resources available. Fishing nets were made by hand. Wooden hoe, shovel, and rake handles were made and placed in their metal parts by hand. Tilling was done with a plough worthy of a museum of 17th century agriculture, drawn by a steer. All cultivation and harvesting was done by hand. Iron tools were all sharpened by hand.<br />All this takes place against a backdrop of the local business, oyster canning, being destroyed by pollution from modern industry befouling the waters of the Savannah River. A second theme is how the natives of this backwater island succeeded in living by their wits in the enforced absence of decent education up until the success of the civil rights movement of the late 1960s.<br />I was expecting a bit more from these recipes, especially after seeing the author demonstrate some of her recipes on Sara Moulton's Food Network show. But, I will give Ms. Moulton's producers full credit for filming segments on Daufuskie Island itself, showing up that the way of life on that island is the real hero of this book. I would buy it for it's effective evocation of this way of life and it's snapshot of an unvarnished poor rural subsistence living cuisine.wn by a steer.

I'm not entirely sure what the trendy term `old school' means, exactly, especially as I have mostly seen it in connection with motorcycles, but I am certain that Jim Villas is an `old school' culinary writer and that casseroles are an `old school' kind of food.<br />Jim Villas, although much younger, belongs to the James Beard school of culinary writing, along with his Beard prot&eacute;g&eacute;s Barbara Kafka and Marian Cunningham. As he recounts in this book, the American casserole, based on several different European precursors, clearly reached it's apotheosis after World War II and went into eclipse in the late seventies and eighties with the scorning of canned and otherwise processed ingredients.<br />That the casserole is making a comeback is also clear from both this book and from it's starring role in a recent episode of Alton Brown's very trendy `Good Eats' Food Network show.<br />In the introduction to the book, Villas eschews some of the less savory casserole ingredients of yore such as canned meats and vegetables, frozen chives, dried parsley flakes, processed cheeses, liquid smoke, MSG, crushed potato chips or canned fruit cocktail. He is not entirely born again, since he does embrace some traditional casserole roles and ingredients such as canned soups, frozen vegetables, dried noodles, bread stuffings, and leftovers. In fact, some themes are so close to the `Good Eats' episode that I suspect Alton Brown may have used this book as a reference for his show.<br />The book opens with a very worthy introduction on casserole `hardware' materials and sizes plus advice on freezing casseroles. The casserole pantry repeats the theme of a reasonable use of prepackaged ingredients, citing Campbell's condensed cream of chicken, cream of mushroom, and cream of celery soups as essential. Some recipes even state that he tried to create the casserole with a homemade replacement for the Campbell's product and found the home brewed substitute wanting.<br />The names of casserole types are a feast for the crossword puzzle addict. There are quiches, stratas, scrambles, pilafs, pies, perloos, surprises, suppers, shroupes, royales, supremes, puddings, bakes, gratins, souffles, cobblers, crisps, crunches, and delights. Some of these names such as quiches, pilafs, and souffles indicate that the author may be coloring outside the lines a bit here and there, but I do not find this a criticism of the book. It adds to the value of the book as a source of good one-dish meals centered on the American classic. The author also seem to color outside the lines a bit when he includes some of his own recipes, but as Jim Villas has recently acquired the status of a classic American writer, I will give him a pass to contribute classic recipes himself.<br />This is one of my favorite kinds of cookbooks, as it makes it easy to find a recipe to fit a particular need. Anyone who shares that attitude about cookbooks will do well to purchase a copy of this book.ole with a homemade replacement for the Campbell's product and found the home brewed substitute wanting.<br />The names of casserole types are a feast for the crossword puzzle addict.

826180:US	39134375	R3AJZ1VC4DVJOB	0393016714	843071065	A Thousand Years over a Hot Stove: A History of American Women Told Through Food, Recipes, and Remembrances	Books	3	24	42	N	N	Ambitious Documentary on Women and Food in America	This journalistic account of women and food by Laura Schenone has the air of a Ken Burns documentary in text and photographs filled with anecdotal information, `sound byte' sidebars, and photographs and drawings contemporary to the times detailed in the text. The subject seems promising, as the subtitle is `A History of American Women Told Through Food, Recipes, and Remembrances'.<br />First, I would like to congratulate the author and the book layout designers and artists at W. W. Norton for a very nicely composed and bound book. This accounted for at least half of the reason I decided to buy the book. The other half was the expectation of an entertaining read somewhere in the same style of Eric Schlosser's `Fast Food Nation' or possibly an M. F. K. Fisher influenced collection of essays on women and food.<br />I was disappointed for at least two reasons.<br />The first was that unlike Schlosser's deservedly famous book, there was no central theme to the narrative. It was very much like Henri Bergson's complaint about 19th century philosophy of being a series of pearls with no connecting string. In the chapter on the later 20th century, there are paragraphs devoted to Julia Child, Rachael Carson, Alice Waters, Frances Moore Lappe, and Betty Friedan, with practically no common thread connecting them. They were all simply people who had an influence on food trends in the middle third of the last century. Even here, much was missed. I sincerely agree with the author's placing Julia Child as the most influential person in American culinary change in the 20th century, yet Schenone misses some of Child's biggest influences. She has been credited with single-handedly broadening the range of foodstuffs available in local supermarkets through her justifiably famous public TV shows.<br />The second was that Ms. Schenone did not get all her facts right. I am willing to believe that this is true because of a failure of research and copy editing. Her assessment of Alice Waters, for example, buys into the myth of Lady Alice as the chef who is the driving force behind the California cuisine and thereby the new American cuisine. This overlooks the very important role played by both chef Jeremiah Tower and chef Paul Bertolli in the success of Chez Panisse. Tower especially is instrumental in the popularization of California cuisine, as he is willing to say over and over again. I suspect Tower may be overstating his case a bit, but in the foodie world, it is well known that while Waters deserves great credit for starting Chez Panisse and setting it's agenda, the real cooking and much of the culinary inspiration came from her (male) chefs.<br />Other annoyances I found were occasional less than perfect wordsmithing. For example, she describes Martha Stewart as a `media scion'. A scion of what? For all of Martha's blemishes, one of her more admirable aspects is that she is quite literally self-made, having practically invented the upper middle class lifestyle / entertaining genre from a lower middle class background. I do give the author points for giving Martha her due share of the credit in influencing American lifestyles. On the next page of her book, I take those points away due to a snide aside on the `high-fallutin' style of Williams-Sonoma.<br />The book deserves a lot of credit for it's many tales of women's life with food going back to pre-Columbian days. In the introduction, she even indulges in a bit of mythmaking about prehistoric women's' roles in food gathering and invention. I call this mythmaking since there are no bibliographic references to scholarly sources for the introduction. Beginning with Chapter 1, most anecdotes are backed up by scholarly references in the bibliography, although it should have been better done with notes connecting particular statements with specific references.<br />It's ironic that the title cites a thousand years over a hot stove, while the text says that a proper iron stove was not available to theAmerican housewife until after the Civil War. The book does redeem itself from several sins by recounting the extent to which commercially available foodstuffs were corrupted by processing in the 19th century before the advent of federal regulation with the Food and Drug Administration. These were the days when the difference between packaged and farmers market food was a whole lot more dramatic than it is today.<br />If there is any theme to the book, it may be the irony that many food inventions originated with women, yet the world of commercial food production and haute cuisine cooking is largely the world of men. The former is easy to understand, as men ruled the world of commerce since Og traded furs with Mog in Neolithic times. The latter deserves some explanation, which I could not find in this book. My pet theory is that the work of a commercial restaurant kitchen demands a kind of athletic stamina of which men can reasonably be said to have more.<br />I agree with the author that `la cuisine Bourgeoisie' was the invention of women. Haute cuisine is based on the women's cuisine of the common folk, enhanced and codified by the chefs to nobility and the wealthy.<br />The choice of photographs shows skill and some good research. The connection between the photographs with the text is sometimes less than perfect, but on balance, the selection of photographs is one of the best features of the book. The choice of recipes is fair, but generally simply illustrations of points in the main text rather than of any real culinary value.<br />I generally enjoyed reading the book, but I was disappointed by some inaccuracies when I had independent information on the subject. This made me suspect those chapters where I did not have confirming background information. I suspect the author would have done better to adapt a more strictly documentary tone. These aspects of the narrative succeed and the polemic tone in the book does not.American housewife until after the Civil War.

828842:US	39134375	R1F0XU9J5S756H	1590170032	612114712	A Book of Mediterranean Food (New York Review Books Classics)	Books	5	31	34	N	Y	Literate Fountainhead of Much Culinary Writing	This volume is one of the very few culinary titles published over fifty years ago, which is not only still in print, but still influencing how people think about food. To understand the importance of the book, it is more than usually important to place it in context, in the England of 1950 which was just coming out of six years of World War II followed by four years of rationing austerity, when a pound of butter was difficult to find and olive oil was sold by the pint in apothecaries `for external use only'.<br />Complimentary blurbs from Alice Waters can be found on many books nowadays, but this one I know is more heartfelt than usual. Based on Jeremiah Tower's recent memoir, I know David influenced both Waters and Tower. She was also a major influence on later writers on Mediterranean cuisine such as Claudia Roden and Paula Wolfert.<br />David's notion of Mediterranean cuisine is somewhat limited to the western and central European coasts of Spain, France, Italy, and Greece, even though David did live and work in Egypt during World War II. Even here, she seems to color outside the lines a bit, reaching as far north and west as Lyon and Bordeaux. There is little here from North Africa. There is not even a mention of couscous in the index. To remedy this deficiency, David refers us to Claudia Roden's excellent book on Near Eastern food.<br />I can imagine that the recipes, foodstuffs, and stories of the Mediterranean shores had much the same influence on post-war Londoners as Provence had on the painting of Cezanne. David's word pictures brought the bright light and blue seas into the London parlors and stirred an interest, which had been dormant for over 10 years. The evidence of this was that, against all expectations, the book sold very well in 1950 and it has been reissued with new introductions in 1958, 1065, 1988, and 2002, the last time with the Foreword by Clarissa Dickson Wright of `Two Fat Ladies' fame.<br />David's recipe writing is very much tied to her times and her English public school and university education. There is no hint of food processor or blender, let alone microwave. All purees are done with mortar and pestle. For those who are not familiar with this venerable tool, let me assure you that with little effort, if will often give equal or better results than the electric gizmos of today, especially with classics such as aioli and pesto. Just check out the pleasure Jamie Oliver shows in using it. The style of recipe writing may also be unfamiliar. David is assuming that the reader is a knowledgeable cook. She takes for granted, for example, that you know how to peel tomatoes and cook potatoes for salads or puree. Most directions are spare. Ms. Wright testifies that she often uses them as reminders of how to write a concise recipe.<br />The names of things may also be unfamiliar. Eggplants are called aubergines and porcini mushrooms are called cepes. These were not hard, but the reference to marrows (courgettes) sent be scurrying to the Larousse Gastronomique. They are zucchini. Many dish names are given in their untranslated French, Italian, Spanish, or Greek. Some other familiar dishes are given unfamiliar names. What I know as the Roman specialty saltimbocca is named `Norman's Recipe'.<br />The text is a joy to read. It is sprinkled with culinary quotes from a great many literary sources. In Alice Waters words `Her words reach all my senses. The life around the table, the setting, the conversation - not just the food - are all part of her inimitable aesthetic.'<br />This book can be read on at many different levels.<br />First, it can be taken as simply a book of recipes, but if that were all there was, the book would not have survived as long as it has.<br />Second, it can be read as a culinary travelogue to spark one's imagination. The section on Spanish rice dishes is a good example of just enough to get you interested, without being so thin as to gloss over important issues. (One of my few complaints with the book is that for Italian rice dishes, the book simply specifies `Italian' rice. As we all know after hundreds of hours of risottos on the Food Network, the Italian arborio rice is good, but the Italian rice carnaroli is better.)<br />Third, it can be a source of forgotten facts about some common dishes. I was surprised, for example, to find the recipe for aioli to include bread crumbs. Who knew!<br />Lastly, the book can be read as a historical document, the first book by someone who will come to influence a generation of culinary writers. I suspect David's later books on French and Italian cuisines had more material to inspire professional chefs like Alice Waters, but it all started here.s with the book is that for Italian rice dishes, the book simply specifies `Italian' rice.

The recipes in seasonal menus are wrapped in text describing the White Barn Inn and information about other hostelries in the Relais and Chateau chain of hotels and resorts. The object of the book seems primarily to publicize this hotel, restaurant, and chain. Since I had never heard of either before opening this book, the book has succeeded in that goal. As an interesting culinary work, the book is a failure, especially compared to the worthy titles mentioned above.<br />When rating cookbooks, I start with three stars if the book meets my expectations, give it four stars when it does so with high quality material, and give it five stars if it's content exceeds my expectations. If the book does not meet my expectations, it gets two stars. If it tries to pull the wool over my eyes, it gets one star. `The Arrows Cookbook' set my expectations for this book, a seasonal cookbook for an inn in Maine, and, unfortunately for this title, the bar was set pretty high.<br />The text by Susan Sully, who appears to be primarily a travel writer, comes straight from a travelogue or advertising brochure. It is aimed entirely at encouraging you to visit this inn with sugary prose. I felt like I was gaining weight just reading her sections. I had the first inkling of what was afoot when the acknowledgments were to flower, cutlery, and antique purveyors.<br />The introductory material cites 140 recipes. This number is heavily inflated by including recipes for stocks, sauces, infused oils, vegetable purees, and smoothes, lemonade, and sandwiches. The inflation continues with a number of recipes for venison and pheasant. Once you get past the fluff, the recipes are heavily weighted toward local Maine seafood, especially lobster and scallops. An examination of the recipes reveals a competence you would expect from a chef at a highly rated restaurant. The lobster stock / bisque recipes use all the parts in the usual way. My only surprise was that while the lobster roe was used, there was no mention of using the lobster tamale.<br />The photographs in the book are worthy of the glossy, oversize format. I especially liked the one of the silver Porsche Carrera. The layout and typesetting was well done. The price was reasonable, and another clue that the object of the volume was to advertise.<br />The book would make a better than average souvenir for a visit to the White Barn Inn and it has a reasonable collection of  lobster recipes. I would rather spend my money on a good paperback of seafood recipes by James Beard, James Peterson, or Alan Davidson.<br />Just as an aside, I wonder where the Publisher's Weekly reviewer's head is at when they give this book a flowery review, yet pan the ambitious Pino Luongo book on his Tuscan cuisine.

Not exactly haute cuisine	`Sam Choy's Polynesian Kitchen' does several things right in a sincere attempt to promote the cuisine of the South Pacific Islands; however, it falls short of convincing me that the food preparation traditions of widely scattered island groups forms an `overlooked cuisine' as claimed by the book's subtitle.<br />At it's heart, I suspect this is primarily a book like Emeril Lagasse's latest, designed to promote interest in the author's establishments in Hawaii. As with Emeril's book, this does not mean it is a poor cookbook. Let's look at what the book does right:<br />First, there is an excellent description of a wide range of Polynesian foodstuffs. While many may simply be beyond a mainland American's ability to find without extraordinary effort, most are available from Hispanic or Oriental or East Indian sources. There is a clue here that the claimed `Polynesian cuisine' may be a fairly derivative practice, borrowing heavily from Spanish and English explorers and Asian immigrants. This survey of foodstuffs includes substitutions, but the number of items where no reasonable substitution is available is rather high. At least one substitution of `yams' for `sweet potatoes' is suspect. The author makes no note about the ambiguity between the African white starchy yams and the misplaced name for New World sweet potatoes.<br />Second, almost all recipe directions are very short. Most are short because they are simple. Many are short because the author seems to skimp on some important details, such as reasonable tests of doneness. A recipe for fried squid, for example, gives no warning whatsoever that cooking for more than one or two minutes can produce a good imitation of rubber bands.<br />Third, the stories of how the author came by some of his recipes are engaging and well written. They are easily one of the better parts of the book.<br />Fourth is the glossary of Polynesian words.<br />Fifth, the book presents the recipes by island group, including dishes from the seven groups of Fiji, Hawaii, The Marquesas, New Zealand, Samoa, Tahiti, and Tonga.<br />The book's shortcomings are most prominent in it's trying to make the `Polynesian cuisine' more than it really is. For starters, many of the recipes are Sam Choy's own invention. I don't hold that against the quality of the recipes, only the believability of the book's premise. Then, almost all staples such as curry and soy sauce are imports, primarily from Asia. There are no classic Polynesian products.<br />I am puzzled especially by the dishes from Tonga where there are several with distinctly Italian origins such as Caponata, Polenta, and Pane (bread in Italian). Choy gives no explanation of this connection. New Zealand's being included in the list also puzzles me. The influence here is so overwhelmingly English and the landmass supports so much more varied foodstuffs that it doesn't seem to fit the archipelago model of the other six island groups.<br />Lastly, I find it hard to take a cuisine seriously where one of the more important sources of protein is canned corned beef. This doesn't surprise me, as this product is also an important foodstuff in the Philippines.<br />If you are of Polynesian extraction, this book will be a great resource. If you are simply in the market for a new, unusual cuisine, I suggest you try Moroccan cuisine or Turkish cuisine.even groups of Fiji, Hawaii, The Marquesas, New Zealand, Samoa, Tahiti, and Tonga.<br />The book's shortcomings are most prominent in it's trying to make the `Polynesian cuisine' more than it really is.

The first of Charlie Trotter's books I reviewed was his newest title `Raw'. As it was a potentially misleading title for the readers of one of the most distinguished chef / authors in the country, I gave it a rather cautionary review to be sure no one reading about the book would get false expectations. Since that book did succeed in showing Trotter's brilliance with food, I was anxious to follow up with a review of a much different sort of title from this renowned culinarian. I was not disappointed with what I found in `Charlie Trotter cooks at home'.<br />This book is one of the very best exemplars of the subgenre of cookbooks by celebrity chefs aimed at the home cook. It equals or surpasses titles like those from Tyler Florence, Sara Moulton, Ming Tsai, Tom Colicchio, and Food Network in several ways.<br />First, the book is arranged in a very practical manner, by course and, for entrees, by type of protein. This excellent choice of chapters is enhanced by a complete listing of `recipes at a glance' at the beginning of the book plus a listing of recipes by main ingredient at the end of the book. Excellent features for a cook at home resource.<br />Second, the range of foods used in the dishes is quite familiar to the typical American home cook. There are very few unusual ingredients or unusual flavors. The entrees are divided into a generous number of seafood dishes; fewer but varied poultry (without any exotic game recipes) and a good selection of meat recipes with all being beef, pork, lamb, or veal. There are no exotic game meats here. Entrees finish up with a good selection of pastas and risottos. Similarly, the desserts are neatly divided into sections on soups, sorbets, and granites; tarts, pies, and pastries; and cakes, custards, and puddings.<br />Third, the range of techniques is diverse enough to succeed in broadening the horizons of even an experienced home cook. This is the only place in this type of book where I have seen the author use tomato water, an ingredient which, when I saw it in Paul Bertolli's book made great sense to me and made me wonder why I have not heard more of it. The book includes several examples of low temperature poaching, even for filet of beef. I have not seen this anywhere else except in Jamie Oliver's latest book.<br />Fourth, the first chapter on stock preparation gives very professional recipes. I recommend people following them not try to take any short cuts. This chef knows what he is talking about.<br />Fifth, the entr&eacute;e recipes often include instructions for preparing a complimentary side vegetable, with instructions for plating the protein and it's side.<br />All the recipes appear to be positively delightful. All techniques are well done, quite good enough for the home cook. The pie and tart pastry techniques, for example, are sound, with all the right cautions about working the dough cold and quick. Unlike a volume like the recent `The Way We Cook', the book has the advantage of speaking with a single voice rather than showing traces of diverse sources for the recipes. Every time potatoes are cooked in water, they are done in exactly the same manner.<br />Potential buyers should be aware that this is neither quick nor cheap cooking. Trotter may have done us the service of providing accurate timings for prep and cooking, but it was better that he leave them off than do them poorly.<br />There are three things, which annoyed me about the book. First, I found the `photographs' interesting, but perfectly useless in this kind of book. They are arty, primitive `photograms', which are so disconnected from the recipes that the photographer had to explain of what foodstuffs they were made. This was the wrong kind of book for these pictures. Second, the `insight' paragraphs at the end of the recipes would have been much better placed as headnotes at the beginning of the recipe, fitting the practice of practically every other cookbook author writing in English. Third, the book isbound with textured paper rather than with true fabric like the `Raw' title cited above. Since the price of the two volumes is not that different and the current volume was cheaper, it would not have been a stretch to give this volume a decently attractive binding.<br />These nuisances aside, this is a very worthy book especially for someone who simply wants a better source of recipes than the hum drum Betty Crocker or Good Housekeeping volume.tured paper rather than with true fabric like the `Raw' title cited above.

832495:US	39134375	R1K7T25VR10J9X	1579595278	287829084	The American Boulangerie: Authentic French Pastries and Breads for the Home Kitchen	Books	5	57	67	N	N	Remedy for standing in line for 3 hours at Bay Bread	If, as it appeared when I started reading this book, that Pascal Rigo's cookbook was to be about nothing more than bread (as Boulangerie in French means bakery), it would have been a worthy book. In that case, it would have been similar to Nancy Silverton's excellent `Breads from the La Brea Bakery'. But, it covers a much broader range of goods, including many things typically found in a Patisserie plus a wide range of `tartines' and sandwiches. Thus, it essentially covers the range of Silverton's three books on bread, pastry, and sandwiches, although not in a great a depth as Silverton in her three titles.<br />From the evidence of this book, it seems to me that the author's bakery, Boulangerie Bay Bread is one of the establishments which continues to keep San Francisco on the short list of American cities for really great cuisine. It is also evidence of the place of French baking as the first among equals with the two other great centers of European baking traditions, the Italians (primarily bread)  and the Austrians (primarily pasteries).<br />In the making of bread, this book is not for the uncommitted. It starts with directions for making a classic `Levain Nature' or bread starter, including instructions for how to keep it alive, how to refresh it for use, and how to use it. This chapter brings back memories of the chapter in Tony Bourdain's `Kitchen Confidential' book which deals with a totally off the wall baker who maintained a really obnoxious sponge, but made terrific bread. But I digress. The next sections in the chapter on bread give recipes for various artisinal breads based on this starter. What is odd is that there is no recipe for baguettes, and no explanation for its absence. This chapter has the only really puzzling recipe instruction. In the list of ingredients for whole wheat bread, there is a call for six and a half to eight cups of organic whole-wheat flour. I immediately expected to see directions for preparing the dough with the Italian well method of bringing in only as much flour as you need, but there was nothing like that. The instruction is to simply dump all the flour into a large bowl and mix with starter, water, and salt. Very, very strange. With the emphasis on using organic wheat and European butter, I was surprised to find most measurements in volume rather than weight. This is odd, but it fits the direction of the book as covering a broad range of French baking and pastry products, not just bread. If bread is what you want, I recommend either Nancy Silverton's book cited above or Peter Reinhart's `The Baker's Apprentice' or Rose Levy Beranbaum's `The Bread Bible'. You can come back to Rigo's book for some specialties such as `Fougasse sur Plaque', the French answer to foccacia.<br />After bread comes Croissants and Pastries. The highlights of this chapter are the recipe for puff pastry, various types of croissants (actually created in Vienna, not Paris), brioche, and some pastries derived from brioche. If you are thrilled with the idea of making brioche, I recommend you check out Nancy Silverton's recipe. I believe it may be a bit better.<br />The next chapter presents savory tarts and sandwiches. Savory tarts are really France's answer to Italy's pizza and for someone who is adept at good pie dough (pate brisee), these tarts may be a lot easier than the pride of Naples flatbread and sauce. The highlight of this theme is the pizza du boulanger with tomatoes, olives, anchovies, and Parmesan on a pate brisee crust. The quiche Lorraine recipe without bacon is much less fussy than what one may find in most pastry shops. Tartines are open-faced sandwiches, many of which are a meal in themselves such as the Nicoise Open Faced Sandwich. As the name suggests, it is a Salad Nicoise done up on a large slice of Pain au Levain, a classic hard crusted bread. The sandwiches, tartines, and tarts in this chapter are worth the price of admission, which, for an oversized book of this caliber, is very reasonable.<br />The next chapter is house specialities headlined by pastries from Bordeaux, Rigo's home province in France (I found it especially charming that Rigo settled in San Francisco after a stint in Los Angles because `Frisco reminded him very much of his southwestern France). This chapter includes recipes for Madeleines, pound cakes, spice cakes, almond cookies, several types of macaroons, and a glamorous Chocolate Buche de Noel (Yule Log) plus a lemon version of same. Just for show, the author also includes a recipe for a chocolate Marquise. Good luck with this one. The author had to track down some near antique molds from the 1930's in order to make them.

This chapter includes recipes for Madeleines, pound cakes, spice cakes, almond cookies, several types of macaroons, and a glamorous Chocolate Buche de Noel (Yule Log) plus a lemon version of same. Just for show, the author also includes a recipe for a chocolate Marquise. Good luck with this one. The author had to track down some near antique molds from the 1930's in order to make them.

834659:US	39134375	R37W5Y8ZSBAMXA	0066212464	826916187	Ripe for Dessert: 100 Outstanding Desserts with Fruit--Inside, Outside, Alongside	Books	4	35	37	N	N	Quinces and Gravensteins and Rhubarb, oh my	David Lebovitz' new title `Ripe for Dessert' is a word play on his subject of fruits in dessert. The teacher and former pastry chef with Paul Bartoli and Alice Waters at Chez Panisse has done a book composed exclusively of dessert recipes, which include fruit in some fashion.<br />The chapters divide the recipes into a slightly quirky seven different types of fruit, where type is not determined by botany but by a combination of season (apples, pears, quinces), terroir (tropical), and preservation (dried). The seven chapters are:<br />Apples, Pears, Quince, and Rhubarb<br />Tropical Fruits<br />Citrus Fruits<br />Dried Fruits<br />Figs, Grapes, Melon, and Pomegranates<br />Stone Fruits<br />Berries<br />The most striking thing about the collection of recipes is that there seems to be not a single classic fruit recipe such as simple Apple Pie or Strawberry Shortcake or Peach Melba or Peach Cobbler. Almost every recipe is original with the author or based on a suggestion made to the author. Many are certainly based on classics, but each and every one has some modification. For example:<br />Apple Crisp becomes Gravenstein Apple and Blackberry Crisp<br />Tarte Tatin becomes Apple and Quince Tarte Tatin<br />Rhubarb Pie becomes Rhubarb Tart with Almond Nougatine<br />Key Lime Pie becomes Lime Marshmallow Pie<br />Linzertorte become Peanut Butter and Jelly Linzertorte<br />Peach Crisp becomes Peach and Amaretti Crisp<br />There is definitely a place on many bookshelves for this kind of book. But it is important to know that this is what the book is all about before buying it. The author is so fastidious as a baker that he does not use generic pastry crusts. Rather, the crusts are customized to the job at hand. I count this as a major plus in a serious work on baking, but his may not be your particular bowl of cherries. I can see this book being justly popular with people who entertain a lot and need something new for dessert once or twice a month, especially since the book is organized to make finding a particular type of dessert very easy. I can certainly see that this book should be popular with restaurants and caterers and all professional bakers.<br />One important fact to know about the recipes is that many ingredients are not restricted to their proper chapter titles. Shredded coconut, for example, is something like the grated Parmesan cheese of the dessert world. It gets sprinkled on lots of different recipes.<br />These recipes are all very good. But, they reminded me of a comment on a TV documentary on a pastry competition where a team lost out because their tastes were just too unfamiliar to the judges.<br />The few pictures in the book are competent. The style of the book is a bit garish. I would have been happier with a nice sedate Alfred A. Knopf treatment to the book design rather than the hot pink and orange colors they chose. I am always pleasantly surprised by a bibliography in cookbooks. This would have been just a little better done as footnotes. The double table of contents by fruit and by type (cakes, tarts, cookies, etc) is wonderful. More cookbooks should do this.<br />If I were looking for a good general-purpose book on desserts including fruit, I would go with Wayne Harley Brachman's new `American Classics' volume. Highly professional treatment of familiar favorites.<br />This book is good for the right audience.finding a particular type of dessert very easy.

If it were, I would dismiss it with three stars and little comment. The first clue that more is afoot here than culls from the Wednesday food section are the blurbs on the back of the dust jacket from Christopher Kimball, Anne Willan, and Steven Raichlen. Kimball I could expect, being a good old boy Yankee New Englander from way back, but Anne Willan is serious stuff.<br />The chapter titles are a bit unusual, but they are exactly the range of topics you would expect to find in newspaper food columns. They are:<br />Appetizers such as deviled eggs, liver pate, ceviche, crab cakes, eggplant caponata, toasts, crackers, etc.<br />Salads such as Eggless Caesar, French Market Salad, Creamy Potatoe Salad, Fattoush, Greek Cypriot, etc.<br />When You're in a Rush with Soups, Chicken, Tuna, Salmon, Bass, and Scallops, quick Bolognese, etc.<br />Dishes We Make All the Time such as Vege Soup, Chili, Yankee Pot Roast, Meatball, Lamb Stew, etc.<br />New Classics such as Corn Chowder, Oyster Stew, Boulangere, Baked Beans, Salmon Cakes, etc.<br />Good Enough For Company with Rack of Pork, Leg of Lamb, Ossobuco, Duck Breasts, Roast Salmon, etc.<br />Simmering Pots with lots of soups and stews such as Cuban Stewed Chicken and Beef Daube, etc.<br />Sides such as Fresh Corn Risotto, Scalloped Tomatoes, Quick Couscous, Blue Cheese Popovers, etc.<br />Rise and Dine with Frittatas, Muffins, Soda Bread, Quesadillas, Banana Bread, Blueberry Loaf Cake, etc.<br />If You Love to Bake with Strawberry Shorkcakes, Carrot Cake, Pies, Tarts, Cookies, Gingerbread, etc.<br />Simple Fruit Desserts with five recipes for apples, oranges, and peaches.<br />The first thing which bumped my opinion up from three stars to four was with the description of how to cook hardboiled eggs. For starters, they recommended my preferred method of pricking a hole in the shell and dropping the eggs into just boiling water. Then, they gave the additional tip of rolling the just dropped eggs around a bit in order to center the yolk in the cooked egg. To cap things off, they gave a recommendation on how to crack the hot eggs to make them easier to peel when they cool.<br />The next thing which warmed my opinion of the book was that I could not find any steps in any recipes which I would do differently. There are few fancy techniques called for in the recipes and almost all of them take no more than a page, but there were also no short cuts.<br />The last thing which appealed to me was the lack of processed ingredients. All pie crusts are made from scratch and I detected no cans of Campbell's cream of mushroom soup. I did find the directions for the pie crusts to be less than perfect, as it was lax in calling for very cold ingredients, combined in such a way to keep them cold and to leave bits of butter to fluff up the crust. But then, this is not a book on pie baking and I'm sure the technuque they give works well enough. Another less than ideal baking recipe was the carrot cake, which called for but a single layer. If I am going to the trouble to make a carrot cake with butter cream icing, I will make three layers for sure.<br />This is not a book for died in the wool foodies. Were I not reviewing it, I would not buy it myself, but for that very large number of people who need to make good meals at least three times a week and don't have time to wade through 800 pages of  `The Joy of Cooking' or `James Beard's American Cookery', this book is just the thing.<br />I think Steve Raichlen's comparison to Julia Child and Simone Beck is misplaced because the latter duo was doing an in depth survey of a very specific local cuisine while the current authors are collecting recipes originating from all over the world and presenting them for aparticular audience. So, their emphasis is on a specific audience rather than a specific cuisine. Sorry Steve.<br />This is an excellent book which accomplishes it's mission at a reasonable price. Just be warned that this is NOT low carb or low fat cooking, just very tasty cooking.So, their emphasis is on a specific audience rather than a specific cuisine.

On the one hand, the book succeeds in presenting a well-written and interestingly presented sequence of classic French or French style recipes. On the other, it fails in presenting its primary contention that it can simplify French cooking. As the author and his cowriters admit in more than one recipe, this is long with lots of ingredients, but you can do it if you just break it down into its (many) individual steps. All the author has succeeded in doing is to show that the complexity can be broken down into a lot of steps and that what may look simple to a talented professional chef who has been in the business for over thirty years, still looks daunting to the amateur. The observation by Daniel Boulud on the difference between amateurs and professionals still holds. Professionals simply see things differently by virtue of having done the same preparations thousands of times over.<br />Since Delouvrier fails in making his primary contention, which can set his book apart from all the others, what is the value of the material otherwise? As always, it all depends on what you are looking for.<br />The book is organized in almost exactly the same style as Daniel Boulud's `Caf&eacute; Boulud Cookbook' with seven chapters of recipes instead of Boulud's four. The chapters are chronological, each dealing with a different stage in the author's career, beginning with his fairly straightforward versions of dishes from la cuisine Bourgeoise such as cassoulet and coq au vin through the author's interpretation of haute cuisine dishes at his very expensive Manhattan venues. The chapters are:<br />Family Cooking, Boulogne-SurGesse, France<br />Hotel School and the Early Years, Toulouse, France<br />Caf&eacute; de la Paix, Paris, France<br />Journet Through Discovery (Montreal)<br />Les Celebrites, New York City<br />LesPinasse and Four Stars, New York City<br />Basic Recipes (Pantry preparations)<br />The book does have the author's reminiscences which are entertaining and have a strong family resemblence to memoirs written by several other French chefs.<br />So the question remains, `Why should I buy this book'.<br />First, I think the recipes are very good, with the ones in the first four chapters being much more accessible to the amateur than the fifth and sixth recipe. The pantry recipes are interesting in that they show the chef is doing high end French technique. Stock recipes, with a few little twists, may have come right out of the Culinary Institute of America.<br />Second, the recipes in the first two chapters include some regional specialities outside of Provence and Lyon. The recipes in the last three chapters do include some Oriental influences, but not much.<br />Third, almost all the recipes are for entrees. Not too much space spent on desserts or salads. The mix of meat, fowl, fin, and shellfish is about right, with very few recipes for rabbit or other game style protein.<br />Fourth, the headnotes offer interesting comments on the source and nature of the material and the preparation. Good, but not dramatically better than other books.<br />If you already own a copy of Julia Child's `Mastering the Art of French Cooking' and Jaques Pepin's books on technique, the basis for buying this book narrows down to getting the book to see this chef's take on things plus some recipes from Gascony.<br />There are no wine pairings, which I don't miss. The photography is competant. There are no ingredient sources listed, but then, there are not a lot of rare ingredients. Just lots of them and some relatively expensive ingredients.<br />If you want a book like this, I would recommend one first look at Boulud's book cited above. If you really like that kind of book and want more, then I recommend this book to you.brites, New York City<BR>LesPinasse and Four Stars, New York City<BR>Basic Recipes (Pantry preparations)<br />The book does have the author's reminiscences which are entertaining and have a strong family resemblence to memoirs written by several other French chefs.<br />So the question remains, `Why should I buy this book'.<br />First, I think the recipes are very good, with the ones in the first four chapters being much more accessible to the amateur than the fifth and sixth recipe.

838455:US	39134375	R25D01GGBH9UHR	1579651267	635645220	The French Laundry Cookbook (The Thomas Keller Library)	Books	5	83	95	N	N	Reflections on America's Culinary Philosopher King	I always like to see the Yankees win the World Series and Tiger Woods win a major tournament. This confirmations that there is someone who is certifiably the best at what they do. For the same reason, after reading the pieces about Thomas Keller and the French Laundry written by Tony Bourdain and Michael Ruhlman, I am happy to believe that Keller is simply the best chef there is in the United States.<br />Reading `The French Laundry Cookbook' by Keller, Ruhlman, and the French Laundry staff and `family' does nothing to detract from that opinion. Keller's words enhance my opinion of him as the ultimate culinary artist.<br />Most successful culinary educators from Martha Stewart to Alton Brown to James Peterson deal primarily with technique. Even major successful chefs who write or demonstrate on TV such as Wolfgang Puck, Mario Batali, and Jaques Pepin deal primarily with techniques with a background doctrine of using fresh, high quality ingredients. The occasional references by Mario or Sara Moulton or Emeril to smells and sounds and tastes often get lost in the woods of prep and firing techniques.<br />Keller is all about smell and taste and what may seem like totally over the edge concentration on respect for materials. One example is when he insists on storing fresh fish on ice in the same position as they swim so the muscles in the flesh are not stressed out of shape. He is all about providing service and pleasure to his patrons by excellence in the kitchen. One professional observer says the French Laundry kitchen is as quiet as a watchmaker's workshop. This simply fits into Keller's need to have an environment where his staff can experience their preparations with as few distractions as possible.<br />This, for example is one of the things which separates Rocco DeSpirito from Jamie Oliver in their shows on the opening of their respective restaurants. While Rocco was in the front of the house smoozing with customers, Jamie was in the kitchen at the expediter's table keeping tabs on the quality of what was leaving the kitchen. It was a revelation to see the superficially sloppy Oliver exhort his staff to use gentleness in cooking and plating and his focus on tastes and smells. Needless to say, Rocco has redeemed himself when he did a book, which focused on taste. But, with Rocco, it was reduced to a system understandable by the layman. Keller remains the ultimate empiricist.<br />This book contains the very first aesthetic justification for small portions at high-end restaurants. The theory is that the patron's first taste senses something wonderful. The second bite confirms the initial reaction, but the reaction is less dramatic. The third bite simply confirms that more of the same is on the way. Keller would rather provide a large number of dishes, each of a few bites, and each providing an exquisitely prepared experience. His doctrine with luxury ingredients such as truffles, foie gras, and caviar is to not skimp on the amount placed on each serving. The rationale is that without that second confirming taste of truffle, the patron may not really know what all the excitement is all about. (I have no idea what the French Laundry charges for a dinner seating, but I'm willing to believe it is pretty expensive. From the evidence of this book, I believe it is worth every penny.)<br />The book contains recipes actually prepared at the French Laundry. They include all of the whimsically titled dishes reported by Ruhlman and Bourdain, including `Bacon and Eggs', `Macaroni and Cheese',  and `Coffee and Doughnuts'. In spite of the fact that some of these recipes are some of the longest I have seen in print, Keller says there is no guarantee this is exactly how they prepare them every day. This harks back to his primary doctrine that the soul of cooking is attention to the individual material in front of you and it's qualities, rather than what is written on a piece of paper. That doesn't mean these recipes will not work in a home kitchen. Madame Keller has in fact, tested them in a home kitchen by her own staff. The recipes in fact elaborate on a number of techniques I have seen before and introduce some which are new to me. The most important is the use of the beurre monte emulsion of melted butter in a very little amount of water. The technique and its uses appear very similar to the beurre fondue technique reported by Tom Colicchio. Both are media for holding or conditioning food in the kitchen rather than sauces used during plating. (I guess it's time I finally read Escoffier). Keller's techniques for shellfish are totally new to me as well. His discussion on cooking lobster is a demonstration of extraordinary sensitivity to his raw material. It easily equals the fussiness of Paul Bertolli in his latest book.<br />The cuisine is almost entirely based on classic French technique, so it will not be totally foreign to someone schooled by Julia Child and Jaques Pepin. While many recipes are daunting, most are doable by a dedicated amateur and even those recipes which may be beyond ones patience will contain useful techniques.<br />This is an early celebrity chef coffee table book format, and the photography is worthy of the price. The index is very good and the book includes a good list of sources. The editors have also included a complete list of recipes. The publisher did Eric Rippert's book and with this book they did not make the same mistake of using a font too small. The book also contains a lot more than lip service to the restaurant's suppliers, as it includes several two page essays by Ruhlman on some of the French Laundry's more interesting purveyors.<br />This book is one of the most lucid characterizations I have seen of the chef's art.

Nothing Else	The best and worst thing one can say about this book is that it is just a very large collection of ancient and modern recipes whose ingredients and preparation conform to at least conservative Jewish dietary laws. It is very similar to a collection of all English Language published sonnets ranging from Shakespeare to the little old lady in Nebraska who publishes in her local newspaper. Everything has been published and everything follows certain rules, but all connections between the collected items ends there.<br />This is not an unworthy book. It sort of reminds me of the old Palgraves Golden Treasury of English Poetry, which collected works according to little rhyme or reason, except that the authors were English and wrote in English.<br />This book has three things going for it.<br />First is its size. With 825 recipes, someone looking for a recipe to accomplish a particular objective within the kosher rules, they have a good chance of finding one.<br />Second is the fact that all recipes have been published, but not all have been published in the pages of the New York Times. Some come from recently published books such as Marcus Samuelsons Aquavit. This means that each one has been editorially reviewed by one or more of professional editorial eyes.<br />Third is the obvious love and care with which the editor(s) have assembled the material. The introductory essays by Mimi Sheraton and Joan Nathan are informative and endearing.<br />Unfortunately, all sense of cohesiveness stops on the first page of Appetizer recipes. There is no trace of any scholarship which would help sort out the recipes by whether the originating tradition was, for example Ashkanazy or Sephardic.<br />The Chapters dividing the recipes are:<br />Appetizers<br />Soups<br />Fish<br />Poultry<br />Meat<br />Vegetables<br />Grains, Legumes, and Pasta<br />Salads<br />Light Fare for Brunch and Lunch<br />Trimmings, Savory and Sweet<br />Breads, Rolls, Bagels, and Matzohs<br />Desserts<br />There is no sense in which Jewish traditional food forms a cuisine in the same sense that Morocco or Turkey or Iran have a distinctive cuisine. Jewish food is an overlay on the existing cuisine of the region.<br />This is a very worthy book if you have few cookbooks and are in need of a more diverse selection of kosher recipes. It is interesting that there is no statement in the book saying that the validity of the kosher nature of the recipes has not been certified by any rabbinical authority. And note that a kosher recipe can easily be made non-kosher by using non-kosher ingredients. A reasonable price for a lot of recipes. If you want a more measured look at Jewish Cooking, check out Claudia Roden's book on the subject and her book on Middle Eastern food.e in which Jewish traditional food forms a cuisine in the same sense that Morocco or Turkey or Iran have a distinctive cuisine.

841195:US	39134375	R2J3AP0P7AWJ9W	0060013966	542929663	The Vineyard Kitchen: Menus Inspired by the Seasons (Cookbooks)	Books	5	13	27	N	N	A  Useful Book for Entertaining with Food and Wine	Maria Helm Sinskey is a professional chef who does ?culinary direction? and teaching at her husband?s vineyard. The book is a collection of ten menus per season where each menu consists of three to five dishes, three being the most common. The most typical menu consists of a recipe for soup or salad, a main dish, and a dessert. The introduction to each menu gives suggestions on pairings of wine with the food, depending on method of preparation.<br />I know very little about wine and food pairings so my opinion on this subject is pretty thin. The advice includes a very wide variety of wines, including my favorite Rhine and Mosel area wines including wines from the Alsace, as the author?s family originally came from the Alsace (Strasbourg). The author seems to show the proper amount of respect for pairing wines with vegetables, especially the dreaded artichokes and asparagus and varies the recommendation by method of preparation.<br />The focus on the seasons begs one to compare this to ?The Arrows Cookbook? and the focus on menus offers the comparison to Emeril Lagasse?s new restaurant(s) cookbook. The commitment to the menu style is better done than with Emeril?s book and I suspect the recipes are just a bit more discriminating than in Emeril?s book. The realization of the dedication to the seasonal is less convincing than in the Arrows book. It is a lot easier to take seasonal thinking more seriously when you are in Maine than when you are in California.<br />Due to the organization by menu, where every menu has one or more desserts, you are getting many more dessert recipes for your money than you get from a more conventional organization, especially when the extra recipe (fourth or fifth) is often an additional dessert.<br />With forty menus, you are also getting about 15 salads, 10 soups, and 15 dishes, which can best be identified as appetizers. These ?starters? seem to have a high percentage of dishes, which are richer than what I may like to see (high concentration of oils, cheeses, and cured meats). This and the dessert population both contribute to the fact that this book is NOT for dieters. I also noticed a bit of repetition among the starters recipes. Some looked suspiciously like others two seasons past. Very odd for seasonally timed dishes.<br />The main courses continue the tendency toward the fatty. The 40 dishes cover protein with:<br />Beef  9<br />Fowl  8 (several of duck and goose)<br />Lamb  5<br />Fin Fish  5<br />Pork  4<br />Shellfish  3<br />Vegetarian 6 (mostly pasta or risottos with lots of mushrooms and cheese)<br />The 20% shellfish seems odd in today?s healthy eating environment, but lets be clear that this book is about seasonal eating with wine, not loosing weight. Many of the main dish recipes such as coq au vin, pepper encrusted New York strip, and bouillabaisse are old friends, so you may have several of them already.<br />The quality of the recipes, the headnotes, and the cooks notes accompanying them is quite high. The author seems to give all the right cautions in all the right places. It?s interesting to note where the author takes some special effort and where they gloss over things. The gloss on an easy couscous method would make Paula Wolfert cringe. On the other hand, the recipe for homemade cr?me fraiche is more detailed than any I have seen to date, including instructions on how to vary the tangyness of the product. The coverage of pastry doughs (Pate Brisee) falls somewhere in the middle. The basic recipe is sound, but not as detailed as you may find in a book on pastry. The author also uses the same Pate Brisee for conventional pies, tarts, and galettes. I know some picky pastry chefs who have separate doughs for each.<br />I found one misprint in a recipe where the text put a quantity of sugar, but neglected to put the unit, so you are unsure of whether it is teaspoons, tablespoons, cups, or pounds. Fortunately, from the context, an experienced cook will know which it is. Very annoying. Tends to put me on my guard for other mistakes.<br />The ?seasonal? card will never sell a book to me, since it has become so hackneyed it has become nothing more than a blurb word on a dust jacket for many books, accompanied by the obligatory endorsement quote from Alice Waters.

844678:US	39134375	R1VIQDE0DAYG12	0060166517	324302361	The Cooking of the Eastern Mediterranean: 215 Healthy, Vibrant, and Inspired Recipes	Books	5	82	82	N	N	Superior Access to an Increasingly Important Cuisine	This is the fourth Paula Wolfert book I have reviewed and I find it better than the first three, even better than her important first book on Moroccan cuisine. It easily lands on my short list of best cookbooks dedicated to a specific regional cuisine. While Elizabeth David's book on Mediterranean cuisine maintains an important place in the literature of Mediterranean cuisine and Claudia Roden's book on the food of the Middle East improves the depth of coverage over David, Wolfert's book tops both of them in depth of coverage and may rival David's book for insights into the culinary wellsprings of the region.<br />Outside of writing on the Mediterranean and the Middle East, I find Wolfert's book to rival those of Diana Kennedy on Mexico and even match the quality, if not the seminal influence of Julia Child's 'Mastering the Art of French Cooking'. The main edge I would give to Child's book is that it succeeds in bringing a more limited topic into a bit clearer focus.<br />Wolfert does not cover the entire Eastern Mediterranean, and her book gains from the focus she put on the four areas she covers. These are:<br />Northern Greece (Macedonia and Thrace)<br />Turkey (Anatolia)<br />Georgia (bordering on the Black Sea, south of the Caucasus)<br />The Levant (Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Israel)<br />While Georgia does not border on the Mediterranean, Wolfert finds that the cuisine here is very similar to the other three regions she has chosen, which makes sense since Georgia borders on Turkey and probably shares much of the same agriculture as northern Greece.<br />Wolfert shares with Kennedy a love of her subject, which matches or surpasses that of even native writers. Paula gives us practically every aspect of her search of local, authentic recipes from stories about her local contacts through thoughts about how to adapt authentic recipes to American kitchens to reflections on those features which distinguish great cuisines, as she does when discussing pilafs, where she says \\"For me, any cuisine that makes plain starches so beguiling is a cuisine of great sophistication.\\" The accuracy of this statement hits home immediately since I just got finished reviewing a book on Tuscan food which manages to make stale bread, dried beans, and corn mush into interesting food.<br />That this is a great book still requires some qualification to identify the audience for which it is best suited.<br />First, it is an essential volume in the library of cookbook collectors and food scholars. Like Kennedy and unlike David and Roden, Wolfert maintains the touch of the scholar in her writing in citing connections to local sources and native language documents. For the cookbook reader and collector, I also offer the opinion that Ms. Wolfert is an excellent writer, or, she has a really crackerjack crew of editors at Harper Collins to tighten up her prose.<br />Second, it is probably one of the very best cookbooks for natives of this region transplanted to the United States. There are books on the cuisine of Turkey and Greece, but I suspect books on the food of Georgia are pretty uncommon.<br />Third, it is a great book for non-natives who happen to have developed a taste for this food.<br />Fourth, this is a superior source of recipes for vegetarian dishes and for ways of substituting bulgar wheat for rice in various dishes. The book is also a great source of yogurt recipes, including directions on making it at home.<br />Fifth, the book takes special note of recipes, which are suitable as Meze dishes.<br />Sixth, the book gives more coverage to breakfast and lunch and to the food appropriate to Ramadan. When other authors gloss over this last subject, it is like they are ignoring the presence of the 800 pound gorilla in the room.<br />There may be people who will not get their money's worth out of this book. Like Wolfert's most recent book on slow cooking recipes, these recipes are all rather long and clearly benefit from long cooking times. If speedis your thing, go to Rachael Ray or a general cookbook author like Mark Bittman. Both have adapted dishes from Wolfert's canon.<br />For my money, this is easily one of the top ten (10) cookbooks available in English. It's geographic range is eclectic and it may not replace books specializing in Greek or Turkish or Lebanese cuisines, but it's approach to food writing is a great model for others.ur thing, go to Rachael Ray or a general cookbook author like Mark Bittman.

More exactly, it is white southern comfort food. You will find relatively little overlap with the dishes of Edna Lewis but much overlap with the dishes in the southern cuisine cookbooks done by James Villas and his mother.<br />With regard to this particular book, the `southern comfort' easy living theme appears in spades. Paula Deen is not a baker and her dessert recipes are not something you would find in books by Gail Gand or Nancy Silverton or even Maida Heather.<br />The first thing you notice is that virtually every recipe is loaded with sugar, butter, cream, cream cheese, chocolate and eggs, whole or yolks. And, aside from the occasional appearance of peaches (obligatory for a Georgia girl), bananas, and cherries for garnish, there are very little fruit products, aside from lemon juice and lemon zest.<br />Before the recipe chapters is a very good short chapter on Hints and Tips. At the beginning of each chapter there are additional hints and tips for the type of dessert featured therein. Almost all suggestions appear to be sound, but may not go far enough. The claim that normal cocoa power can be substituted for Dutch Process cocoa may not pass muster, especially if baking powder is used to leaven the product.<br />The recipes in the book are divided into chapters for:<br />Cakes, which depend heavily on boxed cake mixes<br />Pies, which depend heavily on frozen, store bought crusts.<br />Cookies and Bars<br />Puddings and Custards<br />Candy<br />More Sweet Things<br />I find the instructions for making pie crusts to be inadequate. There is simply not enough detail in the instructions for keeping the ingredients cold, for resting the dough, or for chilling or freezing before blind baking. The technique Paula uses to blind bake also seems a bit idiosyncratic, using a quick run under the broiler for a few minutes instead of the more elaborate blind baking technique I have seen everyone else use.<br />Paula cites a case where her recipe directions were inadequate for a recipe tester (an inexperienced teenager) and properly noted the correction; however, I found a few other recipes where the instructions simply left important steps out.<br />I have done several of Paula Deen's dessert recipes and, as indicated by the list of most prominent ingredients, you should not be surprised to hear that I find them tooth achingly sweet without a lot of variety in texture. The typical French, Viennese, or Italian sweets shop would have a much greater variety of tastes and textures.<br />All this doesn't mean this is a bad book. If you want a really good collection of recipes of the type you would get from Aunt Edna or her church lady friends, this is your book, especially at a list price under 17 dollars. Almost all recipes are really easy to make, although some minor pitfalls have to be avoided. The homey stories about Paula's career and her sons makes entertaining reading.<br />If you are more adventurous and wish to try something with more challenge, go to Wayne Harley Brachman's new book on American Desserts. I highly recommend that book.detail in the instructions for keeping the ingredients cold, for resting the dough, or for chilling or freezing before blind baking.

It has many things to recommend it, but it also should be given more than a cursory thought if you have an interest in purchasing the book.<br />As a compulsive book collector, I often justify the purchase of a book solely on the presence of one good idea comprising not much more than a page or two, but you may not have such liberal criteria when laying out the long green for a book, especially for bone white plants.<br />The devil's advocate view of this book is that:<br />It's coverage of mushroom identification and distinction of culinary from toxic is weak in that the book does not give a consistant photographic coverage to all species. I would be extremely nervous if I knew someone was using only this book as a field guide. A quick comparison photographs for the edible boletus badius on page 33 with the toxic russula emetica on page 71 shows how similar two very different mushrooms can look. The comparison is scarier when you see that the two species flourish at the same time of  the year. My main point is that to a non-mycologist, this appears to be a very inadequate field guide. Much better would be one species per page with much more consistant coverage over all species.<br />While the title of the book refers to all mushrooms, it's emphasis is clearly on wild mushrooms. About 75 percent of all the recipes call for wild mushrooms, primarily morels and many of the recipes calling for cultivated species call for unusual or expensive species, up to and including truffles.<br />So what does that leave for the non-mushroom hunter living in Brooklyn? Here are some reasons for buying this book:<br />The well written text and good photography provides a worthy vicarious experience of the thrills of mushroom hunting in Devon, England.<br />The recipes give several worthy methods for preserving mushrooms, including drying and pickling. This is the material I would pick to primarily justify the purchase. I have not seen it anywhere else.<br />Even if you substitute the humble Pennsylvania button mushroom or the slightly more upscale cremini for the blue stocking morels and procinis, you get a wealth of recipes to add to a vegetarian diet. The recipes draw heavily from French and Italian cuisine, but they include a broad selection from various oriental cuisines as well. Even a fair number of German and Spanish dishes are included. Oddly, there seems to be practically no recipes for the portobello.<br />You also get useful practical tips on handling and eating mushrooms. The book makes it clear that almost every mushroom is healthier to eat cooked than to eat raw. I have heard it said that even our darling little Kennet Square button mushrooms have toxins which must be cooked to remove the toxins. Give the raw mushrooms a pass the next time you hit the salad bar. The information on taking special care with raw mushrooms and alcohol is pretty chilling, but again, as testified by the long popularity of Coq au Vin, this danger is eliminated by thorough cooking.<br />In general, I would rate the culinary advice on mushroom technique to be very useful.<br />Since I am very fond of cookbooks on single subjects, I recommend this book for the recipes and techniques and background on mushroom culture and collection in the wild, as long as you keep the wild part to your armchair. The price is a bit high, so I would not click on the order button without some check on alternate titles, especially the volume by Jane Grigson, `The Mushroom Feast' which I have not yet had the pleasure to sample.evon, England.<br />The recipes give several worthy methods for preserving mushrooms, including drying and pickling.

851901:US	39134375	R1V0AKE082CP9W	0471221473	879697553	In a Roman Kitchen: Timeless Recipes from the Eternal City	Books	5	16	16	N	N	Shootout in the Forum. Two excellent Books at the Same Time	Two books on Roman cooking have appeared within the last eighteen (18) months, which gives us a golden opportunity to proof one against the other to find the better book. The first published last year is , `Cooking the Roman Way' by David Downie. The second, more recently published book is the current subject `In a Roman Kitchen: Timeless Recipes from the Eternal City' by Jo Bettoja.<br />In general, Downie's book appears to be based more on restaurante, trattoria, and osteria recipes while Bettoja seems to rely more on home cooking recipes. Still, there is a significant overlap of recipe names. I had no trouble at all finding five recipes with the same traditional Italian name, although the English translation of the name may have been a little different. I give high marks to both authors for giving the Italian names of all dishes in both the text and the index.<br />I compared the recipes for five dishes:<br />Gnocchi di Semolino alla Romana<br />Spaghetti alla Carbonara<br />Cipolline in Agrodolce alla Romana<br />Carciofi alla Giudia<br />Frittata con Zucchini<br />Although no pair of recipes was the same, I can find virtually nothing in these five recipes which would suggest that one author was presenting consistently superior recipes. I was slightly annoyed with Downie for specifying white coctail onions in the Cipolline recipe, especially since I have no trouble finding cipolline in my local Pennsylvania megamart. My conclusion that Downie relies on the Trattoria and Bettoja relies on the home is in the sources they cite for their recipes. Both appear to give equal time to the influence of the Jewish quarter on Roman cooking.<br />In Bettoja's case, the focus seems to be on a large number of recipes for each major type of Roman dish. She has, for example, more pasta, artichoke, and fava bean recipes than Downie, and also more dessert recipes. This is ironic since Downie controverts one of my hero Mario Batali's claims that Italians do not go in for sweets.<br />In contrast, Downie includes many seminally Roman recipes which Bettoja simply ignores. He has excellent recipes for making both Pizza Bianco, a certifiable Roman speciality, and fresh fettucini, including sound recommendations on making the fettucini completely by hand and with the assistance of power mixers and power pasta rolling machines. Most surprising of all is that Downie includes the recipe for Gnocchi di Patate while Bettoja does not. My understanding from Mario is that this is a Roman speciality and every trattoria in Rome serves it on Thursday. Alternately, Claudia Roden identifies it as a northern (Friuli) Italian speciality. Since Downie specifically cites potato gnocchi as the Roman canonical dish for Thursday and thereby agrees with Mario, I have to assume that while the dish may be promenant outside Rome, it is certainly a distinctively Roman dish as well.<br />Bettoja is a teacher who runs her own culinary school in Rome while Downie is a culinary journalist, so it surprises me that it is Downie who has the superior sidebars on some basic techniques such as how to clean an artichoke (sidebars with step by step photographs) and how to roast and skin sweet peppers.<br />Even though Bettoja's book is later and even though the books have identical list prices and almost identical page counts, Downie's book is much richer in the quality and quantity of it's photographs, almost all with useful captions. I generally do not count good photography to a cookbook's credit, but in the case of a book dedicated to so photogenic a location as Rome, I must make an exception here. For the identical price, Downie and his photographer and editors have simply done a much better job. Downie's book is also richer in sidebars on general Roman and Italian culinary matters. His headnotes for individual dishes are also richer in explaining the history of many dishes such as Fettucini Alfredo and Fettucini alla Papalina.<br />In the battle of the blurbs, Downie has Marioand Carol Field while Bettoja has Lidia Bastianich and Frances Mayes on her back cover. I think that's a tie.<br />I would buy both of these books, even with the rather substantial overlap in named dishes. The overlap is actually a plus for amateur foodie scholars, as it gives one the sense of exactly how different two sources can be with exactly the same dish. Bettoja is a great source for pasta recipes and Roman desserts, while Downie has much greater success at evoking the Roman ambiance and in covering deeper techniques. Downie also wins the points on domestic sources for flour and other Italian specialities. Bettoja rather quixotically gives us the telephone numbers of companies in Rome. Not very useful unless you plan to visit Rome in the near future.<br />Both books are recommended.

854127:US	39134375	R1ETT66LCG4D3P	1584792957	890301952	The Duck Cookbook	Books	5	37	39	N	N	Ducks, Ducks, Ducks, Ducks, Ducks	The title tells it all. This book is all about cooking duck using most techniques common to other types of meats plus at least one which is unique to duck and other fatty fowl. The nine techniques / preparations chapters are:<br />Sauteing<br />Braising<br />Roasting<br />Confit - a French cooking and preservation method unique, I believe, to ducks and geese<br />Smoking<br />Curing<br />Soups<br />Salads<br />Terrines and Mousses<br />It's interesting that while poaching is a common cooking technique for chicken, the technique is not included here for duck. This technique is largely replaced by the confit method. This is just one clue to the fact that a duck is different from a chicken and methods which work for one will not work for the other. The biggest difference is the level of fat in a duck's skin (but not in it's meat). This is simply due to the fact that ducks can fly and chickens cannot and ducks spend a lot of time in the water. This also explains why almost all duck meat is dark, more similar to a chicken's legs than to it's breast meat.<br />The difference between ducks and chickens is the main thing which makes this book valuable in itself, especially since many of the techniques appear to be unique to duck cookery. A second great value to the book is that it spells out the right way to cook to avoid fatty flesh if your primary interest is to avoid the saturated fat without loosing out on the great taste of duck.<br />Aside from the confit method, one of the best values derived from duck is the high quality of the broth one can make from duck, in many ways as valuable and as flavorful as stocks derived from veal. The only drawback is that to make a decent amount of duck broth, you need 12 carcasses or equivalent amount of leftover pieces.<br />This book is by far the most complete collection of duck recipes I could find. The next closest sources are the Cooks Illustrated book entitled 'Chicken', with about 28 pages of duck recipes and 'Beard on Birds' by James Beard which has 19 pages devoted to duck, including many of the recipes included in Peterson's book. In fact, it is a sign of the times that Beard's book, published in 1979 (and probably date back at least 20 to30 years before that time) have several recipes on wild duck while Peterson deals exclusively with the two most common domesticated duck sources, the Long Island (or Pekin) duck and the Mullard duck, the most common source of cryovac packed duck breast.<br />Comparing Peterson to Beard, one finds that while Beard has good recipes, equal to his reputation in American culinary education, Peterson has superior recipes and excellently detailed techniques and explanations for the duck specific methods. Worthy of his book on culinary techniques, the photographic instructions on cutting raw duck and carving roasted birds are impeccable.<br />Peterson's work has placed him high in the ranks of American cookbook authors and this book is a worthy addition to his canon. In past books, I have occasionally found a bit of less than perfect sequencing of steps, so that one must be very careful to read his recipes through and think them through before beginning, but I find none of that clumsiness here. His impeccible descriptions of a sometimes demanding technique are invaluable.<br />If I collected cookbooks for no other reason than to be an easy source of recipes, this is the type of book I would most quickly buy. Adding to the values is the selection of excellent oversize paged photographs of completed dishes joining the great color photos illustrating the techniques.<br />Duck has an aura of luxury about it for a very reasonable price (as long as you leave off the foie gras). This book can be a great access to a new culinary direction. Recommended. Just be sure when selecting recipes that the type of duck matches the recipe.

In past books, I have occasionally found a bit of less than perfect sequencing of steps, so that one must be very careful to read his recipes through and think them through before beginning, but I find none of that clumsiness here. His impeccible descriptions of a sometimes demanding technique are invaluable.<br />If I collected cookbooks for no other reason than to be an easy source of recipes, this is the type of book I would most quickly buy. Adding to the values is the selection of excellent oversize paged photographs of completed dishes joining the great color photos illustrating the techniques.<br />Duck has an aura of luxury about it for a very reasonable price (as long as you leave off the foie gras). This book can be a great access to a new culinary direction. Recommended. Just be sure when selecting recipes that the type of duck matches the recipe. Recipes for fatty ducks may give poor results with leaner birds.	2003-12-25
854172:US	39134375	R29QJRFSHHRD4U	1579545475	864992036	The Church Supper Cookbook: A Special Collection of Over 375 Potluck Recipes from Families and Churches Across the Country	Books	3	43	67	N	N	A More Sophisticated Church Fund Raising Cookbook	There are two dangers in evaluating this book. One can overestimate it's value by focusing on the very reasonable price for an advertised 375 recipes, and buy it's patter that these recipes include valuable secrets which will produce better results than what, a New York celebrity chef, probably. Alternately, one can look down one's nose at the source of the recipes and claim that there is little value in these homespun recipes.<br />There are elements of truth in to both positions, but both positions are guilty of not appreciating the audience for which the book was written. The book is a grown-up and slightly citified version of recipes assembled by church groups into a book to be sold to make money for the parish or womens group or some other worthy civic cause. Almost all recipes will produce tasty results without resorting to any hard to find or hard to make ingredient. Few, if any, will ask you to skin a sweet pepper or bake a fillet in paper. Even better, the book contains homespun versions of classic cuisine such as Cassoulet and Coq au Vin and is not shy about asking you to use a few cups of wine in some dishes. This is a perfect cookbook for rural New Hampshire. It does not even bother me that most of the recipes came from the same part of the country. The book may have been better with a better representation of southern, New Orleans, or southwest cuisine, but I don't think the book's audience will really miss it.<br />What I am afraid the book's audience will miss is an original culinary experience. I just don't see the point of making Coq au Vin with boneless chicken breasts as this book's recipe suggests. You can get a reasonable dish with a winey taste in mushrooms and white meat, but that isn't Coq au Vin. To get real Coq au Vin, you must go to Julia Child or David Boulud. You would even find something more authentic and worthy of the name in a Martha Stewart volume.<br />Another problem with this book is that there is a lot of inconsistency in the style of recipe writing, even with the single experienced editor.<br />I think this book would have been a lot better if it had left out all of it's baking recipes. The recipe for pastry dough will probably work, but it totally ignores the wisdom of every good pastry chef I've seen of the Food Network regarding using cold ingredients, handling the dough sparingly, and having a delicate touch with the butter. Good cooking often requires finesse. Good baking always requires finesse. I especially dislike the statement at the beginning of the book which recommends substituting butter for margerine. This substitution can be disasterous in some cases such as cookie baking, and somewhat grim in many other cases, especially if you happen to hit upon a margerine with the warning against cooking in small print.<br />The book has a patina of erudition in it's naming classic dishes such as Paella Valenciana, but a native of Valencia would probably get heartburn over the statement that Paella Valenciana is made in all sorts of different ways. It is true than hundreds of culinary writers have said this about `paella', but not about `Paella Valenciana'. A sample of false erudition there.<br />This is a good book for what it does. I would recommend it as a second cookbook, as long as the first cookbook was `The Joy of Cooking' or `James Beard's American Cookery' or some other well regarded basic cookbook which gives proper attention to the subtlties. For a more sophisticated first cookbook, the old standard `Mastering the Art of French Cooking' is as good as it was 40 years ago.yle of recipe writing, even with the single experienced editor.<br />I think this book would have been a lot better if it had left out all of it's baking recipes.

I opened this book expecting to find reasons to dismiss this book as unworthy of our interest. I found no such reasons, and several reasons to give this book a reasonable amount of attention.<br />First, this is genuine Venetian cuisine, not Venetian cuisine interpreted by an American or English writer. The cuisine of the da foiore lives and breaths by the pulse of the Venetian fish markets and the seasons of fishing in the Adriatic. Recipes are also true to the region in focusing on rice and corn meal (polenta), and soft pasta dishes most common in the north, especially those close to the prime rice growing area in Europe. There is also an appropriate mix of Middle Eastern influences harking back to the days when Venice was THE spice merchant of Europe.<br />Second, the recipes are delightful, with a bright mix of the fish and an accompanying vegetable, changing slightly the Italian pairing of separate secondo and contorno dishes. I concur with the author's contention that these are indeed simple recipes. They may not be easy, but they should take less time than usual to master. Virtually all protein is seafood from the northern Adriatic, `right off the boat'. There is a high concentration of bivalve, cephalopod (squid, cuddlefish, and octopus), shrimp, and finfish recipes. There are few lobster or crab dishes and beef, chicken, and veal are not even listed in the index.<br />Third, this may be an Italian cuisine which may be most familiar to Americans after the southern Italian tomato drenched cuisine of tomatoes, hard pasta, and pizza. I was never a great fan of Tuscan dishes, but this cuisine backed by the wines of the Veneto, Bardolino, Valpolicella, Soave, and Prosecco is much more attractive to me than the Chianti of Tuscony or the hundreds of newer wines from Italy on the market. Then there is also grappa to make life just a little more interesting.<br />My most delightful discovery in this book is to find the word, `cicheti' for the Italian counterpart of the Greek and Turkish meze which has become a very popular subject of cookbook authors of late, who make a point of saying that Greek meze is not the same as antipasti. Another interesting discovery is that unlike much of the rest of Italy, Venetians are not horrified at the thought of putting cheese on fish, although they do not do it commonly with the very strong dried cheeses such as parmesan or pecorino romano.<br />Even though the book is written by a man, the true author of the recipes is the author's mother, true to the great Mediterranean tradition of cuisine being the woman's provence.<br />If you already have 20 or more Italian cookbooks, then you have to wrestle with your own obsessions to determine if this is worth the investment. At $35 without the celebrity byline, this may be a bit much, but I recommend it none the less, especially if you are a great fan of seafood.a to make life just a little more interesting.<br />My most delightful discovery in this book is to find the word, `cicheti' for the Italian counterpart of the Greek and Turkish meze which has become a very popular subject of cookbook authors of late, who make a point of saying that Greek meze is not the same as antipasti.

For starters, it's written by Peter Reinhart, a major American authority and writer on bread baking. Then, there are connections in the story to culinary luminaries such as Alice Waters, Wolfgang Puck, Mario Batali, Rick Bayless, Paul Bertolli, and David Rosengarten.<br />The first half of the book is a quest to find the best American pizza, after an incident in Reinhart's home town of Philadelphia when he has a pie from a fondly remembered local restaurant, and it simply does not come up to his fond memories of the pizza of days gone by. As one would expect, the quest begins by a visit to sample the pizzas of Italy in Genoa, Florence, Rome, and Naples, the legendary home of the pizza archetype.<br />Upon returning home, the author and his wife visit famous pizza locations in New York City, New Haven, San Francisco, Los Angles, Chicago, and Phoenix. In case the Food Network has not caught onto this fact yet, some of the very best pizza is made at Pizzeria Bianco by Chris Bianco, a James Beard Best Chef of the Southwest award winner.<br />The author is not so gauche as to make a pronouncement on the best pizza in the country, but comes to the conclusion that a local `best' is the conjunction of a perception of what the best pizza should be and a very good pizzaioli who can produce a pie to meet those expectations. One of the most difficult problems for maintaining a good pizza in the U.S. is keeping a dedicated pizzaioli at work at that position and not to treat the job as just another station for a chef to master and move on. Even food meccas like Chez Panisse have problems keeping up the quality of their crusts in the face of staff rotation.<br />The second half of the book is dedicated to recipes and techniques for making pizzas at home. Given the great variety of wood, coal, gas, and electric ovens used to make pizza commercially, it's hard to imagine that with a reasonable amount of dilligence, people cannot get very good results from their home ovens. The biggest difficulty is that the typical home oven cannot manage more than about 500 degrees Fahrenheit. Reinhardt offers three methods to improve your chances with a home oven, both with and without the convection oven.<br />As Reinhart is a recognized expert on bread baking, I find no basis  for my questioning his recommendations. And, since many of his colleagues believe the crust is five times more important for the quality of the pizza than all the toppings put together, I have to believe Rienhart's advice will be a golden addition to your pizza skills.<br />If there is any question in your mind up to now, be aware that this book deals only with the real deal. There are no short cuts here. The recipes part has chapters on:<br />The Family of Doughs including Napoletana, Roman, New York, Chicago, Sardinian, and Focaccia dough<br />Sauces, including tomato, pesto, and specialty sauces<br />Pizzas, including Mapoletana, neo-Neapolitan, Roman, Grilled, Sardinian, and Pita.<br />The classic American pizza represented primarily by New York City is a neo-Neapolitan pizza, but people in Chicagoland live and die by their deep dish pizzas. This is the source of Reinhardt's conclusion that one's perception of the best is affected greatly by what you grew up with.<br />If you don't like chatty books and you just want the recipes, this may not be the best book for you, but if you want the history, the general techniques, plus an excellent presentation of all the classic recipes, this is the book for you, especially at the very reasonable list price for a very well composed hardcover book.<br />Highly recommended.ith a reasonable amount of dilligence, people cannot get very good results from their home ovens.

A classic	This is Paula Wolfert's first book, originally published in 1973, which makes the case that Moroccan food comprises one of the world's great cuisines, on a par with French, Italian, Indian, Chinese, and Japanese. I am not certain she has succeeded, but she has certainly done an excellent job in presenting the case. In laying out her discussion, she contributes a major addition to the dialogue on how great cuisines arise. Her claim is that four conditions are needed:<br />1. A great variety of local food sources.<br />2. A wide variety of cultural influences.<br />3. A great civilization, in this case, the juncture of Islamic Arabs and local Berbers joining to form a group vital enough to conquer medieval Spain.<br />4. A local palace culture to serve as an impetus to creating new dishes.<br />Paula claims that Morocco fulfills all conditions and if I believe her presentation is accurate, I am willing to believe her case. My only uncertainty is due to my inexperience in other North African cuisines, so I cannot tell if Morocco stands head and shoulders above, for example, the cuisine of Tunisia or Egypt. Of one thing I am sure. Her contention about the four conditions for a great cuisine make a major contribution to my thinking on the subject. It expands greatly the simpler claim of John Thorne that what you need is the memory of a great civilization. If one applies this criterion to all the cuisines I list in the first paragraph, it is clear this list has the ring of truth about it. My main argument against the case for Moroccan cuisine is that aside from couscous, there are no other distinctive world beating food products, unlike Italy's riches in types of cheese, wine, vinegar, breads, and cured meats.<br />For the sake of this book, the value of the argument is not so much in the validity of the conclusion as it is in the passion Ms. Wolfert brings to bear in making the case. Every cuisine should have as vital and knowledgeable an advocate as we see here.<br />The book begins with a brief history of how the mix of peoples created the current Moroccan population and where the centers of Moroccan food culture lie. (I am surprised that Casablanca, the city best known to Americans, seems to play virtually no part in the story of Moroccan history or cuisine. All the real action seems to revolve around Fez, Marrakesh, Tetuan, and many other inland cities.) She opens discussion of Morocco today with a description of the Souks or open air markets common in all Moroccan cities. This includes an enumeration of the spices and herbs most important to Moroccan cuisine. The first thing which surprises me is the geographical distribution of the sources for all these spices. Few are native to the African Mediterranean or Atlantic coast. This chapter has some of the few items which date the book. The first observation is the use of the term `salad oil', common in the US through the 60's, but probably quite foreign to labels in today's supermarket. A second oddity is the statement that the reader may have a hard time finding cilantro (in 1973). In 2003, with the popularity of both Mexican and Southeast Asian cuisine, you can hardly miss it in the most modest supermarket. The opening chapter includes general discussions of other basics such as oil, eggs, butter, chickpeas, honey, preserved meat, and couscous grain. Detailed chapters cover:<br />Bread<br />Soups<br />Salads and Vegetables<br />Savory Pastries<br />Couscous<br />Fish<br />Poultry<br />Meats<br />Desserts<br />Beverages<br />Next to couscous, the star of this book is an extremely elaborate dish named Bisteeya which for all the world appears to be the model for the song line `Four and Twenty blackbirds baked in a pie', as it includes the bodies of many pigeons plus exactly 24 hens eggs! But this is just a footnote to the real drama surrounding Wolfert's discussion of this dish. Others have suggested that Bisteeya originated in Andalusia, as if so complicated a dish must originatein Spain, on European soil. From both linguistic and culinary arguments, Ms. Wolfert makes the case that the dish is purely Moroccan, with the pastry, warga, while very similar to strudel dough and Phyllo dough is actually derived, probably through the Arabs contact with Persia, from the method for making Chinese Spring rolls. Who knew! The technique for making warga is not for the uncommitted so, thankfully, commercially available strudel or phyllo dough will work just fine.<br />The recipes in this book do not require a lot of hard to find ingredients in today's markets and they do not require a lot of special tools except for a couscouserie, which can be improvised from a colander and a stockpot. Also, while Paula does all that is needed to make the recipes at home in an American kitchen, I almost believe that one should not dip into this book casually. The best approach to cooking from this book would be to invest in a real couscouserie and track down a source for some of the more obscure ingredients and a good source of organic free range poultry and prepare several different recipes over the course of a few months. One warning is that most recipes tend to be written for a relatively large number of servings, based on the Moroccan style of eating from a central plate with your fingers and the famous Moroccan hospitality of plenty.<br />This book is a treasure, if you have the least scintilla of interest in the subject. Without even that, being exposed to Ms. Wolfert's passion about food in its full flower is worth the price of admission. I can only wish I would know someone with her feelings about food.soil.

This was certainly the case when I started this book by Paula Wolfert of whom I have been reading for several years. With Elizabeth David and Claudia Roden, she is one of the three great distaff writers of Mediterranean cuisine. This is just appropriate because, as Ms. Wolfert says early in the book, the cuisine of the Mediterranean is the cuisine of women. Even so macho seeming an authority as Mario Batali confirms that most of his recipes he steals from Italian mothers and grandmothers.<br />This book is a pure delight for foodies to read. The depth of personal research and understanding of the material is palpable. At the same time, Ms. Wolfert exercizes one of the most valuable traits of the knowledge business in that she liberally shares with us the sources of understanding. I have no knowledge of her middle eastern sources, but names like Harold McGee, Shirly Corriher, and Nancy Silverton grace the pages with their contributions to Paula's treatise.<br />As the subtitle `A Book of Savory, Sun-Drenched Recipes' indicates, this is primarily just that, a book of recipes where the primary ingredient is either a grain or a green or both from a Mediterranean cuisine. But, Paula spends a considerable amount of room on introducing her subjects with valuable information, all of which is helpful and some of which is surprising. Three of my favorite discussions are:<br />1. Catalogue of greens by taste and by the best way to prepare them. Even books dedicated to the topic of vegetables do not give as good a precis on how to approach leafy green foods as a class. An added attraction is anechotes on episodes where Paula has accompanied people on wild greens collecting excursions.<br />2. Description of how to make couscous and the debunking of myths about the preparation, lead by the statement that couscous is not a pasta.<br />3. Essay on Spanish rice dishes grouped under the heading of arroz OTHER THAN the famous paella Valenciana. It is no surprise to learn that a true Spanish arroz must be made with a Spanish rice such as Calasparra, which can absorb up to two and a half times its weight in liquid. The Italian arborio and carnaroli rices will come close, but they are not the real deal.<br />Another intellectual virtue in this book is that Ms. Wolfert makes a significant effort to not repeat material from her other books, but to refer the reader to them instead. When she does, she specifically quotes the earlier volume.<br />The chapters in this book are:<br />A Bowl of Leafy Greens<br />Bread and Pastries<br />Soups<br />Appetizers<br />Salads<br />Light Meals<br />Main Course Dishes<br />Side Dishes<br />Sweet Greens and Grains<br />Sauces, Condiments, and Seasonings<br />Plus notes on wild edible greens and a generously long mail order sources appendix.<br />One little serendipitous encounter was when I discovered the John Cope and Company in the list of mail order sources. This was a great surprise, as Cope produces but a single product, the PENNSYLVANIA DUTCH speciality, dried corn! It turns out this is an excellent substitute for toasted corn kernels in a Turkish dish of chard stuffed with veal, corn, and mint. Who knew!<br />As always, Ms. Wolfert's recipe narratives are highly detailed, giving the reasons for doing each step along the way, and run the fine line between recreating the authentic dish without putting too great a strain on resources available to the typical American chicken.<br />In thinking about all the things the Food Network has been neglecting to tell me in their programming, it just occurred to me that it would be absolutely delightful to see a short series on major American and British food writers such as Wolfert, Ruth Reichl, Jim Villas, Diana Kennedy, and many more. Just give them 30 minutes to discuss anything they want. I cast that idea on the waters.<br />This book belongs on the shelf of anyone who is seriously interested in food.gs on the shelf of anyone who is seriously interested in food.	2003-12-21

The way I decided to simplify the task was to compare it to another highly regarded `how to cook everything' book. The touchstone I chose is 'James Beard's American Cookery', which is his Magnum Opus, and much larger than the more simply titled `James Beard Cookbook'.<br />My first comparison was to simply see if one had things the other did not. I picked five dishes out of thin air, being things of which I happen to be fond and which are not too unusual to my mind, although several of them may be considered regional specialities. Of the five dishes, Beard outscored Bittman on three out of five dishes, and fell behind Bittman on two dishes.<br />Corn Bread  Beard 1 Bittman None<br />Creamed Chipped Beef  Beard 3 Bittman None<br />Chicken Pot Pie  Beard 3 Bittman None<br />Crab Cakes  Beard None Bittman 1<br />Cabbage, Braised  Beard 1 Bittman 2<br />This is hardly the whole story, but it is certainly a vote for the older book. Beard's book does not have recipes for rabbit or for Chinese noodles, but then, it only claims to be presenting American Cuisine, not `everything'.<br />My next consideration involves the style in which the two books write their recipes. Beard actually used a style made popular by Julia Child's 1962 publication of `Mastering the Art of French Cooking' where the ingredients are listed in the margins and the procedure is in the body of the text. Unfortunately, Beard did not go all the way in restructuring the procedures, as the textual steps are not broken by punctuation as they are in Child's book. Bittman uses a style more commonly seen in newer books, where the procedure is below the ingredients and steps are numbered. I find this much easier to follow. I give this round to Bittman.<br />On the overall range as given by the table of contents, Beard's book covers a wider range of general subjects, but I still consider this a draw, as Bittman's chapters represent more modern interests, including a chapter on international flatbreads which Beard does not cover.<br />On sheer size, Beard wins with  839 pages of text versus Bittman's 806 pages. Beard has 32 pages of index to Bittman's 52 pages of slightly larger fonted index. Probably a tie.<br />Comparing what the two authors write on asparagus, I find little to choose. Volume of material is equal. Bittman gives more options, but few details on most options. Beard gives more background information.<br />Personally, I find Beard much more fun to read and I refer to his book in preference to Bittman's book when I want a simple recipe using a particular foodstuff. My experience with preparing recipes from the two books is that Beard gives me consistantly more satisfactory results, but that is based on a very small sample, given the length of both books.<br />The bottom line is that I must rate Bittman's book very highly especially for the very reasonable price per page, but I recommend Beard to anyone who asks.overs a wider range of general subjects, but I still consider this a draw, as Bittman's chapters represent more modern interests, including a chapter on international flatbreads which Beard does not cover.<br />On sheer size, Beard wins with  839 pages of text versus Bittman's 806 pages.

A foodie delight	Tom Colicchio is part of the elite cadre of New York chefs which include Daniel Boulud, Michael Romano, Alfred Portale, and (in the 1980's) Thomas Keller, so he is as qualified as few others are to write a book with this title. Almost all recent books by celebrity chefs have some slant on their presentation of recipes to, I suspect, justify the higher fare for purchasing the book. As the title clearly states, the slant of this book is to help the reader see cooking the way a trained chef sees cooking and develops recipes.<br />For starters, Colicchio says the typical chef does not start with an endpoint, an idea on what sort of dish they wish to create. Rather, they typically start with one or a few ingredients and apply to them a typical culinary technique such as a braise, roast, or blanche. But how do you braise, roast, or blanche? This gives Colicchio his starting point.<br />Like all crafts and professions, cooking has it's own lingo. One can listen to a conversation between two chefs and have no idea what kind of end product they will reach based on the words they use to refer to the methods to be used. `Blanching' is one of my favorites. My rudimentary knowledge of French tells me it is derived from the word for `white'. One may guess from that that the object of blanching is to make something white. Oddly, the actual intended effect of blanching is often to make something more vividly green. So there you have it. We have some techniques to learn. Colicchio does just that in the first part of the book and succeeds in giving some of the best descriptions of stock and sauce making I have seen. It also covers the techniques of buerre fondu, which few other books discuss and none discuss as well. (Be warned, Colicchio really likes to use butter.) Several little gems appear hidden from the Table of Contents. The technique for making vinaigrettes and the explanation of how they work is an excellent little lesson all by itself.<br />From techniques, Colicchio goes on to studies on how to develop ideas about recipes using three different vegetables. And here is one of the more important principles behind Colicchio's thinking. Protein products do vary a bit from item to item and from season to season, but not nearly as much as vegetable products. Fresh tomatoes for example are plentiful and delicious in August and September, and relatively uninteresting for the rest of the year when they come from hothouses or from Florida. For his case studies, Colicchio picks tomatoes, roasted; mushrooms; and artichokes, braised.<br />In the section on tomatoes, the author begins with a lesson on how to roast tomatoes with garlic. He then uses this preparation as an ingredient in six (6) different dishes:<br />Roasted Tomato Risotto<br />Clam ragout with pancetta, roasted tomatoes, and mustard greens<br />Sea bass stuffed with roasted tomatoes<br />Seared tuna with roasted tomato vinaigrette and fennel salad<br />Braised lamb shanks with roasted tomato<br />Caramelized tomato tarts<br />If you don't count the time it takes to prepare the roasted tomatoes, most of the recipes are fairly simple, if you also don't count the time it takes to prepare the stocks and other pantry preparations such as the Onion Confit needed for the tomato tarts. Some other recipes are much longer. Mushrooms and artichokes, both being highly seasonal products, are given a similar treatment.<br />Colicchio then moves on to `advanced' thinking of a style I am finding myself doing more and more often when confronted with a chill chest packed with leftover produce. This section deals with trilogies, groupings of three ingredients, mostly vegetables, and how one can mold the three ingredients into a dish. My main problem with this section is that four of the nine ingredients (ramps, morels, lobster, and duck) in these three trilogies are highly seasonal, difficult to find, expensive, or all three. Not everyone lives or works two blocks away from the Union Square Market. But, the lessons are instructive none the less.<br />This section is one of the first which reminds one that cooking is hard work, especially if you have the kind of dedication to the demands of your prima materia that Colicchio has. One example is in the cooking of lobster, where Colicchio breaks with the simple dunk into boiling water made so famous by the scene from `Annie Hall'. He requires you to kill the beast with your own two hands, remove the roe and tamale, separate claws from tail, and cook the tail wrapped generously in cling wrap. At $10 a pound or more, I guess live lobster deserves that kind of respect.<br />The next section is a three movement concerto with each movement being a solo opportunity for vegetables, which are in season in Spring, Summer, and Fall. These recipes are as good or better than those you may find in books specializing in vegetable recipes. They definitely add value to the book and reinforce the lessons of the previous chapters, even if they also tend to dilute the direction of the argument.<br />The last section is `a few favorites' which are good recipes, long enough to stretch the text to 260 pages.<br />This is a good book, but it will probably not succeed by itself in getting you to think like a chef. Like chess and unlike physics or math, the only way to really learn how to think like a chef is to work like a chef. This book helps you in doing this. One warning. This is not intended to be a complete book of techniques. For that, go to Jaques Pepin's authoritative book on the subject<br />Finally, this book is pricy, but recommended for serious foodies. I agree with some other reviewers that it had less than what I expected, but that is because thinking like a chef may not have been what I expected.sons are instructive none the less.<br />This section is one of the first which reminds one that cooking is hard work, especially if you have the kind of dedication to the demands of your prima materia that Colicchio has.

She thereby does something rare and valuable for younger people starting out on life on their own or with new partners. She also warms the hearts of us old geezers who run through hunderds of books of recipes, techniques, and food characteristics, with little advice on how to use all this stuff. The closest I have seen in recent books to what Ms. Lawson does so well is in the opening chapter of Alton Brown's book on Kitchen Tools where he describes how to pare down you collection of tools to just those you really need and use.<br />Ms. Lawson goes much deeper into uncharted territory. In comparing culinary wisdom to medical expertise, I would describe people such as Mario Batali and Nobu Matsuhisa as great specialists and Martha Stewart and Ina Garten as talented general practicioners who can give excellent diagnoses for the best pie crust or the perfect roasted turkey, but they simply don't touch the question of why do I want to make a pie crust, when, and how often. In this simile, Nigella is the holistic practicioner who treats the whole body.<br />One of her first principles is the position that one should be much more concerned with repeating the basics and thereby doing them very well, to the point where your confidence with the techniques makes them second nature. The closest I have ever come to seeing this advice elsewhere is when Daniel Boulud says that the difference between a professional chef and the home chef (or the culinary journalist for that matter) is that the professional has prepared dishes thousands of times over and in that way has acquired a knowledge of their techniques and materials which a nonprofessional cannot match. I can add this to the number of lessons one can learn from professional chefs.<br />I am in almost total agreement with practically every general strategy Ms. Lawson discusses. I sympathize totally with her devaluing the very tiring mantra of always cooking what is best and what is in season. This is fine if you live in Apulia or Napa Valley, but it is a bit rough on the old green veggie regimen if you live in London or Philadelphia. The failure to fully develop this theme in Ms. Lawson's later volume `Forever Summer' and other problems with that volume lead me directly to this book, as I was surprised at the other book's deficiencies, given Ms. Lawson's reputation and attention in the popular media.<br />Ms. Lawson also writes as part of the community of culinary writers and not as if she is coming up with all sorts of good stuff out of her own ingenuity. Other writers state that they are building on other work, but are shy about citing specific references. Nigella is proud of her mentors, as well she should be, since they include people like Elizabeth David, Claudia Roden, and Marcella Hazan. Oddly, this is not to say Ms. Lawson's works are directed to the same end as the books of these notables. In a sense, she is taking the basic research of the regional specialists and translating it into advice for the rest of us.<br />The book is divided into eight (8) rather unconventional chapter subjects, each one discoursing on a particular food strategy or principle. The chapters are:<br />BASICS, ETC. develops the principle cited above that it is a good thing to prepare the same recipes often. Nigella here offers her candidates for some of the most important recipes for everyday use.<br />COOKING IN ADVANCE is her solution to the anxieties of cooking for entertaining. While others have mined this principle broadly, Lawson goes deeper into the issues of cooking without stress so you can make and recover from mistakes to gain your own style.<br />ONE AND TWO addresses the issues of cooking for others and revisits the `tyranny of the recipe' and the `absence of slowly acquired experience on the other'.<br />WEEKEND LUNCH offers this venue as a less stressfuloccasion for entertaining than the dinner party.<br />DINNER addresses the dreaded full court dinner party and weans us away from a type of restaurant dish which requires deft saute action in the kitchen while your guests are at the dining table.<br />LOW FAT is Ms. Lawson's take on weight maintenance and reduction. I am pleased to see that she focuses on the simplest fact that weight change equals food in minus calories consumed by activity.<br />FEEDING BABIES AND SMALL CHILDREN is a refreshing topic. It is a great pleasure to see this subject addressed by a main stream author and not just in a speciality title. I have always puzzled over the tyrrany of kids culinary proclivities and why adults so willingly caved into them. Ms. Lawson offers some advice on the matter.<br />This is a very good book and I now know how Ms. Lawson has earned her good name in the culinary writing business. This doesn't mean I will stop referring to my Eric Rippert or even my Jamie Oliver, as these people are the really creative culinary figures from which Ms. Lawson and the rest of us will borrow, but I will look on their offerings in a new light.<br />I highly recommend this book and that you read it from cover to cover, even the rug rat material.

Very Delish	James Beard Award winning New York chef Marcus Samuelsson has headlined the writing of this book of  his `New Scandinavian Cuisine' and the food of the restaurant of the same name `Aquavit'. This book is a coffee table foodie picture and recipe book in the same style as Eric Rippert's `Return To Cooking' and Thomas Keller's `French Laundry Cookbook'. The price is a typically high $45. The big question is whether the acoutrements attached to the recipes make it worth more than a $30 cookbook. It is also a valid question to ask if it is worth $30 as a cookbook alone.<br />I think the answer to the second question is a solid `Yes'. The cuisine and the recipes are interesting, inviting, and accessible to the average home cook. Samuelsson makes it clear from the subtitle of his book that he is spicing up the usual Swedish meatballs and gravlax with fusion elements. The surprise is that middle eastern spices arrived in Swedish cuisine several centuries ago through the Swedish East India Company trade between India and Stockholm.<br />The book has thirteen chapters, mixing conventional with unconventional recipe categories. These are:<br />The Raw and the Cured is preparations of uncooked salmon, herring, tuna, bass, char, cod, duck, and beef.<br />Bites, Snacks, and Little Plates, appetizers and hors d'oeuvres<br />Sandwiches, more gravlax, plus wraps and crispbread<br />Salads, fairly conventional root vegetables, seafood, and trendy greens. Still delish.<br />Soups, with mushroom consomme, yellow split pea, chicken soup, and smoked salmon<br />Fish and Shellfish with char, snapper, halibut, cod, monkfish, sea bass, tuna, lobster, and more salmon<br />Birds, Meat, and Game with recipes using coffee, Glogg, lots of mustard, and fruit<br />Sides with lots of Mediterranean, Korean, Central Asian, and Northern European representatives,plus lots of mustard and even more smoked salmon.<br />Crackers and Breads with typical Swedish flatbread, potato mustard seed bread, and bread with blueberries.<br />Jams, Salsas, and Chutneys with mustard, berries, horseradish, and mangos<br />Desserts with lots of unusual berries and candied beets, citrus, and ginger.<br />Drinks with Aquavit, berrry liqueur, and glogg (a wine, spice, fruit, and sugar holiday drink)<br />Some of the most interesting recipes are for Crispy Salmon Skin, Slow Roasted Turkey Wings, Tuna Burger with Cabbage Tzatziki, Salsify Cappuccino, Seared Tuna and Sfcallops with Soy Beurre Blanc, Prune-Stuffed Rack of Lamb, Crispy Duck (breasts) with glogg sauce, Carrot Parsnip cake. One of the most unusual pantry items in the book is Berbere, a hot Ethopian spice mix similar to Middle Eastern and Indian mixes. Other unusual ingredients are berries which appear to be exclusive to Scandinavia. Fortunately, few recipes include these berries.<br />The very best part of the recipes, as it always is in book of this type, are the chef author's notes and comments regarding how the dish came about. The value of this text is what makes the difference between just another cookbook and something worth the extra bucks. The discussions of smoking are especially interesting, seeing how it is done outside the world of the great American barbecue. One comment is especially interesting in showing how Samuelsson used smoking farm raised fish to simply reproduce some of the gamy flavor found in wild fish.<br />I generally feel that a fusion cuisine must do just a little more than a purely ethnic cuisine to prove itself. Ethnic cuisines such as Italian, Indian, Thai, Japanese, and French have stood the test of time. A particular interpretation of Gnocchi may be a little off, but the dish is generally very reliably tasty and satisfying. Samuelsson has two things which more than outweigh this innate disadvantage. First, just like in Venetian cuisine, much of the fusion of diverse cultural influences was done for him three centuries ago by the trade with India and the middle east. Second, Scandinavian cuisine is not well known to American tastes outside the north central plains states. Thus, his successes will be more interesting than an Italian / Thai fusion dish.<br />Like many books of this type, it is as much a creation of a team as it is by a single person. The copyrite page gives credits to a book designer, a food stylist, a prop stylist, and a team of photographers, who happen to be the same pair of photographers who did Eric Rippert's `A Return to Cooking'. All this artistic talent has paid off, as the photography is almost as luscious as the food and they avoided some of the design errors of Ripert's book. However, the photographs of the completed dishes do not always match the recipe. I found at least two cases where the food in the picture was prepared using a different set of directions than those given in the recipe, and, the method in the picture was clearly better for both presentation and logical cooking. I will not say there would be a difference in flavor and I'm sure the intent was to write out the easier method for the home cook, but it did spoil my appreciation of the book just a smidge.<br />Overall, this is a very well done book of it's type and well worth the money to acquire the recipes, the comments, and the much better than average food styling and photography.

Before opening the covers of this book, I was anticipating a reasoned argument from an Anti-Alice Waters position followed by possibly at least some general thoughts about using selected produce out of season. Instead, the book is simply a compilation of new recipes with just the thinnest introduction to back up the premise and provide a theme to the headnotes on the various recipes.<br />Make no mistake from the negative tone of the opening paragraph that this book contains bad recipes. It's recipes all look delightful and invite me to make as many as I wish. A lot of the attraction of the recipes in this book is common to many books of this type written by his nibs Jaimie Oliver, Tyler Florence, and Sara Moulton. They are intended to make cooking more fun for the casual cook. It's for those people who have more time to cook than the 30 minute meal crowd, yet are not hard core Molto Mario style foodies who read Paula Wolfert and Claudia Roden. They are people who occasionally want to broaden their range of cooking. And Nigella has the perfect style of book to suit this audience. The center of gravity of her cuisine appears to be Claudia Roden's definition of Middle Eastern food as many dishes have arabic names and Iranian spice mixes in their recipes. She includes many dishes and ingredients from the Orient as well. She is literally all over the map and shamelessly steals from everyone. As a newphyte foodie, I actually have a great appreciation for references to sources of dishes. It is great fun to see the influence of one writer on another, and for the student to not make believe that they are creating recipes out of whole cloth. Like Jamie Oliver, Ms. Lawson has an especially breezy style doubly effective on American audiences with her English slang. My only puzzle is why Ms. Lawson and Mr. Oliver don't seem to share any slang terms. Are they looking over one another's shoulders? They do have the same publisher, after all.<br />In spite of the lushious recipes, there are several annoying things about this book which may make people feel they did not get their money's worth. The very thin discussion of the books premise is the first. The second is the abysmal organization and table of contents. In addition to the very short introduction and the index, there are but four chapter headings in the table of contents for `first course', `second course', `desserts', and `drinks'. Not being very fond of mixed drinks, the twenty pages in the last chapter are lost on me. This doesn't mean there are no divisions but two in the 169 pages dedicated to savory dishes. `first course' is divided up into `pasta', `soups', and `salads' and `second course is divided up into `fish', `meat', `poultry', and `sides and more'. Why in the world did the author or editors not think to put these in the Table of Contents especially since they are essential to the largest audience for this book. The fact that Lawson and Oliver have the same publisher makes me wonder why the photographic styling in `Jamie's Kitchen' is so good yet the photographic styling is so poor in this volume. The photographs of food have no captions. The reader can assume that the recipe and the photo of same are on facing pages, but good luck if there are any pics which don't fit this placing. The non food related pics range from being uninteresting to ugly, especially the washed out pics of Ms. Lawson herself.<br />The recipes are luscious and Ms. Lawson is an engaging writer, but this book does not properly serve it's audience, especially at a list price of $35 a pop. If I were a Nigella Lawson fan, I would ignore everything I said above and buy the book. The recipes are worth it and are worthy of four out of five stars. If I'm looking for a resource for filling out a party menu, check out Ina Garten or Martha Stewart. Much more organization, and accessibility.h more organization, and accessibility.	2003-12-16

The three connect in this book by Ms. David's being the avowed inspiration for Rodin's work and by Claudia Roden's citing Paula Wolfert's excellent book on couscous and referring to one of her other major works in the bibliography. It is also worth noting another literary connection in that the Alfred A. Knopf editor for this book is the acclaimed Judith Jones, the editor for Julia Child's landmark first books on French cuisine. While all of that makes this a noteworthy book with `good connections', it is not what makes the book worth buying.<br />As the title suggests, this book is a new and greatly revised edition of a volume first published in 1968. In this edition, much academic material, i.e. recipes derived from translations of old historical documents has been replaced and augmented by newer material from the Middle East. Ms. Roden clearly states that this is not a work of scholarship, but one should not take from that the feeling that these recipes are not the real thing. I am certain that like Ms. Wolfert, they are genuinely Middle Eastern recipes, made useable by the modern American or English cook.<br />The meaning of `Middle Eastern' in the title may not be exactly what a geographer or historian may mean by `Middle Eastern' or roughly from Turkey to Egypt to Iran. Ms. Roden means primarily the region covered by the greatest advance of the Muslim rule and influence in the European Middle ages. Her four principle regions of concentration are:<br />The earliest and `the most exquisite and refined' is that of Persia, now Iran. This is `the ancient source of much of the `haute cuisine' of the Middle East'. This is the route by which rice from India passed into the Middle East and the West.<br />The second region is roughly the Arab lands now formed into the states of Syria, Lebanon and Jordan. This is where Arab food is at it's best. This includes the Fertile Crescent, which is actually in modern Iraq.<br />The third region is Turkey, or more broadly, the area influenced by the former Ottoman Empire. This presence had its influence most felt in Europe, especially the Balkans, Hungary, Greece, Russia, North Africa, and even Austria and France. This is the source of kebabs, savory pies, yogurt salads, and paper-thin dough.<br />The fourth style is the cuisine of North Africa, extending as far West as Morocco on the Atlantic coast of Africa. The strongest native influence here is in couscous from the Berber nomads who collaborated with the Arabs in conquering southern Spain. This region also retains some of the strongest echoes of the cuisines of ancient Persia and Baghdad.<br />The recipes are divided by the type of central ingredient in dishes, but certain ingredients, most especially olives and olive oil, yogurt, citrus fruits, bulgar wheat, rice, eggplant, and lamb pervade all sections. I was just a bit surprised to find that like the Indian cuisine, clarified butter plays a large role as the `lipid of choice' in this region, keeping parity with olive oil in most regions.<br />The recipe sections in this book are:<br />Appetizers, Salads, and Cold Vegetables such as Stuffed Grape Leaves, Falafel, and Baba Ghanouj<br />Yogurt, including very simple instructions on how to make yogurt at home<br />Savory Pies including Tagine Malsouka, Spanakopitta, and many other Filo based pies<br />Soups, including those of lentils, chickpeas, fava beans, spinach, and carrots<br />Egg Dishes, featuring omelets very similar to the Italian frittata or Spanish tortilla<br />Fish and Seafood, including marinades, kebabs, and North African seafood<br />Poultry, featuring pigeons, squabs, quail, ducks, and many varieties of chicken dishes<br />Meat Dishes featuring lamb, the famous shish kebab, moussaka, meatballs, and sweetmeats<br />Vegetables, featuring artichokes, spinach, zucchini, eggplant, okra, sweet potatoes, and chickpeas<br />Rice, featuring pilafs and rice with favas, dates, yogurt, chickpeas, cherries, lentils, and rhubarb<br />Bulgur, Couscous, and Pasta featuring bulgar pilafs, methods for making couscous, and noodles<br />Breads, featuring pita, pita, and pita<br />Desserts, Pastries, and Sweetmeats featuring citrus fruits, apricots, nuts, cherries, dates, and baklawa<br />Pickles and Preserves featuring preserved lemons, pickled vegetables, chili and tomato sauce<br />Jams and Fruit Preserves featuring citrus, peaches, walnuts, pumpkins, figs, quinces, and eggplant<br />Drinks and Sherbet featuring Lemonade, Laban (Yogurt Drink), coffee, tea, almond milk<br />As one may expect, New World vegetables are present, but not as pervasive as in Italian cuisine.<br />One can see much of this food at the heart of the perceived to be healthy `Mediterranean Cuisine' plus echoes in raw food preparation and in the cuisines of such luminaries with a Mediterranean background such as Eric Ripert. This book did exacerbate my confusion over the term `Meze'. The Greek food expert Diane Kochilas states that it refers only to small dishes served with ouzo and other alcoholic beverages separate from sit down meals. Roden confirms the connection with ouzo but identifies it with dishes opening a meal. I guess it depends on which country you talk to. Sigh.<br />This book is a certifiable classic, especially for those interested in food in general or in Middle Eastern food in particular. The bibliography is an excellent jumping off point for exploring this cuisine. Also, the sidebars of Middle Eastern stories are a real hoot.

865432:US	39134375	R1GO5RLQUHTAUT	0395915376	624069134	The All-American Cookie Book	Books	5	29	30	N	N	Excellent Recipes for American Cookies. No Patissere Here!	This book lives up to it's name by being a collection of recipes originating in many different American regions, as reported in old, regional cookbooks. I've baked many cookies from this book and they have all exactly met expectations. But, the book does not just provide a source of very good cookie recipes, it also paints a little portrait of how a cuisine changes due to changing access to ingredients and cooking equipment. Many of the recipes date from the middle to the late 19th century because lots of important cookie ingredients such as both chocolate and vanilla did not become commonly available to the American baker until that time. Similarly, temperature controlled ovens did not become available until the late 19th century which is important since cookies are much more sensitive to temperature control than larger, more important goods such as bread.<br />The book contains chapters on nine (9) different types of cookies:<br />Sugar Cookies and Shortbreads, 18 recipes, including my very favorite Snickerdoodle recipe<br />Chocolate and White Chocolate Chip Cookies, 18 recipes, including 6 variations on chocolate chip<br />Chocolate and Mocha Cookies, 10 recipes, including `pies', bars, and sandwiches<br />Brownies, Blondes, and Other Bar Cookies, 25 recipes, including brownies and fudge cookies<br />Fruit, Pumpkin, and Carrot Cookies, 21 recipes, including tassies, ambrosia cookies, and fig cookies<br />Nut and Peanut Cookies, 16 recipes, including my favorite bourbon balls and peanut butter cookies<br />Oat, Coconut, and Sesame Seed Cookies, 13 recipes, including 7 variation on oatmeal cookies<br />Ginger, Spice, and Molasses Cookies, 13 recipes, including lots of Pennsylvania favorites<br />Cookie Decorating and Crafts, 18 recipes for cutout cookies and icings<br />I have not examined every cookie book currently available, and there is no question that this book does not include classically European cookies like Madeleines, but if what you want is good old fashioned cookies for holidays or otherwise, you will not go wrong with this book.<br />If you need additional sources of American cookies, this book includes a very respectable bibliography.<br />I also strongly urge the new cookie baker to read and follow Ms. Baggett's suggestions on how to succeed at cookie baking. I also urge new cookie bakers to follow individual recipes very carefully. They are adapted from old recipes, which may not have been very precise about measurements; however, Ms. Baggett's version of the recipes corrects that with great success in every case that I have tried. I am especially fond of her taking the trouble to leave selected recipes to using baking soda and cream of tartar, as in the snickerdoodles rather than replacing this pair with baking powder. One irony is that she has converted weights into volume measurements which are typically less precise, but it certainly works, due to the greater uniformity of ingredients today. It is also certainly easier for the home baker.<br />Photographs are welcome eye candy and are well done, but contribute little to your for success with the recipes.<br />Well done all around, Nancy.for holidays or otherwise, you will not go wrong with this book. <br />If you need additional sources of American cookies, this book includes a very respectable bibliography.<br />I also strongly urge the new cookie baker to read and follow Ms. Baggett's suggestions on how to succeed at cookie baking.

866175:US	39134375	R33ZQOUG1OEW72	1584792574	13584737	Gratins: Golden-Crusted Sweet and Savory Dishes	Books	4	22	22	N	N	An Importantly Useful Source of Easy, Tasty Dishes	This is the type of book I find the most useful in my collection of over 200 cookbooks for finding a recipe to fit a particular niche in a menu. The book deals with a single type of dish, the gratin, but it has at least one big surprise. That is, the dishes in the book are evenly divided between 39 recipes for savory gratins and 39 recipes for sweet gratins. And, the author on the cover is more closely associated with the creation of the sweet gratins than he is with the savory.<br />The best thing about the savory gratins is that few if any of them would be considered standards. There are, of course, some which include sliced potatoes, but all of these include some new twist to make them more interesting. That means, you have 39 new dishes which are easy to access and relatively easy to prepare. In fact, almost all savory gratins are made with the same drill:<br />- Boil an ingredient, usually a pasta or vegetable, until al dente.<br />- Saute one or more ingredients, usually onion and garlic and a vegetable.<br />- Create a sauce, sometimes from the sauteed mixture, sometimes in a double boiler.<br />- Heat the oven to about 425 degrees fahrenheit, sometimes heat the broiler.<br />- Grease a gratin dish, build the gratin by layering ingredients.<br />- Heat in oven for 15 to 45 minutes until bubbling or until top is browned.<br />There are small variations with each recipe, so there is no thought of turning this into a formula, but once you get the drill down, each new recipe becomes that much easier.<br />If you did not adduce this fact from the publisher or from the author's bio, you may be able to see from the savory contents that this book was written by a French chef. The amount of butter used in these savory dishes is enough to keep Land o Lakes in business for a very long time. Not to mention that it will keep a battalion of hens in the egg laying business until the cows come home.<br />The savory gratins are very good, but the main attraction is the sweet gratins, which actually appear first in the book. The differences between the savory and sweet gratins are not merely based on using the same drill with sugar replacing onions and garlic and fruit replacing brocolli and potatoes. It is true that every sweet gratin does feature one or more fruits, but there is a greater variety of containers. Many of the sweet gratins are done on dessert dishes, ramekins, and small souffle dishes rather than the trusty old gratin dish. (To be fair, several savory dishes use ramekins also, but not as many). The sweet gratins replace boiling and sauteeing with macerating fruit and creating custards. The sweet gratins' recipes are typically one or two steps longer than the savory, and, as true of pastry the world around, often require a closer attention to measuring and to the application of heat. Custards and caramels are very finicky!<br />One thing the two styles of gratin share is that their style of finishing in the oven means that they will rarely be the dish on the critical path to getting a meal on the table. Savory gratins and warm sweet gratins will very nicely stay warm in an oven for many minutes while you fuss with the last minute sautee.<br />There are at least three features of this book which distinguish it from most other cookbooks. First, there is a complete list of recipes at the beginning of the book. For all but the largest `Joy of Cooking' style of book, I always consider this a plus. For this type of book, it is a real added value. Second, there is an index of ingredients in the back, separated by sweet and savory, indicating all of the recipes in which the ingredient was used. For example, if you have some leftover leeks, you can easily find the two gratin recipes which include leeks. Third, there is virtually none of the chatty headnotes and sidebars which you find in cookbooks of almost all styles. I did miss this, as they tend to make the book more interesting to read, but it stresses the point that this bookis all business, gratin business, that is.<br />The book is very attractive and very typical of a European style of binding. I found two small issues with the book. First, while the binding of the book is very sturdy, especially for a volume listing at less than 30 dollars, it is too stiff and not made to lie flat. Not a good configuration for a cookbook. Second, there were at least two misprints, neither one attributable to a faulty translation from French to English.<br />I give this four stars because this book is USEFUL and it's recipes are relatively easy! I don't give it five stars because it does not, unlike some books by Daniel Boulud or Tom Colicchio or Mario Batali or Paula Wolfert, broaden and deepen my understanding of the culinary arts.iness, gratin business, that is.<br />The book is very attractive and very typical of a European style of binding.

866376:US	39134375	R11F56D3JHKB8R	0821228544	839952919	Our Latin Table: Celebrations, Recipes, and Memories	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A Superior Resource for Cuban Family Meals and Spirits	This is a book of Spanish influenced recipes, gathered into celebratory menus including alcoholic drinks which were the centerpiece to a large extended Cuban family transplanted to the U.S. and enriched by pan Caribbian food influences and close association with the American foodie family.<br />The introduction and the blurbs on the back of the book read like a Who's Who of the Food Network and other American food icons. We are treated to references to Mario Batali, Bobby Flay, Alice Waters,Norm Van Aken, Joe Bastianich, Alex Garcia, and Aaron Sanchez. Food influences from Mexico, Texas, Argentina, and Peru join the basicly Spanish / Cuban cuisine.<br />Almost all of the recipes are fairly simple and fairly familiar to anyone who has grown up with a Latin cuisine. One central theme in the batterie of recipes is that Cuban cuisine is not as spicy as Mexican cuisine and that rums of various ages are an important ingredient in many dishes, not to mention the very large number of mixed drink recipes presented in the book.<br />In a country where Latin cuisine ingredients now rival the availability of Italian specialities, there should be no problem in acquiring the ingredients for these recipes.<br />I dislike echoing blurbs on the dust jackets of books since, no matter how sincere they may be, the author is being paid for the complimentary opinion. However, I must say that Bobby Flay's quote really does hit the mark. That is `\\"Our Latin Table\\" is a delicious blend of savory dishes, festive menus, and strong family traditions with a Latin beat'. I will also echo the loquacious Mario in giving very favorable opinion of the photographs which the editors or authors have very kindly provided with meaningful captions, even if the contents are nothing more notable than two or more family members enjoying one another's company. The very last photo of a warmly lit large house after sunset convey's the spirit of the book as well as it's many celebrations of family life.<br />I have one serious criticism and a few annoyances. The serious issue is the fact that the glossary would have benefited from some serious editing. The `aprepas` definition, the first to appear: `Corn cakes made with corn meal' should have been more informative. Another is the definition of pancetta identified as `Italian Fresh Bacon'. It would have been much more useful to describe it as `Italian Unsmoked Pork Belly, for which bacon can be substituted'. There are others, none of which are terrible, but enough shade one's opinion of the book as a serious culinary work. The only annoyance worth airing may be the fact that in a very eclectic collection of Latin music, there is no mention of tangos by the Argentinean, Astor Piazzola or the bossa nova songs by Brazilian Antonio Carlos Jobin. Sigh.<br />I heartily recommend this book to people who cook for Latino families, no matter how large or small. The book has a somewhat lesser utility as a source for people looking for a specific Latin recipe. For them, works by Diana Kennedy, Rick Bayless, or others may be a better choice.ave one serious criticism and a few annoyances.

867084:US	39134375	R1LU6QLUAIY0RC	0060392622	702491703	Raw: The Uncook Book: New Vegetarian Food for Life	Books	4	10	11	N	N	Raw Preparations Brasserie Style	I embarked on a review of this book to get a different perspective on the raw food techniques presented by the very well known Charlie Trotter and his co-author Roxanne Klein in the new book entitled simply `Raw'. I was skeptical that Trotter's book approached the subject in a way which would encourage anyone to try this food if they were not already devoted to the doctrine.<br />This older book goes a long way toward making this cuisine a lot more practical and interesting to the ordinary foodie and certainly more accessible to the Vegans to whom this approach will be attractive. The raw food movement actually goes at least one step beyond the vegan doctrine in that it excludes any foodstuffs which have been processed at a temperature of 120 degrees Fahrenheit or above. By extension, it excludes any foodstuffs which can only be made palatable by heating to this temperature. This excludes virtually all conventional baking. By coincidence, it also excludes virtually all white starchy foods such as potatoes, white rice, and pasta. This immediately makes the cuisine more attractive as a resource for those people who have a strong inclination to reducing carbohydrates.<br />Juliano Brotman's book is accessible to more people because it eliminates one barrier placed by Trotter's book in that it uses very few unusual fresh ingredients. It's list of special materials should certainly be much more accessible to anyone living in or near a large city or near a good health food store. As always, non-perishable special items are availible to anyone within reach of an Internet connection. Juliano's book goes an extra step by supplying substitute methods for techniques which are best done by a juicer or a dehydrator. As long as one has a good blender and an oven which can sustain a temperature close to 120 degrees Fahrenheit, you can do most of the recipes in this book. More recipes are accessible if materials processed by a juicer can be bought from a local health food store.<br />The book does not remove the perception that this cuisine involves a lot of prep work and a lot of prep work for intermediate pantry items. The list of ingredients, most involving some kind of knive work, blending, or grinding, is imposing. It is a testament to modern fresh produce distribution methods that it is practical to maintain this kind of cuisine outside of California. Even so, the number of different fresh ingredients with different seasons can make some of the recipes pretty expensive, if even possible in less urban parts of the country. But, there is no question that this book makes this very extreme form of cuisine more acessible to a larger number of people than does the Charlie Trotter book.<br />I would still warn people on the outside looking in that this cuisine involves a major commitment of time. One unespected requirement of this cuisine is that prep time is often much longer than for conventional methods. At the heart of this issue is processes using a dehydrator (or an oven in place of a dehydrator). These techniques look a whole lot like baking or roasting, but at a low temperature for a much longer time. A second major time commitment comes from soaking and sprouting nuts and seeds. These processes, very commonly used in recipes, take from four (4) hours to five (5) days. And after this, you don't even get bread! Just kidding. There is no doubt that many processes in conventional cuisine do take a long time. The most common is the baking of artisinal breads. But,  little of the day to day cooking most people do require much more than two hours to prep and cook.<br />I will not question the premises behind the raw food doctrine, as I am not qualified to evaluate it's claims to being a more healthy way to eat. I will only offer the observation that the doctrine appears to involve a lot of spirituality and I cannot but believe there is a certain placebo effect taking place. I also believe people commited to this cuisine are eating fewer harmful materials and many of the foods they eat are certifiably good for most people. I'm also sure it is a good way to stay thin.<br />There are some suggestions and objections I have about the book, but none detract from the book's overall worth.<br />First, I am very surprised the book uses just `olive oil' as an ingredient instead of `extra virgin olive oil'. There is a danger that a reader may take this as a license to pick just any olive oil product, some of which may have included a considerable amount of heat to extract the last bits of oil from the olives after all the easy oil has been obtained by cold pressing.<br />Second, I always object to long pantry item suggestions, and this book's pantry suggestions appear to have a lot more problems than most, as it includes a large number of perishable commodities such as cilantro,parsley, romaine, basil, mushrooms, tomatoes, avocados, and dates. My philosophy with pantry items is to never buy anything unless I plan to use it as an ingredient within the next day for perishables and the next week for durable foodstufs.<br />Third, I object to a few of the more polemical (and plainly false) statements such as the clain that we replace water cooked out of foods by dirty tap water. The overall quality of the bood does not deserve this.<br />This is RAW brasserie to Charlie Trotter's RAW haute cuisine.

867286:US	39134375	RMUH95U150PLD	0141181532	248695390	French Provincial Cooking (Penguin Classics)	Books	5	96	96	N	N	A Fountainhead of Modern American Cuisine	Elizabeth David is one of foremost writers on food in the latter half of the 20th century and this book has her most celebrated writing. For this reason, I was inspired to write this modest review when I saw Amazon feature the volume as an offering, 43 years after it's first publication in England.<br />It is a coincidence of no small meaning that this book appeared within two years before the publication of Julia Child et al's landmark `Mastering the Art of French Cooking'. Child was even worried, when David's book appeared, that it may steal a lot of the thunder from Child and her colleague's effort. The fact is, the two books are very much like the Wittgensteinian `duck rabbit' optical illusion in that they deal with the same subject but from different points of view.<br />One distinction is that while Child's book is simply a cookbook of French recipes, David's book is a long essay on French cuisine, offering the sketches of recipes more as exercizes to be completed by the reader than as true recipes. In fact, it is one of the most enduring legacies of Child's book that it redefined the detail to which a recipe writer should go in order to adequately communicate the process of preparing a dish.<br />A second distinction between the two is that they deal with two different facets of French cuisine. As David recites from work by Curnonsky, there is haute cuisine, la cuisine Bourgeoise, la cuisine Regionale, and la cuisine Improvisee. David discourses on the third while Child, et al present the second.<br />For many, including such luminaries as Jeremiah Tower and Alice Waters, Elizabeth David is the fountainhead of thinking on the French notion of `la cuisine terroir', sometimes interpreted by the notion `what grows together goes together'. For David, this is the heart of regional cooking, and the thing which most distinguishes it from cooking at restaurants where clientele arrive at any time of the year or the day and expect to be able to order virtually any well known French speciality.<br />One of the passages which best characterizes David's approach to a lot of cooking is her opening statement on the perfect omelette: `As everybody knows, there is only one infallible recipe for the perfect onelette: you own.' I'm sure this would not work for Daniel Boulud, but it works just fine for me, after having seen about five (5) different, contrary techniques on how to make the perfect omelette.<br />It's interesting to constantly encounter reminders that the book was written before the widespread distribution of Teflon coated cookware, as there is no mention of it, even for egg cookery. I believe the book is all the more valuable for this fact, in that it paints a picture of a cooking style which has irrevokably been changed by technology. A second technological change brought upon the world by the French themselves is the 'robot-coupe' or food processor. It's noteworthy that the device is only mentioned in Notes to the 1985 edition where it is pointed out that the device was a major contribution to both the good and the bad aspects of nouvelle cuisine.<br />As stated above, the recipes are not as much presented as a blueprint to reproduce every dish cited, but rather to illuminate the discourse. One of my favorites is the entry for Salade Nicoise, where not one but four (4) different variations are given, including the variation of Escoffier.<br />The sections on French kitchen equipment and French techniques appear to be quite complete and absolutely essential if you embark on reading a cookbook written in French. The book has a short essay on each of the major culinary regions of France, starting. Almost obviously with Provence which is blessed not so much with great culinary talent as a great source of produce, similar, perhaps to the situation in California where the `la cuisine terroir' could take root much more easily than in Toledo or Albany. The largest portion of the book is chapters on cuisine by type of foodstuf or type of preparation such as:<br />Sauces<br />Hors-D'oeuvres and Salads<br />Soups<br />Eggs and Cheese<br />Pates and Terrines<br />Vegetables<br />Fish<br />Shellfish<br />Meat<br />Composite Meat Dishes<br />Poultry and Game<br />Left-overs<br />Sweet dishes<br />The book ends with a bibliography which alone is worth the price of the paperback volume.<br />This book begs to be read from cover to cover.

The most important element in determining whether you wish to buy this book is whether or not you really want another book of French brasserie recipes specifically as they are prepared at this restaurant. I give it only four stars to serve as a warning to think before you click on the order button.<br />These recipes are very good, divided into the chapters:<br />Appetizers, soups, and breakfast: 18 such as Salade Nicoise, Gravlax, steak tartare, onion soup gratinee<br />Fish and Shellfish: 23 such as Bouillabaisse, Sole en Papillote, Grilled swordfish, Koulibiac<br />Chicken and Game: 10 such as Coq au Vin, Duck a l'Orange, Cassoulet, rabbit Moutarde<br />Meat: 15 such as Steak Frites, steak au poivre, Pork Milanese, Glazed pork belly, Choucroute Garnie<br />Vegetables and Sides: 20 such as French Fries, Potato Gratin, Potato gnocchi, spaetzle, onion rings<br />Desserts: 9 such as Cr&egrave;me Brulee, Profiteroles, French Apple Tart, Pavlova, Lemon Mille-Feuille<br />You get the picture. If you have any three French cookbooks chosen at random, you will probably have recipes for over half of these dishes already. I am really surprised there is no recipe for an omlet.<br />Good reasons for buying this book are:<br />- Resource for an entertaining menu based on a French brasserie theme.<br />- Source of several very good general entertaining recipes, especially dishes like Pot au Feu, Choucroute Garnie, and Bouillabaisse which may have three or four different types of protein. This is very well suited to groups with varied tastes.<br />- Source for some brasserie recipes which one may not find in French cookbooks, such as the Italian and German influenced dishes of gnocchi, spaetzle, and choucroute garnie.<br />On the plus side, this is a very attractively prepared book and the recipes are adapted to being prepared at home. I wish, in fact, that the authors would have been truer to their restaurant methods. I have always believed that one of the many things a home cook can learn from restaurant practice is how to be economical with ingredients. In some preparations involving mushrooms, they say to discard the stems. I will bet good money that in the restaurant they put the stems into their vegetable stock pot.<br />There are several editorial gafes I have come to expect in Clarkson Potter books. This book introduces some new ones. First, the titles of the recipes begin the book all in French (with no English translation) and somewhere in the middle of fish and shellfish, they switch to English (with no French translation). From that point on, they switch back an forth between English and French almost randomly. Second, after carefully laying out pages so that everything relevant to a recipe is on two facing pages, they leave sidebars for one dish to slip over onto the next pair of pages. Third, the forward by Robert Hughes repeats material in Keith McNally's introduction. I guess he thought nobody reads Forewords. Fourth, the Foreward says most restaurants avoid swordfish, yet there on page 74 is a recipe for grilled swordfish. Sacre Bleu!<br />These are all minor gaffs, and I give Hughes special credit for the overall quality of his essay. It is clearly superior to similar material in a recent gloss on the life of his Manhatten restaurants by Daniel Boulud. This brings an interesting contrast to Balthazar's food to what you will find in Caf&eacute; Boulud, especially since the joint chefs at Balthazar cite Boulud as their mentor. While both are firmly based in French cuisine, they are clearly based on two different styles of French cooking. Brasserie cooking was designed to be a type of fast, inexpensive food while Boulud's haute cuisine is meant for serious sit down sessions of marathon eating and drinking. The result is that to my taste, having all the time in the world to cook, I find Boulud's dishes much more inviting from their descriptions on the printed page than do Balthazar's brasserie fare. But that's me.<br />The photography is comptetant with the usual fuzziness in the closeups and the usual absence of captions. Sigh. The overall design of the book is very clever and bright, easy to read, and, I suppose, based on the look of the Balthazar menu.<br />Overall, it is very well done and a worthy purchase. Just be careful to evaluate how you expect it will complement your needs and your cookbook collection.ted page than do Balthazar's brasserie fare.

869568:US	39134375	R3MR8QG5TLIUT5	0743243757	39190693	Tom Valenti's Soups, Stews, and One-Pot Meals: 125 Home Recipes from the Chef-Owner of New York City's Ouest and 'Cesca	Books	5	42	48	N	N	Very Good Versions of Standards All Very Accessible	If I only bought cookbooks to cook from, this would be my most desirable type of book. First, because one can go to this book when you know you want an easy one pot meal instead of wading through lots of restaurant chef and Italian cuisine and French cuisine books. Second, because the recipes in this book are good.<br />There is little need to summarize the content of the book, as the title pretty much tells the story. You also should believe the statement on the cover that these are `home recipes' and not the kind of recipe Tom Valenti typically makes at his restaurants, or, at the very least, he does not make them in the same way at his restaurants.<br />The cover says there are 125 recipes which, on the face of it is a tad thin for the $30 tariff. These are broken down by:<br />Hearty soups and chowders: 18 including classics such as `pasta fazool', clam chowder, and lobster bisque<br />Casseroles, stews, and chilis: 28 including risottos, fish stews, sausage and cabbage stew, and venison chili<br />Large Cuts and catches: 29 including leg of lamb, beef brisket, pork shank, and hunter style chicken<br />Accompaniments and additions: 10 including pastas, rice, potatoes and polenta<br />Condiments and Garnishes: 9 including pesto, aioli, roasted tomatoes, and croutons<br />Oops, that is only 94. The remaining recipes are variations on main recipes plus recipes for chicken and beef stocks. Since almost recipe in the first three chapters has one or more variations, the effective total may be closer to 200. The bottom line is that these 94 basic recipes are worth the higher toll than you may find in some other books.<br />One way I recognize a superior book is when they illuminate properties in ingredients (as in Paul Bertoli's Cooking by Hand book) or make fine distinctions in technique to achieve superior results. Valenti does a double service in this book by endorsing the use of supermarket stocks for most recipes and the use of an immersion blender for most recipes, yet he makes a point of indicating which recipes would come out a lot better by using homemade stocks or a bar blender or food processor. An additional feature of several recipes is where the authors present alternatives for dishing out the meal on the day after on `Tomorrow's Table'.<br />It is important to not assume this is a book on quick cooking or that you will not have more than one pot to clean at the end of the day. As the authors freely admit, there is a lot of moving stuff back and forth from the central pot used in the preparation and there may be some supplementary heating up, but most of the action takes place in the center ring. The main thrust of this statement is that there are no auxillary preparations such as making a fish stock for bouillabaisse or making a lobster shell broth to make lobster bisque. The authors do not guarantee that the techniques in this book will produce results which rival the recipes with separate steps. What they do promise is that the results will be very good with somewhat less active time and one or more fewer pots to scrub. Be warned that some of the recipes will take very long indeed. Witness the name of the recipe `Seven Hour Lamb'.<br />It is no surprise that Tom Valenti is very fond of bacon, as this is a very common ingredient in the classical preparations of soups, stews, and braises. He uses it in many of the recipes and freely admits he is very fond of all things pork. One curious statement he makes in this regard are when he lumps Canadian bacon together with American / English style bacon and pancetta. The latter two are from pork belly while the former is sliced pork loin, and is very lean. Another curiosity is when he states that prociutto rather than pancetta can be substituted for bacon in a recipe. I am not sure if these are misstatements or represent a deeper understanding of these products than I have.<br />The foreword by Mario Batali originally attracted me to the book, as Molto Mario is my culinary hero, although the dust jacket blurbs from Mario, Bobby Flay, and Lidia Bastianich probably relate a lot more to Tom Valenti's founding the `Windows of Hope' program than they do with the innate quality of the book. And, I rarely trust blurbs anyway, since these people are paid to offer these statements. My reward for following Mario's lead is that I find that one of his nicknames is `beefy cheeks', due to his love of beef jowls. And here I thought he only cared about pig jowls.<br />If you like one pot meals with no rare or expensive ingredients (aside from a little saffron here and there) and relatively easy techniques, then this is the book for you. It may not be the very best book on the subject, but it is very good.although the dust jacket blurbs from Mario, Bobby Flay, and Lidia Bastianich probably relate a lot more to Tom Valenti's founding the `Windows of Hope' program than they do with the innate quality of the book.

870607:US	39134375	R2GB01EYJ10YEO	0936184388	360661070	The Best Recipe	Books	5	9	15	N	N	Wisdom for the Everyday Cook at a very good price	There is a catch in the title of this book. That is, what is the `best recipe' depends a whole lot on what you want in the recipe. Rachael Ray's best recipe for a beef stew is one, which will be done in less than 30 minutes. Daniel Boulud's best recipe for beef stew is the most flavorful which will go well with his wine cellar. `Better Homes and Garden's' best recipe may be the one, which is the least expensive with a reasonably good taste, regardless of the time required to prepare it. `Light Cuisine's' best recipe is the one with the fewest fat and fewest saturated fat calories. You get the picture.<br />The `best recipe' in the opinion of the editors of `Cooks illustrated' is generally the one with the most flavor which can be completed in a reasonable amount of time. This means that it may in fact be quite possible to achieve a more flavorful result if you are willing to spend more time with the preparation. There are usually additional special criteria depending on the recipe. My favorite example is the recipe for a simple tomato sauce. The objective of the editors is to use a minimum number of ingredients (tomato, oil, garlic, and salt) in order that they may achieve the most distinctively tomato flavor in the result. This eliminates many common tomato sauce ingredients such as carrots, wine, onions, thyme, basil, tomato paste, and meat. This strategy may have its virtues, but it will not convince me to change my allegiance from Mario Batali's basic tomato sauce with grated carrots, onion, and thyme. It will also not convince me to change from using canned whole peeled San Marzano tomatoes. But, the article did bring out many useful facts and opinions for evaluating other recipes. For example, it revealed that tomato puree in canned tomato products has been cooked before canning, so it has a less bright flavor than the whole or chopped tomatoes. For those who may be using butter in making sauces, it ventured the opinion that butter dulls the bright acidic flavor of the tomatoes. Another useful suggestion was that olive oil be added in two stages. Part should be added at the beginning to bring some flavor out of the garlic. The remainder should be added at the end to add fresh olive oil flavor. But this is what Italian chefs have been doing for the last 200 years.<br />I think the lesson from the tomato sauce story is that the `Best Recipe' recipe will not necessarily be better than others, especially those formulated by talented, successful chefs. It is also true that some of their findings may simply be things chefs have been doing for a long time anyway. The difference between the way Molto Mario presents the sauce and the way Cooks Illustrated presents the sauce is that Cooks Illustrated explains why certain things work and why others do not.<br />This lesson is repeated in earnest in their discussion of recipes for vegetables. In a world where everyone stresses that vegetables not be overcooked, why does Mark Bittman repeat a Paula Wolfert presentation of a Moroccan recipe which cooks the bejesus out of green (string) beans, with the statement that this recipe can simmer on a back burner for up to an hour and it's taste will not suffer. Well, it turns out, as Cooks Illustrated explains, that green beans have a very firm skin which requires a lot more cooking in the first place to make them light on the tooth. And, once cooked, this skin will retain its crispness long after your broccoli or asparagus will have descended into mush. This lesson is repeated for most common vegetables found in your local megamart. You will get the best blanching, steaming, sautee, or roasting time for each vegetable, and their opinion on which method best suits each vegetable. I read this section with great interest. But, if I want a recipe for doing my broccoli rabe, I will go to Alice Waters or  Marcella Hasan, depending on whether I wish to compliment an American or an Italian style meal. But, that's because I have a lot of cookbooks at hand. If you enjoy reading about cooking and your budget for cookbooks is slim, I would put this book at the top of your wish list, just as I would put `Cooks Illustrated' on the short list of culinary magazines I buy.<br />My greatest satisfaction in reading this book is the way in which the authors have cited sources for their ideas. Cooking is a combination of manual and intellectual skills where achieving the best result is due to both practice and knowledge. Knowledge can be discovered, written down, and communicated. So, I am delighted, for example, when the authors cite John Thorne as the starting point for their excellent macaroni and cheese recipe. They candidly state that they could do very little to improve on it. Similarly, in the essay on Foccacia, they cite the work of Carol Field as the basis for their recipes. This is much more true to life than an author's giving the impression that they came up with 200 recipes all by themselves. I really wish this were a more common style in culinary writing.<br />Bottom line is that for less than 30 bucks, this is a first class cookbook, even if it does not represent gourmet restaurant cooking.	2003-12-09

In a way, that sounds like a very retro scenario, predating the current popularity of fast cooking, the renaissance of gourmet cooking of the seventies and eighties, the convenience product / soup can cooking of the fifties, and the dark days of the thirties and forties. If you ignore the cosmopolitan sources of many recipes, this a refurbished look at the kind of cooking your first generation American grandmother or great grandmother did at home.<br />That is not to say these recipes are especially easy. Many are not. However, I have made several dishes from this book and I have gotten more personal favorites from this book than from all my Italian cookbooks combined. That doesn't mean these are the very best recipes either, but they work. When you compare Sara's recipes for chicken stock with those in `The Best Recipe', you find many differences, but I will bet on Sara's recipe or even James Beard's recipe over the `Best Recipe'.<br />Sara's book includes several things I love to find in a cookbook.<br />First, it's very chatty and informative about how she arrived at the recipe. Outside of the kitchens of Thomas Keller, Tom Colicchio, and Charlie Trotter, for example, there are probably very few genuinely new recipes being created even today. Almost all are variations on traditional classics. How many ways, for example have you seen tomato, basil, and mozarella combined. You will see at least five more variations on this very old theme on the Food Network over the next year.<br />Second, Sara revels in her roots, and she has very interesting roots to celebrate, as her mentors are three of the most distinguished culinary writers of the last fifty years, including Jean Anderson, Jacques Pepin, and the incomparable Julia Child, for which Sara was an assistant for many years.<br />Third, the book begins with a feature which should be manditory in all cookbooks. The notes on how to use this book give the meaning of a large number of common ingredients such as eggs meaning large eggs, flour meaning general purpose flour, and butter meaning unsalted butter.<br />The book includes a wider variety of dishes than you may find in restaurant or speciality cuisine cookbooks. It also contains a lot of classics such as crab cakes, fried green tomatoes, apple strudel, rice pudding and oven fried chicken. While these are classics, there is usually some twist to make them fresh.<br />I would recommend this as a very good second cookbook, after the `Joy of Cooking', `James Beard's American Cookery', or Mark Bittman's `How to Cook Everything'. The recipes will be fresher and have greater cachet by being able to announce that they are from a celebrity chef.One caveat is that this will not teach great technique, so your third book should be the excellent books on cooking technique by Jaques Pepin or James Peterson.ld, for which Sara was an assistant for many years.<br />Third, the book begins with a feature which should be manditory in all cookbooks.

Rather, I was looking for some insight into the history of cuisine in England around 1600. I was pleasantly surprised to find things which are really interesting to cook.<br />The book does not strictly cover meals mentioned in Shakespeare's plays, however, it is liberally seasoned with quotes from the Bard's plays making reference to foodstuff and spirits. The recipes are taken from cookbooks of the period which are enumerated in the very good bibliography. The volumes of this period were published from between 1560 through 1650 and all but one (Italian) are written in English and appear to be directed to the English housewife rather than the court of Elizabeth or James.<br />The biggest surprise is the prevalence of sweet ingredients in almost all savory dishes. If not sugar itself, then sweetness from fresh or dried fruit. The book even states that the English of the period had a serious sweet tooth. The complement to this tendency is the appearance of savory ingredients such as spinach in sweet desserts.<br />Another common theme in the cuisine of the period was the use of pastry crusts. They used it with just about everything. The remnants of this method can be found in dishes such as beef Wellington, savory pies, and cooking fish in a pastry crust. The method of making pastry crust may be a little unusual to the casual baker, but it is in fact based on a French technique used today for incorporating butter. Instead of cutting in the butter with forks or a pastry cutter, it is `smeared' into the dough with a kneading type of motion using, of course, very cold butter. It would be interesting to know how butter was kept cold in summer.<br />It is not surprising that the most pervasive foreign influence was not French, but Italian. Note, for example, that one of Shakespeare's most popular plays, `The Taming of the Shrew' was based on a 17th century Italian style of comedy. Tomatoes and chili peppers are totally absent, as they had not even been adapted in Italy yet, but artichokes, cardoons, asparagus, capers, mint, peas, parmesan cheese, and flat leaf parsley are all common. Citrus fruits, both local and from the Mediterranean are very popular. The fact that relations between England and France were probably very cool at this time, and the fact that England was rapidly developing a world wide trading network, especially with the Mediterranean and the Levant explains the popularity of food from that region. It is also likely that French cuisine had not yet achieved the preeminant position it has today and the cuisines and products of Italy, Portugul, and Spain were probably a common trade for English products.<br />One of the more interesting historical aspects was the fact that many vegetables popular in this cuisine were brought to England by the colonists and soldiers of the Roman Empire. Carrots, turnips, and onions head the list in this category.<br />It may be surprising to find shellfish, especially lobster and crab in the cuisine of the people, until one remembers that these animals were literally considered trash by boats fishing for cod or other fin fish. These must have been very, very cheap. The only puzzle was how they got to London and still be fresh enough to eat.<br />It is no surprise that most of the blurbs on the dust jacket plugging the value of the book are from theater people rather than from culinarians. The audience for this book is as likely to come from lovers of the theater as it is from foodies. The author caters to exactly this audience by presenting a chapter of suggestions on how to organize and cater to a dinner party patterned after this Elizabethan cuisine.<br />This is one of the first books I have found where I was willing to open it purely for the pleasure of the read, however, I was delighted to find interesting recipes, although it is likely I will stick with modern methods forpreparing pastry crusts and stocks. One of my few gripes with the book is that contrary to the promise by the author, not every original recipe text was included. It was entertaining to see how the author translated the slim instructions with no amounts specified into a modern recipe with all the expected teaspoons and tablespoons and the like. A worthy, if somewhat pricy volume.preparing pastry crusts and stocks. One of my few gripes with the book is that contrary to the promise by the author, not every original recipe text was included.

I got a copy as soon as it came out and set to reading it with a vengeance. I was as mortally wounded when on the third page there was a blatent misspelling which should have been caught by a reasonably skilled copy editor, but it wasn't. Bravely moving on, I encountered the statement which said heat is transferred in two ways. Wait a minute. Didn't my high school physics teacher say heat was conducted in three ways, radiation, conduction, and convection? In the next paragraph, AB goes on to speak at length about convection, but doesn't have this behavior join as an equal with the other two. I continued reading the book to the very end, but could not keep those two very early misstatements from clouding the stock I had originally set in the book, especially since in later chapters, convection seems to creep into equity the way it is discussed in the text.<br />But now, at long last, I revisit my boldly autographed copy of the book and confess my admiration for the book.<br />My first positive impression of the book was that, unlike one of my other heros, Jean Shepard, AB's humor does translate well from the spoken to the written word. I can only guess that this may be due to the humor of irony, where Brown is dealing very lightly, albeit very deftly, with two very serious subjects, science and cooking.<br />My next positive reaction, but no surprise, is that AB corrects almost every misstatement by every chef ever written or spoken on TV. My only hope is that since the book has won a James Beard award, professional chefs will take it seriously and correct some of their more egregious errors. Herein lies my dismay at the two misstatements near the beginning of the book. I was measuring AB's accuracy against a higher standard than I would someone like Emeril or Bobby Flay.<br />My most positive reaction to the book is that it does not rehash so many episodes of  `Good Eats'. Maybe that's why, unlike my dear hero Jean Shephard, his writing comes off as fresh as it does. The book has all the feel of having been started from an empty MS Word document and not begun by cutting and pasting from scripts of various shows. Well done there, AB.<br />I confess that for as much as I like and respect AB's explanations of how recipes work, I was never entirely comfortable that he always had the very best spin on the recipes he presents. This is true of `Good Eats' and it is true of this book. This has a whole lot to do with AB's confession at the very beginning of the book. He is not a chef and, like Julia Child before him, never claimed to be a chef. He is an educator. That's not to say he can't cook and it is not to say he is not a talented cook. It's just that he is much better at communicating than he is at cooking. A chef, as David Boulud says, is someone who has cooked some of the same recipes over a thousand times and thereby know his ingredients and processes in a way that no one who just reads about them can possibly know. Thus, when Alton Brown and Mario Batali do the same thing in different ways, I will do it the way Mario says and not the way AB says, because Mario's livelyhood depends on his technique and the fact that it works.<br />But, cooking technique is not really what this book is all about. To borrow Alton's metaphor from the `mission statement' at the beginning of the book, I see Alton as a very good map maker. He will explain how caramelization works better than all the Food Network chefs put together, but I will still follow Mario's suggestions on how to oil and heat a saute pan or make pasta or even crack an egg. AB is a great mapmaker, but Mario and Jamie and Emeril probably know how to get from point A to point B with the tastiest result.<br />So, I don't generally cook AB's recipes, and I feel none the poorer for it. Those who feel the book is not practical are missing the point. The book intends to explain things that most chefs don't even understand. Techniques are more like thought experiments to make a point clear. Like the famous ironing board pasta making table, It is very unlikely I will actually duplicate the technique. As long as Alton continues to do what he does best, I will continue buying his books and watching his show. My only challenge to him is to avoid the temptation to release blatently exploitative products like the blank book marketed on the strength of his name and the reputation of this book.<br />Buy this book to learn why cooking works.

Pure gold for Chefs	This essay recommends practices which an aspiring chef of haute cuisine should follow in order to succeed in this very demanding profession. Many of Boulud's recommendations are as applicable to a professional in information systems as they are to a culinary professional, but some are distinctly applicable to crafts where one works with ones hands. For example, one of the things which distinguish professional chefs from the home chef or, for that matter, from culinary journalists, is the fact that they have prepared some dishes thousands of times over, so they can judge the doneness of a cooked material by the simplest sound or feel or smell. They are so well practiced at knife skills that many kitchen aids are, for them a waste of time. So, there are some suggestions which may actually be better advice for a carpenter than they are for a statistician.<br />The recommendations are golden. I find nothing here which runs counter to anything else I have read about the culinary profession. Two of the most distinctive aspects are the importance of mentoring in a culinary education and the need to be prepared to give up a normal life at home. The first aspect repeats the similarity between culinary arts and other manual trades. Carpentry and plumbing still follow mentoring career paths dating back to the middle ages.<br />Boulud also effectively describes the difference between haute cuisine and bourgoise cuisine, a distinction in French which I have seen in no other cuisine, although I suspect there are some Japanese culinary disciplines which embody the same distinctions with their intensive discipline in knife skills and pasta making. One hallmark of haute cuisine is that it is very common to have two or more ingredients or preparations cooked separately so each is heated to just the right degree of doneness for that material. When I started cooking, this aspect always annoyed me and made me wonder why recipes weren't written more simply. This attitude shows an ignorance of or lack of respect for different ingredients.<br />The only objection I have to this book is it's price. A list price of $22.50 for 124 small pages is a bit much, even for the high quality of the material within. I subtracted the 35 pages of recipes in the back, as I believe many of them have appeared in some of Boulud's other books.<br />Otherwise, this is a must read for anyone interested in the culinary arts, especially if you have not already read widely in the literature on the subject.ce of or lack of respect for different ingredients.<br />The only objection I have to this book is it's price.

These requirements are:<br />Expensive equipment which most people do not have such as a dehydrator, ice cream maker, or juicer.<br />Fresh, seasonal, rare ingredients commonly available only through a farm catering to restaurants.<br />Pantry item preparations which involve one of the two above or an inordinate amount of work, with no application to dishes in more common cuisine.<br />I commonly give five stars to some books I know I will never cook from, because I know there is an audience, which will make very good use of the book. Rachael Ray's books are an excellent example. I have all the time in the world to cook, but people with little time will be very well served by using her books. But who will actually be making things from this book 'Raw'. I can imagine it may be hard core vegans who have the passion to search out these ingredients to provide variety and eminently healthy to their meatless diets. It may also be restaurateurs who wish to follow in Roxanne Klein's footsteps and have a client base, which can support it.<br />One can argue that like travel books, which provide a means of virtually visiting foreign lands, this book would be bought and read as a travelogue. But, I believe very few people buy cookbooks for that reason. I have over 200 cookbooks and I have not prepared any dishes from many of them, but each and every one was purchased with the intention of making several dishes in the book. I know that there are ambitious chefs who keep abreast of new things and, since the book is co-authored by Charlie Trotter, they are sure to read it, just to see what Charlie is up to. There may also be some foodies who do in fact buy cookbooks just to read.

Only one recipe comes even close to belonging to one of these traditional styles of preparation. Every dish is constructed from plant products.

875750:US	39134375	R3U5TA8LTSYGJ3	0688154107	133246950	Lidia's Italian Table: More Than 200 Recipes From The First Lady Of Italian Cooking	Books	5	77	77	N	N	Northern Italian Cuisine from the PBS show	This companion to a PBS series presented by Ms. Bastianich includes over 200 authentically Italian recipes. I believe the value in purchasing this book depends a lot on how many cookbooks of Italian cuisine you already have. There is a fair amount of overlap with Ms. B's first book, `Al Cucina di Lidia'. For example, in the PBS title, there is a recipe for rabbit, `Coniglio al Balsamico' which features balsamic vinegar and sage, while in the earlier book, there is a similar recipe, `Coniglio alla salvia' featuring balsamic vinegar and sage. Both are braises, cooking for about 45 minutes. Both books also include recipes for sauerkraut and pork. The overlap may be less than 10 percent and Ms. B. does cite her book as a reference, along with ten (10) other titles, about half of which are in Italian. It is just important to realize this in weighing the value of the book.<br />Based on the incidence of recipes for strudel, fresh pasta, polenta, and risotto, I would say the book concentrates on the cuisine of northern Italy, which is totally expected, as Ms. B was born and raised on the Istrian peninsula, east of Trieste. The chapters and number of recipes in each are:<br />Appetizers: 21, many of bruschetta and including prosciutto<br />Soups: 22, including an essay on how to make a good minestre.<br />Fresh Pasta: 16, including an essay on pasta making and several recipes including game meats<br />Dry Pasta: 14, including essay on tomatoes and sauces<br />Rice: 11 recipes, almost all for risotto<br />Gnocchi: 11 recipes, many with game meat<br />Polenta: 9 recipes, mostly regional specialities<br />Vegetables: 20, including lessons on prepping artichokes and favas<br />Game and Chicken: Rabbit and boar and venison, oh my<br />Meat: 19, including recipes for sauces<br />Fish and Shellfish: 17, including general tips on handling bivalves and crustaceans<br />Sweets: 22, including Strudel and Zabaglione.<br />If you have no Italian cookbooks or only cookbooks covering the hard pasta / tomato ridden Neapolitan cuisine or really need a book for game recipes, you could do no better than this volume. If you absolutely must have every cookbook by a major Italian cookbook author, this will be a worthy addition to your collection. If you have Ms. B's third book on Italian-American cuisine, this will be a very good compliment, as I expect no overlap there. If you really enjoyed the PBS series for which this book is a companion, then I highly recommend it.<br />But, if you already own a few of the other hundreds of Italian cookbooks, I suggest you at least browse the book before signing up. There may be more overlap than is worth you money. I will still give it the highest rating, because on its own merits, it is a very good book.idden Neapolitan cuisine or really need a book for game recipes, you could do no better than this volume.

This is a long cold drink of water for all of us foodies who spend their time in cookbooks wading through French and Italian terms for the tenth recipe for coq au vin and the seventeenth recipe for gnocchi.<br />For the more discerning cookbook buyers among you, this is a celebrity chef coffee table style book of recipes from David Bouley?s restaurant ?Danube? which specializes in recipes from Vienna or in the style of Vienna, primarily those which would have been served to the Hapsburgs rather than simpler fare found in a Prater district caf?. This is Austrian haute cuisine, oddly showing much more influence from northern Italy than from Paris (hence the title of the book). This makes eminent sense as much of northern Italy was once under the rule of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.<br />Recipes are divided among seven (7) chapters primarily presenting cuisine by season. Chapters are:<br />Fall: 14 recipes featuring cabbage, plums, truffles, and suckling pig.<br />Winter: 16 recipes freaturing venison, strudel, goulash, and viener schnitzel<br />Spring: 13 recipes featuring salads, rabbit, lobster, and crab<br />Summer: 12 recipes featuring veal shank, lamb chops, mackeral, salmon, and foie gras<br />Signature Dishes: 8 cocktail recipes plus 14 entrees, including 7 seafood entrees<br />Traditional sweets: 15 recipes including the world famous Sachertorte and Linzertorte. Yum<br />Pantry: 13 recipes for stocks, doughs, and cures<br />Most recipes are relatively long but very well written (Melissa Clark, one of the co-authors, is a professional writer who has written or collaborated on 16 books, including at least one on desserts). Aside from the usual ocurrences of foie gras, black truffles, and caviar one would expect from a cuisine prepared for emperors, there are few unusual ingredients. One of the least familiar is a soft ricotta like cheese named Quark (Topfen in German) which is a soft, fresh, white curd cheese similar to pot cheese. I have never seen it in my local megamart, but then I never looked for it.<br />For the cuisine of Vienna, there are a surprisingly large number of seafood recipes, although I suspect that by the middle of the 19th century, Vienna was within 12 to 16 hours of the Adriatic coast by train.<br />The layout of the book and the photography are as good or better than similar books with equal or higher list prices. The photographs of frolicking sous chefs are kept to a minimum and the photographs really succeed in making the food, especially the pasteries, look appetizing.<br />If you have no cookbook which include the flagship Viennese tortes and strudels, this alone is worth the price of admission. The recipe for Sachertorte, for example, is similar to the recipe in the recent book ?Kaffeehaus? by Rick Rodgers, but seems to achieve a much fancier result with two layers instead of one and with more chocolate, but less sugar.<br />I would trade a Daniel Boulud and two Jacques Pepin softcovers for this one. This may not be for everyone, and the authors are honest about not doing historically accurate cuisine (?New Cuisines of Austria and the Danube?) but if part of your heart belongs to Austria, you will enjoy this book.here are few unusual ingredients.

876748:US	39134375	R2NQNVBH5VW0TG	037541150X	57066906	Lidia's Italian-American Kitchen	Books	5	19	21	N	N	Comforting Food from Italian Genius and American Wealth	This third book from Lidia Bastianich has at least two things going for you can see from the dust jacket alone. First, it's from a PBS television series, which means the recipes were clearly worked over by a platoon of prep chefs and culinary producers, so the instructions are well exercized. Second, it's a winner of an IACP Cookbook award. They don't give these to just any compilation of recipes. A third clue that this book will be something special is that it's editor at Knopf is Judith Jones, the most celebrated cookbook editor of the last several decades, having begun her career by editing Julia Child's `Mastering the Art of French Cooking'. The last clue that this promises to be a rewarding book is that it is published by Knopf, my all time favorite American publisher which has an unsurpassed attention to the details of laying out an attractive book without the need for glitzy rotogravure.<br />As anyone who has spent any time watching Mario Batali on TV knows, Italian American food is different from Italian cuisine. Since there is a rather large industry of culinary journalists and chefs describing the true Italian regional cuisines, it's only fair that the Italian American derivatives be celebrated on their own merits.<br />Ms. Bastianich will not, however, be limiting herself strictly to Italian American hybrids. Some dishes are her own creations and some are purely Italian which never acquired an `American accent'.<br />The chapter headings in the book are:<br />Antipasti<br />Soups<br />Pasta &amp; Risotto<br />Pizza<br />Entrees<br />Contorni (Side Dishes)<br />Desserts and Coffee<br />I am happy to see there is no space dedicated to the extensive subject of  Italian breads except for the brief chapter on Pizza, as this is a subject requiring a great attention to detail which would detract from the primary object of the book. I am also happy that no space or expense was devoted to wine pairings. While this is a worthy subject, I would rather know that all my money is going for quality recipes.<br />As Ms. Bastianich came from northern Italy (actually Istria, ceded to Yugoslavia at the end of World War II) and the great majority of immigrants from Italy to America came from southern Italy, the book ends up with a fairly balanced reflection of Italian cuisine as a whole.<br />One of the signal features of Italian American cooking is the mixing of meat with southern Italian tomato pasta dishes, as in Sugo di Carne and Spaghetti and meatballs. Of course, meat sauces are not unknown in Italy. Northern Italy has the Sugo alla Bolognese. In fact, Italian appears to have a special work, `sugo' for meat sauces to distinguish them from meatless sauces such as `salsa marinara' and `salsa di pomodoro'.<br />Another signal feature of Italian American cooking is the apotheosis of garlic, which is used with even greater abandon than in the Italian south. Where Italians typically slice raw garlic, so you can easily skirt around it if you wish to keep a sweet breath, Americans are known to crush the daylights out of the cloves, making it's taste stronger and harder to avoid.<br />The book includes two very nicely done color photograph sections. Photos of food are free of the annoying out of focus closeups found elsewhere. There are good black and white photos demonstrating selected techniques, clearly being performed by the author herself. Photographs of family are endearing, clear, and well captioned.<br />I have cooked several recipes in this book and find them all delicious. Not all are easy and some may require some practice, but then, try to construct a mortise and tendon joint entirely from the directions in a book on carpentry.<br />This is true comfort food. Highly recommended.going for quality recipes.<br />As Ms. Bastianich came from northern Italy (actually Istria, ceded to Yugoslavia at the end of World War II) and the great majority of immigrants from Italy to America came from southern Italy, the book ends up with a fairly balanced reflection of Italian cuisine as a whole.<br />One of the signal features of Italian American cooking is the mixing of meat with southern Italian tomato pasta dishes, as in Sugo di Carne and Spaghetti and meatballs.

877853:US	39134375	R2SNGK1D8CL9CB	1586420623	909801353	Claudia Roden's the Food of Italy: Region by Region	Books	5	37	38	N	N	La Cuchina de Italia from top to bottom	Claudia Roden is one of the distaff aristocracy of Mediterranean culinary journalism with Elizabeth David and Paula Wolfert. This book, `The Food of Italy Region by Region' is an adaptation of a series of newspaper articles written for the Sunday Times of London. Each of the 19 larger regions has a chapter devoted to the traditional dishes and wines of the region. The cuisine of two very small regions, Valle D'Aosta and Molise are grouped together larger neighbors, Piedmont and Abruzzi respectively. Each chapter begins with an essay on the food of that region followed by several recipes. Emilia-Romagna, for example gets 21 example recipes.<br />Each essay includes a section on the wines of the region. This was one of the most interesting aspects of the work to someone who knows very little of wines. Before reading this, I was under the impression that Italian vintage wine culture was hundreds of years old. Wine was certainly produced in Italy since before the Roman Empire, yet up to World War II, it was largely the production of everyday wine with few quality exports. Only in the last 50 years has Italy developed the same kind of quality labels to rival those of France. I must say they have done a very good job of it.<br />I was also surprised by the relatively recent awareness of regional cuisine in Italy, as it never really codified its culinary traditions in the same way France did so well. I am delighted, however that there is a book, which ties together all the material in my five (5) foot shelf of books on regional Italian cuisine. It is especially interesting to see the split in Italian cuisine below Rome into the very Mediterranean cooking of  Campania, Calabria, Apulia, and Sicily versus the more European cooking of, for example, Tuscany, Emilia Romagna, Piedmont, and Friuli. In the north, for example, you have soft pastas and gnocchi with family resemblances to Germanic dumplings. In the south, for example, you have abundant olive oil and dried tomatoes linked closely to the cuisines of Greece and North Africa.<br />The author presents close to 300 recipes by region, but also gives a list of recipes by these food types:<br />Appetizers<br />Stuffed Vegetables<br />Fried Foods<br />Cheese and Eggs<br />Seafood Antipasti<br />Pizzas, Breads, and Pies<br />Soups<br />Pasta<br />Dumplings<br />Risottos<br />Polentas<br />Fish and Shellfish<br />Meat, Poultry, and Game<br />Side Dishes, Salads, and Vegetables<br />Desserts<br />This is excellent Sunday Supplement journalism and very good culinary reporting. I found very few differences of opinion between the author and Mario Batali, my gold standard for Italian regional cuisine. In the case of any disagreements and any other evidence, I would give Mario the nod simply because he is a professional chef in addition to being an interpreter of Italian cuisine and the author is not a professional chef. That means that in spite of how expert Ms. Roden's reporting may be, she has not prepared this food in the restaurant environments on which she reports.<br />One disagreement I detected is in pasta making technique. Ms. Roden cites the `well' or `volcano' method for incorporating liquid into flour to make pasta which Mario demonstrates often. Ms. Roden deviates from this practice by saying that the operation may be easier if done in a bowl instead of on a flat surface, yet, there is an obviously good reason for doing it on a flat surface. It allows one to use `just enough' of the flour for the liquid, and no more, depending on the humidity of the air and the nature of the flour. I suspect Mario's doctrine is closer to how Noni actually does it in Parma.<br />Another disagreement is in the `lipid of choice' where a location may have both olive oil and rape seed oil or other neutral oil available. Mario always uses extra virgin olive oil and claims that where olive oil was available, it was always used in preference to other oils. I am willing to give Ms. Roden the benefit of thedoubt here, as I suspect that rape seed oil was probably less expensive than olive oil when the rape seed was produced locally.<br />A third disagreement is in the use of canned versus whole tomatoes in cooking. Mario always uses canned tomatoes for sauces while Ms. Roden specifies fresh whole tomatoes in several of her recipes. I have a hunch that Noni in Campania used both, depending on whether tomatoes were in season or not, especially since Noni was doing the canning anyway.<br />The most exciting conclusion I draw from this book is the refutation of John Thorne's theory that the greatness of Italian cuisine stems from the emulation, in poverty of the glories of the cuisine of the Roman Empire. Roden specifically states that except for a brief period in the Renaissance and in very recent scholarship, there is little Italian reference to the cuisine of the empire. Rather, it is much more likely that the huge diversity in Italian cuisine comes from the interaction of a fabulous variety of produce, greatly enriched by new world products like tomatoes, corn, and chilis, with the cultural overlays from Islam, Spain, Norman Europe, France, and Austria-Hungary. The most dismal message I get is the abandonment of traditional rural agriculture; similar to a trend reported in rural France.<br />This is not your typical Time-Life or Williams-Sonoma glossy photo treatment. This is the read deal with hundreds of relatively easy recipes based on very accessible ingredients using easy techniques, all for a very reasonable price. Unfortunately, Ms. Roden did not have the answer to why Thursday is gnocchi day in Rome.rape seed oil was probably less expensive than olive oil when the rape seed was produced locally.<br />A third disagreement is in the use of canned versus whole tomatoes in cooking.

The recipes occupy by far the larger portion of the book and include all of the expected elements of Italian cuisine. The culinary chapters are:<br />Appetizers and Soups<br />Salads and Vegetables<br />Pastas and Sauces<br />Fish<br />Meats<br />Game<br />Breads and Desserts<br />Spirits and Infusions<br />The most valuable portions of the book deal with the recipes native to Istria, especially those dealing with game and foraged vegetables and mushrooms. As the book makes clear, Istria, located near the top of the Adriatic Sea, is very near the crossroads of Europe's Roman, Slavic, and Germanic ethnic influences. The cuisine is all the more interesting for that fact. There are distinctly Austrian influences throughout the cuisine, including a recipe for an obscure Hungarian sweet crepe, palacinka, my Grandmother from Austria-Hungary would often make. The most vivid picture I get from the book is how food must have acquired the importance it has for many Europeans, since they spent so much of their time acquiring food and working with such inventive ways of making everything edible into something delicious.<br />The chapters on game cookery are expecially useful, including recipes for quail, Guinea hen, pheasant, squab, duck (with sauerkraut, of course), rabbit, venison, and wild boar. Of special interest is the technique, `Squazet' which is an untranslatable word meaning a braising method used in Istria, suitable primarily to slow cooked meats. A good example of making the most of what you had.<br />All the recipes are good as well as interesting for being examples of Istrian cuisine. However, I would recommend that for breads and pasteries, one consult a specialist in these fields. These baking recipes will work, but I know there are better techniques to be had. The sections on fresh pasta are short, but they appear to give competant results. The sections on various types of gnocchi and it's techniques are very good. I believe the recipes for mushrooms have much to offer which you may not find elsewhere.<br />The treatment of photographs in this book leaves something to be desired. All are presented in an old fashioned sepia tint and some, even some photographed specifically for the book by modern equipment seem to loose detail to shadows and haziness. Placing captions for chapter heading photographs strikes at the rear of the book in an appendix strikes me as a case of really poor judgement. I have a hunch the captions were forgotten until it was too late to include them on the same page as the photo. There are some lapses in copy editing. The Italian culinary term `sugo' is used in the memoir and no explanation is given for the term. It does not even appear in the appendix and is arcane enough to be absent from Larousse Gastronomique and a reference on Italian cuisine. I would have been baffled by the reference had I not encountered in the book `Cooking by Hand' by Paul Bertolli.<br />I give this book the highest rating because it's shortcomings do not detract from it's primary mission of being an engaging and accessible presentation of Istrian cuisine.tions on fresh pasta are short, but they appear to give competant results.

It presents a wide variety of exquisitely authentic recipes from the justly famous coffee houses and pastry bakeries of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. All basic techniques are genuinely Mitteleuropean and not French or American adaptations of these techniques. As such, the book is a valuable contribution to popular culinary history, as important to the foodie interented in such things as the dozens of books on regional Italian and French cuisine.<br />The chapters cover:<br />Basic batters, doughs, and glazes  14 recipes such as puff pastry<br />Simple Cakes  19 recipes such as gugelhupf and roulades<br />Fancy Cakes  14 recipes such as Sachertorte and Linzertorte<br />Strudels  7 recipes such as apple strudel<br />Sweet Yeast Breads  11 recipes such as brioche<br />Sliced desserts  14 recipes such as berry meringue squares<br />Cookies and doughnuts  10 recipes such as vanilla cresents<br />Pancakes and sweet omlets  8 recipes such as crepes<br />Sweet dumplings and noodles  4 recipes such as prune pockets<br />Puddings  7 recipes such as chocolate pudding<br />Hot and Cold beverages  6 recipes such as coffees, wine, and tea<br />Glossary of ingredients, equipment, and techniques<br />Coffeehouse guide to Vienna, Prague, and Budapest<br />Mail Order Sources<br />Bibliography<br />Coming from paternal grandparents who were born 40 miles east of Vienna, this book made my eyes misty in rememberance of my grandmother's baking. The book does not rely on store-bought puff pastry and does not hold back on liquer flavorings. The book does give excellent recipe for strudel dough, but it does not go so far as to have you make your own filo dough. I guess that will be in his book on Greek or Turkish baking. A sidebar on properly handling filo sheets is invaluable.<br />The glossary of techniques is excellent. My only wish was that the author would have made some mention of chocolate sold by specific weight of cocoa butter, as Vahlrona and, I believe, high end American producers such as Sharfenberger and Jacques Torres do. This is so much easier than troubling over imprecise terms like semi-sweet and bittersweet. One concession to American home bakers is the exclusive use of measurements by volume rather than by weight. I really feel that if you are about to take the trouble to make strudel and make your own strudel dough, the effort needed to accurately weigh ingredients is of little consequence and may improve the results.<br />The photographs of old Austrian coffee house interiors are gorgeous. I would have really appreciated captions. One has simply no idea whether the room is in Vienna, Prague, Budapest, or Brooklyn.

Unlike her later 30 minute meal books, this first in the series does not group two or more dishes into meals which can take less than a half an hour to prepare. This is largely because the book was written before Rachael showed up on the Food Network show of the same name, which introduced the 3 course meal format. In spite of this timing, almost all of the dishes in this book have shown up on early seasons of Rachael's show.<br />In many ways, the grouping of dishes by type rather than by meal is an advantage, making it easier to match up different pasta and salad courses on different days. The drawback is that you have no hints on how to coordinate your time in preparing the three dishes at one time, although this is not exactly rocket science.<br />The main chapter headings / dish types are:<br />Pastas  29 dishes<br />Salads  28 dishes, some suitable as main course salads<br />Take out lookalike  39 dishes, primarily burgers, sandwiches, pizza, Tex-Mex, and Asian lookalikes<br />Comfort Foods  34 dishes such as chilis, sauces, soups, and casseroles<br />Full meals  5 menus for small party (8 to 12) quick cooking<br />Meatballs  5 recipes<br />I believe it is an important symptom of one of Rachael's main objectives that many of her dishes are named after family members. She presents the great Italian love of food and family together when you don't have Nona and three aunts at home all day to do all the prep work and braising.<br />One recent book on cooking traditional recipes slowly to recapture both the joy and flavors of this cooking makes the suggestion that Rachael's style of cooking is too hectic and has too little flavor. While the first has an element of truth, I say it does not remove the `Joy of Cooking'. It actually rescues it from the drive in take out window. On the latter point, this author if plainly wrong. I compared Rachael's Caesar Salad to a recipe from Martha Stewart and Rachael's was superior in taste, as Miss Martha really overloaded her dish with raw garlic.<br />It is very fortunate that the cuisine on which Ms. Ray's food is largely Italian, as the Italian cuisine has spent centuries perfecting the concentration of flavor in foods such as balsamic vinegar, cheeses, hams, and tomato concentrates, all of which are available in first class products at the local American supermarket.<br />The only drawback to using these products and prepackaged meats and vegetables is that you may be paying more for the same meal than if slower, prep intensive recipes were used. For thirty-something parents who are in the early middle of their career, this cost is probably inconsequential when compared to the benefits. It is certainly both economically and nutritionally inconsequential when compared to the fast food fare.<br />I have a lot of respect of Rachael's not overloading the book with suggestions for the pantry. Stocking up a pantry without specific recipes is a waste of time and money. I also strongly suggest the reader play close attention to the tips on knife use. Very important.<br />I'm afraid Rachal's recommendations on equipment are not helpful. One look at her Food Network show and you may see a Dutch oven, two large saute pans, a grill pan, and a blender in action at one time. Don't scrimp on the pots and pans. Do what Rachael does, not what she says in this department. I will give her credit for getting by with just one very good knife.<br />Rachael is not Mario or Martha or Emeril. She is teaching you how to do it fast, without loosing the fun and the flavor. As always, the price of the book is very right. Enjoy yourself!point, this author if plainly wrong.

882233:US	39134375	R2DQUISHCVTLCN	0609608932	568413749	Cooking by Hand	Books	5	124	127	N	N	Graduate Level Courses on Prima Materia	You buy this book for culinary inspiration and insights into how the very greatest chefs think. It's most proper neighbors on your bookshelf are titles such as Eric Rippert's `A Return to Cooking', James Beard's `Delights and Prejudices', and Mario Batali's `Simple Italian Food'. Each of these volumes, in their own very personal ways explore the authors' inspirations and love of food.<br />This volume combines monographs on ingredients,  personal memoirs, and exacting techniques into a web of very enlightening recipes and insights.<br />Paul Bertolli is the owner and executive chef of the restaurant Oliveto in Oakland, California and a former head chef at Alice Waters' Chez Panisse. Unlike Jeremiah Tower, Bertolli makes no mention of Waters except for the obviously shared devotion to fine, local ingredients. Instead, I am delighted to see him acknowledge assistance from Harold Magee and several other culinary academics.<br />If Mario Batali gives us the college courses in proper Italian cuisine, then Paul Bertolli gives us the post-graduate training, citing in the introduction the Elizabeth David epigram that `Good Cooking is Trouble' meaning that good cooking requires painstaking effort with lots of circles and switchbacks in one's path to mastery.<br />The book is in no way a traditional cookbook and anyone who buys it just for the recipes will be missing over half the value. The eight chapters comprising the bulk of the book deal with some materials and techniques at the heart of Italian cuisine.<br />The first topic deals with respect for fresh ingredients. This begins Bertolli's illuminations on the life of ingredients such as polenta, artichokes, zucchini, spring vegetables, eggplant, olives, mushrooms, and pears. The book reveals something new and exciting about each material and breaks a few rules along the way. In explaining the methods for curing olives, the author also begins offering the reader an entrance into a wonderland of new ways to be involved with our food.<br />The second main topic is an essay on `Ripeness'. It stresses that good cooking does not come from recipes but from looking at and listening to your ingredients.<br />The third topic is tomatoes and looking at them for color, juice, essence, shape, sauce, conserva, complement, braise, container, condiment, and side dish. This section contains many tomato based recipes, but the real gem is the discussion of `conserva', a preparation similar to tomato paste, but a much more potent carrier of flavor.<br />The fourth topic is an essay on the techniques for making balsamic vinegar plus the ways of using young, middle-aged, and old balsamico.<br />The fifth topic is a primer on pasta making. This takes one beyond Mario's well method into a world of fussiness about the quality of the wheat which rivals the obsessions of the very best artisinal bakers. This chapter is worth the price of admission.<br />The sixth topic is entitled `Bottom up cooking' and introduces at the reader to meat `sugo' which is created by the repeated browning and deglazing of meat and broth until you reach a concentration of flavor I have never seen discussed before in depth, although it is similar to the French notion of `jus'.<br />The seventh topic treats pork and the many ways of curing pork including the making of sausage and ham. While there is enough information here to give one a credible start at salume, the author points out that this is a skill which requires a substantial amount of practice. Even if one never touches a sausage casing or a meat grinder, this chapter is well worth the background it gives to assist one in respecting their ingredients.<br />The last major topic is devoted to menu building, mostly by working backward from the dessert. This section should be very familiar to Chez Panisse devotees, where daily menus were built upon the produce of the day. Like Chez Panisse and some other very high end restaurants, Olivato presents fixed price tasting menus withseveral courses, each paired with an appropriate bottle of wine.<br />I suspect there are people who will buy this book and be disappointed because all they wanted was a book of good Italian recipes. If that is what you want, check out Marcella Hazan, Lidia Bastianich, or Giuliano Bugialli. This book has very good recipes, but it includes so much more. I give Bertolli and his editors extra credit for giving a complete list of all the recipes at the beginning of the book, since the recipes are not organized by chapters one commonly uses to find them.<br />The book also includes a better than average list of sources to support the author's emphasis on excellence.

Limited Variety	Barbara Witt's new book gives you recipes which are selected to cook on weekend days in order that they may be frozen or refrigerated and heated up on working weekdays. This intends to return to the enjoyment of cooking and to return to flavor which is lost when one cooks quick meals during the week in what seems to be a direct reference to the Rachael Ray style of fast cuisine.<br />The 192 cooking ahead recipes are divided into:<br />Soups:  18, including recipes for chicken, beef, and vegetable broth.<br />Braises:  13, slow cooking pot roast style dishes and stews<br />Ground Meat and Stuffings: 21, meatloaves, meatballs, sausages, and croquettes<br />Side Dishes:  18, Salads, slaws, rice, beans, and pasta<br />Condiments, salsas, and sauces: 34, plus pickles, confits, chutneys, and dressings<br />Sweets and treats: 18, cookies, muffins, jams, pies, cakes, and nuts<br />There are 122 in the chapter tables of contents. The remaining 70 are variations on these recipes. Counting braises and ground meats, this represents 34 main dishes, almost all of which are variations on the stew and the meatball or sausage. This is the flip side of the 30 Minute Meal cuisine which focuses on saute, grill, and broil, although Ms. Ray does include some quick braises and roastings, especially for roast vegetables.<br />I believe it's fair to say that Ms. Witt's cuisine presented in this book is actually more limited than Rachael Ray's style of cooking, as it seems focused primarily on two types of cooking. As Barbara Witt is presenting her recipes as an alternative to Rachael Ray's style of cooking, I have to say I believe Ray's approach has more variety in it's tastes, as it includes a much broader range of ingredients and techniques. Ms. Witt has one seafood dish in her 34 main dishes. Thus, I believe Ms. Witt's contention of greater flavor may be unfounded.<br />I'm surprised, in fact, that she did not include the truly classic make ahead dish, southern fried chicken. I'm also surprised that the didn't include more casseroles and cooking in paper techniques.<br />Another issue Ms. Witt takes with the fast cooking approach is that it robs one of the satisfaction of cooking, as you are not doing it in a hurry. The author even recommends that one make their own broths. I have no argument with this suggestion. My contention is that if you are willing to go that far, other books such as the `Joy of Cooking' or `James Beard's American Cookery' may be a better all around source of recipes which do not require great skill, exotic ingredients, or lots of time. If you are really looking for recipes which can occupy your mind and broaden your culinary horizons, try Julia Child, Paula Wolfert, or Diana Kennedy.<br />In the recipes, I would across the board replace fresh tomatoes or canned chopped tomatoes with canned whole plum tomatoes. This simplifies your prep time and simplifies your pantry. I also detect several places where the recipes could be more healthy by replacing butter with olive oil. I have no argument with butter. I use far too much as it is. I'm just suggesting that a more uniformly olive oil regimen has a lot going for it.<br />Whenever I review a book, I am compelled to disagree with the chapter of recommendations on what to keep in the pantry. My experience is that whenever I buy an ingredient without a specific recipe planned for preparation in the next few days, that ingredient sits on my shelf until it expires. The best approach is to plan one's cooking for the week, do your big Saturday shopping trip and get all the ingredients (except for fresh fish and meats) you need for the week. In a very short time, you will have a very respectable pantry built up. Just buy double on durable items such as beans, pasta, and canned goods. I would especially stay away from things like Beau Monde seasoning, Garam masala, and curry powder. If you are willing to make broths, then you will double your pleasure by making your own spice mixtures.Also avoid ground cloves, coriander, cumin, white pepper, and nutmeg. I buy ground cinnamon only because I bake a lot and turn over a bottle of cinnamon in a month. Once you grind your own nutmeg, you will never go back to preground. I promise.<br />This is a good book. The recipes will give you good results. My main argument with it is that it does not deliver on it's main promise of being an improvement over quick cooking and that by concentrating on cook ahead, it limits the variety of dishes available to you.ground cloves, coriander, cumin, white pepper, and nutmeg.

883834:US	39134375	RDU5BBCWKIDXP	0743236734	558739455	The Arrows Cookbook: Cooking and Gardening from Maine's Most Beautiful Farmhouse Restaurant	Books	5	15	17	N	N	Food, Gardening, and Inspiration wrapped up in one book	`The Arrows Cookbook' combines 156 recipes from the four seasons of the highly regarded coastal Maine restaurant with a experienced amateur gardener's recommendations on planting and running a large southern Maine vegetable garden for the restaurant. The book embodies the familiar mantra of using fresh, seasonal, local ingredients fortified by giving you the information you need to grow fresh, local ingredients. This is the special slant the book offers, as no publisher has yet gotten the chutzpah to charge $40 for a book without trying to give the reader something extra.<br />The tone of the book is heavily oriented to their rural Maine terroir in style and content. In Maine, the seasons play a much greater role in daily life than they do in California or even in Manhattan. Therefore, the book's attitude toward its product has neither the mystical reverence of Paul Bertolli or Alice Waters nor the high maintenance, high craftsmanship of Daniel Boulud or Eric Rippert. Even though there is considerable respect for ingredients and home brewed food making here in both the gardening in the Spring and Summer and ham curing done in the Winter. There is also no evidence of high tech houte cuisine (there are no prep or cook times or difficulties ascribed to the recipes) or of Napa Valley chic wine recommendations. This is Maine! This is boiled lobsters, boiled meat, and wild apple country.<br />The asking price of $0.26 a recipe is a relatively high price for the average cookbook. Many very good books average out at $0.10 to $0.20 a recipe, list. What would make you willing to pay the extra toll for this book aside from the celebrity status of the venue?<br />1. The recipes are good, simple preparations. Of the 156, there are:<br />Appetizers  27<br />Salads  22<br />Main Courses 26 11 of which are for seafood<br />Sauces  21<br />Side Dishes  36<br />Desserts  24<br />The relatively high proportion of appetizers, salads, and side dishes to main courses is explained by the fact that the menu is different for each of the four seasons, based on what produce is available in that season. There are few or no tomato dishes in Spring and few strawberry dishes in Winter. The up side to this picture is that this book is a very good source for seasonal salads, appetizers, and side dishes. If one's limited cookbook budget was aimed at either seasonally or vegetarianism, this is a very good book. The attention to edible flowers is especially noteworthy.<br />2. The gardening information is fairly complete for the straightforward vegetable garden. Its primary value is inspirational and getting one started in the right directions. A good bibliography of gardening texts is included. The supplementary books are needed, because these authors are amateurs. I found at least one botanical mistake, but it wasn't serious. The book's value drops off the further you live from the Southern Maine growing zone and the less space you have available to grow stuff. The greatest value of this part of the book is the inspiration it can give to save money by growing your own. I believe the frugality of restaurant operations and the way they treat their prima materia is one of the most useful inspirations for home chefs. The growing of herbs alone in a Manhattan apartment can probably save someone over $100 a year with a commensurate improvement in their cuisine. Check out the price of fresh basil the next time you are in the tomato aisle of your megamart.<br />The photographs in this book are very gratefully limited to special sections and are of a reasonable quality. I have given up assigning demerits for photos, which have the center of a plate in focus and the front and back out of focus. All are about the food. No sous chefs hamming it up for the camera. Very commendable. One regret I have about the photography is that the book gives special attention to a very large arrangement at the restaurant entrance which changes at least seasonally, yet they give not a single photo of this great work, even after giving a detailed description of how to construct one. There are also many small black and white photos related to the text, but with no caption. Occasionally disorienting. Lastly, I miss a few more photos of their extensive garden and greenhouse(s). I start to get the sense that, like Emeril's recent cookbook, this book is aimed at being an elaborate advertisement for the restaurant.<br />This is good and more than commonly useful book. At a discounted price of $30 or less, I recommend it.this great work, even after giving a detailed description of how to construct one.

This is almost a shame, given the number of very good recent books on bread baking by Peter Reinhardt and Nancy Silverton, just to name two of the better known author / bakers. The chapters covering types of bread deal with:<br />Quick Breads (Muffins, Biscuits, Scones, and the like)<br />Flatbreads (Pita, for example)<br />Soft Sandwich Loaves (Pullman loaves, for example)<br />Hearth Breads (often what one thinks of by the term Artisan breads)<br />Sourdough<br />Brioche (on the boundary between bread and cake)<br />The recipes in these sections follow the same precision Ms. Beranbaum has shown in her earlier books on cakes and pasteries. All measurements are given in both volume and weight (imperial and metric). Great care is also given to specifying the type of flour. We are not dealing with your everyday AP Gold Medal here kiddies.<br />Everyone with a passing knowledge of things culinary knows there is a big difference between cooking and baking. In most cooking, the quality of ingredients varies greatly from item to item. Two steaks laying next to one another in a meat counter are invariably different, needing a bit of adaptation and attention from the cook. Cooking is very experimental, constantly observing and tasting the product in the course of mixing and heating. Baking is much closer to the theoretical, where one needs to very closely follow a formula to derive the result you wish. One thing this book clarifies is that while bread baking is still very different from, for example, meat cookery, the picture is not as simple as the one I described above.<br />First, while ingredients like flour and water are much, much more uniform than pork chops and New York strip, there are still variations, and one dimension of quality in flour is uniformity from sack to sack. There are, for example, major differences in all purpose flour from maker to maker, even if you ignore the differences between soft and hard wheat, i.e., White Lily versus King Arthur.<br />Second, baking is highly sensitive to conditions in the baking environment, most especially to humidity and ambient bacterial flora. The first factor is familiar to almost every pie maker, who must titrate the amount of liquid they add to pastry dough to reach just the right moistness. The second variable is most important to the artisinal bread baker.<br />The greatest value of this book to all people interested in bread baking is that it succeeds in explaining the mysteries of bread and why things work out and why they sometimes don't work. It explains why the baker cannot take their ingredients for granted. While they do not have to deal with the great variety in tomatoes from month to month, they do have to deal with much more subtle differences. Old flour and old eggs may simply not produce the desired results, and you may not know this for 24 hours after you start the bread.<br />This brings up the point that time is a very important ingredient in bread baking, especially artisinal bread baking. Although one can make really good quick breads and sandwich breads and flatbreads in two to four hours, a respectable baguette cannot be done in less than 12 to 16 hours. The impression that bread baking is not for the faint hearted has a grain of truth to it.<br />But, even if you plan to never  bake a baguette or brioche, this book is simply a very good read for foodies interested in knowing about bread baking. The first chapter on the `Ten Essential Steps of Making Bread' is worth the price of admission. The chapter on quick breads will pay for itself at the next bake sale. The appendices on ingredients and equipment is exhaustive and informative. I finally know now where I may be able to find the elusive malt extract I've been looking for.<br />If the Norton Copy Editor for this book is checking in here, I have to point out that the onlymistake I found is when the text states that Wondra flour and yeast dissolve in water at two different places in the text. The proper term is `suspend' or `go into emulsion'. But then, almost everyone makes this mistake.<br />Get this book for the baker on your Christmas shopping list.found is when the text states that Wondra flour and yeast dissolve in water at two different places in the text.

I heartily agree with blurbs by such notables as John Thorne and Alan Davidson that the work puts Dunlap in the company of Diana Kennedy and Paula Wolfert. One can hope that future works validate this initial judgement. We can use a lot more books like this.<br />I believe it is common knowledge among foodies that there is a big difference between Sechuan and Cantonese cuisine, and that the former is characterized by very spicy foods. Viewing a few episodes with the Iron Chef Chinese will fill you on this. What this book covers is to characterize with great clarity and thoroughness what Sichuan cooking is all about.<br />The first impression I get is that Sichuan cooking is very highly codified, almost on the same level as French cuisine. This immediately reveals to the reader that, for example, there are easily a half dozen different types of stir fry cooking within Sichuan cuisine alone. It also means that the Sichuan doctrines on taste match or exceed Western culinary tradition. They have, for example, the concept of `xian' which describes the `indefinable, delicious taste of fresh meat, poultry, and seafood'. This is in addition to the real magic the cuisine does with the more familiar sweet, sour, salty, and bitter. The author effectively captures and communicates the importance of these tastes in Sichuan cuisine to the reader, including experiments so one can experience these tastes first hand.<br />The second impression I get is that chilis, that is, plants of the genus capsicum from the new world, had as big an impact on Sichuan cuisine as the tomato had on Italian cuisine, at roughly the same time in history. Before new world chilis arrived, the heat in this cuisine came primarily from a local red pepper, a berry similar to our familiar black pepper. In the seventeenth century, the genus capsicum really took over. Yet, the cuisine is not as fiery hot as one may find in Mexico or the Caribbean. The peppers most commonly used are just moderately hot and the author constantly warns against substituting Thai chili peppers for the Sichuan peppers, as the result would be painful.<br />Following Ms. Wolfert and Ms. Kennedy, the author has successfully translated the Chinese techniques for English speaking readers. However, one would not be able to fully appreciate or execute these recipes without some basic ingredients and equipment. I really believe that one would loose something in these recipes if one did not have a round bottom wok and it's tools. Fortunately, even very good Chinese woks are very inexpensive, especially at restaurant supply stores. For those with electric ranges, a flat bottomed wok may be a reasonable approximation. I would also recommend that one make the effort to get the authentic canned and bottled ingredients. Substitutions, even from other Asian cuisines may give very misleading results. For the non-foodie recipe hunter, I recommend the chicken recipes and the vegetable recipes. The Kung Pao recipe is worth the price of admission and one always needs a way to make veggies more interesting. (I was surprised when the grean bean recipes used the French haricort vert and not the long Asian grean bean.)<br />If Ms. Dunlap is not presenting authentic recipes, she has done a very good job of fooling me. She has also succeeded in keeping me thoroughly entertained with her headnotes and stories about how she came across the various dishes. The only heads up I would give you, dear reader, about the recipes is that sometimes important information about the recipe is given in the headnote, which people in a hurry may not read. Otherwise, this is a first class job of recipe writing.<br />The photographs are gathered in color sections and are of reasonable, but not extraordinary quality.

889120:US	39134375	R2RG3HTSVNSAFD	0060083905	100330050	The Cook's Canon: 101 Classic Recipes Everyone Should Know (Cookbooks)	Books	5	43	47	N	N	Provocative Culinary Scholarship and Opinion	Raymond Sokolov has collected recipes and background stories on what he believes are the 101 most important dishes or cooking preparations a cook should know, from the point of view of Western, primarily French culinary tradition. This is a book I wish I had written myself, so I obviously believe this is a very important contribution to those of us who approach food as somewhere between an interest and an obsession. I also must say that Sokolov has done a pretty good job of it.<br />First, I believe the choice of the 101 to put into the canon is very well made. I cannot easily think of one preparation I would replace with an alternate choice. Even the more obscure choices appear to be right on. For example, I have a good familiarity with Fillipino cuisine and I concur that the one Fillipino dish included is the correct choice.<br />Second, I believe the recipes are also very well chosen. The recipe for ?bread? for example, is not the simple square loaf one can produce in a few hours in a home kitchen. Rather, it is a much more sophisticated generic artisinal recipe using a sponge developed overnight and baked with high humidity added to the oven to promote a hard crust. Very good choice. Also, most of the recipes are actually very simple and few require any unusual ingredients. With some exceptions I will mention below, I believe the care with selection of ingredients is well placed, for example, when Raymond gives us the warning about using very fresh eggs to make  zabaglione.<br />Third, the headnotes to the dishes are delightful and make turn the book into exactly the kind of foodie book I like the best, a combination of historical and linguistic scholarship with references connecting us to the wider world of food writing to such luminaries as Julia Child and Elizabeth David. Herein lies my most significant disappointments with this book.<br />The headnotes are very entertaining, but they are sometimes so at the cost of very cheap shots at respected colleagues in the food writing field. There is one paragraph in the article on macaroni and cheese which is highly disrespectful to John Thorne and some of his statements. I believe Thorne is if not the best, then one of the best contemporary writers on cooking and the origins of cuisine. I do not always agree with Thorne, but I believe he deserves respect. Sokolov has gone for the mantle of scholarship and has let it slip by a crude ad hominum attack. He makes a similar personal but less acid observation on Elizabeth David. While I love the work, this has turned me sour on the author.<br />There are some lapses, also, in the description of ingredients. In the recipe for Daube de boeuf a la provencale, Sokolow calls for bacon, preferably pancetta. Later, in the list of ingredients for spaghetti, he correctly distinguishes bacon (smoked) from pancetta (unsmoked). In the first case, it would have been much better to specify pancetta and say one would substitute bacon if necessary. A small point, I guess, but it did tarnish my opinion of the author?s expertise.<br />For the quality and usefulness of the material, the book is very reasonably priced, and I do not miss photographs common to almost every other culinary oeuvre printed today, as I?m sure it would have jacked up the price. What I do miss is a formal bibiographic reference to where the author selected his recipe. Many contain some vague reference to a specifec work, but rarely the full chapter and verse of his text. For quiche lorraine, the author cites both Julia Child and Craig Claiborne for two different opinions, but does not say exactly from which source his recipe comes, as if  he had a direct connection to the Platonic idea for each of these recipes.<br />I really enjoy the kind of culinary writing which opens threads to other writers so the reader and connect the ideas from different sources.

890954:US	39134375	R2Y0KT0ASLX7BK	1891105108	465512930	Rachael Ray 30-Minute Meals 2	Books	5	284	314	N	N	Good Food for Busy People	Rachael Ray combines three or more recipes into a meal which can be made at home by inexperienced cooks from ingredients available at your local supermarket in about 30 minutes, with some minimal advance preparation. She does this very, very well in her books and on her Food Network series.<br />Rachael's TV series is shown somewhere between Mario Batali's ethnic Italian cuisine and Martha Stewart's high end cooking / entertaining demonstrations. Herein lies the moral of the story. Rachael does not feature haute cuisine, ethnic Italian, formal entertaining, fancy pastry, high nutrition, low calorie, economic preparations, or vegetarian. She does good food at home in a short time. This doesn't mean her meals are not nutritious or fattening, or use poor technique. Her preparations use a very high percentage of fresh ingredients and a low percentage of suspect animal fats and overly prepared ingredients. Many meals are a Mediterranean diet for everyman. Her use of extra virgin olive oil rivals Mario and her use of garlic would make Emril proud.<br />Her techniques are sound and very achievable for anyone with at least one very good knife, a food processor, a grill pan, and a few large saute pans and a large dutch oven. The only culinary skill one needs are fairly good knive skills, plus the discipline to keep that one knive very sharp. For those critics who say they learn nothing from Rachael's presentations, I say they miss the point. She is showing you how to eat well without great chops in the kitchen.<br />The thing which impresses me the most is that in spite of her retro 50's d&eacute;cor on her show, her food does NOT emulate the 50's food doctrines focusing on assembling easy meals from prepared foods. Having lived through the 50's with a working mother, I know exactly what that was like, and this ain't it. There is a fairly heavy use of fresh foods in partially prepared form, such as deboned chicken breasts and prewashed, precut salad greens. This means Rachael's meals may be slightly more expensive than similar meals done a la Mario from prima materia, but if you're a 35 year old with a good job, working 10 hours a day, 30 minutes to prepare a meal is a real bargain. I also know that loosing the bone on meats will loose some sources of flavor, but cross your heart and hope to die, do you really notice the difference on Tuesday night after a hard day at work.<br />If one compares Rachael's work to those nearest to her style on the Food Network, I believe you will see the really has her act much more firmly together than the new `Good Food Fast' show and, dare I say it, she succeeds much better at what she does than the Food Network icon Sara Moulton. Sara concentrates on  techniques, unusual foods, and unusual cuisines. I routinely cook from Sara Moulton's book and I do not routinely cook from Rachal's books, but then I'm retired and cooking is my hobby. Rachael does what she does very, very well. She may just not be what you are looking for.<br />I started taking Rachael much more seriously when I realized her 30 Minute Meal format predated her appearing on the Food Network. She cooked it up herself and was not a creature of Food Network producers. Another kudo to Food Network for, like Alton Brown's `Good Eats', seeing something good and running with it.<br />The most important caveat I would place on Rachael's menus is that accomplishing them in 30 minutes does require you to have a well organized kitchen with all foods equipment in good working order and immediately at hand. It also requires a very good advance knowledge of the recipes. The 30 minutes doesn't include the time it takes to read the recipe, do the shopping, and make sure everything is at the ready. It also helps to be thirtysomething with good knife skills. I have never caught Rachael cheating on her show (unlike Ms. Carmichael on the Good Food Fast show) but she accomplishes her goal by being constantly in motion, with not a second taken to reread therecipe or track down a missing onion.<br />Rachael's books are not free of errors. In one recipe, for example, a russet potato is identified as general purpose, when it is much more properly identified as a starchy potato. However, the use to which the potato was put in the recipe was CORRECT. I have found more serious culinary mistakes in a book by Emeril Legasse!<br />Rachael is not Julia Child or Lidia Bastianich or Diana Kennedy. She does food quickly at home with simple ingredients and equipment and she does it very well, presented at a very reasonable price.or track down a missing onion.<br />Rachael's books are not free of errors.

He describes this volume as an expanded appendix to his monumental, award winning `A Mediterranean Feast'.<br />I believe this book would be of interest to anyone with more than the most minimal interests in food. At the very least, it is a highly accessible catalogue of good vegetable dishes. Although some dishes do contain meat, fish, or meat stocks, it can also serve as an excellent resource for enlivening vegetarian diets, as the author does minimize meat ingredients.<br />These types of books are not commonly written in English by British or American writers. It always seems to be the Germans and the French who write the great compendia volumes for various interests. Unfortunately, good German and French and Italian works like this are hard to come by, even at the local Borders or Barnes and Noble. So, I am immensely grateful that Wright has rescued us, at least in the specialized world of Mediterranean cuisine.<br />Some people may find issue with his selection of vegetables. Wright's strategy is to be as broad as possible, including both vegetables only found in the wild and vegetables which have been imported to the Mediterranean shores from the orient or from the new world. I am very happy with this choice, especially since entries indicate the most likely point of origin for each plant and it's current distribution. There is nothing more annoying than looking for an entry in a reference book, not finding it, and wondering why it was left off, out of laziness or because it did indeed fall outside the scope of the book. With this book, that question should never arise. I also endorse the vegetable classification done by commercial criteria rather than by scientific criteria. Who could imagine this book without the tomato! My only disappointment here was that mushrooms were all lumped together under a single heading. Culinarily, this makes some sense, as most mushrooms are interchangeable in dishes, but I have to believe the distribution and ethnic uses of morels is quite different from portobellos.<br />One of the great joys of the book is that it's emphasis is both culinary and scholarly, in that much material, such as scientific names and common names in many different languages is available here along with very useful recipes. One direction in which the book is not exhaustive is in the choice of recipes. For vegetables such as artichokes and tomatoes, only a small representative sample is included. Whole books could be dedicated to the dishes of these vegetables. What we find is interesting, tasty examples which may not be found elsewhere.<br />I find the culinary contents of this book to be truly amazing and of tremendous value in any foodie's library. Surprisingly, I find several problems in the more scholarly content of the book. There are at least two statements on artichokes I find very surprising. One is that the choke is edible and the second that the stalk of the choke is not eaten. I rely on the authority of Mario Batali to believe both of these statements is incorrect, at least for Italians, who, Mario reports, regularly buy artichokes with long stems, peel, cook, and eat them with the heart. Another statement says that white asparagus is actually normal green asparagus, blanched before it is picked. `Blanched' is simply the wrong word, as it indicates a brief heating in water. A better word may be `bleached', although that has misleading associations as well. The fact is that they are whitened by mounding soil around the stalks to keep them away from sunlight. No heat of chemical is involved. The book would have been well served by a really good copy editor. Well, all the blurbs on the back cover are from culinary stars. No Nobel laureates here.<br />That aside, this is a wonderfully useful book. I wish many more of this type from Wright and other English speaking authors.ng authors.	2003-11-22

This combination cookbook, art book, and memoir is the story of a major celebrity chef's retreat from restaurant cooking to spend four weeks of culinary invention with a supporting cast of one culinary journalist (Michael Ruhlman), one painter (Valintino Cortazar), two photographers (Shimon and Tamar Rothstein), and a sous chef / recipe scribe Andrea Glick, all in a rather pricy package.<br />For the $50 list, one gets about 156 recipes, 15 of which are for condiments and ingredient preparations such as a vinaigrette and confit of lemon. Included in the price is the text by Ripert and Ruhlman which can be read in less than 4 hours, very good photographs of some, but not all of the dishes and photos of Rippert staring at and fondling ingredients, and about 100 paintings by Cortazar.<br />The most valuable aspect of this book is what it reveals about how Rippert reached his level of excellence in the culinary arts, and how he works to maintain that level. Rippert appears to follow the same path as Bobby Flay, Emril Lagasse, Tony Bourdain, and, if you  can believe it, Alton Brown, where these people were mediocre at school and other vocations until they discovered cooking, which, along with some very important mentors, they came alive with the passion needed for excellence in the culinary arts. Rippert's primary mentor was the great French chef Joel Robuchon, who demanded a level of excellence and discipline which only a handful of chefs can accomplish. The insights of this sort you simply don't get on the Food Network. Wolfgang Puck will give you his secret for a poached beef, but not for the way he thinks when he creates and tests recipes.<br />The recipes are much more a part of this narrative of revelation than they are a worthy source of material for the food hobbyist, much less for the everyday cook. The recipes are not organized by ingredient, taste, or course. Some are simple, but many are very involved and use uncommon ingredients such as the always elusive Kaffir lime leaves and expensive ingredients such as foie gras and truffles. Each recipe give an estimated prep time and cooking time. This is an excellent reature and probably should be included in every worthy recipe book, but I suspect the prep times are a bit ambitious for the average home cook, even for an enthusiastic hobbyist who is not under any time pressure. Twenty-five (25) minutes is not a lot of time to perform some type of preparation on eleven (11) different ingredients unless you are Eric Rippert. One symptom of the impracticality of this cuisine is that an important ingredient for several dishes is lemon confit, which requires THREE MONTHS to prepare. And, it is not an ingredient you will commonly find even at the local megamart. True to Rippert's history and the cuisine of his restaurant, Le Bernardin, the majority of the more interesting recipes are for seafood and I think he includes several important techniques for dealing with them. You will want to prepare more than a few of these recipes, but I think the bottom line is that the recipes are much more valuable as a part of the narrative than they are a part of a cookbook.<br />The photographs are very good; however, they are basically eye candy, except for the few glimpses of the attractive Ms. Glick, The paintings are pleasant. Somewhat more interesting eye candy than the photographs. The text in Mr. Ruhlman's voice is primarily background scenery, about as useful as the non-food photographs. Ruhlman has serious credentials in culinary writing, so I suspect he made a serious contribution to the words Eric Rippert's voice. The text in Mr. Rippert's voice is the main game. The only real dissonance I found in his discourse was when he shows his disinterest in pastry, claiming it was `too scientific' requiring far too many measurements. The great irony of this statement is that Eric Rippert's methods represent the scientific method at it's best, constantly tasting and adjusting based on his experiences with intermediate steps.<br />The overall package is attractive, with one glaring sour note. The font of the text is FAR TOO SMALL. This is a major annoyance, something which would have never gotten out the door at Knopf or Harper Collins. The book has much value for serious foodies with very good eyesight. The recipes are very good and well worth the investment, if you can get the book at a discount.ces with intermediate steps.<br />The overall package is attractive, with one glaring sour note.

This volume complements his monumental, award winning `A Mediterranean Feast' and is, I believe, as accessable, entertaining, and useable as food writing can get.<br />I confess that this type of writing by a culinary scholar / journalist writing about regional cuisines of the past and present is just about my favorite kind of food writing. Aside from the fact that these people are typically better writers than chefs, I believe this content has a cachet about it similar to what people say of antiques. What has survived from the past is generally better than what is produced today because there is so much more historical product than there is of contemporary product. Things typically survive because they are good.<br />Wright's book fits this expectation to a tee. For $22 list price, one gets over 500 recipes from all around the Mediterranean. This collection is so good, one could easily retire your Martha Stewart and Ina Garten books on appetizer menus and have this take their place.<br />In spite of the superficial similarity in the various small dishes in the book, there is a significant difference between antipasti and hors d'oeuvres, which accompany a large meal, tapas, which often consist of a meal in themselves to accompany afternoon drinking and conversation, and meze, which, in several countries comprise a large meal in itself, based on a lot of little dishes. There are family resemblences between the various little dish cuisines of the Mediterranean but, except for the presence of olives and olive oil, there is probably no common heritage to which all can be traced. Meze dishes can be traced to Arab cuisine. The word appears to be originally from Turkey. Hors d'oeuvre and antipasti are much more recent, emerging in French and Italian cuisines over the last 150 years. Tapas may be traceable to the period of the Moorish occupation of Spain, even though both Wright and Diane Kochalis, an authority on Greek cuisine agree that tapas and (Greek) mezes are different things.<br />All this very interesting historical stuff simply makes the excellent collection of recipes just that much more interesting. The books contents are divided into sixteen (16) types of dishes such as Bread Snacks, Dips, Cheese, Eggy stuff, Saucy Meats, Saucy Veges, Stuffed Vegetables, Salads, Pastries, Pizzas, Fried Turnovers, Fried Tidbits, Wraps, Seafood Salads, Grilled Food, and Pickles and Marinades. This is followed by two chapters of components recipes. One for Sauces and Spice Mixes and one for Doughs and Batters. The book concludes with an extensive list of Party Menus.<br />As you may expect, there are some requirements for uncommon ingredients, mostly cheeses of Greece and North Africa plus spice mixes, including the ever elusive Aleppo pepper. Substitutions from the world of Italian cheeses are almost always possible, but part of the fun is to get the read deal. Internet sources are, of course, provided.<br />In this very large book, I found only one questionable item, where the author specifies fresh plum tomatos or tomato puree to build tomato sauces. On the strength of the opinion of Mario Batali, I would change this to always using canned whole tomatoes.<br />This book will stay in my library long after others have been carted off the the library's book sale.rish occupation of Spain, even though both Wright and Diane Kochalis, an authority on Greek cuisine agree that tapas and (Greek) mezes are different things.<br />All this very interesting historical stuff simply makes the excellent collection of recipes just that much more interesting.

895619:US	39134375	R24BJMHOM9ZKMI	0786868562	838927122	Flavor	Books	5	23	32	N	N	A Great Focus on Basics	Many celebrity chef cookbooks published in the last few months have been packaged as coffee table books and have been written with an emphasis on some distinctive aspect of cooking which will help it stand out from the pack and sell at relatively high prices. Rocco Dispirito's spin on the cooking experience, as the title makes obvious, is on the role of balancing flavors, or, more exactly, the four classic tastes (sweet, sour, bitter, salty) in preparing food. As we all learned in high school biology class, the four tastes are experienced on the tongue and the remaining components of flavor are experienced by thousands of receptors in the nose. Flavor is actually more about smell than it is about taste. But, the four classic tastes are much easier to classify, so Rocco and his co-author(s) focus on that. There is a brief mention of  the newly conceived umani taste found in foods such as tomato, beef, mushrooms, and fava beans. Rocco, wisely, I think, leaves it at that. After introducing the tastes, the theme is carried throughout all the recipes in the book, identifying the predominant tastes of all the ingredients in each recipe. This theme is not merely a gloss, forgotten by the time one gets to the entr&eacute;e recipes.<br />This book can be seen on several different layers and the value you find is based on how valuable you find each of the layers in the presentation.<br />At the most basic level, there are the recipes. For a list price of $35, the number of recipes is pretty thin. There are 105 recipes divided into Appetizers (18), Soups (11), Salads (10), Entrees (35), Side Dishes (11), Desserts (13) and Reserve List (7). The last category needs explanation. All the recipes in the other 6 categories are, I believe, fairly straightforward, with a very reasonable number of ingredients. This is not the same as fast. Many recipes do require long cooking or marinade times and very few require less than an hour of active time, even though few require any fancy techniques or equipment. This is a sure sign that the restaurant recipes have been adapted to home cooking. The Reserve List recipes are all distinguished by being more difficult to prepare, with more steps and more ingredients. These are the types of recipes you will find in a book by Daniel Boulud. The recipes in this book are based on French seafood style of cooking with a heavy infusion of Southeast Asian (Thai cum Vietnam) flavors and methods. Some are simple, but most have that upscale New York restaurant about it. But then, one of the reasons you buy this book is to do Union Pacific recipes at home.<br />At the next level, you have the overlay of flavor notes on the ingredients. For the real foodie, this aspect of the book really works. For me, it reinforced the epithany I had while watching the `Jamie's Kitchen' special where Jamie is testing his students for their appreciation of taste. It is so easy to get lost among the trees of equipment, techniques, nutrition, books and recipes and forget that above a bare subsistance level, it's all about flavor, which is the engine which drove the great world cuisines to coax great results out of inexpensive ingredients by seemingly involved methods. It is clear that Rocco is not seeing things hidden from other chefs. He and his collaborators have hit upon a way to bring this to the foreground.<br />At another level, the book adds very useful information about each recipe, giving the total time, active time, difficulty, number of protions, and recommended wine paring for the dish. The serving size is standard. Nothing new there. The total and active times are uncommon, but they shouldn't be in high end cookbooks. I believe these times are very realistic. The difficulty rating is a great addition. My only reservation is that no recipes outside the reserved list have a rating of more than 3 out of 6. Still, a very good thing.<br />The top level is the way in which photographs have been used in this book. There is a photograph for the finished product for almost every recipe. Almost all of these photos are very good. There are also many photographs of ingredients. Pretty. Not that useful. There are several techniques which are illuminated by a series of photographs, but NO TEXT. They look like pages from a book seen in Fahrenheit 451. All pictures. No reading. They work, but they would have worked much better with a little text. As in Jamie Oliver's book, there are a lot of photos of Rocco and colleagues fondling ingredients. Except for the one with the young girl covered in chocolate, I could do without them.<br />As long as you get this book at a discount price, it is definitely worth it for the amateur chef. It will succeed in making cooking more interesting and it will give you some great experiences with exotic ingredients. Rocco's advice on encountering new ingredients is right up there with Alton Brown's advice on thinning out your kitchen equipment. Another added value are the lists of ingredients by taste and by season at the back of the book. The obligatory list of internet ingredient sources is there as well.<br />I have just a few pet peeves. Rocco does a great service by pointing out which ingredients infuse well in water and which ingredients infuse well in oil, but then spoils the whole insight by relegating it to `scientific babble'. The other minor annoyance is when he assigns classic names such as pot au feu to a dish which are substantially different from the classic recipe, then neglects to put these named dishes in the index.<br />A great gift for the foodie on your list.r the finished product for almost every recipe.

I heartily recommend this book to just about anyone as a source of tasty, easy, traditional dishes. The only reservations would be to people who may not have the time or inclination to search out some of the speciality ingredients.<br />Almost all recipes in this book use fewer than 12 ingredients and the technique rarely takes more than four (4) steps, taking no more than a half page of text. This is not exactly quick cooking, although there are a fair number of quick recipes herein. Some recipes do require long marinades, but very few require long cooking. Most heat is from either a quick saute or a grill.<br />The issues with ingredients, especially for those who like to stay authentic, is probably solved if you live in a large city and there is a Greek or middle eastern grocery available. It is also probably not a big issue if you live near a `megamart' which carries a generous supply of Greek and Turkish staples. Needless to say, even if you live in the sticks, there are internet sources for everything. The most important speciality ingredients are:<br />Greek feta - There is barrel cured and tin cured. Some recipes recommend one type. Some the other.<br />Other Greek Cheeses - Popular Italian cheeses like ricotta will substitute for most requirements.<br />Greek Oregano - Dried<br />Greek / Eastern Mediterranian yogurt - Fortunately, there is an easy way to make plain yogurt work.<br />Dried Mint - Yes, dried. Fresh mint is also commonly used.<br />Greek Extra Virgin Olive Oil - `What is grown together goes together'. But Italian or Spanish will work.<br />Phyllo - Supermarket Phyllo is fine.<br />Octopus - The national seafood of Greece.<br />Pastourma - Cured Beef<br />Once you locate a source, I believe most ingredients such as the Greek olive oil will actually be less expensive than Italian substitutes. Almost all other ingredients such as eggplant, pita, and ouzo are very common everywhere in the country.<br />Meze, short for mezethes, denotes small dishes served typically at small eateries like `mezethopoleion'; ouzeri, similar to the Italian wine shop; and the tsipouradiko, serving Greek eau-de-vie. The object of these establishments and their meze fare is to offers its patrons a place to eat, drink, and have conversation in the hours between large meals. The author points out that although there is a strong similarity in portion size and preparation similarity to Spanish tapas, the dishes were specifically developed to be eaten only as an accompanyment to drink in the middle of the day, not as a `before the meal' bite to get you started on the main meal of the day. It is much more comparable to bar nuts, pretzels, and pickled eggs on American bars.<br />All portions are small and most are designed to be eaten with the fingers, bread, or skewer.

It is much more comparable to bar nuts, pretzels, and pickled eggs on American bars.<br />All portions are small and most are designed to be eaten with the fingers, bread, or skewer. Chapters in the book cover:<br />Dips, Spreads, and Relishes; Savory Salads; Small Egg Dishes; Phyllo Pies; Fried Finger Foods; Vegetables and Beans; Seafood; and Meatballs and Kebabs<br />The author is a recognized authority on Greek food and has a written a widely praised book on general Greek cuisine. The color pictures are decorative, but few. While I found all instructions very simple, the author did occasionally seem a bit opaque. I still don't totally understand her instructions for peeling a roasted eggplant. As Martha Stewart said in one of her book introductions, this book made me want to immediately try many of the dishes. This is a sure symptom that there is good food to be had here.	2003-11-18

It didn't take me long to change that opinion. This book sustains that good opinion.<br />The book is simply 30 Minute Meals 3. It's recipes and menus are taken directly from the scripts of the Food Network show 30 Minute Meals. This is a good thing. If nothing else, it insures that the recipes have been run through with several pairs of eyes more than once and it saves one the time required to download the almost always good recipes from the Food Network web site. It also means that you have a foolproof visual aid to show you exactly how it can be done in 30 minutes. And, at a very affordable list price of $22, discounted to below $20, I'm sure, this is a very economical resource.<br />The book is not pure foodie fare in that it makes a judicious use of prewashed and cut vegetables, boned and skinned meats, prepared stocks, cake mixes, and frozen foods. It is not, however, a revivial of the food culture of the 50's where building meals from packages and cans was heralded as the sensible way for the housewife to prepare dinner quickly and easily. Rachael makes abundant use of fresh raw materials such as lettuce and pancetta, and makes the application of extra virgin olive oil and garlic into something of a mantra.<br />At the same time, this is definitely not fast food. As Rachael states on numerous occasions, her cuisine is a remedy to fast foods, which I heartily endorse. The overriding virtue of her books is that she not only presents recipes which can be done quickly, she presents whole menus which, in theory, can be done in 30 minutes, and shows how to switch from one preparation to the other, so as she does on TV, the whole meal can be done quickly. Her success in accomplishing this feat is more than worth the reasonable price of admission.<br />As Rachael will be the first to admit, few of her recipes are original. Many are fast lane versions of classic dishes. Many others are adapted from older books. I recognize, for example, a dish made in 10 minutes with canned tomatoes and frozen green beans which are based on a Paula Wolfert classic which can cook for over an hour. Rachael spends a lot of time reading old cookbooks!<br />For those who may not know of Rachael's work, there are some caveats. First, finishing a typical Rachael Ray menu in 30 minutes of real time is a stretch for the average cook. I have never seen Rachael cheat on the screen, but her pace can only be sustained by someone who really knows her way around the kitchen, has a kitchen which is very well laid out to fit her style, with plenty of work room and plenty of high end pots and pans. It also helps that all ingredients are right at hand. It also helps to be a thirtysomething who knows the recipes by heart and can keep in constant motion for 30 minutes. Another caveat is that there are several cooking techniques such as braising and roasting which simply cannot be done in the 30 minute window. Rachael relies heavily on the grill pan and the broiler. Fancy techniques are also absent, although this is probably a good thing for non-foodies. There are no omlets, but plenty of their Italian cousin, the frittata. I also have some qualms about not washing the `pre-washed' greens and some of the additives which may come along with the few prepared foods she does use.<br />Lastly, there are some pet peeves. First, using the `evoo' abreviation for extra virgin olive oil at every single occurrence is a REAL bother. Every other cookbook I have ever read simply says `olive oil' and makes it plain once that it always means extra virgin olive oil. Even Mario Batali isn't that compulsive about olive oil. Second, stating some measurements in two different ways, the exact teaspoon or tablespoon fraction followed by the `handful' or `once around the pan' is simply unnecessary. Giving the precise measurement is great, and far superior in a book to Jamie Oliver's glugs or Tyler Florence's counts, but the second hip measurement is unnecessary. Everyone who cooks works out their own methods for approximating precise measurements. Just say at the beginning of the book that one can use their own judgement and leave it at that. Third, the expression of fractional quantities is simply wrong. One may say 2 and 2/3, but it should NEVER be written that way. It is just distracting.<br />Don't get me wrong, I cook and bake for a hobby and am much closer to the ethos of the slow food movement than I am to Rachael's style, but then I'm retired and have the time to spend on it. For anyone with a job and time for no more than one trip to the megamart per week, Rachael Ray is an angel. Even if she is still a lightweight next to Mario.d far superior in a book to Jamie Oliver's glugs or Tyler Florence's counts, but the second hip measurement is unnecessary.

898369:US	39134375	R3L9EM1GOLNP1E	068486343X	288168259	Daniel Boulud's Cafe Boulud Cookbook	Books	5	21	21	N	N	A very good thing	Martha Stewart captured the charm of this book in her introduction when she says `...I cannot wait to open it again (for)... those recipes that I want to try immediately... then to all the other recipes, because I'd like to try them also'. I have felt that same urge while reading other great cookbooks, such as Julia Child's `Mastering the Art of French Cooking', to which this book is a worthy amendment. This urge is a sure sign that the author(s) of the book have something which have touched your sensibilities.<br />It is important to note that while Daniel Boulud is the headliner, there is a very important co-author, Dorie Greenspan, who has won more cookbook awards than any three celebrity chefs put together. It's hard to determine exactly how much Dorie contributed, but, as a major cookbook author in her own right, I have to believe her contribution was a lot more than transcribing Boulud's words from tape recordings and notes. My guess is that, at the very least, she was instrumental in translating the recipes from the restaurant to the home kitchen. Her contribution must be, therefore, essential to the attraction of this book.<br />As other reviewers have noted, the book, like the menu at Caf&eacute; Boulud, is divided into four independent sections covering French, World, Seasonal, and Vegetarian cuisines. In evaluating the recipes, I believe this division is incidental. All of the recipes are easily identifiable as having sprung from the French culinary tradition. The only thing distinguishing one section from the others in my reading is that the first section on traditional French recipes presented a concrete look at the elements of Nouvelle Cuisine in the Troisgros brothers recipe `Salmon and Sorrel Troisgros'. In the past, I have read many generalities but few real examples on what this movement is really about. I thank Daniel and Dorie for that. There is, of course much, much more.<br />While the subtitle of the book proclaims it to contain recipes for the home cook, these are primarily only practical for the `foodie' cookbook collector, food hobbist, weekend meals, and special entertaining meals where the added cache of preparing something from Caf&eacute; Boulud adds interest to the feast. Almost all recipes are LONG, with long ingredients lists. Many recipes include long marinades and braises. Most recipes include substantial subpreparations such as for stocks and sauces. Luckily, the authors always add a warning when the technique requires a plan ahead step. None of this detracts from the type of enthusiasm Martha Stewart had for the book, as I felt the same thing. These are good recipies.<br />It is to our advantage that the new interest in food in the US is centered around both American and French cuisines, as this means that very few ingredients used in this book will be hard to find. I have even seen Jerusalem artichokes in my local supermarket. No need to travel to a farmer's market or to the regional megamart. Spices and herbs should be no problem. The hard to find stuff is more likely to be things like sweetmeats and marrow bones.<br />I found no errors in this book. The closest it came was to relate Jerusalem artichokes with globe artichokes in the main section of the book. The two are not botanically related, and this is cleared up in the appendix on ingredients. In general, I find such appendices on tools, techniques, and terms to be of little value, since, being just a few pages long, they invariably omit something you may look for. This book's appendices have good content, but they fail to explain many of the French culinary terms. I also give little credit to the pantry recipe sections, but, in this book and other good books like it, you need to know how the author prepared their veal stocks and the like to really know how their stuff is supposed to turn out.<br />The color pictures in this book are the way I like them in separate sections, all together, so you can page through all the pictures to choose a dish. In this book, the pictures are divided into the four sections of recipes. Very wise.<br />This book is MUCH better than the later `Chef Danial Boulud: Cooking In New York City', where the celebrity chefs started entombing their cuisine in coffe table books with lots of useless photographs. The absence of Ms. Greenspan's influence is also felt in the latter volume.<br />Even at $35, this book is a keeper.. In this book, the pictures are divided into the four sections of recipes.

900214:US	39134375	R2E7J7RVO4N3G5	006018535X	520527101	From Emeril's Kitchens: Favorite Recipes from Emeril's Restaurants	Books	5	24	31	N	N	Very Good Meals, Well Presented	Emeril?s new book is different from many other recent celebrity restaurant recipe books, mostly in very good ways.<br />First, while Emeril is definitely the star, he liberally shares credit for the work with all senior members of his large organization spread across nine restaurants plus ?Emeril?s Homebase? in New Orleans. Emeril even goes so far as to credit all of his administrative staffs and sommeliers. The last is odd because there is no mention of any wine pairings to the food. Not being a great fan of fine wines, I don?t miss this and do not hold it against the book. I point it out because it may be a feature important to some potential buyers of this book.<br />Second, there is none of the coffee table look to this book. It is all business, devoted exclusively to the presentation of recipes. Following this theme, all the color plates are together in the center section of the book. I find this much more audience friendly, as the photographs are better placed to assist one in choosing an attractive dish from the selection available. The quality of the color photographs is good, but not excellent. The camera is a bit too close for my taste,as the front of a pizza is in focus while the back of the pizza is hazy.<br />Third, the recipes in the book are much more organized around dinners, with recipes for both supporting dishes and major components being presented together with the recipe for the entr?e. In spite of the entr?e centric presentation, there is still a large and, to my eyes, a more useful than usual section at the beginning of the book on ?Basics?. This organization makes the book much more suitable to it?s typical audience than many others. I believe people buy celebrity chef books primarily aes a resource for planning entertaining menus and to generally make their Sunday and holiday dinners more interesting. This book is a great help for that objective, with the bonus that you can throw out the fact that ?this meal is served at Emerils!?<br />Fourth, Emeril makes it very clear that the recipes were created by many different chefs. I recognize only a very few recipes from his TV shows, and Emeril takes personal credit for very few of the recipes. This does not lead to a hodge podge, as all of Emeril?s restaurants seem to be firmly based in the Cajun / Creole / Gulf Coast / Southern cuisine, with a bit of New York / Chicago steakhouse and Fall River Portuguese thrown in to leaven the mix.<br />Fifth, this book is not overpriced. List price is reasonable, and with a discount I suspect it can be had widely for not much more than $20. I believe this is because this book is not a salvo to help garner Emeril a James Beard or IACP award, it is to bring people into his restaurants. This is why the book promotes the restaurants? ample wine cellars and sommelier staff, but says nothing about wine pairings in the style of Ming Tsai or Tom Colicchio.<br />Sixth, I have found no errors which would typically be found and corrected by a copy editor. More than one upscale culinary coffee table denizen has been infected by such errors. The folks at William Morrow, the publisher, earned their place in the acknowledgments.<br />In general, there are some simple recipes, but not many. I give Emeril and his collaborators credit for not making any claims that this is simple cooking, because it isn?t. Most of the protein entrees require one or more secondary preparations of stocks, sauces, ingredients, and garnishes. Even if one replaces the stocks with commercial products, the number of pantry preparations is still large. On the other hand, with a few exceptions, I believe few of the preparations are hard for a dedicated foodie. I would caution people who use this book that there is some cooking expertise assumed here. Warnings for symptoms for which the cook should check to determine doneness or other culinary endpoints are rare.<br />As stated above, the cuisine is classic American, with reliance on over the top quality beef, crab, shrimp, lamb, crawfish, and the like ingredients rather than on obsessively fine technique to achieve tasty results. There are few of your fussy French greens, replaced with a high reliance on Bibb lettuce. The Caesar salad, for example, is less fussy than Martha Stewart may like. It is certainly less fussy than you will find in a big ticket New York steakhouse.<br />The observation on the Caesar salad recipe is typical of what I found in many recipes. The mashed potatoes recipe, for example, is several notches below what one would find under a roof of a major French restaurant. Another clue is the treatment of mustard in sauces. The sauce au pauvre recipe cooks the Dijon mustard for 10 minutes on moderate heat before plating. Every authority from Jaques Pepin on down warns against cooking mustard to avoid it?s turning bitter. But, this type of over the top technique is not what Emirl is all about.<br />Oddly, the only real disappointment I took from the book is that there were very few recipes from Tchoup Chop. This is the one cuisine which would diverge the most from Emeril?s Cajun / Creole center of gravity. I would recommend any prospective buyer to ignore any connection with the flamboyant character on ?Emeril Live? and take the book on its merits.b, shrimp, lamb, crawfish, and the like ingredients rather than on obsessively fine technique to achieve tasty results.

For an older book, I always try to find something new to say which other reviewers may not have touched on. In the case of this book and it's companion volume `Second Helpings' by the same authors, about the cuisine of the same Union Square Caf&eacute;, that rationale is simple. Almost all of the recipes successfully fit my criteria for buying celebrity chef / restaurant cookbooks. That is, almost all of the recipes are accessible to the experienced home cook living in the northeast United States and offer resources for making their cooking more interesting.<br />More specifically, both volumes enrich my repertoire of Italian dishes without the need to invest in many autre ingredients. They make very good use of their 160 recipes (a magic number which seems to be the de regeur count of dishes in this type of book) without adding a large number of the usual, and usually unnecessary list of recipes for kitchen staples. They are here, but their number are kept to a reasonably small number. If I really want to make a primo veal stock, I'll check out the CIA cookbook.<br />My rating of five (5) stars is based entirely on comparing this book to similar, recently published books by Daniel Boulud, Tom Colicchio, and Emril Lagasse. For books of this type, the lion's share of the value is in the effective presentation of the recipes, and in this task, the authors excel. They make the small point of placing all the ingredients prep work with the ingredients list. The more one reads recipes in other books, the larger this point becomes. This practice would be on my short list of style tips for recipe writing.<br />There are very few black and white photographs, and I find that I do not miss the large color rotogravure look. Pages of text provide much more value. I also don't miss the wine parings, as this is only useful to a very limited audience.<br />Good value for the money.	2003-11-14

My first surprise was that the title mislead one to think it was a general book on cooking skills. Instead, it is an exposition on the cooking at Colicchio's Manhatten restaurant Craft and the title was really a play on words. A much more accurate title would have been `Cooking of Craft'. The author does not hide this fact. In the `How to use this book' section, Colicchio states clearly that the audience for the book is `a skilled amateur or enthusiastic hobbyist' where `speed and convience are probably not your first focus here'. As the content `this is a book that sets out how things are done in one restaurant, Craft'. My second surprise was based on the fact that Colicchio's stated goal for the cuisine of `Craft' was to make the kind of simple, well prepared food he makes at home. Well.... When you throw in the `...prepared well...' qualifier with a bunch of extremely talented, obsessive corp of chefs working in the Manhatten restaurant market, you get something which no home cook in their right mind would consider `simple'. I'm exaggerating a bit, since, as I will cite below, there is much of value for simple fare, but there is no evidence of this simplicity in the opening section on meats. In fact, the opening section in the meats chapter is on `charcuterie', a term which the author does not even bother to explain. This IS rough going for newbies, especially since charcuterie is one of the fussiest and most time consuming of classic cuisinary techniques. But, it does get better.<br />The book is divided by eight simple sections, in which there are rewards for the skilled amateur. These are:<br />Meat - This section answers a question I have always had about restaurant food. How does the restaurant kitchen handle preparing braised dishes, when most braises worth their salt often take hours to achieve the fall off the bone tenderness. The solution is obvious, based on the fact that braisees often taste better the next day. Viola, they are prepared a day ahead and reheated. These recipes show you how.<br />Fish - Very sound. Nothing ground breaking. The usual litany on using fresh ingredients.<br />Vegetables - Here is where the objective of simplicity starts paying off. Very good, truly simple recipes here, as long as you have a good supply of stock preparations at the ready.<br />Mushrooms - This section and the next are worth the (discounted) price of admission. Well done fussiness.<br />Potatoes - Actually found some reasonably simple recipes I have not seen before, and the compulsive obsessive twist on the classics.<br />Grains and beans - A few oddities. Sound stuff.<br />Dessert - A rather nicely large selection of recipes, highlighted by the large number of fruit compotes.<br />Pantry - The usual stock in trade. The recipes for fumet and ramp butter are interesting, and the classic French term and technique buerre fondue is new to me.<br />I am a compulsive book buyer, and my only criteria for being satisfied in a purchase of a technical book is if it had one idea I have not found anywhere else. In this book, it would be the restaurant kitchen's techniques for preparing braises. On the other side of the coin, there is a fair amount of material which may be only for the armchair, unless you wish to make your own puff pastry or roast you own whole baby lamb. Tony Bourdain is alive and well at craft, it seems.<br />The cuisine is based in the recipes of Italy, probably northern Italy, although I am sure Mario Batali would sneer at all of the frenchified stocks and techniques. No simple brodo here, thank you.<br />In this mixed bag of eye candy and practical advice, there are a few problems which are not worthy of the care the author and his staff devotes to the food of craft.<br />First, there are misspellings. I found, for example caul fat misspelled in a head note.<br/>Second, there are erroneous page references. Things on page x weren't there. They were a page later.<br />Third, the recipe writing style was inconsistant. Some prep steps accompanied the list of ingredients and other prep steps were in the body of the method. When I saw  Danny Meyer and Michael Romano of Union Square Caf&eacute; make a point of putting all prep work with the ingredients list, I thought it was trivial. It aint.<br />Fourth, there are mistakes in simple kitchen chemistry. For example, a recipe says that one applies heat to a mixture of sugar and cream and wait for the sugar to melt. Please. The proper term is dissolve.<br />Errors of this type lost this book it's fifth star.<br />I noticed this same type of carelessness in the copy editing of Diana Kennedy's new book, also published by Clarkson Potter. I would expect better from a company with such a large presence in the cookbook market. On the plus side, I do notice that Clarkson Potter binds their books to lay flat on the table and be bound very securely to take a lot of wear. The photographs seem to be a wash. They are no better than what one would expect.<br />This book is truly for the food hobbyist and cookbook collector. It does nothing for people who want easy, fast, cheap, or low calorie.

And, the appearance of a sequel justifies the good opinion of the first volume. The new volume continues it's contribution to my Italian repetoire and continues to do it with recipes which are exceptionally well written. The introduction to the new volume makes it clear that many, if not most of the dishes are ... from Italian restaurants and nonas. I like this, if only because I find this much more believable than if the authors took credit for the recipes themselves. I also appreciate the traditional Italian names of the dishes as it makes it easier to compare these recipes with those done by classic Italian food writers such as Marcella Hazan and Lidia Bastianich.<br />The new volume uses it's photographs to add a rare element of humor to the cookbook. It is great good fun to do some celebrity spotting in the pics and be reassured that if Jacque Pepin takes the trouble to eat there, something good much be going on in the back of the house.<br />The new volume includes a long Pasta and Risotto chapter. A welcome addition.<br />On the down side, I find some of the recipes fairly long. Several are probably too much for the casual cook, although I believe some of the length is due to their being very thorough in their explanations.<br />Since this is a sequel to a well received book, I find the Pantry section to be a waste of space. Many named preparations from the first book are repeated in the second. Since these preparations are also available in hundreds of other books, I think this is blatant padding.<br />Bottom line is that the book is a worthy continuation to the original.	2003-11-14

It suddenly started making sense to me when I read that Franey was employed as the head of the Howard Johnson's research and development kitchen in the 60's before going to his gig as a culinary columnist for the New York Times. The credentials of this chef, along with my interest in preparing good food quickly lead me to buy this book shortly after it was published in 1989.<br />Franey is especially qualified to write recipes with this slant due to his long service at the New York Times column devoted to quick cooking.<br />Like some modern writers on fast cooking such as Rachael Ray, I believe Franey does alter classic recipes such as pot a feu to get them done faster, but mostly selects those recipes which can be done in less time. There are some exceptions to this such as Pierre's recipe for Chile con carne, typically a long cooking dish. I have prepared this chile many times over the last 12 years and at one time I thought it was very good. Now, after being exposed to some of the more authentic, classic southwestern recipes, I find Pierre's recipe merely a good expedient. Pierre also does not limit himself to the cuisines of western Europe<br />On the other side of the coin, I find that this book contains many bonus features on techniques which one would not expect to find in a book with this slant. For example, it covers the always challanging method for dealing with an artichoke and a method for charring the skin of a sweet pepper.<br />This is a very good book for the novice, occasional cook, as it was for me when I first purchased it. The only warning I have is that being short does not always mean easy. A novice cook may find himself challanged by some of the preparations and find yourself taking much longer than an experienced chef.<br />If you are a serious foodie who dotes on Paula Wolfert and Diana Kennedy, you can skip this volume.ana Kennedy, you can skip this volume.	2003-11-12

The credit to Ms. Kennedy is enhanced by the fact that the material in the book was quite plainly not written and produced by a team. The depth of the material is exceptional, considering the fact that Mexican cuisine is as broad and as regionally diverse as the more widely storied cuisines of Italy and France.<br /><br />The book is much more than a collection of recipes. In many ways, it is a Larousse Gastronomique for Mexico, with all of the weight of authority that name carries,including sections on:<br /><br />Menus - A small section, very informative for Mexican newbies, but not very deep.<br />Ingredients - All sections are deep and rewarding.<br />- Dairy<br />- Fats<br />- Chiles<br />- Herbs<br />- Vegetables and Fruits<br />- Meats<br />- Grains (Rice and Pasta)<br />- Seasonings<br />Techniques - Exceptional, doubly so because it includes both weights and metric units of measure.<br />- Antojitos<br />- Moles<br />- Table Sauces<br />- Tamales<br />- Tortillas<br />- Vinegar<br />- Yeast Breads<br />Utensils Native to Mexico - Some blemishes here. See below<br />Mexican Food Terms - Some blemishes.<br />Sources of Ingredients - By state in the US.<br /><br />Note that unlike the situation with French and Italian ingredients, Ms. Kennedy generally has a low opinion of the quality of Mexican ingredients available in the United States. This makes it doubly useful that she has provided the means of making several of these base ingredients in the home.<br /><br />As Diana points out in the introduction, she is both the food stylist and the hand model for all of the excellent photographs by Michael Calderwood. The photographs clearly enhance the value of the book.<br /><br />I am not very familiar with Mexican techniques myself, so, to evaluate the recipes, I concentrated on the baking sections and can say that they are worthy of the best presentations I have seen by baking specialists. In baking even more than with other techniques, measuring by weight, more especially measuring by the more precise metric scale, is essential to achieving consistant results, and Ms. Kennedy gives you the `full 9 meters' to good measuring, tempered by techniques to compensate for humidity. It even includes some tips I have not found in books dedicated to baking.<br /><br />One of the greatest and most unexpected pleasures to be found by reading this book is the sense Ms. Kennedy gives you of her belonging to a community of cookbook authors. She does not simply drop names. She cites and credits people like Julia Child and Paula Wolfert for their insights and facts uncovered. The thrill is not so much in acquiring this information as it is in seeing the author and her subject placed within a broader world of culinary ethnology.<br /><br />There are three sections to the book which could have benefited from some judicious copy editing. The first is the introduction where many Mexican terms and locations are used before they were explained. It would have been better to place this section after the section entitled `Mexico'. The second is the Mexican Food Terms section. It is said that some terms cannot be translated into English, yet the explanation of the term does not succeed in really communicating the sense of the term. The third is the `Utensils Native to Mexico' where a similar problem occurs. A term has no English equivalent, yet the book does not provide a picture of the utensil, even though pictures of translated terms have excellent pictures accompanying the text. Don't get me wrong, this section is very, very good. It just has some things which could be better. One last criticism, also in the purview of a copy editor, is some awkward word usage, such as when people `waft' between Mexico and the US. Doesn't work for me.<br /><br />A rare but excellent feature of this book is the references to recipes and techniques in Ms. Kennedy's earlier books. I'm sure this can be annoying for someone who does not own these books, but it ultimately adds to the value of the present value as well as enhancing the value of her earlier books. At the very least, it means you are not paying for things which have been published elsewhere. I can think of more than a few cookbook writers who would benefit from this feature.<br /><br />Anyone who has any interest in Mexican cuisine will be richly rewarded by reading this book from cover to cover. Anyone who has a general interest in good cookbook writing will be rewarded by reading this book from cover to cover. Anyone who has an interest in the origins of cuisine will find much here, but this is a cookbook, not a book of history or linguistics. Anyone with an interest in trying new types of baking (or suggestions on how to write a good baking recipe) will find many rewards here. I would look to this book before executing any Mexican recipe by any author. This is a book against which others should be judged. I would hope other authors would go to school on this volume.alue as well as enhancing the value of her earlier books.

You will find little or no preaching on local sources, simple preparations, fresh ingredients, or organically raised produce. These were simply not an issue for him in 1964. Recall that this was less than 4 years after the publication of Rachael Carson's `Silent Spring' and less than 2 years after the publication of Julia Child's `Mastering the Art of French Cooking'. Elizabeth David was probably unknown to most of Beard's audience and Chez Panisse was less than a glimmer in Alice Water's psyche.<br />I must say that having read a recent, well regarded biography of Beard, I suspect that Beard has done something of which Martha Stewart has been `accused'. That is, reinventing himself to the public by glossing over some of the less pleasant episodes in his childhood. And, at least two thirds of the book deal with his mother, her chefs at their Portland Oregan boarding house, and his early exposure to the foods of the American northwest.<br />This is much more of a memoir than it is a cookbook, but for what few recipes it contains, there is a much greater chance that these are from Beard's personal experience. As his autobiography documents, and as Jerimiah Tower, a Beard confidant confirms, this may be one of the few books James Beard wrote himself. He almost always had one or more assistants compiling material for his books.<br />Aside from his being the most important influence on the food writing of a generation of Americans, I always appreciate Beard for the simplicity of his recipes and ingredients. One rarely needs to worry about obscure ingredients or difficult techniques in Beard's books So, If one wishes to get an authentic taste of this American original and get a sense of the nature of his writing, one cannot do better than by reading this volume.inal and get a sense of the nature of his writing, one cannot do better than by reading this volume.	2003-11-11
904687:US	39134375	R11OJM2VHH9X2O	0060936924	483112622	The Short-Cut Cook: Make Simple Meals with Surprisingly Little Effort	Books	5	117	118	N	N	Easy Access to Good Food	I began cooking from this book about 12 years ago, when it was first released in hardcover. I did not know Jaques Pepin's reputation, I simply wanted recipes one can do quickly. My bottom line on this book is that it succeeded in delivering on the promise of the book's title.<br />I confess I was a little cynical about Pepin's book at first. Pierre Franey, a chef whose very very impressive pedigree I did know had published, at that time, at least three volumes of quick cooking recipes based on his well-known New York Times column. I interpreted this as simply 'jumping on the bandwagon' of a popular trend. I got it anyway because the evidence of Pepin's previous books and the blurbs on the back of the dust jacket attested to Pepin's credentials in the kitchen. Little did I realize that Franey and Pepin were close friends and had worked together for many years.<br />Regarding thie recipes in this book, I am very happy to find the reliance on prepared foods such as the famous Campbell's soups, to be much smaller than one may expect from the introduction. I also believe that unlike Rachael Ray, Jacques does not accomplish his objective by finding short cuts to long techniques, but keeps his dishes short by selecting recipies which are classicly short on preparation. In this way, he succeeds in describing recipies with few or no compromises on results.<br />Having prepared several dishes from this book, I will warn you that Pepin is wise not to give any expectations about how long these dishes should actually take. While there is not a lot of prep work in most recipes, some of the recipes do require a fair amount A perfect example is the Salade Nicoise. This may be faster than the recipe in Julia Child's books, but you still need to plan for some serious shopping and prep work to get a good result.Another example is one of my favorites, his Asian influenced tangy rice stick salad. It looks simple on page 105, until you realize you need to do an ingredient preparation on page 22 which takes longer than the final recipe.<br />All grousing aside, this is really good stuff. The price for 200 recipes of this quality is a real bargain. My only other complaint is that the short section in the beginning of the book on stocking one's pantry is probably a waste of time. Whenever I buy anything with the expectation that I will use it in some unknown recipe in the future, I usually find the stuff spoils or expires before I get around to using it. After a fair amount of experience in cooking from cookbooks, I have learned to ignore all such recommendations and simply buy what I need for what I know I will be making in the next week.page 22 which takes longer than the final recipe.<br />All grousing aside, this is really good stuff.

The skill and inspiration behind the book is unmistakable. The more difficult issue is to what extent the method by which the recipes are presented make sense for your style of cooking.<br />Ming begins each chapter with 32 `master recipes' followed by one or more uses for that master recipe. In this context, `master recipe' does not meat the same as the way the term is used by Julia Child in, for example `The Way to Cook'. In this case, the outcome of a master recipe is a complete dish on which one can make variations. In Ming Tsai's usage, a `master recipe' is the recipe for an ingredient which is not a dish in itself. This is certainly not a new idea as the examples of classic stocks and pastry doughs point out. Ming's contribution is to apply this principle systematically to a wide range of intermediate, storable ingredients for creating about 145 different dishes.<br />Ming states the notion came to him when he translated procedures used in his restaurant, `Blue Ginger' to the practice of home cooking. I am convinced that professional cooking techniques can often be transferred to the home with good results, but as many have pointed out, there are many techniques which simply don't travel, and, that the home cook can often achieve better results than one can do in a typical restaurant. The question is whether or not this technique succeed at home. Obviously, many home cooks make their own stocks and pastry doughs, so the question is basically whether the technique works equally well for the other `master ingredients' presented in this book. I think the answer largely depends on what kind of cooking one does.<br />The types of cooks which will clearly benefit from this book are:<br />1. People who enjoy reading cookbooks, regardless of the practicality of the recipes.<br />2. `foodies'. People for whom cooking is a hobby.<br />3. People with large familys who have the time and resources to prepare and store the ingredients.<br />4. People with finicky family members, where some effort on two dishes can be combined.<br />5. Other people with a lot of time for advance preparation and semi-skilled hands for prep work. A church social kitchen, for example.<br />6. People working up menus for restaurants.<br />7. People who do serious entertaining, for whom the food / drink pairings will enhance their menus.<br />This is unquestionably a good and useful book. I am especially grateful for the authoritative recipe for dashi broth and for the bread / pastry sections of the book. There are some tips which I have never seen before and which are unquestionably useful to the home cook. The recipes are also not too expensive. For example, being largely based on Oriental cuisines, the recipes use canola or grapeseed oil in place of olive oil. There is also very little use of the other famous Italian, French, or Russian big ticket ingredients. On the other hand, some ingredients may be very hard to find and Ming does not provide a page of internet sources. My local megamart still does not carry Kaffir lime leaves.<br />Some negative aspects of this book are:<br />1. The price. $32 for 140 recipes is no bargain. It will be available at a discount, but it is still a bit pricy.<br />2. In the short run, the recipes may actually take longer for the home chef than a conventional approach.<br />3. If one does more than two master recipes, keeping track of expiration dates becomes a chore.<br />4. If one does more than two master recipes, freezer and refrigerator storage becomes a problem.<br />I am very reluctant to say Ming has come up with something original, as I have not read every cookbook ever published. And, the advance preparation of stocks and condiments has been classic in both eastern and western cuisines. But, he has brought a very refreshing lesson to us, from which I think much can be learned.familys who have the time and resources to prepare and store the ingredients.<BR>4.

Even my local megamart seems to draw a blank when I ask them for brioche.<br />I believe the quality of this book far exceeds it's ability to provide very good recipes for sandwiches.<br />First, it will clearly arouse a greater interest in buying or even baking at home the types of high quality breads this book recommends. I'm not suggesting everyone start making Pane Toscana, but, acquiring the skill needed to make a simple country bread on a regular basis will bring with it an enormous joie de vivre. For the simplest Italian technique, see the bread making exercize in the volume `Jamie's Kitchen' by Jamie Oliver. For more elaborate results, you can start with the bread recipes in the back of this volume or in Nancy's `Bread from the La Brea Bakery'. I cite the Jamie Oliver source because Silverton makes no bones about the fact that her recipes are advanced. Simple breads can be very easy. Artisanal breads require a level of commitment to the task far beyond what is required to make cupcakes or cookies.<br />Second, the book fills in a big hole in the epicure's repertoire. For those of us who have cultivated an interest in food to enrich our lives by avoiding at all possible the overly expensive or overly processed products of American food industries, this provides a means of enjoying all the virtues of sandwiches with the bonus of a new reason to enjoy some of the world's great cheeses and some of the garden's great greens. What is the use of coveting a wedge of Italian Fontina without a preparation in which to fully enjoy it. And, not just any preparation, but one which is reasonably quick and easy to prepare.<br />Lunch and poker snacks need never again be devoid of character.	2003-11-09

W. Appel of the New York Times or Calvin Trillin of the New Yorker. As such, Mort Rosenblum looks at things culinary much more from the economic, social, and even political point of view rather than as an epicurean such as James Villas or Ruth Reichl. For that reason, the general reader will find much to interest them herein. These are not essays for only the foodies among us.<br />  My strongest impression on reading this book is that the author is describing many of the situations which drive people, at least citizens of France and the European Union, to organize protests at world economic summits or other meetings or organizations aimed at promoting globalization. Economic conditions in France and regulations imposed by the European Union appear to be leading to the disappearance of small scale agriculture in France, the kind of agriculture which is largely responsible for the artisnal foods and wines for which France is so famous. The great irony here to my mind is that in the same last 15 years, there has been a great revival of interest in both local and international artisanal products among Americans. Whitness the great reputation and influence of Chez Panisse and the movement to support local farmers and markets plus nationally available artisanal products such as Maytag blue cheese and specialty bacons.<br />  Another irony is that the European Union regulatory bodies are having much the same effect on smaller agricultural businesses in Europe as American regulatory agencies have on local products. They appear to be driving out of business the very agriculture which so clearly distinguishes European agricultural products from the American. The issue of cheeses from unpasturized milk is a perfect example. American customs prevents the import of any such products into the U.S. except for Rocquefort (since the French have convinced the FDA that the penicillin in this cheese kills off anything normally eliminated by Pasteurization). The problem is, the economics of producing Rocquefort is becoming so difficult that there is some danger that true Rocquefort may disappear, i.e., be too expensive to produce.<br />  The great tragedy I sense in the disappearance of artisanal products from small scale agriculture is that it means that the relatively inexpensive pleasures one can gain from the great foods of the world are in danger of either disappearing or becoming too expensive for the average middle class foodie to afford. I would really mourn seeing things like Rocquefort or Brie go the way of caviar, simply too expensive and too rare to enjoy outside of a very expensive venue.<br />  I strongly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys contemporary essays in general and essays on things culinary in particular. To those reviewers who found the work too dispassionate, I would point out that Rosenblum is writing journalism and not polemics. Being informed of the `desertification' of the French countryside and the reasons for same was more than enough.

The book is laid out by more by method and type of fish than by fish species, and this is not how the casual cook thinks of looking for recipes. After struggling with it for 10 years, I found several superior fish cookbooks by some really stellar talents, including no less than James Beard and Alan Davidson, plus Mark Bittman and James Peterson. All of these books are worthy. Beard's book in particular, is well suited to the occasional cook. Recipes are clear, simple, and economical with ingredients.	2003-11-08

It presents an excellent variety of dishes which avoid the preconceptions of a vegetarian regimen by presenting a wide variety of vegetable, grain, bean, and pasta dishes, avoiding a heavy concentration on the expected vegetable proteins. Herein lies the irony of the book's title. By successfully including a very wide variety of recipes and by having no reservations about using dairy and egg products in the recipes, Ms. Lemlin probably ends up with a volume where `classic' vegetarian dishes are very much in the minority. I think a major hint that the title was given simply for marketing effect is the fact that Jeanne at no time gives a definition of what she considers a `classic' vegetarian dish. I certainly don't know what that definition may be. That said, let me repeat that this is a very good cookbook.<br />  When I began reading this cookbook in order to review it, I set out with the deliberate intention of finding things which would justify fewer than five (5) stars, since I seem to be giving a lot of five star reviews lately. I am happy to say I did not find any egregious errors aside from the inappropriateness of the title. I will not hold that against the book. I will only warn you again, dear reader, that the title may be misleading.<br />  The only issue of substance I have with the book is it's treatment of rice dishes. There is not a single risotto recipe in the whole book. And, what, I ask you, may be a more classic meatless dish than mushroom risotto made with a vegetable stock. Otherwise, the treatment of rice is also a bit skimpy. The author relies on the conventional wisdom of two parts water to one part rice for cooking white rice. Even a cursory glance at the back of the Uncle Ben's box shows this is not strictly true. Many sources concur that a less than two to one ratio is always better, and the relative amount of water should decrease as the amount of rice increases. Fortunately, there are numerous books specializing in rice cookery which I recommend you consult. An especially good discussion of plain rice cookery can be found in John Thorne's book `A Pot on the Fire'. Another minor rice gaff is when Ms. Lemlin says arborio rice is very short grained. I believe it is actually a medium length rice. Still very good for risotto of course.<br /> As this book has some 300 recipes and can be bought for less than $12 dollars, I consider this a great bargain, considering the quality of the recipes. For the hard cover at $30, I would give it only 4 stars. For the paperback, I give it the full five!of water should decrease as the amount of rice increases.

Before having read both books, I was sure Beard was deservedly at the pinnacle of American culinary expertise and influence. I now believe that position belongs to Julia Child, who, with her two French colaborators, was almost entirely responsible for the text of their books, unlike Beard, who employed a sizeable number of ghost writers in much the same way that 'Martha Stewart' is more of a brand for a team effort than itis the identity of a single worker. At the same time, one can easily trace the rebirth of interest in things culinary by the conjunction of Childs books and early PBS shows with the advent of the Kennedy White House French Chef hired by Jackie Kennedy. I also have an enormous respect for Child in comparison to Beard for scrupulously avoiding product endorsements and other commercial entanglements.<br />I know this book was written without the active cooperation of Ms. Child, and I believe it shows. The author had access to all of Child's papers and correspondence and, I'm sure, interviewed a large number of Child's friends and colleagues. This makes me yearn to read Julia's own memoir. Until that is available, this will do just fine.	2003-11-07

I began baking from it just because it was my latest book on baking. Then, I began toing to it when the results of baking recipies found in other books did not pan out as well as I expected. It was also directly responsible for my acquiring a heavy duty KitchenAid stand mixer, although I was able to quite successfully do recipes involving some heavy duty dough even without the mixer. But, the mixer did make it easier.<br />One of the primary lessons I learned from my comparing recipes in this book to other books is that these recipes are fully up to professional bakers' standards. No dumbing down here. My best evidence is when I tried making cinnamon buns using two other recipies and the results were simply inferior to what one could buy from Entenmens at the supermarket I then made the same product using the Child recipe and I produced definitely superior results.<br />Please be aware that these recipes were not developed by Julia Child and Julia Child did not write the book. This does not detract from the quality of the book, just the quality of the credit. The writer, Dorrie Greenspan, has done several other books on baking, all with a very high quality. Julia's collaborators, all major talents in baking, include such stars as Nick Malgieri, do nothing but increase the value of the volume.<br />This book is at it's best as an introduction to all the different types of baking for a person who has time to deal with the finer points of baking things like artisnal breads and sticky buns. Yes, a stand mixer is recommended.	2003-11-07

It is also much more about olive oil than it is about the fruit, especially since commerce in the oil dwarfs trade in the fruit. Aside from it's being especially well written, it benefits most from it's being written entirely from a first person point of view. Aside from references to selected European Union regulations and documents, all of the text relates conversations between the author and his subjects, the olive growing farmers of the Mediterranian and California. The story starts in the author's own home where he himself raises olives in a small farm in Provence, France. From there, the story travels to other Provencal olive groves, Italy, Spain, Morroco, Greece, and Israel / Palestine.<br />  The book provides a wealth of information for your understanding of olives, olive growing, and the production of olive oil. The most interesting aspects of this story were the domination of olive oil commerce by Italian firms, in spite of the fact that Spain is the world's largest producer of olives and the differences between various methods of extracting oil and how these different processes may affect the quality of the oil.<br />  This book is a very good read, especially for foodies. Just don't expect much information about the culinary and nutritional values of olive oil. There are other books dedicated to olive oil which cover this very well.	2003-11-07

Wolfert is one of the most distinguished cookbook writers of the last 50 years, certainly of the era which began with the publication of Julia Child's `Mastering the Art of French Cooking' in 1962. Wolfert is easily in the very select group which includes Diana Kennedy, Marcella Hazan, and Richard Olney, and only slightly less stellar than Child and Elizabeth David. That said, my focus in the review is to find anything which would detract from giving this new book five (5) stars and be done with it.<br />Wolfert's primary objective in her books is to give recipes true to their ethnic roots and methods, yet present them in a way so that they may be recreated in American kitchens with ingredients available from the local megamart. This involves some compromises, mostly with the selection of equipment. One does not need a fire pit or a tangine to do these recipes, but one does need several ingredients which may not be available locally. The book, of course, provides internet sources for such ingredients.<br />The author's focus in this volume is to present recipes from her area of specialization, the Mediterranian, including Spanish, Provencal, Italian, Slavic, Greek, Turkish, Levantine, and Moroccan dishes, devoting all her space to recipes which require a substantial amount of time to prepare, cook, or `age'. She presents at least three rationales for this focus. The first is that she, and presumably her audience, find it very relaxing and pleasurable to participate in this type of cooking. The second is a tie-in to the Slow Food movement centered in Europe. This is specifically a reaction to American fast food sources and specifically to the opening of a MacDonald's at the base of the Spanish Steps in Rome. More information on this can certainly be found on related web sites. A third reason is the large tolerances of slow cooking methods. There is a much larger margin for error when doing a 3 hour braize than when doing a 3 minute saute. This means that less experienced chefs who simply cannot manage a crepe or a scallopine can shine with a vegetable stew or a poached fish.<br />Slow cooking does not always mean a long time on the fire. For fish or fowl, it can mean a long time marinading. For salads, it can mean a long time after mixing for flavors to mix.<br />I made several recipes from this book and found them all perfectly satisfactory and delicious. Of the many recipes I read, I found very few confusing instructions. At one time, I would have been willing to withhold a star for poor recipe directions until I started finding at least one occurrence in practically every cookbook I read, including some from some very promenant authors. Based on my very limited knowledge of Mediterranian cuisines, I can only say I found Paula Wolfert as true to her sources as she has always been. It should be mentioned that Wolfert is not limiting herself to traditional dishes. Many of her dishes have been created by contemporary Mediterranian chefs. Her primary allegiance is to location, methods, and ingredients, not to history.<br />Note that this is definitely not California Cuisine. Vegetable dishes especially are cooked to the point where soft vegetables literally disintegrate into a background sauce. The result is still delicious.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who loves to cook new things; has the time to devote to finding the ingredients and making the preparations; and has a love for the flavors of the Mediterranian outside the well worn Italian and Provencal cuisines. I also recommend the price. Full retail price is very reasonable by today's standardsdoing a 3 hour braize than when doing a 3 minute saute.

911203:US	39134375	R1J2ZWOVTYMOAT	0316085669	330870900	James Beard's American Cookery	Books	5	47	51	N	N	The Classic American Cuisine	I'm reluctant to praise the memory of James Beard for producing this excellent cookbook, as it is well known that he employed ghost writers and assistants, including Marian Cunningham and Barbara Kafka, who have since gained promenance in their own right as cookbook authors. Even such a Beard fan as Jeremiah Tower states that there may be very few of his books which he actually wrote himself. That being said, let me state that this is an excellent general purpose cookbook which should be on every American cook's shelf even in preference to some newer, trendier titles.<br />There are two things which most clearly distinguish this volume. The first is that many of the recipes and supplementary text in this volume are superior to Beard's (sic) presentation of the same recipe in his other titles, even when the other titles specialize in a particular ingredient or method. I find, for example, his chicken recipes much more detailed in the general book than in the volume `Beard on Birds'. The second reason for having this book is that a very large number of the recipes are relatively simple to prepare using very easily acquired ingredients. There are hunderds of recipes which can be prepared cheaply and, with a little searching, there are hundreds of recipes which can be prepared quickly. James Beard was very `old school'.<br />One word of warning is necessary. While Beard is not as spare in his descriptions as Elizabeth David, he is also not as full of details as Julia Child, who basically changed the entire style of American recipe writing, including the style of James Beard to some extent. There are times when Beard does assume some basic cooking knowledge, although there are fewer assumptions here than in lesser volumes.	2003-11-06

He explicitly sides with Jeremiah Tower's version of the origins of California cuisine, versus the version whereby most of the credit is given to Chez Panisse in general and Alice Waters in particular. Were it not for his obvious respect for M.F.K. Fisher, Paula Wolfert, and Elaine Whitelaw, I would suspect him of the same misogeny I detected in Tower's memoirs.<br />His memoir, `Between Bites' is one of the first books of essays on the culinary I have read and for that I owe to Mr. Villas my introduction to the importance of M. F. K. Fisher, Richard Olney, Elizabeth David, and Paula Wolfert as fellow writers in culinary journalism and education. For this I am very grateful. Villas also devotes sizeable chapters to Craig Claiborne, Paul Bocuse, Beard, and his mother, with whom he co-wrote two cookbooks. This was also the first book which really filled out for me the importance of Craig Claiborne to American culinary opinion when Claiborne was in his prime. For a second, similar opinion on Claiborne, see Jaques Pepin's memoir `The Apprentice'.<br />I did find it a bit surprising that he had very kind words about Emril Lagasse and less than kind words about Wolfgang Puck. As Emril embodies the old New Orleans / Comander's Palace cuisine and Wolfgang embraces a version of the `California Cuisine', this tends to confirm my view of his `old school' orientation. I'm sure this had nothing to do with the fact that Emril provided a glowing blurb for the back of the book's dust jacket.<br />In addition to profiles of culinary luminaries, he recalls the story of how he arrived at his profession and his position as a columist at the magazine `Town and Country' and a delightful story of how he worked as a table captain (waiter) at Chicago's Le Perroquet for a week. Very droll and very informative. He also includes one or more recipes in each chapter, from which I made southern buttermilk buscuits on at least a dozen different occasions. This biscuit recipe, especially made with White Lily flour and homemade baking power is very good, but, I suspect, not the very best. When I switched to Nick Malgieri's recipe which replaced shortening with butter, I found the results distinctly better. Maybe Villas was being kind by replacing lard with vegetable shortening.<br />This is an excellent read and I was sorry when I reached the last page.iter) at Chicago's Le Perroquet for a week.

The only real connection between this premise and the rest of the book is that all the recipes, from apple pie on down, are past or present American classics. Many of these recipes have fallen into obscurity such as indian pudding, but all are `red, white, and blue'. I suppose one could be cynical about the tie-in between baking and flag-waving, but Brachman pulls it all off with great good humor and a good story behind every recipe.<br />The book covers pies and tarts; cobblers, buckles, pan dowdys, etc; cakes; puddings and custards; doughnuts; cookies, brownies, and bars; ice creams; and sauces. True to it's title, it covers no type of baking other than sweets and covers no species of desserts which are clearly associated with another nationality. No Sachertorts here! He may be stretching it a bit when he includes tarts, although I am very glad he did. It is the first time I have read that there is a definite difference between a tart dough and a conventional pie dough. The latter aspires to being light and flaky, since it has no need to support any weight and is typically kept in a pie pan while being cut and served. The former is built so it's vertical wall can stand alone without the support of a pan. While Wayne admits that tarts have a distinctly French accent, all the fillings are purely Yankee Doodle.<br />In spite of the light tone of the historical commentary, the pastry techniques described herein are rock solid. This book would not be out of place as a textbook for a course on dessert baking. A corollary of this is that there is no attempt to make this a book of easy recipes. Pie and tart doughs are not easy, but Brachman gives you all the steps plus some general techniques the professionals use to `divide and conquer' complicated work. This would also be a great book to start a young baker out on serious techniques with the aim of achieving professional results.<br />There are a modest number of photographs and all are useful. No fluff here. One may have wished to see just a few more to, for example, demonstrate the French tart method called fraisage. Having a Pennsylvania Dutch background, the only place I detected some lapse in the text was in the discussion of funnel cakes. The batter recipe does not fit my experience and Wayne has the batter dispensed using a piping bag. I'm sure that is how a New Yorker would do it, but in Lancaster County, they use a funnel. Nicht Wahr!.<br />A very worthy book, especially for the price, for the casual baker and the amateur baker who wishes to learn more basic techniques.t Brachman gives you all the steps plus some general techniques the professionals use to `divide and conquer' complicated work.

While the book has some of the ingredients which would comprise such a work, it is actually a book of recipes from his three restaurants hung on a rather thin framework of the day in the life of a major restaurant kitchen.<br />The framework text can be read in less than an hour and contains several errors in punctuation and word usage which a copy editor should have corrected. The design of the text presentation is equally poor. There are shifts in font to signify changes in topic or voice. Some pages of text look like something out of Alice in Wonderland or Monty Python with staggered letters and words and poor choices of text / background color contrasts. Very difficult to read, what little of it there is.<br />As in some other recipe books I've seen, a minority of the photographs display the food and it's preparation while the majority of the photographs show restaurant workers and celebrity friends of Chef Daniel hamming it up for the camera.<br />This leaves the recipes. In 234 pages, there are a scant 80 recipes, all of which are presented as being from one of Boulud's restaurants, and, most are indeed recipes one would not likely make at home. There is a high incidence of unusual and expensive ingredients such as pig's head, and some downright bizarre, such as piballes worms. Many of the recipes are also very long in the preparation. Unlike every other cookbook I have reviewed up until now, I did not bother to actually make any of the recipes therein, as it was apparent that except for a few, mostly breads and desserts, these were not the kind of dishes the average person would make, even for entertaining. (This is not typical of restaurant cookbooks, as I find no difficulty making many of the recipes in Mario Batali's Babbo cookbook.) A good case in point is the db hamburger made with truffles, foie gras, and comfit, oh my.<br />Most recipes include a wine recommendation giving a specific vineyard and year, about which I can have no opinion except that it does nothing to enhance the value of the book for me. A type of wine such as `chardonnay' or `merlot' would have been quite good enough. I will give a small nod to their wine recommendation of `beer' for some of the dishes.<br />The book includes a list of sources, a requirement for these recipes with many unusual ingredients.<br />In all, I think the only value to purchasing this book is if one wishes to dine at one or more of Daniel Boulud's restaurants often and wish to know what goes into his stuff or, if one wishes to create a restaurant menu very similar to Boulud's fare. One may find some value to looking through this book at a library if one wants to research variations on a particular recipe.<br />In sum, recipes may be good, but there are too few and the presentation is poor.

I have always had the greatest respect for Jacques Pepin based on the high reputation of his culinary books, collaborations with Julia Child, and great good humor and skills displayed on various television appearances, but I have always wondered how he reached a position of high respect within his profession without a connection to a major restaurant for at least as long as I have known of him (the last 15 years). This book answers my question and a whole lot more, confirming my impression of Jacques as a major figure in culinary America and a great gentleman as well.<br />  Without giving away too much of the book's story, I must point out that Jacques was, by some great good fortune, the chef to France's President Charles DeGaulle at a very young age. In fact, he appeared on the TV show `To Tell The Truth' and the panelists did not pick him as DeGaulle's chef because he was so very young. Upon coming to the United States, he quickly attained a position as a line chef under Pierre Franey at the great Le Pavillion, following Franey to a position in the test and development kitchens at Howard Johnson's. For those of you post baby boomers, I can assure you from first hand experience that at one time, Howard Johnson's was often considered a very desirable place to eat out.<br />  Jacques would probably now be the owner / executive chef at a major restaurant but for a very serious automobile accident which broke most major bones and which left Jacques with only a slim chance to even be able to walk. Miraculously, he mended well to the point where he returned to an almost normal life, but without the ability to sustain the 12 to 14 hours on his feet at a typical chef's station. This lead to his career as a teacher, followed by cookbook writing and TV cooking series a la Julia on PBS.<br />  This book ranks with some of the best culinary memoirs by being both engaging, inspiring, and revealing of the nature of culinary professionals' work in the kitchen. Aside from his associations with Julia Child and Pierre Franey, he was a close friend to Craig Claiborne and well known to James Beard and his company. Without doing any gratuitous name dropping, Pepin also relates revealing stories involving Danny Kaye, Alice Waters and `the great' Paul Bocuse. This is not the first Danny Kaye culinary story I have read, and these little peeks into his cooking skills make me wish he had done a culinary memoir / cookbook similar to many less skillful non-culinary celebrities. The encounter with Paul Bocuse casts some light on the nature of the nouvelle cuisine movement in France.<br />  One of the most interesting insights obtained from this book is the picture of the American culinary scene in 1960, as seen by a very experienced and talented French chef and how this scene has changed in the last 40 years.<br />  I heartily recommend this book to anyone with a taste for culinary memoirs. This is one of the best. My only reservation is that it left me wanting more, as it seemed to give very few details about the last 20 years of his life.

This culinary memoir is the least informative and certainly the least inspiring of all I have read, but it is not without some merit within this genre. The most important warning to the reader going into this volume is that Jerimiah Tower has an AGENDA. The primary items of this AGENDA are to demonstrate how important HE was to defining California cuisine and how chummy he has been with the movers and shakers of late 20th century US culinary scene.<br />To dispense with the latter item first, there is no question that Master Tower could be considered a James Beard prot&eacute;g&eacute; and did have close relations to Jim Villas, Jonathan Waxman, Julia Child, Wolfgang Puck and (the great) Mario Batali. However, there is a very long list of culinary stars, itemized in another review of this volume, whose name appears in this book simply to enhance one's opinion of the author by his seeming association with these luminaries. Three (of many) striking examples is his mentioning Jamie Oliver, Nigella Lawson, and Emril Lagasse, with whom he has no professional connection. In spite of the fact that he mentions Mario twice in his text and includes a picture of he and Mario, there is no information on their contact, even though Mario did work at Stars. A similar clue to the chronic name dropping is the appearance of a Barbra Streisand photo in the book, with no mention of her whatsoever in the text.<br />The first and more promenant item in Master Tower's agenda is his promoting the notion that he was instrumental in promoting what has become known as California cuisine. The first shot in making this case is in the prologue where he describes a luncheon prepared for 100 culinary journalists in Newport Rhode Island in 1983 where, by chance, he and his colleague chefs had to prepare the lunch in the open, on grills, in full view of the attending writers. They were impressed, of course, and began to identify the style there used as something distinct, the California cuisine. One main theme running through the book is the fact that he was as important, if not more important in establishing Chez Panisse as the fountainhead of the California style. I believe it is common knowledge that Alice Waters is a bit stingy in sharing credit for the Chez Panisse reputation past and present. I am looking forward to reading Alice's point of view, and even more, to reading some third party discussion of this scene. One minor item I would really like cleared up was who, Wolfgang Puck or Chez Panisse, was the first to stick a pizza crust in the oven with a California twist to it's toppings.<br />I find it strange that in this book there is no clear statement about what the California Cuisine doctrine is and how it is differentiated from earlier American  cooking or from French cuisine, especially from Nouvelle Cuisine. Near the end of the book, he itemizes the tenants of nouvelle cuisine as:<br />- Hand raised ingredients<br />- Bought that morning<br />- Cooked at the last minute<br />- Eaten in season<br />- Based on local ingredients<br />- No longer using elaborate old style French sauces<br />So, how is California Cuisine different from this? Also, as the author cites himself, some of these principles were followed by major American restruants, at least in part, as long as 100 years ago (See reference to Delmonico's truck garden in New Jersey in the 19th century).<br />Tower also assumes some credit for making available a wider range of ingredients in the nation's supermarkets. I have it on relatively good authority that this trend begain in the early sixtys driven by Julia Child and the coincidental advent of French cooking in the White House under the Kennedys. A small irony I would enjoy researching some day is that, on the one hand, the use of locally available ingredients is touted while the restauranteurs are literally creating new local ingredients by enlisting local producers to start growing things they have not grown before.<br />A minor theme detected in the book was, I believe, a bit of misogeny. Aside from a justifiable effort to acquire some of the credit for Chez Panisse, Tower appear to be generally cool to at least two other major female figures, Julia Child and Paula Wolfert, in American culinary growth. To be fair, he is very decent in his treatment of Elizabeth David, primarily as one of the wellsprings of influence behing Chez Panisse.<br />My interest in culinary memoirs is primarily to answer the question `Why do people get into this business, with it's very long hours and modest pay?' Tower does little to answer the question and typically makes the profession look even less attractive than what I have described. Unlike several other memoirs, the book contains no recipes, just menus. I missed this. It would have gone a long way to describing exactly what the book was really meant to be about. The recipes make it look as if California cuisine is nothing more than French methods applied to Napa valley produce.<br />The bibliography is a very useful addition to the knowledge of literary foodies.

The primary object of this genre is to provide good recipies in an entertaining manner from a wide variety of cuisines. This book generally succeeds on all these counts, with some reservations.<br />Please be careful to note that this book is not and does not claim to be a teaching text. One will probably not get the full benefit from this book if they are a complete novice. This being true, the brief sections at the beginning of the book on kitchenware and pantry items are probably misleading. Whole books are devoted to these subjects. Tyler cannot hope to cover these subjects effectively in a few pages.<br />While there are some recipes in this book which are fairly simple, there are also many which are quite complicated. Take, for example, the Philly Cheese Steak. Pat's Steaks in South Philly can knock out a cheese steak in 10 to  15 minutes. Tyler's recipe will take an amateur chef at least 90 minutes, requiring the preparation of two different sauces. For best results it also requires a specific Italian Ciabatta bread and Italian Fontina cheese. The other side of the coin is that the results are spectacular. Pay special attention to the time from shopping bag to dinner plate given for each recipe. He's not kidding, and almost all recipes need an hour or more. This feature a major plus and fits the primary purpose of the book as a source for amateur cooks to find new and interesting recipes to entertain or have fun with.<br />Also, I would take the statements about simple ingredients with a grain of salt. I have yet to find a local source for Kaffir lime leaves and fresh or whole dried lemongrass and I am skeptical about availability of some other ingredients if one does not have access to a good oriental market. A corollary to this situation is the fact that these are not budget recipes. They are also not specifically aimed at being low fat, low calorie, or high healthy. This is not to say they are bad for you. I will wager that almost all of these recipes will be healthier for you than any typical fare from a fast food outlet. Just don't bother trying to count calories. Have fun with the recipes and eat small portions if you are watching your weight.<br />Tyler dutifully subscribes to the `fresh ingredients' mantra, to which I have no argument, as long as you are aware of the implications and alternatives. There is no question that you really should use fresh herbs in certain cases such as parsley, basil, cilantro, and dill. Dried alternatives are simply a pale shadow of the fresh herb and at least three out of four of these herbs are reletively inexpensive and available the year around. Tyler, however, specifies fresh herbs for practically everything, including thyme, rosemary, and marjoram. These fresh herbs are expensive and not always available. Also, the dried forms of these herbs are as good or sometimes even better than their fresh counterparts, especially when ground and added at the beginning of cooking. Just be sure when using dried herbs and spices, that you buy the whole form and grind or mash the material at the last minute. The most dramatic example of this is nutmeg.<br />I find the style of recipe writing to be competent, with two concerns. First, Tyler seems to have subscribed to the Jamie Oliver school of measuring, where the amounts of many ingredients, especially things like cooking oils and seasonings are not stated exactly. This is fine for an individual's style of cooking and does reflect the fact that many ingredients are added to taste, but this is not good communication! One person's `1 count of peanut oil' may be three times larger than the next person's. Just as one always gives a test for doneness as well as giving an expected cooking time, I would much prefer the old teaspoons and tablespoons to `glugs and counts'. Second, I have found lapses in the proper sequencingof steps. There are times when Tyler gets things out of order, even though much of his text makes a great effort to sequence carefully, there are some slip ups. Otherwise, the recipe writing is very chatty, filled with tips on technique to get the best results, however, the background material which makes this type of book fun to read is a little thin.<br />I would recommend this book to an amateur chef who buys the occasional cookbook to make their meals more interesting and who is not afraid of complicated, time-consuming preparations and who is not adverse to some pricy ingredients. Note that there is some overlap to Tyler's TV shows, but not so much that it makes one feel the book has nothing to offer.There are times when Tyler gets things out of order, even though much of his text makes a great effort to sequence carefully, there are some slip ups.

I confess that this background makes it almost impossible for me to give the book less than five (5) stars, although I will cite some weaknesses in a generally very worthy book.<br />`jamie's kitchen' is primarily a celebrity chef cookbook where the celebrity is a practicing chef like Mario Batali and Bobby Flay, however there is no distinct connection between the recipes in the book and Jamie's restaurant `15'. Rather, I've seen many dishes done on his Food Network show `Oliver's Twist' appearing in this book. There is also no systematic connection between the contents of the book and the Food Network special of the same name; however, there are some recipes and demonstrations of techniques, which appear in both. Note that unlike Jamie's various TV presentations, all units are in Imperial units (pounds and ounces and Fahrenheit and so on) however one does have to translate teaspoon from the term dessert spoon.<br />Overlaid on the typical celebrity chef content is a outline of a cooking course covering common cooking methods such as salads, `cooking without heat', poaching, boiling, steaming, en papillote, stewing, braising, frying (pan and deep), roasting (pot and pan), broiling, grilling, and baking (bread and pastry). As an outline and presentation of exemplars for major culinary methods, this book is very good; however, it should not be accepted as a complete cooking textbook. (I would not rule out a talented instructor's using this book as a supplementary text, but it is still not in the same league as excellent texts by Madeline Kamen, Anne Willen, or the Culinary Institute of America). Another clue that this is CANNOT be taken as a textbook is Jamie's aversion to exact measurements. A text could never be as imprecise. That said, I give high marks to the photographic demonstrations of several basic cooking techniques such as filleting a flatfish, making a basic bread dough, chopping and slicing, pasta making, and blanching tomatoes.<br />Thus, the primary value of the book lies with the quality of the recipes and the usefulness of the recipes to the buyer. I believe the overall quality of the recipes is very high, and, personally, I found the choice of recipes to be very, very good. There is the expected influence of Italian cuisine in many of the recipes; however, there are also distinctly oriental overtones in many of the recipes, especially in the salads. I was especially delighted to find a relatively simple recipe for Chinese steamed pork dumplings. The recipe for this dish presented by a Martha Stewart guest took three pages (I am not so naïve to believe that the results of the simple version will have all the virtues of the more truly ethnic recipe, but the point is that the simpler essay on a classic preparation will enhance your appreciation of the more complicated, more ethnicly accurate presentation.) The section on bread is basically an introduction to Italian breadmaking and an excellent introduction to breadmaking in general. The basic dough is simpler, for example, than many common white bread recipes with the added virtue of not requiring a stand mixer to obtain a decent result.<br />My take on celebrity chef cookbooks is that their primary object is to enhance one's enjoyment of cooking by breathing life into old recipes and presenting an interesting range of new options to the reader. A perfect example of this object for me was the description of poaching beef fillets in red wine. Up to now, cooking expensive beef in a water-based medium seemed to border on sinful. Jamie makes it all make sense at the cost of a decent bottle of red wine. This is also the perfect illustration of the fact that celebrity chef cookbooks are not aboutcheap or fast or easy. Jamie give the game away on `easy' when he demonstrates a technique which he confesses took him several days to master.<br /> Jamie's talent reminds me of a description of Robin Williams. Translated from comedy to the culinary, I find Tyler Florence (for example) to be a very talented chef, but Jamie Oliver is a force of nature. His enthusiasm for the skillful preparation of good ingredients into masterful food is communicated as effectively from the printed page as it is from the TV screen. This communication is assisted by the excellent photography framed in the oversize dimensions of the volume.<br />While the book is less than perfect, few of the blemishes warrant a pass on this volume if you are looking for the rewards that such celebrity chef cookbooks have to offer. A major consideration in buying this book is it's cost. Luckily, I am certain that the book will be available at a discount from practically any outlet. The concern about the cost is inflated by the fact that the size of the book hides the fact that more than a few large pages are taken up by photographs of people, mostly Jamie, in artsy poses against gritty backdrops. These enhance the coffee table character of the book. A little game one may try is to find the picture of Jamie which contains a picture of Jamie and Jools. Very droll. The positive aspect of the photography has already been noted above. Not every culinary book with full color photos of food does as well as this one in using them to complement the words in the recipes. This is a must for Jamie Oliver fans.fast or easy.

Books in this class are most useful to people who are already reasonably good cooks and use such books as a resource to broaden their range without having to buy a large number of cookbooks. The `celebrity chef' source for these books should be a reasonable assurance that the book's recipes will be well crafted. In satisfying this objective, this volume succeeds very well.<br />First, the book contains recipes from a wide range of cuisines with a totally predictable distribution. Out of the advertised 160 recipes, I count 19 Italian, 10 Mexican, 7 Japanese/Chinese, 6 Thai/Vietnamese, 5 French, 4 Greek/Mediterranean, 4 Southwestern/Tex-Mex, 4 Cajun/Creole, 3 Central European, and 2 South American. This count is based entirely on the country name in the title of the recipe or a distinctly Italian, French, Spanish, etc. name of dish or ingredient (Challah, for example is Yiddish and is counted as a central European dish). The potato, cheese, and egg breakfast dish may have a Spanish origin, but I didn't dig that deeply. You get the idea.<br />Second, the book contains sections on breakfast, sandwiches, breads, and desserts. One or more of these subjects are often missing from this type of book. Including them reinforces the value of the book as a source for entertaining and `having fun with food'.<br />Third, I find the recipes very sophisticated, worthy of something found in `Cooks Illustrated' or `Good Eats'. The recipe for foccacia, for example, is very careful to start with a sponge, which is allowed to bloom for 30 minutes. No short cuts here. Another example is in the biscuit recipe which adds butter in two different ways to enhance both flakiness and tenderness. I'm impressed. The score here isn't perfect. I detected a less than ideal recipe for Snickerdoodles cookies. None of this should be surprising. These recipes come from a demanding kitchen environment where they are prepared often, with some amount of experimentation and analysis to present them on Food Network shows.<br />Fourth, the discounted price is right. My giving four (4) stars is based on a price of 23 dollars or less. The list price of about 30 dollars is too much for 160 recipes.<br />Fifth, there are very few exotic ingredients required, in spite of the diversity of the sources. It does require lemon grass, but does not require Kafir lime leaves or Aleppo pepper. Similarly, there are few overly complicated recipes and several which are fairly simple. However, this is NOT a `fast and easy' book. I suspect that most novice cooks would find most of the recipes in this book somewhat involved. This is consistant with the fact that the authors did a good job of presenting interesting recipes which give professional quality results. All the dishes I prepared were very successful.<br />So why didn't I give this five (5) stars? The main reason is that the book tries to do more than it can possibly do well in 281 pages. It also does not do one thing which this `celebrity chef' class of book commonly does: give us a nice story or background to make each dish more interesting and make us want to read through the whole book. The book does not include an estimated preparation time make ahead tips. This is why I make the point of saying this book is best for a cook with experience. The misdirected effort is in the `essentials' chapter of 14 pages which gives a page or two on subjects which can each fill large books. A sentence referring the reader to books on technique by Jaques Pepin or James Peterson would have been much better. Also, of the advertised 300 photographs, only about half do justice to the food. Many are pictures of the food network staff at work. Many pictures of the food aretoo close or too far away. The photographs do not significantly enhance the value of the book. Some background stories however about Mario or Sara or Emril would have been great fun, especially if they connected the recipe to the show. If getting permission to include such material was too much to ask, then stories on how they worked up the recipes would have been neat. A missed opportunity, I think.r too far away.

In many ways, this is the book I expected to find when I looked at AB's Cook's Notes volume, but there are still many reasons to warn potential buyers to look before they leap. In my opinion, the book looses one star for costing 22 bucks for about 12 dollars worth of material, most of which can be found in other sources. The book looses a second star for not filling my expectations for completeness of the material. The table of substitutions, for example, did not have the first three things I looked for, that being buttermilk (!!!), creme fraiche, and Aleppo pepper. I may forgive the last, even though it does appear as a common ingredient in at least three recent cookbooks, but no BUTTERMILK. At least two culinary reference books in my library have substitutions for buttermilk and creme fraiche, not including the Larousse Gastronomique. The book looses a third star for, like the Cooks Notes volume, not being loose leaf bound. The book lost a few points for me when the generally very good diagrams of meat cuts from cows, pigs, and sheep did not include any reference to what Mario Batali calls the fifth quarter, being things like heart, liver, kidneys, sweet breads and (my favorite) guanciale. I have this fantasy that the only thing keeping AB from having his picture on the cover of Gourmet magazine is that he has not, like Mario, done a show on guanciale (pig's jowls). Unlike the Cooks Notes volume, I would not dismiss this volume totally. If you the prospective buyer have no other culinary reference and are inclined to own everything you can with AB's name on it, then I would not want to stop you. But please page through it before laying down your 23 bucks! Otherwise, save your money for a more complete volume such as the Williams Sonama 'Kitchen Companion' volume.	2003-10-02

If Alton Brown saw this book at his local megamart, he would not buy it for all the reasons he recommends people go to hardware stores and restaurant supply stores to buy less expensive and more functional versions of high priced items. Do not buy this item. It is not a ?book?. It is simply a blank book with AB?s brand recognition mug on the cover. Must be the former advertising producer coming out. You will be much better served by going to the local office supply superstore and purchasing a small, inexpensive three (3) ring binder and a 3 ring hole punch to punch holes in all the recipes you download from the internet.<br />If AB really wanted to sell something for your 15 bucks, he would have:<br />1. Made it loose leaf bound instead of spiral bound, so that you could buy additional blank pages at the aforementioned office supply superstore, or even at the local drugstore.<br />2. Included a comprehensive set of unit of measure conversion tables.<br />3. Included tables of cooking methods and times for a wide variety of meats and vegetables. A perfect tie-in to the organization of the book whose success this item is milking.<br />4. Included tables of various flours and grains,  and the things for which they are best used. For example, the best applications of: Bread flour, all purpose flour, cake flour, whole wheat flour etc. Similar things could be done for beans and lentils.<br />5. Included checklists of the best dry and fresh spices and herbs to keep on hand and the time it is safe to store them. The list should indicate which are best used fresh and which are quite acceptable used dry. Most sources, for example say that dry basil is a very poor substitute for the fresh herb while dry thyme is quite acceptable for almost all applications. A selected list of internet spice dealers would be peachy here as well.<br />I think AB should attone for this shameless marketing ploy by doing a ?Good Eats? show on how to economically store kitchen notes and recipes. If Martha Stewart can do it, I?m sure he can do an even better job.tewart can do it, I?m sure he can do an even better job.	2003-09-15

The tabulation of types of `Pots and Pans' materials, their advantages, disadvantages, and relative costs. This chapter alone is worth the price of admission. This section will not save you money except for its advice on non-stick pans. All sources I've seen from Mario Batali to AB agree on not spending a lot for Teflon ® lined pans, except be sure to get them with oven proof handles for making frittatas.<br />2. The thoughtful discussion of knife design and how different design features are important, or not important for different cutting tasks. This section will save you money, unless you are a knife freak.<br />3. The discussion of most major types of gear, which give you the features you should find most desirable. You may not agree with AB's choices, but he tells you how to make the choice which is best for you.<br />4. The essay on kitchen sanitation. This is one of many areas where the home cook can learn from professional chefs' practice. I'll bet that even Martha Stewart is not as careful as Alton recommends, and I plan to begin following his recommendations immediately. Note that one can make a little game of finding all the oblique references to Martha Stewart in the book. I've found four (4).<br />5. The explanation of accuracy versus precision in evaluating measuring devices, especially weighing devices. Being a former chemist, I would argue that AB gives too little credit to the role of the balance, although I concede that using it in the kitchen does require both extra space and special knowledge the average chef may not have.<br />To the book's credit, it has a wealth of references to actual makes and models, while I have detected no bias to any one manufacturer, in spite of some gratuitous general kudos to OXO. AB's opinions are based on a thorough and thoughtful use of kitchen tools over many years, so his opinions are much better than your Aunt Ida, no matter how good her apple pie may be. However, I take some with a grain of salt. I would not dismiss springform pans unless I heard both Maida Heatter and Nick Malgieri gave them up.<br />Another minor nit I would pick is in his use of the term multitasking. In computer science, where the word was born, it means the ability to do two things in parallel, not two different things in series! I would especially disagree with some of the uses to which he puts a rolling pin, as some secondary uses may lead to nicks which may harbor microbeasties and impair it function. The solution of sanding said roller may give it an uneven shape. Tsk Tsk.<br />This book is much better than his first, since it addresses in a comprehensive way a subject which is only dealt with in a very piecemeal way by any other source, including Cooks Illustrated.
