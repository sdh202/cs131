It is also the novel where Brady first meets the character he becomes rather obsessed with throughout other novels Linda Manning.  Unlike most classic Brady novels of yesteryear this novel is not set in cold war Eastern Europe so you do not even have to imagine that the cold war has not ended or imagine and substitute a more modern foe of the West for the setting.  Away With Murder has Brady taking up what he is told will be a simple assignment of delivering a first edition algebra textbook from London to Amsterdam.  All seems to be going smoothly until he finds two men in his hotel room who want him to take a drive with them and won't take no for an answer.<br /><br />Previously I would have said Blind Date was my favourite Brady adventure but Away with Murder would have to at least tie if not beat it.  Pattinson writes in an old man style where his characters use words that show Pattinson is obviously from a previous generation and not quite down with the lingo of today but this style does add something unique and enjoyable to his novels.  High quality Pattinson novels worth your time and money are The Silent Voyage, Skeleton Island, The Time of Your Life, Blind Date, The Murmansk Assignment, Obituary for Howard Grey, Crane, The Animal Gang, Spoilers, The Golden Reef and Life Preserver.	2005-10-13

There are a lot less surreal Carl Hiaasen style characters and Box seems to be moving more in the direction of far fetched fantasy land solutions then stuff that could occur to anyone in every day life.  It's not a bad read and fans of the Joe Pickett and his family characters may well get something out of it but hopefully C.J. Box will return to the real world for his next novel.<br /><br />Cattle and other animals are being found mutilated with surgical precision around Saddlestring, Wyoming. The lazy cops are quick to blame a grizzly bear who has ventured from his national park.  Joe Picket of course knows that a bear could not leave the corpses like they are being found and when human corpses start to join the list he has a wall to overcome in convincing the task force assigned that the bear, birds or any other wildlife aren't the killers.  Meanwhile Cleve Garrett heavily funded by secret backers has been following the mutilations all over the country and is trying to convince Joe that aliens are responsible.	2005-10-08

Once again approached by Linda Manning, a woman he can not seem to get over to perform a job for her employers.  She is no longer employed by the British Secret Service but her new employer Adsum although not revealed to Brady what they actually do seem to be into the same sort of work. Of course as much as Brady tells himself he doesn't want to go he cannot say no to Linda and this time his assignment is to accompany her to Paraguay as her translator. Who knows he thinks, he might get lucky with Linda while there. In Paraguay Brady quickly realises this mission is just as dangerous as his cold war era ones.<br /><br />Old Pals Act is certainly not Pattinson's best work but it is not a bad adventure either.  It unnecessarily does go into quite a bit of detail of previous novels such as Blind Date, The Antwerp Assignment and other novels that have featured Steve Brady as he reminisces about his previous assignments and times with Linda so if you're planning on reading those great novels I'd check them out first.<br /><br />Pattinson writes in an old man style where his characters use words that show Pattinson is obviously from a previous generation and not quite down with the lingo of today but this style does add something unique and enjoyable to his novels.

The Silver Tassie, the boat he is travelling on is cut in half by a speeding Russian ship in a dense fog and only Manning and another Englishman named Grill manage to board the Russian ship before it speeds away. Although they are treated well onboard the Russian ship it soon becomes apparent they will never be aloud to leave and are nothing more than prisoners who know too much and will spend the rest of their days in a Russian jail as the rest of the world has already classified them as dead men lost at sea with the rest of the crew of the Silver Tassie.<br /><br />Pattinson writes in an old man style where his characters use words that show Pattinson is obviously from a previous generation and not quite down with the lingo of today but this style does add something unique and enjoyable to his novels.

David Morrell's Creepers is definitely a can't put down until the final page, forget sleep, work, TV and everything else read.  Granted you can predict some facts before they are revealed, but that doesn't mean you aren't sitting on the edge of your seat waiting to read what will happen next.  A great read up there with Morrell's best such as First Blood, The Protector, Long Lost and Burnt Sienna.<br /><br />In Creepers, Balenger joins a group of creepers (people who explore abandoned buildings) to document their activities as they explore an old hotel called The Paragon in Asbury Park, New Jersey.  The hotel was owned by an eccentric millionaire who was afraid to venture into the outside world so built a home with hidden peepholes, cameras and passageways where he could observe the going ons of his guests undetected.  No expense was spared in the construction of The Paragon and in its prime it was one of the most luxurious hotels in America.  As Asbury Park went off the list as a tourist destination and into the realms of a no go crime area the owner lived there alone behind steel shutters which protected him and the mansion from the outside world.  It has been vacant, sealed up and deteriorating since his death and new owners are tearing it down in a few weeks.  Balenger and the other creepers plan to explore and document The Paragon before that happens.  They have some idea what is inside, but it is what they don't know that can kill them!	2005-09-18

Patterson has written arguably his best ever non Alex Cross, Lindsay Boxer adventure.  Fans of his usual style may however be a bit surprised.  The short chapters are still with us but if the cover had been ripped off you could be forgiven for thinking you'd picked up a Harlan Coben novel as this novel follows that first person mainly looking through the eyes of one character narrative style he and other authors such as Jonathan Trooper and Nancy Sparling have mastered.  This new style works extremely well for Patterson and Gross though and great characters make for a can't put down, throw away the remote control, call in sick to work thriller.<br /><br />In the Lifeguard Ned Kelly thinks he now has the perfect life. He has met Tess a beautiful rich Australian girl who seems to like him as much as he her.  He is also about to make the perfect score, along with four lifelong friends he will share in five million dollars just for setting off a few burglar alarms.  The perfect score however does not go to plan and with his friends lying with bullet holes in their heads and Tess dead in a bathtub and 50 million dollars worth of paintings missing he is soon America's most wanted man.  He must work out, track down and prove who set up his friends and killed Tess or he will be behind bars for the rest of life.  A beautiful blond enthusiastic art expert, special FBI agent Ellie Shurtleff who has been waiting a long time for a case with some action and substance is someone else who will add complications to Ned's quest to avenge his friends and live a normal life once again.	2005-09-12

Box's debut novel Open Season was so good I immediately looked for the sequels.  Savage Run the next in the Joe Pickett series although a little bit predictable in parts maintains the high quality of the original masterpiece.  The Carl Hiaasen style characters continue in Savage Run with extreme environmentalists, arrogant trophy hunting rich ranchers who have politicians and officials in their pocket and surreal criminals.<br /><br />In Savage Run environmental guerrilla warfare against developers, ranchers, loggers and hunters organisation One Globe leader Stewie Woods is continuing his vandalism and destructive ways against those pilfering the environment when he is blown up along with his new wife by a bomb strapped to a cow.  The cow is one of Jim Finotta's an arrogant rich and powerful rancher who as Joe finds out when he visits him is not opposed to shooting game out of season, cutting off their heads as a trophy and leaving the rest of the animal to rot in the wilderness.  Soon other environmental lawyers, activists and other prominent pro wilderness people's deaths join Stewie Woods on the obituary list.  An organisation long thought to have died out called The Stockman's trust has hired two killers to restore the world to the way they think it should be.<br /><br />If you haven't already done so read Open Season.  In fact it is a good idea to read that novel before this one as parts of that story are given away in Savage Run.  Also if you haven't done so check out Carl Hiaasen novels which are similar to Box's but set in Florida instead of Wyoming.	2005-09-11

In The Murmansk Assignment recently retrenched foreign correspondent journalist Paul Wyatt is offered a job to be smuggled into Russia, go to Kirvoney St in Murmansk and bring back a defecting Polish biologist who is hiding out there.  The job will be simple and easy he is told but once in Russia Wyatt quickly learns the simple plan is going to be quite challenging.  For one there is no Kirvoney St in Murmansk and two his partner Olaf Hansen seems to be a bit of a hot head and a drunk which causes all kinds of hurdles.<br /><br />James Pattinson books vary drastically in quality but this is one of his best.

J. Box before picking up Open Season but I know this book will definitely not be the last of his work I read.  Open Season is a sensational novel complete with eccentric style dim-witted villains, extreme environmentalists who do more harm than good, trigger happy red necks and corrupt and incompetent officials and government departments that wouldn't be out of place in a Carl Hiaasen or Bill Fitzhugh adventure.  An extremely enjoyable and satisfying read.<br /><br />In Open Season park ranger Joe Pickett is in the job for the right reasons, his family is ever increasing in size and his meagre paycheque is barely paying the bills but he knows he making a difference to the wilderness and the creatures which live there.  Twelve Sleep Wyoming, the community he watches over however isn't as into conservation as he is. Practically everyone in town can see nothing wrong with going out with a rifle and shooting whatever they come across to either eat or put on their wall.  This means Joe's kids, especially his oldest daughter Sheridan pretty much have no friends at school.  When Sheridan sees a monster one night in the backyard which the next morning turns out to be a dead redneck who humiliated her father by taking his gun off him during a ticket, life for the family is set to change for ever. Throw in some previously thought to be extinct Miller's Weasels and a community whose economy will collapse if a planned gas pipeline is prevented from going ahead if one endangered species raises its head and you've got an extremely entertaining read.<br /><br />Another author called Ben Rehder also writes eccentric character filled game warden novels, his books are set in Texas.

There isn't a book out there that does and this provides a brief summary of the movie, the actors, studio, directors and producers as well as other key staff.

So I decided to check out her other books and picked up Piggy in the Middle but was disappointed that it was no where near the quality of Evil Genius. I was also disappointed that the epilogue which for some reason is at the start of the novel gives away the ending of the novel.<br /><br />In Piggy in the middle Ron a kind but not the brightest guy in the world has lost his driver's licence and with that his job. His snobby fianc&eacute; Jacqui puts wedding plans on hold as she cannot marry someone working in the only job Ron can get without a licence which is cleaning animal pens at Agricultural and Biomedical Research Industries (ABR). Everyone else at ABR looks down on Dallas so he is rather grateful when one day he is befriended by child genius and rich kid Felix. In a desperate attempt to impress his only friend Felix lets Ron in on top secret information such as that Jibby one of the pigs he looks after has a partial human brain. Meanwhile equally low in intelligence Dallas under contract by ABR to shoot feral pigs and send them skin from the shot pig's ears discovers that the feral pigs are being wiped out by a virus produced by ABR and that she will soon be out of a job. She heads to ABR for compensation where she meets Ron and Felix and learns more than she bargained for.	2005-08-25

Unfortunately great marketing personnel may accomplish sensational outcomes, but not employing the same degree in talent for authors makes this book a novelty yes, but not much else.

Although this one was written in 1978 and is set in Communist run Poland and East Germany it really isn't too dated. Obviously you need to temporarily forget the cold war ended and that Poland and East Germany are now part of the European Union but unlike a lot of other cold war era novels this one doesn't really harp on the anti Communist propaganda so history has not proven it to be that far fetched or inaccurate.<br /><br />In Blind Date Steve Brady has a substantial gambling debt and is saved from a beating by an organisation offering to pay off his debt if he just takes a trip to Poland.  He does not want to go but figures he will be worse off if he says no so gets on the ship with a fake passport bound for Gdansk.  He is told nothing of what he is supposed to pick up or where he will pick up it up just that he will receive instructions from his next contact when he gets to the hotel. He is forever kept in the dark but one of his contacts Paula, like most Polish women is a hot blond so he does not mind so much when she tells him she will be accompanying him to his next contact.  However his next contact can't tell him much because he is dead so although things are going badly he and Paula have no choice but to continue the journey to Brady's next contact but nothing seems to be going as planned and Brady of course has no idea what that plan actually is.<br /><br />This is one of my favourite Pattinson novels even though it was written before I was born it is still just as good and could have been set in a modern background like the Middle East quite easily.  Pattinson novels are quite simple and light reading.  He does write in a style where his characters use words that show Pattinson is obviously an old man but that does add something to the novels.

They get lost along the way and after their car breaks down have to hike into the nearest town for help.  Unfortunately for them the nearest town is Four Corners and everyone there is dead.  Soon to be dead will be the arriving trio if they cannot allude the heavily armed militia who now control the town.  Also soon to be dead are thousands of Americans if the trio can not get out of town and warn the authorities.  Meanwhile cops they've met in past novels and the rest of the Monkeewrench gang are freaking out as the girls become more and more late and do not answer their mobiles so they set off in their RV to locate them.<br /><br />I preferred the serial killer Monkeewrench adventures to Dead Run especially Live Bait as they are so much more realistic but I thoroughly enjoyed this book as well.  Although I love the Monkeewrench series so far, the real test for this brilliant mother daughter writing team will be when they can write a thrilling masterpiece with different main characters.  Definitely buy Dead Run and the former two sensational novels as well.	2005-08-04

You know who the murderer is from the beginning and just in case you weren't paying attention the novel gives it away at every opportunity throughout.  The sheer stupid decisions throughout the novel Bianca makes are beyond believability as it is unlikely anyone could survive to the age of eighteen or would be entrusted to babysit a newborn when they are sixteen if they are as stupid as she is.  The judge in the courtroom scenes is also extremely unrealistic, if a judge was showing as much bias as he does in the book on day one of the trial he would be immediately dismissed.<br /><br />In The Dark, Sixteen year old Bianca Winters is babysitting St Simons Island, Georgia's richest family the Shipley's baby when she discovers an intruder is in the mansion.  As the maid is murdered she somehow manages to escape with the baby but immediately cannot tell anyone what happened as she has no memory of the night.  Two years later and her doctor is encouraging her to date again and to get over her fear of the dark and become a normal citizen.  She is also about to have access to a one million dollar trust account given to her by a grateful Shipley family.  She goes to the movies with Rick from her school but immediately her fear of the dark kicks in and she flees to the bathroom. There she is bullied by a fellow student and warned by the murderer that when she remembers, she will be killed. She later falls in love with the brother of the town's most famous criminal who no one trusts.<br /><br />Pathetic unrealistic read, give it a miss.	2005-08-03

Still in school Davey has a bit of talent in the bike racing department and pesters his dad into buying him a new bike that one of his rivals is selling.  School bully Hard Stew had previously arranged to purchase it but Davey's dad slips the seller some extra cash to swing the bike Davey's way.  Davey is given an ultimatum along with regular beatings that he had better do the right thing and sell the bike to its rightful recipient.  Being a complete wimp Davey sees no alternative but has to convince his father to let him sell.  Meanwhile Davey's granddad dies and it seems not only does no one else care they all say good riddance which deeply disturbs Davey further.  At the funeral he notices his cousin has developed into a hot babe and along with avoiding Hard Stew he does everything he can to become romantically involved with her.<br /><br />Not the best novel in the world but an interesting novel due to the disturbed mind of Davey.  Bernard Ashley is obviously an old man as his characters dialogue is rather dated and certainly not the lingo that school aged children use today or have for a few generations for that matter.  With authors like James Pattinson who also do this there is a quite a nostalgic charm to this style but the charm isn't really mastered by Ashley and it actually becomes quite annoying at times.  The whole there's something wrong with wanting to sleep with your cousin fact is not tackled in this novel which is a little bit weird as well.	2005-07-31

Paul Fraser works for a London merchant bank and is sent to Central America to investigate the enterprise of Carlos Ortega who is after a substantial loan to expand his empire.  It soon becomes apparent that Carlos cares little for his country or about the lives of others and will not let anything or anyone get in the way of his purchase of rainforest to be knocked down for his beef cattle.  Then there is Carlos' daughter Margarita who Carlos has arranged to marry his good friend's son but Paul has fallen in love with.  Not to mention the Tree People who like Carlos will not let anyone stop them and will go to any lengths to protect the rainforest.  Paul's future may well be spoilt by death from any of these factors.<br /><br />I thought this was one of the best Pattinson books I had ever read until the last couple of chapters which seem a bit rushed an uncreative which drops my rating down a star.  James Pattinson books vary drastically in quality. Pattinson writes in an old man style where his characters use words that show Pattinson is obviously from a previous generation and not quite down with the lingo of today but this style does add something unique and enjoyable to his novels.

It spends a lot of time in Ned's first job CompuWorld setting the scene and letting us know what an upstanding great guy Neal is.  This could have been done in a lot less chapters but apart from that this is a pretty good story which once it gets going has you wanting to finish it to find out what happens.  Another great thriller novel dealing with someone suddenly unemployed is The Ax by Donald E Westlake.<br /><br />Ned Allen is has the gift of sales.  He has quickly risen to the position of Northeast regional sales manager at America's third biggest computer magazine CompuWorld.  New owners mean his and his staffs jobs are in jeopardy if there are problems so when an advertiser reneges on his verbal contract Ned is faced with the decision of questioning his ethics and resorting to blackmail to get him to commit to save himself and his staff.  Days later he learns it was all for nothing as CompuWorld has been sold again, this time to its main rival who is shutting it down.  Now Neil is unemployed and has a few major enemies who will do everything to stop him from working in the industry ever again.  When his wife leaves him and he is on the streets he receives an offer he knows is a bit too good to be true but takes it anyway.

The first half of the book follows the adventures of a British guy named Nick Reed who has taken a break from his mundane job to travel America.  Nick has an interesting way to fund his vacation, he just pretends to be someone he's not.  He is not stupid enough to actually pretend to be a famous person but has discovered it is extremely easy to pretend that you are the son or brother of someone famous.  His hotel tab, drinks, dinners, and all other expenses are usually picked up by those who want an inside scoop and to just hang around the relation of a celebrity.<br /><br />Although it is the same story continuing the second part of the book has Nick pretending to be Schwarzenegger's son attending and graduating at a bounty hunter school and going on a mission which goes totally wrong with Nick needing to maintain the lie of his alter ego to survive.  The second half of the book is definitely a lot more of a can't put down edge of your seat thriller type novel than the first half which is a lot lighter and non action celebrity fun focused and written in a way you can put it down and pick up when you have a few minutes to spare.  Both parts of the book are five star quality though and you will look long and hard to find a better book than this.  Once you start the second half you won't be watching TV or going to work so think of a good excuse and get a blank tape.<br /><br />Also read Nancy Sparling's Being Alexander, it's great as well.	2005-07-22

Harry Bingham's fourth novel maintains the high quality set by his masterpiece The Money Makers, Sweet Talking Money and The Sons of Adam.  Like The Sons of Adam, Glory Boys is a period piece set in the early era of aviation, the World War has just finished and prohibition is still strong in the US.  The Glory Boys of aviation fresh from the war now have to make another living.  Willard Thornton laps up his hero status and sets to extend his five minutes of fame with a movie career.  Only problem is he is not a very good actor and soon becomes massively in debt and has to work for the company his loan is with to pay it back. Captain Abraham Rockwell has no dreams to become wealthy and is only interested in flying but a mechanical failure has him crash landing in Independence, Georgia where he is worshiped and treated as possible saviour of the town from the booze runners of Marion the town to the south.<br /><br />Glory Boys is a very enjoyable read.  I am definitely not usually into period pieces but the quality of Bingham's previous work meant I couldn't pass this up.  I wasn't disappointed and like all Bingham novels you learn a hell of a lot as well.  If you haven't read his masterpiece The Moneymakers definitely check it out!	2005-07-22

It was a bit predictable in parts especially the final chapter and it was unnecessarily long in certain parts that a bit of editing could have fixed up but that does not diminish from the fact that it is a great page turner novel.  If you like this sort of plot also get Mother's Boys written by Bernard Taylor, a similar plot where a new step mom has to deal with step sons, especially two older ones who will go to any length to be rid of her and are even less driven by morals than Flic and Imo are in Twisted Minds.<br /><br />Successful architect Matthew Gardner meets a beautiful woman Caroline Walters who happens to be a recent widow while both parties are vacationing in Switzerland.  They fall in love and with no regard for Caroline's three daughters decide to impulsively marry.  Matthew moves to England and into the Walter's house where it soon becomes apparent that with at least the two older sisters Felicity (Flic) and Immogen (Imo) the happiness and pleasantness towards him before the marriage was just an act.  The London branch of his employer also seems to resent the fact that he called in a personal favour to be relocated there ahead of more qualified locals.  At first the hints from his new step daughters are subtle but as it becomes apparent to the girls that Matthew is either a really slow learner or couldn't care less how they feel, will stay married and will sleep with their mother in their father's bed so they are forced into more drastic actions.  Matthew's life becomes a nightmare and the girls lose any hint of morals in a desperate attempt to not just to force him away one way or another but to extract vengance for what he has put them through as well.	2005-07-17

Not much detail on each character, facts are wrong for example Jason's from Friday the 13th true passion is not chainsaws, in fact I don't remember him ever using one and the blurb does not mention his mum watched him drown in Camp Crystal Lake.  Another example of poor research is Homer Simpson.  He does not say Hmmmm, he says Mmmmmm.  Obviously Seth has not watched a lot of TV or rented a movie in his life.<br /><br />The layout of this book is boring.  Paying a bit to copyright owners would allow a few more pictures other than the seldom black and white photograph but usual third blank column.

Koontz has however again accomplished what other usual writers of adult thrillers such as James Patterson have tired and failed at, by writing a great children's picture book whose quality would sell the book alone without needing to rely on the author's famous name to put it on the best seller lists.<br /><br />In Robot Santa a year has passed since Charlotte and Emily saved Santa and Christmas from Santa's evil brother Bob.  Now reformed and leaving his evil past behind him Bob has decided to redeem himself by training a gorilla to drive a sleigh manned by a robot Santa he built to ease the workload of Christmas Eve.  Of course the gorilla gets bored and Robot Santa malfunctions and it is up to Charlotte and Emily to save Christmas once again.<br /><br />Robot Santa again has the rhyming style and great artwork that the original contained.  Some of the rhymes don't flow as easily as the first book though and the quality of the story wasn't quite up there with the original classic.  Fans of Dean Koontz or the original Santa's Twin will definitely want to check this out though.	2005-07-11

Bartender Billy Wiles finds a note on his windshield telling him that he must decide through his actions in the next six hours if a beautiful blond school teacher will die or an elderly woman.  He of course does not know if the note is real or just a joke but shows it to his lazy cop buddy Lanny who dismisses it and tells Billy to forget about it.  It soon becomes apparent to Billy that the note is indeed real and now with a second note he has another no win choice to make.<br /><br />I thought the book went slightly downhill from this stage as the story didn't keep along the original plot of the notes and instead turned into a Billy Wiles dealing with the psycho killer while covering up the crimes so Billy won't face trial for them.  This new plot was obviously not as believable as the original idea or realistic.  It was still a good and enjoyable story don't get me wrong but books that theoretically could occur in the real world where you can put yourself in the characters' shoes make much better on the edge of your seat thrillers than farfetched ignoring the facts of the real world storylines.<br /><br />The substantial amount of crime scene television readers have been exposed to makes even the most unforensically knowledged reader know you cannot clean up crime scenes as easy as Billy does in Velocity.  Good enjoyable read but not the masterpiece quality realistic thriller it started out to be.	2005-06-26

The Golden Reef is not one of those novels.  Granted some of the older Pattinson stuff is a bit dated but there are some of his great works like The Golden Reef that are as good as his latest work.<br /><br />The Golden Reef concerns the events of the Volpariso an English navy ship sunk in the latter part of World War II by the Japanese, well at least that's what everyone thought until a lone survivor is found almost dead in one of the ships lifeboats almost a year later.  Lone survivor Keeton knows the full story, the fate of the other survivors and the crimes committed by cowards who thought the Volpariso's fate was a watery grave and left him and the others to die with the ship.  Keeton however is claiming amnesia but two others who left him and the others to drown know if he is alive then the Volpariso didn't sink after the attack.  They also know there was over a million dollars worth of gold on board and they want it and won't take no for an answer.<br /><br />James Pattinson books vary drastically in quality.

Although this book is a worthwhile read it is not in the same high league as Danger Zone which could be compared to Harlan Coben, Joseph Finder and other similar authors' great work.<br /><br />In The Trade, Malibu resident Matt Lowell ignores a police road block and races towards his house to save it and his dog from a fire raging in the neighbourhood. Losing his car to the fire he is forced to run along the beach to his house but on the way comes across an abandoned baby. Eventually when he arrives at his house he notices the baby is dead. After the fire the baby's teenage mother is found dead on the roadside covered in flowers. Upon investigating the scene Matt finds out there's other children in the canyon and brings an injured girl home with him who can't speak English and is terrified of everyone. For reasons only known to him and to allow the plot of the book to happen he doesn't just ring the cops but keeps homicide police in the dark about everything and instead tries to solve the problem himself. Only when those who also unbelievably have also gone along with his plan start to turn up dead does he realise he will soon be dead if he doesn't gather enough evidence first.<br /><br />The Trade is also similar in plot to another book I recently read called California Fire and Life by Don Winslow which tackles a similar plot a lot more brilliantly and with substantially more substance and believability. The Trade is all right if you are borrowing it or can get one for free but if you're trading money for it you'll get a better deal with Danger Zone or California Fire and Life.	2005-06-16

Gerald's Game is an okay read but not in the masterpiece league as some of King's other work such at It, Thinner, Misery and some of his other novels.  To be honest it would have been better as a short story or novella as it starts off extremely well but does drag on a bit in parts especially as Jessie remembered the past.  Not the can't put down page turner that some of King's other work is but an interesting read none the less.  I especially liked Prince, he should have had more coverage.<br /><br />Gerald's Game is a story through the eyes of Jessie Burlingame who has both hands handcuffed to a bed in a remote cabin while her rapist husband Gerald lies dead on the floor.

This 1998 Brad Meltzer thriller although not in the same masterpiece league as The Zero Game and The First Council is still a great read.  It is not as fast paced a read as those novels but an enjoyable thriller non the less.<br /><br />Jared is a successful defence attorney but needs to attract new clients to the firm before he can become a partner.  Sara is unemployed but equally talented and finally lands her dream job as a district attorney but on her first day learns that mass layoffs will occur shortly and its highly likely since she is brand new she will be one of the ones to go.  She decides to steal a case because it was requested to one of the most popular district attorney's and she figures it has to be huge and she can show her stuff then won't be fired.  She's disappointed to learn it is just a burglary case prosecuting some low life called Kozlow and now everyone knows she stole it.  Still she must win it to have any chance of not being fired.<br /><br />Kozlow becomes Jared's client and when he later finds out it's his wife's case tries to pull out.  Kozlow takes Jared to a man named Rafferty who explains they obviously didn't hire Jared for his skill but because he is the husband of the DA.  They also tell him if he doesn't win Sara will be killed and if he tells her they both will.  He has no choice but to defeat his wife who not only is motivated to win to keep her career but also threatened Jared will be killed if she doesn't.	2005-06-03

Myron Bolitair fans may be a bit disappointed that this isn't another in that great series but there is no doubt Coben writes sensational one off novels as well. In fact to be honest I think his one off books are even better but I realise there will be those who passionately disagree with this statement and this just shows what a great author Harlan Coben is.<br /><br />In The Innocent Matt Hunter comes out of prison, and nine years since the day he was incarcerated his life looks like having not just turned around but well on the way to bliss. He has a child on the way, a beautiful wife and he's about to purchase a new home. Life's not that easy though and someone sends him a picture of his wife sitting on the bed in their hotel room. Someone is obviously following him, the local cops want him out of town and a policewoman he knew as a child is pursuing the murder of a nun with evidence pointing at him.<br /><br />If you like Coben and want books written in a similar style also check out the authors Joseph Finder particularly his books Paranoia and Company Man, Brad Meltzer, Max Barry particulalry his book Syrup, (note - his first name is spelt with an extra x for that one) and Jonathan Trooper, especially his books Plan B and The Book of Joe.	2005-05-27

A Body to Die For was a lot faster paced with more interesting and realistic characters than this novel.  If Looks Could Kill spends too much time and too many words trying to outline Bailey Weggin's character than is necessary which means the novel gets rather boring at times.  An all right read but not in the same category as A Body to Die For, get that one instead.<br /><br />In If Looks Could Kill Bailey Weggins works as a writer in Mahattan for a woman's magazine and one early Sunday morning she is pulled away from a good time between the sheets by a phone call from her boss demanding she accompany her to check on her nanny.  Bailey finds the corpse of the nanny and it soon becomes apparent she has died from poisoned chocolates.  Bailey suspects the chocolates weren't meant for the nanny but instead her boss and decides to use her journalistic skills to find out just what happened. Of course this sort of thing does not please the murderer.	2005-05-19

Two British guys do not want to settle down to everyday post war life just yet so they convince their rich fathers to buy them a boat and they set sail to see the world.  As their funds dwindle and returning to England seems imminent they meet two American girls in Florida who get by living off of rich men.  The girls thinking the guys are wealthy convince them to take them on a trip to the Caribbean.<br /><br />One of the girls trips over a human skull on a deserted island and after some digging they unearth a multitude of gold bars.  Knowing before they can become rich they must first sell the bars poses problems as they can't just walk into a bank so they take one bar back to Florida to see if they can sell it.  Of course underworld figures prefer to just take gold rather than pay for it.  Also interested in the gold is an ex Nazi sailor who buried it there in the first place and he's not just going to stand by and let others have it.<br /><br />Pattinson novels are quite simple and light reading. They do very dramatically in quality though. Skeleton Island is one of the best Pattinson novels I have read.  He does write in a style where his characters use words that show Pattinson is obviously an old man but that does add something to the novels.  Other quality Pattinson novels worth your time and money are Blind Date, Obituary for Howard Grey, Crane, The Animal Gang and Life Preserver.	2005-05-17

This book gets really boring after a while and is very predictable. I have read Diamond's novel The Trophy Wife and although that had a pretty weak ending I did enjoy it and you were at least entertained throughout and wanted to get to the end. I was very disappointed with The Babysitter, read The Trophy Wife instead.<br /><br />In The Babysitter political candidate Gordon Acton and his wife Ellie have no time to look after their kids as they need to use their time doing such things as getting Gordon elected, writing a thesis and attending social events. Their last babysitter was spending a bit too much time under the beach towel with their snotty private club's lifeguard rather than watching the kids. Teresa Santiago is recommended to Gordon as her heritage is a mixture of a few minority groups they need to target for votes and she is a high achiever which fits in with Gordon's wife's thesis on diverting funds from the underprivileged class schools to their parents.<br /><br />After Gordon gives in to a few temptations of the flesh and Ellie has let Teresa do the majority of work on her thesis they both start to realise Teresa can expose them both and ruin their plans. There is only one way to ensure she cannot tell anyone.	2005-05-17

This is definitely not the best Pattinson novel out there by a long way but it is a good simple read and written in the usual Pattinson old man style.  Pattinson novels are quite simple and light reading.  He does write in a style where his characters use words that show Pattinson is obviously an old man but that does add something to the novels.  Better Pattinson novels worth checking out are Blind Date, Obituary for Howard Grey, Crane, The Animal Gang and Life Preserver but fans of Pattinson will enjoy Steel too.<br /><br />In Steel we follow the life of the title character Mark Steel whose life is turned upside down when his drug addicted girlfriend is found dead.  A visit to her drug dealer leaves Steel with a price on his head and hit men in pursuit.  He is forced to leave England and become a drifter in Europe where he meets up with various women, and employers with secrets he wishes he knew about beforehand.  A similar type of novel to Obituary for Howard Grey although not as good.  The ending in Steel also lacks closure and is the main reason it drops in my overall rating.	2005-05-14

(Neal Carey Mysteries)	Books	1	6	9	N	N	You Are Just Wishing They'll All Hurry Up and Drown	I was extremely disappointed with While Drowning in the Desert.  Recently I read The Life and Death of Bobby Z as well as California Fire and Life which were sensational masterpieces.  I thought I had discovered a brilliant author and with anticipation looked for other novels of Winslow's and when I found this book I looked forward to the great story I expected within.  How wrong I was! This is one of the biggest disappointments in the literary world that I have ever wasted my time on.  The characters are weak, farfetched and not believable.  The style of the novel with large parts written as letters to solicitors and to other weak characters, just doesn't flow well and the story is a struggle to get through.  If this was the first Winslow novel I had come across I wouldn't pick up another, but since I have read the great novels California Fire and Life and The Life and Death of Bobby Z I will give him another chance.<br /><br />In this book Neal Carey is asked by a man who is not his father but who he calls Dad to escort an old man from Vegas to his home in Palm Springs.  The old man Natty Silver is very popular in Vegas and doesn't want to go home so will do anything to delay the journey.  Meanwhile dumb criminals are looking for Natty in Palm Springs and Neal's fianc&eacute; wants a baby.  Give this disaster a miss!	2005-05-14

I must admit I wondered if Patterson could still produce these sorts of novels and am very happy to see that he still can.  Hopefully though Patterson won't now use fans renewed hope to quickly cash in and release some half effort Alex Cross thriller but will now put the same effort into that once great series and his independent novels that he has done with this one.  I hope so but I have my doubts, we'll have to wait and see.<br /><br />In 4th of July Lindsay Boxer is having dinner and a few drinks with the Women's Murder Club when her ex partner Jacobi calls and tells her the black Mercedes seen at the crimes of a child serial killer has been spotted.  She of course has to be there when they catch the culprit but the night does not go smoothly and before she knows it she is in hospital and facing serious jail time and financial ruin for her actions.<br /><br />Whilst awaiting the trial and on forced vacation time she decides to recoup and relax at her sister's place in Moon Bay.  Moon Bay was incidentally the scene of her first homicide investigation which is now a cold case and one she has never given up on.  When a local spite of serial killing seems to be related to that case she just can't say stay on the sidelines.  Beside she has to have something to do to take her mind of her trial, but not everyone in Moon Bay is pleased she is lending a hand.	2005-05-10

My first Finder novel was the masterpiece Paranoia so I decided to check out his other work.  I was very disappointed with his previous novels, not due to their quality but because they were absolutely nothing subject wise like what Paranoia was.  Company Man isn't the same either but it does return to the business world and is one all fans of the book Paranoia will enjoy as well.<br /><br />Nick Covenor is the CEO of small town Michigan company Stratton Corporation.  He was once the most popular man in town but pressure from the owners to relocate factory work to China has meant 5000 of his workforce is now unemployed.  5000 of his workforce now hate him and most of the town knows at least one person who was laid off.  So it is little wonder the local police do next to nothing when his home is constantly vandalised and broken into and are quite happy to let his young daughter stumble upon the family pet dog which has been butchered by some psycho.  In fear for his family Nick upgrades his security with the help of Stratton head of security and unbeknownst to Nick ex corrupt cop Eddie.  Meanwhile at the office Nick starts to realise he is being undermined and when the security system tells him there's an intruder one night his actions leave him with more than just the office to worry about.<br /><br />Sensational novel that will have you forgetting about TV until you've finished.  If you haven't read Paranoia check it out as well.	2005-05-10

This was a lot less surreal than that novel but no less enjoyable.  Apart from a great fictional story you also learn through the main character Jake Wade a substantial amount about fires.<br /><br />Former cop Jake Wade works for insurance company California Fire and Life and is investigating a fire which has killed a woman and destroyed millions of dollars worth of business man Nicky Vale's antique furniture.  The lazy and corrupt police blame Pam, Nicky's wife who died in the bedroom but the evidence points to arson.  Adding in the fact Nicky seems to only care about when he will get the insurance payment and not about the welfare of his kids or the loss of his wife, who unbeknownst to Jake happens to be the half sister of his ex girlfriend points to the fact of insurance fraud.<br /><br />What should be a simple denial claim however is made harder by the fact that Nicky is part of the Russian mafia and pretty much everyone in the police, California fire and Life, Court system and everywhere else is on his payroll.<br /><br />This is a great read as is The Life and Death of Bobby Z.  Read them both.	2005-05-08

David Morrell has written some sensational novels, recent masterpieces include The Protector and Burnt Sienna.  First Blood was Morrell's first though and unlike a lot of authors who become great over their careers Morrell was right on the money with his debut classic.  The ending few chapters are similar to scenes he has written in other books and to be honest I think he has improved with the later novels there, but Rambo in the forest chapters certainly are of masterpiece quality.<br /><br />To really get into the book you have to sort of try and forget the Stallone image of Rambo and whoever the actor was who played Teasle (the cop) as their character descriptions (physical and personality) are a bit different in the novel.  It is great to be able to get inside the heads of both characters which the movie didn't do anywhere near as well.  The movie also had a clear line of who was the victim and who was the bad guy where as the novel giving both sides lets the reader wonder a bit more and makes the characters more human.<br /><br />The version of First Blood I read also had an introduction by David Morrell in present times reflecting on the 70's when he wrote the book which was pretty interesting, so get that version if you can.  Don't stop with First Blood though, also check out Morrell's other classics such as The Protector, Burnt Sienna and Long Lost to name but three of his later gems.	2005-05-05

Zachary King in this book is a similar character to Ben in Plan B and Joe from the Book of Joe. Everything Changes is also written in the same narrative, talking to the reader style as those novels.<br /><br />What it lacks though is a clear plot.  You knew what was going on in the other novels ie Ben and the others trying to force their celebrity friend off drugs in Plan B and Joe returning to a town he had slammed in his novel to visit his dying father in The Book of Joe.  Everything Changes is just a fly on the wall view into a few weeks of a Zachary King's life and his mid life crisis, fear of bladder cancer and reunion with his father Norm who walked out on his life years before.  The book is also rather predictable, you know what Zach is going to choose to do after a few chapters.<br /><br />It is however entertaining and Zach's medical experiences are something every guy hopes to never go through.  A good read but read the sensational novels Plan B and The Book of Joe first.	2005-04-30

Over the past few years many destinations have completely disappeared from this one great informational book with their space being taken up by restaurant and hotel listings which backpackers obviously never use. This is obviously to force backpackers to buy the other localised editions to find out about places in each state or region as well as the main one which previously was all you ever needed.  Missing the whole point that backpackers don't have the money to spend or space in their backpacks for twenty odd heavy books.<br /><br />Canada information in the 2005 edition is a joke.  What will 2010 cover just Montreal and Vancouver?  Most provinces are no longer listed, they used to be.  Winnipeg and the entire province of Manitoba, Regina and the entire province of Saskatchewan, gone! The whole point of backpacking is that we stop at places along the way not just the mass tourism stops.  Without these listings you're travelling on your own until you reach Alberta if you're going from Ontario to the West. Even Ontario content is dwindling, what happened to Thunder Bay?<br /><br />The USA coverage is also going down the drain. Spokane in Washington as well as Bellingham (of major importance as is where backpackers catch the Alaskan Marine Highway Ferry to America's biggest state's panhandle,) Whitefish, Montana<br /><br />Fargo, North Dakota and a heap of other places have just disappeared over recent editions.<br /><br />Also what is gong on with the hostel listings?  Either hostels have to pay to get listed now (which should be stated so the reader knows they are getting biased coverage) or there's some really sloppy research going on.  Fairbanks only lists two hostels I know of at least eight, there's heaps more in Manhattan than Let's Go would have you believe, in fact just about every destination has more.  This is disgraceful because backpackers may use up vital money for expensive accommodation believing the only hostel in town is booked out when there are ten alternatives with free beds.  Or worse not visit a destination because they think there is no affordable accommodation when there is.<br /><br />Let's Go needs to have a long hard look at themselves.  Backpackers made them their millions of dollars in their initial years and sure the more allocentric mass tourism market may be highly profitable and able to recognise the Let's Go brand name, but why then not have two editions.  One for backpackers with more destinations, hostel and supermarket listings and one for hotel users with fine dining and the other stuff backpackers will never use.  Let's Go isn't alone, Lonely Plant, Rough Guide and the other competitors are also following track, in fact I'd say they are worse but this is no excuse for Let's Go which use to be a great information packed guide.

I had previously been disappointed with Morrell's short stories having read Nightscape another collection of short stories which weren't that great.  Black Evening however has higher quality stories than that edition and I was pleasantly surprised.  Sure not every story in here is great and I thought it was going to be another collection of shockers when I read the first story The Dripping but there are some gems in here.  Black and White and Red All Over is a superb tale from the child narrator who is recounting his experiences of delivering the paper every day and his experiences with the serial killer who abducts paperboys.<br /><br />The Typewriter deals with an author and a possessed typewriter with a mind of its own, Mumbo Jumbo looks at the pressure of high school sports and what good luck charms can mean to a team.  The Storm similar sort of theme to Stephen King's Thinner has a father cursed by a roadside Indian to always be followed by a storm.<br /><br />I'd recommend reading Morrell's masterpiece novels like The Protector, Burnt Sienna and Long Lost before checking out his short stories but if this is a good price get it too.	2005-04-17

Before reading Jonathan Tropper's debut novel Plan B I had previously read his sensational novel The Book of Joe.  Whilst The Book of Joe was a little bit lighter read than this book the same high quality of characters and superb writing mean you can't put Plan B down until the final page.  Ben (a similar character to Joe in The Book of Joe) has just turned 30 as are the small number of friends he still has.  One's Chuck, a successful doctor who seems to take every opportunity he can to sleep with younger women, another's Alison a successful lawyer who has been in love with Jack since university.  Jack is now a famous Hollywood actor who unbeknownst to the public is addicted to cocaine and on a downward spiral.  Then there's Lindsey, Ben's ex girlfriend who is currently unemployed.<br /><br />Ben married another woman while still in love with Lindsey and is freshly divorced.  Life didn't turn out the way any of them thought it would and mid life crisis is an understatement for all but Jack.  They all see Jack as being all but dead in a few years if they don't intervene.  An intervention doesn't work so they go to plan B, kidnap him, drive to the country and keep him locked in a room until he detoxifies. They didn't really think the details of Plan B totally through however and things start to go wrong.  They should have had a plan C but they don't.<br /><br />This along with The Book of Joe is a sensational read.  My Plan A is to find any other books by Jonathan Tropper and acquire them as soon as possible.	2005-04-14

Tom thinks it will be a pretty cruisey job and he might even get laid if he plays his cards right.  Then the death threats begin, people they talk to are murdered and he learns that Shirley believes her grandfather survived the crash and may in fact be the hairy Bigfoot type monster or fathered the creatures or creatures who have murdered many villagers especially women throughout the years. Tom knows the police chief having grown up with him but the chief is not too happy Tom and Shirley are poking around in his country with the death toll rising fast around them.<br /><br />This is another sensational and enjoyable Nicole novel.  Nicole's novels are fast paced, pretty believable (although again we have a snake bite scene where the person is treated by someone sucking out the poison which is just plain stupid and is the last thing you should ever do when bitten by a snake) and has a strong female lead character.  Shirley is probably a bit more realistic than the Jessica Jones character of a lot of other Nicole books although she is not as interesting.  I would recommend any of Nicole's Jessica Jones novels such as The Voyage, The Pursuit and others along with stand alone novels such as this one and Ransom Island.	2005-04-12

Sure some tourists eat at these places and spend hundreds of dollars a night for somewhere to sleep away from other travellers but these rich or short holiday travellers are not what Let's Go's roots were all about.  Let's Go was originally a backpacker book which provided a comprehensive list of backpacker hostels in most large cities and small towns throughout the Europe (for the Europe edition) along with basic information on what there was to see or attract you to stop there.  Now most of those small towns are gone.<br /><br />Nottingham, England (where Robin Hood hang out), Titisee and Schluchsee in the Black Forrest Germany are gone from previous years.  Freiburg is not the Black Forrest experience, just the nearest big city but Let's Go will have you believe it is.  All Northern Ireland now lists are Belfast and Causeway Coast.  What about Londonderry (Derry) the only medieval walled city on the island of the Republic of and Northern Ireland.<br /><br />What is going on with hostel listings?  Each year more and more of them disappear.  I know of at least 21 backpacker hostels in Dublin yet Let's Go lists only 6 and some towns do not even have a hostel listing even though there are hostels there.  This means backpackers may not go somewhere at all out of fear there is nowhere to stay which is not the case. Pisa, Italy has no hostel listings when the Centro Turistico Madonna dell' Acqua Hostel a short walk from the famous leaning one (can be found at V. Pietrasantina 15).  Inverness, Scotland has only one hostel listed, I know of 7.  Either the quality of staff in the research department has gone downhill or hostels now have to pay to be listed.  If this is the case it should be mentioned before each city's hostel listings so the unsuspecting reader who thinks they are getting unbiased coverage is aware.<br /><br />Lauterbrunnen probably the best nature town in Switzerland (surrounded by numerous waterfalls and the Alps) was listed but has also disappeared.  It is sad to think some people (who only go where their guide book takes them) may go to Europe, backpack for a few months and only find out when they meet other backpackers that they missed out on a gem of an experience. What will Let's Go 2015 contain just London, Barcelona, Paris, Berlin and a few other cities?<br /><br />If you've never been to Europe then this book will be of some benefit to you but due to lack of coverage if you're planning on visiting the real Europe you'll have to research elsewhere as well. Get a second hand edition from the late 90's if you can instead.  Let's Go needs to rediscover its roots. granted it is still one of the leaders in this market but if the five star tourist market is profitable then why not have two editions, one for backpackers with more towns and hostels and one for the hotel, fine dining traveller market.lity of staff in the research department has gone downhill or hostels now have to pay to be listed.

If the book of Joe was a cup of Joe you'd be going straight back for a refill as it is that good.  An entertaining light read, the character of Joe Goffman along with the supporting characters are so well written that you just can't stop turning the pages until you reach the last one.  I had never even heard of before but will definitely be checking out Jonathan Trooper's other work and if it is half as good as this I can't go wrong.<br /><br />Joe Goffman hated his small Connecticut town, apart from his final year in high school he had only friend and not being an athlete had nothing to talk about with his basketball obsessed father.  He moved away after high school and struggled as a writer until one day his agent came across a diary sort of story Goffman had written for himself about his backward, one employer, Cougar (basket ball team) worshipping town.  He had left nothing out and once published and later made into a blockbuster movie, occupants of his former home town which was now seen as a joke by the rest of the world wanted him dead which was fine with him as he wasn't ever going back.  A phone call from his sister in law Cindy one night telling him his father has had a stroke and is in a coma forces him to return and although it has been 17 years the locals have kept their grudge.	2005-04-03

This is the third Meltzer book I've read a like The Millionaires and his masterpiece The Zero Game it is a brilliant non stop thrill ride.  Like The Zero Game this book is set DC politics but unlike that book which was set in Capitol Hill, The First Council is based in the White House and adjoining OGOB building.  Sure American politics doesn't sound like an interesting topic but Meltzer has a style that makes it thrilling and entertaining.<br /><br />Michael Garrick has a dream job, he gets to visit the Oval Office and advise the president and do things most people would envy.  Dating the president's beautiful daughter Nora is certainly the envy of every man in the USA but of course he can't tell anyone about that.  After a night lost in the DC suburbs after evading the Secret Service bodyguards Michael and Nora end up in a gay bar where they see Michael's boss Simon.  An election is underway so they follow him to find out if he's doing anything that will be detrimental to the president. They witness him drop an envelope full of cash in a secluded spot, Nora decides to take some of it and paranoia sets in for Michael who knows someone was watching.<br /><br />The next day Michael decides to tell Caroline a superior at the White House about Simon but Simon has beat him to it and Caroline tells him he has been accused of the same thing and she believes Simon. Of course he can't tell anyone he was with Nora or her father will lose the election so he has no alibi and when Caroline is murdered it becomes apparent he will go to jail or worse be murdered himself if he can't find out and prove what's actually going on.	2005-03-30

Of course he's dating the most attractive popular girl (Tracey) in high school whose shallow nature and love for herself is sky high.  So when Lori buys a Dreamcatcher and the demon tells her he can make all her dreams come true including being popular, stardom, get the hot neighbour guy, and have vengeance on Tracey and the other popular kids she jumps at the chance.

Although not as surreal a writer as Carl Hiaasen, similar styles of characters make up this novel as in Hiaasen's masterpieces.  Dumb and greedy criminals and police get what they deserve as they try to take down Tim Kearney, all for different reasons.  Kearney an ex Gulf War marine has just killed Stinkdog with a number plate while spending time in the California Corrections system.  Stinkdog was a prominent member of the Hell's Angels and a price is put on Kearney's head.  Tad Gursza a sleazy DEA agent offers him a deal.  He can become recently departed drug legend Bobby Z who has died in custody and be traded for another DEA agent who is in the hands of ruthless drug lord Don Huertero.  With no choice Kearney becomes Bobby Z and suddenly has all the women and respect he could ever want but as things go wrong he soon discovers Bobby Z has lots of enemies who want him dead and think Kearney is Z.<br /><br />This is a sensational novel, I'll definitely be checking out any other work by Don Winslow that I can find.	2005-03-22

Books	3	0	0	N	N	Something to Read While You're Stuck in Traffic	Anyone that's ever live or ventured into poorly planned large cities can relate to events in this short novel.  With all London teams playing at home a rail strike is orchestrated by train drivers wanting to attend the football (soccer), which is happening simultaneously with London's worst ever traffic jam resulting in cars sitting bumper to bumper and not moving an inch for a number of days.  The situation is not helped by lazy and corrupt government officials who have a wager on the jam's end date with their local bookies and will do anything to prolong it.  Margaret Thatcher has to meet the French President for urgent talks and knows if she is late the French will see it as an insult so commandeers a Hell's Angel bikie to weave her through the gridlock.  This is one of the many stories on offer in this insight into the world's biggest traffic jam and its affect on normal law abiding and non law abiding British citizens and American tourists and an old Australian rugby fan.  Not the greatest novel ever written but a worthwhile and enjoyable read none the less.	2005-03-17

Nightscape however is not a novel but a collection of short stories and Morrell is not in the same top of the writing ladder league for short stories as he is for novel writing.<br /><br />I found quite a few of the stories in Nightscape a bit of an effort to maintain interest in and keep reading as they just weren't that good.  Resurrection was by the far the best story in here tackling the issues of cryogenics and being frozen until they find a cure and what impact this has on the frozen one's family and ultimately the frozen one once they awaken.  If I Should Die Before I Wake was also fairly enjoyable but being that it was set during World War I you knew it was pure fiction therefore losing its believability factor.  The final and longest story Rio Grande Gothic about a policeman who is obsessed with finding the perpetrator who keeps leaving a pair of new shoes in the one spot on the highway is also fairly good but the other stories were nothing special.  Spend your money on Morrell's masterpiece novels instead of Nightscape and wait for Nightscape to become available at your local library.	2005-03-13

Trying to emulate other high profile authors of adult thrillers who have written successful children's picture books such as Dean Koontz, James Patterson falls long short of the mark. Santa Kid is the story of a girl named Chrissie who is the child of Santa and lives at the North Pole.  Some rich guy turns up to buy the place and even though Santa says Christmas is not for sale, on the next page without explanation the ruthless rich guy and his corportation owns the place.  It is up to Chrissie to bring back moral and save Christmas from the business corporation. About the only clever thing about this book is that the cover design resembles a present.<br /><br />A very weak story, like a lot of Patterson's recent work not much effort has been into this.  Patterson has written some sensational stuff in his days but this book is not one of them.  The illustrations by Michael Garland are pretty average as well and what a pathetic present on the last page.  If you want a good picture book for children written by a normally adult author buy Dean Koontz's masterpiece Santa's Twin instead.  Gary Larson's There's a Hair in My Dirt is another great children's picture book written by an author whose work is normally targeted at adults.	2005-03-08

In fact I'd hazard a guess as to say the other author Bill Montalbano wrote most of this and now that Hiaasen has become a household name the publishers are trying to cash in by putting Hiaasen's name at the top of the cover of thie rerelease.  The book is set in Florida, that is pretty much the only similarity I can see to the great Hiaasen novels such as Strip Tease, Double Whammy, Skinny Dip, Sick Puppy and Lucky You.  There's no surreal humorous likeable (or unlikeable) characters in here, no three or more separate storylines converging and crossing over each other, just no real fast paced enjoyment that we have to expect from Hiaasen.<br /><br />Don't waste your money.  Buy one of the masterpiece Hiaasen novels instead.	2005-03-05

I've only read two other books by David Morrell and this is very different in style as well as characters to Burnt Sienna and The Protector which were both sensational novels by the way if you haven't read them yet.  Long Lost is more like a non Myron Bolitair series Harlan Coben novel where the majority of the novel is a psychological thriller where you are really taken into the mind of the victim and feel like you are part of his up and down journey rather than a fast paced action hero thrill ride as the other two books I read were.<br /><br />Brad Denning made his little brother go home from a baseball game because he was cramping his style in front of his friends when they were both young kids.  Petey never made it home though, and now as an adult with a son Petey's age of his own, Brad is more surprised than anyone to run into his brother on the street who he had assumed was dead.  All Brad wants to do is make up for lost time and lavishes money and attention on Petey.  But all Petey wants is Brad's life and after attempting to murder Brad he kidnaps Brad's family.  Now Brad knows the anguish his parents went through and to make matters worse the FBI tell him that the man he thought was his brother is actually someone else.<br /><br />Long Lost is an extremely enjoyable fast read with extremely short chapters which make putting it down when you need to a breeze.  You won't want to put it down too often though.  My only criticism is that the book is a little bit predictable at times namely the ending but only drops it one star in quality it is still a sensational read.  The book is not as big as some of his other novels and is only about a third of the width at most of The Protector and Burnt Sienna if thickness is a judgement factor in your purchasing decision.  You should make a decision to purchase this great read though, you won't be disappointed.	2005-02-26

Maybe the Honeymoon of sensational can't put down, miss work, forget about TV until you've read the final page Patterson thrillers are over for good.  I hope not but recent novels including this one have not been up to masterpiece quality fans once enjoyed.  Although this is not a bad novel and most authors would be proud to call it one of their own, it just doesn't contain that fascination with its characters and riveting fast paced storylines you expect from the great serial killer creating mind of Patterson.<br /><br />Honeymoon introduces us to the beautiful serial killer Nora Sinclair who dates or marries rich men before killing them and transferring their money to her secret Cayman Island account.  Transferring large sums of money of course gets the attention of the FBI who realise a pattern of similar deaths to her husbands and decide to investigate through agent John Ohara who poses as a life insurance salesman with a promise of a million dollar settlement from her latest victim's secret will.  Not knowing if she is just the victim of unfortunate coincidence or a cold blooded killer John can't help but be tempted by her seductive powers.<br /><br />It's not a bad novel and if you get a cheap or free copy definitly read it.  One other thing that I didn't like about this book was that the first chapter is set way ahead in the future to most of the rest of the book so it gives away what will happen later and you are just hoping that scene will hurry up so you will have some mystery left.	2005-02-26

She seduces a pathetic Arthur Royden who is so grateful for sleeping with her that he does whatever she asks and steals top secrets plans for Drill Bit the world's newest and deadliest weapon.  She decides not to take it to her employers but instead to make a bit of cash on the side and sell it to the Israelis.  Of course the KGB aren't too happy about this and it is while fleeing a psychopathic KGB man she jumps into the passenger seat of private detective Sam Grant's car.  Sam Grant doesn't want anything to do with her but his girlfriend takes a liking to her so Sam is forced to hide her.  She just wants to cash in though so keeping her alive is a bit of problem for Grant.<br /><br />This novel is a bit dated in these Russia friendly days but the basis of the novel is still good and the book is an enjoyable and quick read.  Not the best Pattinson book out there but it is not bad.  If you can pick up a free copy it will certainly pass the time enjoyably.  Great Pattinson books worth departing with your money are The Animal Gang, Obituary for Howard Gray and Crane.	2005-02-26

Burnt Sienna has you turning pages until the early hours of the morning as you can't put it down.<br /><br />Malone an ex marine now full time painter has no choice other than to accept a demand by wealthy arms dealer Derek Bellasar to paint two portraits of his beautiful wife Sienna.  His CIA buddy informs Malone that Bellasar has had his previous wives painted too before murdering them and wants him to convince Sienna to escape with him and inform the CIA of everything she knows about her husband.  Upon arrival at Bellasar's French Riveria mansion compound Malone comes to quickly realise how little time Sienna has left and probably himself as well.  He also realises just how hard it will be to escape if he can convince Sienna to believe him and how hard it will be to hide on the outside world with Bellasar's resources if they do.<br /><br />A bit unrealistic at times but a non stop entertaining can't put down thriller non the less.  As well as The Protector also check out Morrell's novel Long Lost.	2005-02-26

If only more pet owners took responsibility before purchasing their pets and researched how big they would get, how their temperament is with children and other pets, how much they will cost in food and other expenses and how big a yard they really need to run around in then there wouldn't be so many dumped animals or feral once were pet animals running around in our national parks.  Whilst there are many decision helping and informative books out in the marketplace on dogs, cats, birds and fish, there has been a severe lack of information on the large reptilian pets that are growing in popularity.<br /><br />Thankfully Robert Mash has written an extremely helpful guide to dinosaur ownership complete with sensational photographs of humans interacting with their best friends around the house, out in the parks and on the sports fields. The photographs alone mean that even those who have no interest in owning a dinosaur will still be able to get great enjoyment from this book.  Those doing school assignments and others who wish to use this as a research book on the facts of different types of dinosaurs will find this a lot more entertaining and easier to read than most research books.  A must for any dinosaur lover.	2005-02-19

A few recent below average novels especially The Taking had many wondering if Dean Koontz could still produce the masterpiece novels he once did such as Watchers, Intensity and Night Chills to name but three and his latest novel Life Expectancy, is proof that he still can.  This is definitely a must read Koontz thriller which will have you staying home and turning the pages until you're finished.<br /><br />Life Expectancy starts with the birth of James Tock or Jimmy as everyone will call him. A fact his dieing grandfather predicts who incidentally dies at the exact same time as James' birth.  His grandfather has other predictions as well which he forced his son to write down with his last dying breaths of five dark days for his grandson.  One for detail, he also provides the dates but there is no time to contemplate this or grieve for his father as a mad clown is on a murderous rampage shooting everyone he comes across in the maternity ward where of course James has just been born.<br /><br />This is a sensational novel.  I also found it amusing that the main characters of a book where a timeline is so important have the last name Tock and a maiden name of Greenwhich which of course both are of major importance in time.	2005-01-30

This book is an extremely enjoyable and entertaining light read.  If you liked this also check out Syrup and if you haven't read Free Lunch by Sparling, get it too.

No in depth analyses of the stars or movies are in here although there are a few paragraphs on a select few.  How is George Clooney an action star?  It seems the author is gong for increased sales by including a popular star and favourite of many women but to say he is an action star, please.  Why this book is laid out like a textbook is anyone's guess.  I guess the publishers took one look at the substance and said there are better similar books out there in the entertainment category, such as 1000 Movies to Watch Before You Die, so we'll try something different and try for education but they failed.  Give this a miss.	2005-01-26

This is a sensational action packed thriller, the first novel I have ever read by David Morrell but it certainly won't be the last.  Books that you stay up until you literally fall asleep, forget about the TV and leaving the house until you have finished are rare these days but The Protector is one of those elusive literacy gems.  Just buy it! Warning though the back cover gives away a bit of the story so don't read it until you've read the book.<br /><br />The book is about a former Delta Force member, Cavanaugh who can't get over the high of the rush of being shot at etc so along with other ex agents works for Global Protective Services, a company where those who need protection and can afford it go for help.  One client a brilliant scientist named Prescott claims to be on the run from a South American drug barron who wants the scientist's formula which increases addiction.  At first after nearly being killed upon the initial meeting of assessing the client and barely making it to safety this scientist's story seems believable. Events then transpire which shine a new light on what Prescott really invented and whose side is he really on anyway?	2005-01-23

The title of this book was probably created by the publishing company's marketing department to appeal to kids and hence sell more copies but the book is obviously not written in a style for just children to enjoy.  It is simple and straight forward so is not complicated and children of any age will enjoy and learn from it but it does have enough detailed information that anyone interested in the origin of inventions just out of interest or conducting research for journalistic articles or university assignments would find it an excellent reference tool.  Inside you'll learn about the origins and inventors of false teeth (used to be taken from corpses), post it notes, toilets, toilet papers, snow mobiles and other stuff.  You'll also learn interesting pieces of trivia such as Walt Disney beat to death a sleeping owl when he was a kid and was so horrified by what he did that he decided to do what he could to help animals.	2005-01-23

This is another book you won't want to put down until the last page.<br /><br />In this adventure we are taken to Central America where a democratically elected president narrowly avoids death in his escape from a military coup.  Obviously he must remain in hiding to stay alive so when he is approached by a photographer with pictures of the current president and one of his blood thirsty ruthless general's wives naked together he believes he has a the ultimate life preserver so he can live a life without fear.  Of course men who have lived their whole lives through violence do not see it the same way as is evident when he receives a package containing a part of his daughter and demands for the photos in return for the rest of her.	2005-01-18

It fails miserably in its ability to keep you turning the pages, the main character Jennifer is just not that interesting and you really couldn't care less if she makes it with old childhood friend Brendan who like all bad 'chick flick' type books is dying of a disease, in this case a brain tumour.  The other main part of the story revolves around Jennifer discovering who the secret mystery lover was of her grandma Sam, who is lying in a coma whose letters Jennifer is now reading.  The book is boring and predictable is a severe understatement. It is just not worth spending even one cent on.  If you haven't read Suzan's Diary for Nicholas defiantly do so, but forget this rush job.	2005-01-17

This book is also two and a half to three times the size of your average novel so is also excellent value for money.  Like his two previous novels this one is also a great motivator, inspiring you to go out there and make money or at least achieve your dreams.<br /><br />This is the first Bingham novel to be a period piece. It starts off in 1893 with the journey set over the next fifty years or so spanning the two world wars, depression and everything else in between.  The wealthy Adam Montague's wife is giving birth to his second son as is by pure coincidence the wife of his gardener.  Unfortunately the gardener's son Tom is not an easy birth and with Tom's sister pleading for help at the Montague house she is told by Adam's oldest son Guy that the doctor will be by shortly.  Of course Guy sees no reason why their family doctor should assist the help, tells no one and goes to bed leaving Tom's mother to die a painful death.  Wracked with guilt the Montagues discipline Guy, adopt Tom and raise him alongside their new son Alan as if they were twins.  The boys are inseparable but not Guy, he sees Tom as the enemy.<br /><br />As the years go by it becomes apparent to Tom that he will not in fact get the same privileges when he is older that the biological boys will. His promise of a Persian oilfield is taken away from him by Adam and events in World War I highlight the divide so much that he decides to have nothing to do with the Montagues. Nothing however will stop him from achieving his dream of being an oil baron.  This also becomes Alan's dream and nothing will stop him either.  There can be only one oil king and sparks will fly.<br /><br />Sensational novel.  If you haven't read The Money Makers buy it now.  Sweet Talking Money although not quite the masterpiece of this book and The Moneymakers is also brilliant.  Get it too.	2005-01-11

This is a sensational book which covers the idea of Shrek, both movies Shrek 1 & 2 as well as behind the scenes stuff such as animation techniques and so forth.  You will learn all sorts of interesting trivia such as the sequel was originally going to be an election for the throne with candidates such as Pinocchio's policies being about honesty.  This is a very high quality book with nice paper making up the 173 pages, the makers haven't skimped on the quality at all, with heaps of illustrations and actual still frames from the movies it would make a sensational gift for any Shrek fan.  You do want to make sure you have seen both movies first because the book does go extremely detailed into the plots of both, it is an excellent book, there's not really anything negative that could be said about it.  It is a great book which will provide hours of enjoyment.	2005-01-09

The whole novel is extremely interesting and really lets the reader know the terror and hardships of the times written about.  I would recommend this novel to anyone along with other fine Pattinson novels such as Crane or The Animal Gang.<br /><br />Drake has lead a hard but interesting life that has seen him struggle at times to get by.  One day he comes across the obituary of the wealthy Howard Gray a man he had years ago tried to track down but could not find, a man who had betrayed and stolen his salvation from the hard life years ago.  The obituary does not mention a lot of Gray's past and Drake wonders if Gray's modern day family and friends knew those secrets or were totally unaware of the real character of Howard Gray.  This is how the book begins, then we the reader are taken back into the past and relive the lives of best friends Drake and Gray from their beginnings in the workplace where they have dreams of travelling the world, to their narrow escapes from death on ships in World War II and struggles throughout life together in the years after. When we know the whole story of their pasts and Gray's ultimate act of evil we are taken back to the present where Drake must decide if he will contact the widow of Howard Gray and find out if she knows the truth about her deceased husband.	2005-01-09

No this is not a hoax by Amazon, this book actually does exist and inside you'll find various hoaxes that have fooled governments, populations at large, journalists, internet users and well anyone who can be fooled.  The more recent ones such as the photo of the guy on top of the World Trade Centre with an American Airlines plane in the background you will no doubt have seen before but it is great to see how those hoaxes started and how many people they fooled. Some of the older hoaxes you may also have heard of as they have become legendary but there are heaps of them in here so it is doubtful you will have known them all.  This book also contains photographs (not colour) of hoax photographs and other illustrations.  It is a good interesting read and covers the entire globe not just the USA like other similar books.	2005-01-02

Kerry who needs to put on makeup every ten minutes and change clothes every hour is enraged when the conductor takes her vastly too large carry on to the baggage car from her whipped boyfriend who was struggling getting it onto the train.  When she goes to get it she finds the coffin of a recently deceased class member is also going to San Francisco. Even though she, Hannah and the rest of the gang had treated the kid they had forced the nick name of Frog onto like a social leper and made his life miserable she throws a tantrum about having to share the train with his corpse which much to her disgust gets her nowhere.  When the train enters its first tunnel and the Frog's girlfriend is found nearly strangled to death the terror begins for the gang of friends.  Hannah seems to be of special interest to the murderer but she won't tell her friends why.  It seems that Frog is not happily staying in his coffin and she and her friends are in grave danger.<br /><br />It was an enjoyable quick read and is ideal to read if you have to kill a few hours somewhere, maybe even at the train station.  You do have to overlook that surely after an attempted murder the train would be stopped at the next town and all suspects removed to an interview room with the local police but obviously they have to stay on the train for the story to happen.  I've caught the train from Chicago to San Francisco and it doesn't stop for a half a day in Denver either, it stops at places to refuel yes but not a whole morning and there's no way it would delay hundreds of passengers to wait for one teenager to reappear or not.  Also why they would expect the corpse of Frog to be in the very same coffin they rescued Hannah from seems to defy logic.  If you can overlook these things and accept the work as pure fiction then this is a very enjoyable read.	2004-12-26

Broken the secret adult pact and published confidential files telling kids the truth about various rules we adults have passed onto them under the misconception that these rules were for their own good.  David Wisniewski reveals the truth that the real reason we eat vegetables is to keep them in their place so they do not take over the world and eat us, instead of the lies we tell that vegetables are good for you.  Other secrets he reveals include the reason why grown ups say drink plenty of milk, that combing your hair is not to keep it neat, why you shouldn't blow bubbles in your milk, why you shouldn't play with your food, why you shouldn't jump on your bed, why you shouldn't bite your fingernails and why you shouldn't pick your nose.<br /><br />This book has been published with great illustrations made from cutting little bits of paper and gluing them into very detailed pictures.  The only thing that lets this book down for kids and thankfully saves us adults is that there are only a few myths unveiled.  This of course makes it extremely likely that David Wisniewski will release a sequel but you'd think if he had the secrets he could have made this book a bit thicker and included them in the one book.  As an adult I can only say that I hope the book is so thin because these are the only confidential files he has managed to steal.  Wait a minute he is an adult isn't he? So why does he even need the files since he already knows the answers.  I predict Mr Wisniewski's motives are not just to publish the truth for kids but to make money along the way and that this is the first in a planned series of sequels. I enjoyed this enough that I'll check them out as well.	2004-12-23

This collection of short stories fell very short of my expectations. Granted I had never heard of Joan Hess but the praise for Joan Hess reviews on the back all claimed she was an extremely funny writer so hence that is what I expected. Humour however is not contained within this novel, it is not that her jokes or comedy scenes weren't funny, it is just that they do not exist at all. This book is a B grade thriller but certainly not a humorous collection of stories. The quality of those stories as thrillers is also rather average. The stories are predictable and many an effort to stick with as well. Give this book a miss!	2004-12-16

What lets this book down apart from that there are only 12 animals (plus another eleven have a small paragraph on the back page as well) is that it reads like a textbook or school assignment.  This makes it an effort to get through if the reader, and lets fact it a large majority of non fiction picture books readers are kids, is not really interested and actively seeking information on each animal.<br /><br />This boring style is great for quotes in pieces of assessment but not for encouraging anyone to pick up the book and learn more about these and other animals.  If you're doing an assignment you're probably going to be borrowing this along with other books from the library where you'll find quotes and information anyway and not looking at purchasing it.  If you want interesting and entertaining or even 'cool' in the eyes of children writing style for this type of picture book get Youch! It Bites by Trevor Day or check out the Informania series, as if a reader whether a kid or adult is entertained along the way they are more likely to read the whole book and have the info they read actually sink in and retained.	2004-12-12

It is good though how each conspiracy has a paragraph written through the eyes of a sceptic on each conspiracy contained within.  Don't get me wrong, you will also learn some interesting facts you may not previously know about some of the conspiracies that may convince you their true.  I found that although they have the topics of some major conspiracies they do not have the actual more well known conspiracies about them.  For example the 9/11 one in this book does not mention at all the conspiracy that a plane did not actually crash into the Pentagon which is making the rounds on the Internet at the moment.  Nor does it mention the Philadelphia plane being shot down by the US air force to prevent it crashing into a Nuclear Powerplant/Capitol Hill which is believed by a substantial number of people.<br /><br />The other thing I think could have been improved in this book is the font colour and background selection. The Kurt Cobain, Extra-Terrestrials intro pages and others are impossible to read at night or if you are a bit tired with their faint grey text and black backgrounds.	2004-12-07

This is an excellent book which teaches you how to survive if you are unfortunate enough to crash somewhere, get shipwrecked, be in the middle of a natural/terrorist disaster or are lost in the wilderness.  Whilst I doubt you would be able to remember all this info if ever in trouble, if you take this book with you if going on multiple days hikes, or have it ready in the vehicle in case of road block by fire, someone getting bitten by a spider/snake or terrorist attack with a chemical agent the you'll be in better shape.  This book is excellent to help you prepare for natural disasters but I think you would have to have it with you when deciding which plants are good to eat, animals poisonous and so on if lost in the outback or forest.  The handy colour sketches are good but I doubt you'd remember them without the book.  The SAS Survival Handbook is a great guide which would be helpful to everyone for future survival as well as being an interesting read.	2004-12-06

To be honest it isn't as good as the Vampire book. It is written by a different author after all but it is still one of the best books on simple introductions to a horror topic I have come across.<br /><br />The book has five sections.  The first is a classic ghost story titled The Empty House by Algernon Blackwood which is a condensed version of the original tale.  The second section is old lady ghost hunter Dee Bunker's Ghost Hunter Scrapbook, in which she tells the tales of various investigations she has been on.  The National Museum of Phoney Ghosts is an excellent little package that makes up the third chapter.  A ghost named Sir Ghastlie Mones exposes the tricksters and con artists who have claimed to photograph or talk to ghosts and provides evidence of their trickery.  A ghost film guide is the fourth chapter reviewing different family movies containing ghosts from the silent to present era. What made the Informania Vampire book better than this was that it didn't just include movies rated for children.  The final ready reference section gives a timeline of different sightings, ways to avoid ghosts, and internet sites to find out more information.<br /><br />The Informania series are a great collection of easy to read but still extremely informative books written in an entertaining way that they will appeal to children as well as adults along with those with different reading levels.	2004-12-05

This isn't just a reference book of facts, although if you are researching for an assignment or something you could certainly use this book in that way and I can't think of a better book of facts for doing that.<br /><br />The beauty of this mammoth sized book is that each criminal analysed is written like a short story so what you've really got here is a collection of 865 non fiction short crime stories.  I also found it interesting when reading the information boxes on each execution for example James Billington was pretty much the sole executer no matter where the execution took place for the first couple of years before some of his assistants got a bit of work.<br /><br />There are also tables at the back of the book showing the statistics on which crime the death penalty was implemented for, and which country within Great Britain had the most executions.  There's also an index of the towns and their executions as well as a calendar so you can compare which day of the year is the most popular for executions.  This book is simply excellent.  No avid crime fan wether used to reading fiction or non fiction should pass up purchasing this masterpiece.	2004-11-28

Her voice attracts interest from someone who is actually listening and becomes obsessed, but is disappointed the real thing doesn't match what had been imagined by the voice.  This stalker decides to have some fun and teach Lily a lesson for being so misleading and ungrateful for the celebrity status the stalker has generously given her by the stalking actions.<br /><br />I thought this book was pretty average.  No literary events occur within that are memorable.  Look elsewhere for a quality stalking novel.	2004-11-22

Other efforts only seem to cover one era, assuming all good movies were made before colour or after a certain date but this monster sized collection spans movies from 1902 to 2002. This 960 paged collection contains 1001 movies, obviously they couldn't really call it 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die if it didn't. Not all of the greatest movies ever made are inside but then again the book is not claiming they are.<br /><br />I do wonder though why movies such as Friday the 13th are not included when so many other horror movies in here are compared to it. No matter what the basis for selection was the great thing about this book is that it doesn't just have movies that were made in Hollywood, no it recognises that a movie world exists outside of the USA and has great movies from all over the world, some are even languages other than English although at least 95% of them are English speaking ones.<br /><br />This is an excellent collection and a must for any movie fan. It is also great for you to get to know what a lot of those older DVD and videos in the $1 week sections of the local video store are actually about. After reading you'll have a desire to rent many and some you had heard the titles of before you may no longer want now that you know what the movies are actually about. An excellent present for any movie fan, although it would cost a bit to post.	2004-11-21

This book is full of colour photographs and illustrations as well.  It did come out before 2005 (I am writing this review in November 2004) so obviously the book is not entirely up to date for 2005.  It is still great though and an excellent source of trivia questions or answers to friendly bets.	2004-11-20

Chapter two covers Coincidence or Destiny, chapter three Not-So inanimate Objects, chapter four Spooks, Specters and Witches with the final fifth chapter covering Just Plain Weird.  Every chapter has a quiz with a final larger quiz at the end of the book. There are also six colour pages in the middle with great photographs.<br /><br />Inside you learn interesting information such as the Titanic carried an Egyptian mummy that everyone who had come in contact with had previously died, did it sink because of the mummy's curse?  Two brothers were killed a year apart by the same taxi with the same passenger is another fascinating fact this book teaches.  I don't want to give anything else away lets just say this is an excellent easy to read book.

While nothing in here would be considered a masterpiece, unlike most collection of stories where on or two are sensational and the rest average all in this collection are enjoyable enough.  Healy writes in a straight forward style with these stories, there are no twists at the end, you know what is going to happen but the characters are interesting enough that the journey there is what it is all about.  The title story is the longest and probably could have been a bit shorter about a police officer whose room in next door to a homicide and gets roped in by the inexperienced local force.  In fact all the stories in here pretty much deal with murder or crime in one way or another.  Next Season is the story of an avid scuba diver getting over his cheating wife, Proportionate Response has two thieving kids picking the wrong victim when they steal a canoe, Habits has a bank robbery baffling the law, City Life deals with a stalker in a gym with a lone female worker,  Him Gone Good is the way a cat deals with its owner's boyfriend who is cheating on his wife, Hero deals with a low IQ'd court officer who is propositioned by a mafia wife to kill her husband, The Safest Little Town in Texas deals with another dimwit criminal who thinks he has stumbled upon the ultimate town to commit an armed robbery and Rotten to the Core has an apple farmer seeing his future go down the drain as his widowed mother is being talked into unprofitable ways by a new attractive male worker.<br /><br />Off-Season is a good enough read if you're stranded in airport or somewhere and want something easy and quick to read.	2004-11-13

He has grown up in a house tapped by the FBI where his last name gets him all sorts of privileges out of fear of his father.  Vince however does not want to lead a life of crime and wants nothing to do with his family's business the mafia.  One night Vince thinks he's about to score on a date but when he goes to get a blanket out of his car's trunk he discovers a body.  This kind of thing for some reason puts his date off and Vince does not see any action.  A few weeks later and along with his best friend Alex who can't get a girl either, he attracts the eye of a beautiful student journalist named Kendra. Head lice bring them together in her father's house where Vince learns her dad's an FBI agent.  Later he learns the very same agent who is bugging his house.  What is a reluctant son of the most feared crime family to do?<br /><br />This is a very easy to read, fast and simple novel.  Whilst the ending does seem to be rather open ended, probably in the hope of a go ahead from the publishers for a sequel the book is extremely entertaining.  I'll definitely be checking out more work by this author.	2004-10-29

It does drag on in a few scenes for too long but the worst and unforgivable factor is that the story does not end and key plot facts the reader was anticipating having answered by the conclusion are not.<br /><br />I can't really explain this without giving away the plot so if you haven't read the book don't continue reading this review, just be warned the book does not give you closure.<br /><br />We never find out exactly why these six were brought to the island at all.  Were they there to be murdered after their nightmares had been played out by the guy who gave them coffee at the interview?  Was the guy in the attic actually the kidnapper or was he part of the project and murdered by the kidnapper or just there to monitor the situation and take notes before the actual kidnappers or owners of the company arrived?  What did he actually die of, was it really a heart attack that a few of them suspected or was it more sinister?  Was there actually really a job at the end of it for one of them after the experiment was over or were they all to be killed?  Was he there to actually torture them with their worst fears or help them overcome them?  Was the boat with his corpse ever found?  Were they ever rescued or did they starve to death when the food ran out?  Did they start to go insane when the food supply got low and kill each other?  Did the others ever find out Jamie did not attach the note to the corpse and did they kill him when they realised they would die because of him?  So many questions that go unanswered, you could understand if this was part one and there is a sequel but this is not mentioned anywhere in the book.<br /><br />It is so frustrating that you turn the last page and have no idea what happens to them or the true reason why they were taken there that I will never bother investing my money buying another Scarlett Thomas novel or energy into reading another one as I do not know if her other novels do not give closure either.  If you want to read an excellent novel about sinister things happening to people who apply to job advertisements read the masterpiece the Ax by Donald E Westlake.son why they were taken there that I will never bother investing my money buying another Scarlett Thomas novel or energy into reading another one as I do not know if her other novels do not give closure either.

The only problem is that the majority of them are so easy that even someone who has seen only a few episodes will have no trouble answering them.  The book is divided into Homer level (easy) Marge Level (no difference to Homer level) and Lisa Level.  The 100 Lisa level questions are the only ones that regular viewers may be challenged by.  So hence that is what you are buying, a book of 100 questions not 1000.  It almost seems this is a rush job by the authors trying to rush an idea into the market before an official version comes out.  Buy the Simpsons Guide to Springfield or other better quality Simpsons books instead to gain a better knowledge of everyone's favourite yellow family.	2004-10-24

This is an average skeleton outlining the plot of what may well be an enjoyable novel when the author gets round to writing it. Only problem is somehow this plot idea skeleton has been published as the actual finished novel when it clearly lacks substance. This plot outline is about an art expert who witnesses a colleague she doesn't much like get hit by a car. Someone steals his briefcase and she stupidly decides to tail the thief to an apartment and steal the briefcase for herself. Now not really explained proplerly in the story this woman was somehow set up to do just what she did and is taken at gunpoint to a mansion where she has to validate the painting inside the briefcase as a real priceless Raphael. Although the characters are not really explained in any depth the family in the mansion is at war with other parts of the extended family and she ends up out of the blue sleeping with the daughter of the owner of the house for no apparent reason other than the author probably has some lesbian bedroom fantasies he wants to put on paper. She has to somehow figure out how to get the Raphael into safe museum hands and survive.<br /><br />This short story (it is only 80 less than half the size of A4 pages of above normal sized font) is like a primary school child's effort at writing a story. Well actually I'm sure they can do better. Out of the blue suddenly one character is interacting with another as if they've known each other all their lives with no explanation as to how they even know each other or character development at all. I won't waste my time or money on other poor literacy efforts by this author.	2004-10-18

Ian Dotti is not the brightest of agents and sends back reports on blood sucking insects, birds and other creatures which Sophia Smart researches and presents archived photographic and detailed files of.

Section four of the book is the author's opinion of the best 24 hours of Vampire films and television programs ever made.

Also in this section is information on items handy to have to prevent having your blood sucked by vampires and other blood suckers as well as how to dispose of unwanted creatures who like blood beverages.

Some of these stories have appeared in other compilation thriller author short story novels so you may have read them before.  Most of these were written at least thrity years ago.  Like any collection of stories the quality varies across the range as well as the subject matter.  Science fiction fans are catered for well here with aliens, genetic engineering gone wrong, an alternative dimensions.  Twilight of the Dawn contrasts what the emptiness of life is like without anything to believe in.  Fans of serial killers are catered for with Chase although you are likely to have already read this one as a stand alone novel either under the pseudonym K.R. Dwyer or Koontz's own name.  The other lengthy story is the title track, Strange Highways. Not one of my favourites but you may like it.  My favourites and ones I would rate five stars are The Black Pumpkin, Miss Attila the Hun, Trapped, Kittens (his first ever published work) and Twilight of the Dawn.<br /><br />There is also a commentary by Koontz on how publishers do not encourage short story writing and how hard it is for them to be published which is quite interesting.<br /><br />Whilst not the masterpieces that some of his novels like Mr Murder, Watchers, Intensity, Night Chills and some others are the stories in here are still a great and satisfying read.	2004-10-17

Major villain The Wolf forces previous evil diplomatic immunity serial killer and one of my all time favourites British Colonel Geoffrey Shafer, aka The Weasel, to join his team, reaping mass murder and havoc across the USA and Europe.<br /><br />The Wolf a James Bond type super villain who no one knows anything about let alone the true identity of is threatening major terrorist attacks in four major Western cities if ransom is not paid.  When it becomes apparent the Wolf has nuclear weapons and will not hesitate to use them it is up to Alex to find him and capture him before the final deadline.<br /><br />This is an enjoyable thriller but like I previously said, it is a little bit unrealistic and more James Bondish than previous Cross novels.  The final chapters also seem to be a bit rushed and would have been more enjoyable and easier to understand if what happened was expanded over a few more.  Tracking psychopathic serial killers was a little more believable for Alex than saving the world but London Bridges is a great read and a must for any Patterson or Alex Cross fan.	2004-10-17

Discovering that she left her watch behind after a massage, Bailey discovers the dead body of a beautiful masseuse wrapped mummy style in silver paper.  Bailey proceeds to investigate the murder but discovers a lot of things others do not want uncovered, putting herself in extreme danger.<br /><br />A good story with a great female lead character.  The ending however is a little too convenient and it is not real likely the police force would respond in the way they do upon just hearing what they do, which is all that drops this great book from five to four stars.  Highly recommend read.  I'll definitely check out other novels by Kate White.	2004-10-13

Like with all of Hiaasen's masterpieces, Strip Tease has simultaneous stories occurring where all characters cross paths at some time.  You've got your unethical lawyers, corrupt and stupid politicians and their criminal advisors/minders.  Sleazy strip club owners, a floor manager named Shad who doesn't mind insurance fraud but would die to protect his work colleague strippers.  Then there's Erin Grant, a stripper who is just trying to make enough money to gain legal custody of her daughter whose violent ex husband steals wheel chairs and wants to punish her by keeping custody of Angela at all costs. Detective Garcia who also appears in the novel Double Whammy along with all these great characters make for one of the best Hiaasen novels ever written, taking the reader on a ride of murder, blackmail and behind the scenes strip club and corrupt puppet politics.<br /><br />Buy Strip Tease and if you loved this also get the other masterpieces, Sick Puppy, Hoot, Lucky You and Stormy Weather.  Any Hiaasen novel in fact is a great read and a worthwhile purchase.	2004-10-12

Not so with Nightmare Hour as the cover for this book is the reason I recommend purchasing it.  The eyes of the creature on the front of the hard cover edition where the numerals of a clock surround the face are sensational and change colour when the light reflects at different angles, giving the book a pure evil characteristic.  When you walk past it the eyes light up or go red. It is truly amazing and seriously forget the contents inside, the effect is so good I recommend purchasing this book for the cover alone.  If the version you are buying does not have this face with eyes, look for this version, even if it is more expensive as it is more than worth it.<br /><br />The actual stories inside aren't the most realistic or graphic of horror stories, they are written at a level similar to a children's cartoon where magic happens and children are always the heroes and the central characters of the stories.  Most stories are fairly predictable but all are enjoyable.  There are ten stories in all, each of differing quality. Subjects covered include vengeance for a pumpkin farmer on Halloween vandals, witches, medieval sorcerers, clowns, ghosts, clairvoyant masks, werewolves, aliens and hospital visits.  As I said before the cover is the main thing you must ensure you get upon purchasing this book. It alone is worth the five stars.	2004-10-12

Making a novel about fishing entertaining is a mammoth task, but Hiaasen has achieved just that.  Double Whammy doesn't start off as fast a pace as his other novels but once ex governor now wilderness living hermit Skink comes on the scene the pace quickens and never drops off. Fans of this character from some of his later novels will learn how one of his most interesting facial features happened. I won't give away what that characteristic is for those who have not read those novels or are reading this as a stand alone but for those who have read newer adventures it is really interesting to know, and purchasing Double Whammy to read how it happened is worth the price alone.<br /><br />Police officer Jim Tyle from most novels with skink is back in this one too as well as Officer Garcia from the novel Striptease.  Queenie the world's biggest Bass, some dim-witted fishing tv show hosts with huge egos, a shonky on air priest/Floridian property developer and a low IQ'd hit man who forms a close relationship with a bulldog accompany private R.J. Decker in making this a memorable read.<br /><br />Whilst Skink and other characters may have become more developed in later novels this is still a sensational read.  Also check out Hiaasen's masterpieces Sick Puppy, Hoot, Skinny Dip, Striptease, Lucky You and others as well.	2004-10-10

These aren't scary stories you would tell sitting around a campfire while out in the wilderness.  They don't have anything whatsoever to do with camping, serial killers, ghosts or anything that would either fit under the Spine-Tingling claims of the title or what you would picture would be in a campfire story collection. Most of these stories are set in the snow or ice, how many families or couples go camping in the snow or in Antarctica?  Tales of historic explorers or pioneers in wagons and stuff like that is not what most what most people attracted by this title want to read about.  What does a tidal wave in a seaside town have to do with camping?  The only one that could be even remotely have something to do with the wilderness is the bear attack, although not of camper but of a scientist. Even that story stops before the attack does, obviously she survives because she's telling the story but some details of the rescue and aftermath would have been nice.<br /><br />The only thing I can see that the title of this book must be referring to be would be that the pages of this book would be good to keep the campfire going to keep you warm for an extra few minutes.  This book is an excellent example of great successful marketing, the title would sell a heap of copies no doubt, but it is not very ethical marketing to mislead and promise one thing then deliver something totally different to what that title promises.  Hopefully this review will stop others being ripped off.	2004-10-02

Why didn't I really like this book?  It's boring! I thought this book would either be one of two things, a book full of interesting funny tales of things that had gone wrong for actual travels or evidence as to how the airlines are ripping off consumers, how they are cutting costs and stuff like that.  Instead this book is just some slow North American with the IQ of a rock's attempt to compare the marketing world to airlines.  This guy is so arrogant and stupid that he doesn't even check first if he needs a tourist visa before visiting another country then complains just because he is a Canadian that he should get special treatment and not have to go through what people from every other country do.<br /><br />He has obviously come across a basic marketing textbook somewhere but never bothered to get anyone who has actually studied or worked in marketing to explain the terms to him as he's a long way off most of the time.  For some reason he isn't even prepared to stand by his comments and deliberately misspells every airport or airline he is complaining about so he won't get sued.  This gets really annoying extremely fast.

Hiaasen writes simultaneous stories in the one novel where the characters all cross paths at different times.  Unethical and criminal characters get their comeuppance like in all his other novels but the setting in the aftermath of a hurricane just makes Stormy Weather a bit more realistic than his other novels.  I was extremely tempted to not go to work once I had started this book because it is so hard to put down.  My advice is to start reading this when you have a weekend free or something as once you start reading the first page you're addicted to the fast paced surreal storyline.<br /><br />In Stormy Weather a hurricane hits southern Florida wiping out trailer parks, houses and anything in its path.  Looters and con artists are of course drawn like magnets trying to prosper from the victims, as are honeymooners Max and Bonny Lamb.  Max drags his reluctant new bride to the devastation so he can get it all on film to impress his yuppie friends back in New York but disappears while following an escaped monkey.  Ex governor now living in the wilderness Skeet knows where he is as he has taken him prisoner to teach him some lessons.  Meanwhile a dishonest caravan salesman is planning on how to survive the vengeance of his customers who have lost their homes and their loved ones while con artist roofing contractors take deposits and never return to their victims until they rip off the wrong people.<br /><br />Other masterpiece level Hiaasen novels are Sick Puppy, Lucky you and Skinny Dip.	2004-10-02

Extreme Odds just wasn't as entertaining as Spare Parts even though it had the same ex cop character Adam McCleet.<br /><br />In this novel McCleet accompanies his friend to the country of Bob, a country newly formed on an Indian reservation by his friend's son Buddy who is a real estate developer.  Bob has attracted over 200 immigrants most of which have their own agendas.  There's the hemp growing female farmer, gun fanatic, religious cult leader, casino/radio operator and many others as well.  Buddy is about to open his own bank where he is about to launch his own currency swapping US dollars for Bobs, but murderers have their own plans which make the situation in Bob extremely personal for McCleet.	2004-09-28

The classic simultaneous story telling following the adventures of different characters that all link up and cross paths at sometime during the novel is again brilliantly done here.<br /><br />The last two blue tongue voles on the face of the planet are stolen from the Amazing Kingdom of Thrills, a Florida theme park by two dim-witted thieves working on behalf of an old lady named Molly and the Mothers of the Wilderness.  Joe Winder is the public relations man for the park who is being disillusioned by the greedy unlawful ways of his boss Francis X. Kingsbury.  He stumbles upon the truth that the bluetongues were not really what they seemed to be in the first place and is fired with a death sentence on his head to be carried out by the park's steroid addicted ex corrupt cop security guard.  What follows is an excellent war of duelling media releases with Joe determined to cause as much damage to the park as he can. When he crosses paths and becomes an ally with an ex governor living in the wilderness as an environmental protector now calling himself Skink the battle reaches new heights.<br /><br />This is another classic Hiaasen adventure that you have to own.  Other great Hiaasen novels are Hoot, Skinny Dip, Lucky You and Sick Puppy to name but a few.	2004-09-26

Obviously the author is really into what she believes in but when you buy a novel you want it to be believable. The characters making up this town by all being obsessed with religion just don't represent any small town society on the face of this planet and do not make for a believable novel. It shouldn't matter what an author's interests, hobbies, beliefs or any other characteristic are, they need to be able to set their books in the real world, not their ideal one. If the town people had been more realistic then this would have been a sensational novel. The basics are there, somehow this slipped through without the editor seeing it. Having snuck through in it's current form results in this books poor rating.<br /><br />It is a good basic plot, religious fanatics who run a shelter for rehabilitating ex cons are murdered while fighting the local council who want the place shut down. Evidence points to the husband (Jonathan Cleary) of one of the daughters (Morgan). The husband suspects an ex con named Gus but the husband is behind bars. The religious police chief suspects everyone and seems more concerned with the daughters than solving the case. Meanwhile a teenage runaway Sadie is on the run from her violent step father and comes to Cape Refuge.<br /><br />The main problem with this book is that religion is rammed down the reader's throat at every opportunity. Every character in the book says at some time I'll pray for you or has a scene where they are actually praying. One or two characters would be believable but a whole town, come on. God's plan is mentioned by most characters and all are trying to convert the other sister Blair who does not believe in their faith to mend her ways. Obviously you can work out what the author had happen here. It is a real shame the author cannot separate her fantasy world to the real one. You should be able to pick up a novel written by a Christian, Jewish person, Atheist, Hindu, Muslim or whatever without them constantly cramming religion down your throat. If you wanted this you'd buy the bible or biblical character fiction. This would have been a great book but with the unrealistic setting it isn't too good. The author maybe needs to get out a bit in the real world and meet people in other social situations besides church. The editor needs to do their job as well. Like I said, I don't care what religion an author is, I don't discriminate in who I read. She's got the basics right, and with more realistic characters representing the broader range of every day society and this would be a great read. At the very least, a warning of the author's religious obsession needs to be put on the cover, so readers are aware of the obsession, before they pick the book up off the shelf and part with their hard earned money.one.

Hoot is marketed as Hiaasen's first novel for children but there is really no difference between Hoot and his other novels other than that some of the main characters in this book are school aged children and the book is about half the thickness of his other work.  This is actually one of my favourite Hiaasen novels and this will be enjoyed by any Hiaasen fan no matter what age they are.<br /><br />This book is written in the usual fast paced, witty, surreal Hiaasen style with simultaneous stories where the characters all cross paths at one time or another.  In this one Roy Eberhardt, son of a father who is constantly transferred to different locations across the USA isn't enjoying his new location Florida, too much at all.  Like everywhere else bullies are picking on him and while being bullied on the school bus by Dana Matherson, he observes a strange boy running down the street.  Fascinated, he decides to find out more about the boy, of course Dana won't leave him alone to accomplish this easily.  Meanwhile police officer Delinko, a nice but not the brightest officer on the force is investigating constant acts of vandalism against a construction site for the 469th Mother Paula's Pancakes restaurant.  Along the way the reader will come across dim witted site foreman Curly, unethical public relations agent Chuck Muckle and a bunch of other interesting characters including some nice little ground nesting owls.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book along with Hiaasen's other novels such as Sick Puppy, Skinny Dip and Lucky You as well.  I also highly recommend the [[ASIN:B000GB5MH4 DVD movie]] of this book. It sticks fairly close to the novel which is extremely rare these days and also has an interview with Hiaasen in the special features.  Hiaasen also comentates the bonus commentary version of the film as well.	2004-09-19

This is the fourth book by Hiaasen I have read and like two of the others it is another great and entertaining read.  Sure you know basically what's going to happen, but like any good comedy you are glued to each page wanting to know how the characters get there.  Hiaasen writes simultaneous stories where the characters all cross paths at one time or another.  In this one Joey Perrone is thrown off the back of a cruise sheep by her husband who is sure she will drown in the ocean and that he will get away with the perfect crime.  Of course he has forgotten she was on the swim team in high school but instead of simply going to the police she pretends to be dead so she can screw with her husband's mind before she gets the ultimate vengeance.<br /><br />Skinny dip is an excellent book as are Hiaasen's novels Sick Puppy and Lucky You.  I'll definitely be checking out more of his work.	2004-09-13

His previous novel Odd Thomas was also well below par and hopefully this second below average novel in a row is not a sign that the days of Koontz's great masterpieces of literature are over.  I mean Molly and Neil Sloan are just not interesting characters. Reading the novel I really just couldn't care less if they were successful, lived or died.  A bit more action was really needed throughout.  The Taking was more like some philosophical argument Koontz was trying to put across rather than a well written, can't be put down until the last page thriller like we are used to. If The Taking wasn't a Dean Koontz novel I would not have even bothered finishing it.  It almost seems as if he has writers block and is publishing some average author's work under his own name.  The whole point of the aliens visitation is never justified or explained properly, it seems if Koontz is the author of The Taking he may be on vacation or something, with contractual obligations to fill and just quickly put something together.<br /><br />I'd rather see one or two novels a year of a higher quality then a larger number of unenjoyable low quality books.  Koontz is one of the greatest writers of the modern era and it is a shame he is obviously not putting the same amount of effort into his latest work as he did with his masterpieces.  He has created some of the best books ever written such as Watchers, Night Chills and Dark Rivers of the Heart to name just three but The Taking is a waste of money.  Buy a previous novel instead.	2004-09-12

Note I did read that first so it does maybe taint my opinion of this book as certain key plot developments from this book were given away in First Degree so I would highly recommend reading Open and Shut first.<br /><br />Open and Shut is a brilliant novel which introduces the sensational character Andy Carpenter.  He is a fast mouthed, witty lawyer who talks to automated voices in lifts and carparks and always has some clever comeback to give acquaintances and those he has to deal with.  Although I think the character is perfected in his next book, Andy Carpenter is still sensational in this one.  He is very similar to Harlan Coben's Myron Bolitar character.  If you liked this novel check out that series, Myron is a version of Andy in the world of Sport Agents.  Anyway back to this novel, Andy's father was a prosecutor and upon his death bed told Andy to look into a case where he successfully put away Willie Miller who is now on death row.  Andy does and quickly learns there are lots of secrets by lots of evil men who do not look favourably at a retrial of the man they have framed.  What follows is an enjoyable thrill ride where Rosenfelt balances the more interesting outside world with the courtroom resulting in a great read.  Buy this and the sequel First Degree as well!	2004-09-12

Go Straight to Your Wallet and Buy This!	Everyone has a Monopoly set somewhere at home.  If you're like me your set of instructions disappeared long ago and was only a sheet of paper with small font at best anyway.  This book explains all the rules in great detail.  I never knew there was a limit on the number of houses and hotels and that when there aren't enough green houses you couldn't just fork out the monetary value for a hotel.  The age old debate of does free parking collect all the taxes and whoever lands on it gets the money is answered as well.  The answer is no by the way.  This is a great handy guide for any arguments about the rules.<br /><br />Even if you already know all of the rules this is still a pretty good purchase.  Inside is a heap of trivia such as the names of all the characters on the board and cards, the fact that Parker Bros prints 50 billion dollars of Monopoly money each year and the fact that on average each player makes about $175 dollars around the board. A comparison of the Monopoly properties and what those streets are actually like in the real Atlantic City both when the game was invented and today is very interesting reading along with the predecessors to Monopoly and other historical information.  There are also tips on how to play from Mr Monopoly including which are the best properties to purchase.  This is an excellent little book for anyone who enjoys playing the best board game ever invented.	2004-09-12

The cover probably does not do this sensational book justice in reaching its target audience.  The cover design of this book makes it look like a program you would pick up at a travelling carnival and like the book only appeals to kids.  Whilst this book is definitely very kid friendly and would be a great present for children it is also a great book of facts for adults.  There are plenty of great photographs and sketches some even from classic movies.  I had no idea that Mary Shelley only came up with the idea for Frankenstein because she was playing a game with a group of friends during a lightning filled stormy night where they competed against each other on who could tell the best horror story and debated if lighting could start a life, since they knew it could end it.  This is just one of the many interesting facts contained within.<br /><br />This sensational book is an excellent introduction to the horror world for any beginner reader as well an excellent source of horror related trivia for the serious horror fan.

You think legal thriller or courtroom drama and the word usually boring comes to mind but Rosenfelt has found the balance between court room chapters and the more exciting outside world for events to happen in for the story to lose no substance.  Andy Carpenter is a funny extremely likeable character, sort of like Harlan Coben's Myron Bolitar character, where Carpenter has to think on his feet to avoid either being killed, beaten up or outplayed in the courtroom making wisecracks at his opponents along the way.  Dean Koontz style Rosenfelt gives Carpenter a loyal lovable golden retriever by his side as well.<br /><br />After a man confesses to the murder of Carpenter's girlfriend's arch enemy Carpenter faces an ethical dilemma of what to do as an innocent man faces trial.  Oh and the innocent man also is a guy much hated by his girlfriend and ex cop Laurie.  Much to the disgust of Laurie he decides to represent the guy but quickly learns this is only the start of his nightmare as Laurie also faces charges for the brutal murder.  You won't be able to put this one down.	2004-08-29

Basket Case was very different in style to those books and I don't think was anywhere near the quality level that those two books were at.<br /><br />Basket case is written as a through one character's eyes story, where with Hiaasen's other books there was five or six stories happening simultaneously where the characters ultimately come across one or other.  That aspect missing from this novel made it rather mundane and boring.  The lack of journalistic knowledge by Hiaasen for his main character Jack Taggart who was supposed to be a great journalist was something I immediately picked up on being a journalist myself as the articles written by the character weren't using journalistic style. The inverted pyramid was not followed, where the most important information is at the beginning with the story's less important information following so that editor can cut it anywhere with the story still making sense.  The lead paragraphs were very weak and wouldn't have made readers read on. His stories would not have made it to print at any even average newpaper. That's just something I picked up upon and if you're not a journalist maybe it wouldn't bother you.  I wouldn't have really cared about that if it was a light, entertaining read like Hiaasen's other work but to be honest I just found this book rather boring.<br /><br />Definitely read Lucky You and Sick Puppy though, they are masterpieces.	2004-08-29

Hiaasen has a knack for novels where the stupid an immoral get their comeuppance and the reader gets lots of laughs and satisfaction along the way.  I'm going straight to the bookstore and getting another Hiaasen novel as soon as I've finished this review, he's that good!<br /><br />JoLayne Lucks works as a vet in a small Florida town called Grange.  Grange's town folk are a bit eccentric and not opposed to conning passing travellers to stop by and see their Madonna statue weep, the oil stain Jesus or marvel at the electric drilled hand and foot holes that are supposed to be a mark of the crucifixion.  JoLayne couldn't be more opposite, she turned down a higher paying career in hospitals to help out animals and recently rescued 45 turtles from land which was going to be turned into a shopping mall. One day she wins the lottery, unfortunately so do a couple of redneck low IQ'd  racists who can not see any reason why they should have to split their winnings, so after a violent assault take JoLayne's ticket as well.  Accompanied by a disillusioned journalist JoLayne is determined to get the ticket back before it is cashed in.

Although this is a sequel to the two authors' novel Monkeewrench, Live Bait could easily be read as a stand alone novel.  Monkeewrench is also a great book though, and the outcome and some key events of that novel are given away in Live Bait so I would highly recommend reading Monkeewrench first because once you've read this book you'll want to check out the authors' previous work and you'll enjoy Monkeewrench so much more without knowing the outcome.<br /><br />In Livebait, Minneaolis homicide detectives Magozzi and Rolseth have their boredom relived by a serial killer who is murdering the elderly night after night.  These sweet old people seem to have no enemies and are loved by the community, either have a cat, love baking for the grandkids, gardening or other typical retired generation activities.  Most of these victims also have survived concentration camps in World War II Germany meaning the killer seems to have no heart at all. Minneapolis police want this murderer bad and enlist the help of grace MacBride and her Monkeewrench computer invention to find a motive and help catch the killer.<br /><br />This novel is extremely well written and full of great plot developments.  I liked Monkeewrench, but this novel is an even higher literacy league.  I can easily seeing this becoming a box office smash movie down the track, of course a movie will never be as good as your imagination reading it in this book.  This novel could have probably been written as a stand alone novel outright not including the Monkeewrench element and giving away the plot of that book for people who have not read would be my only criticism.  But they'll probably sell more copies of this book being that it is a sequel which means more people will get to read this literacy masterpiece which is maybe for the greater good.	2004-08-23

High Crimes certainly started off extremely well and for the first quarter of the book you are on a non stop thrill ride but the next three quarters of the book are set in and around a court room and a military one at that which isn't as exciting.  That's not to say the remainder of the book isn't well written and clever, it is just not as exciting as the first part.  I'm not really into American court room fiction, I usually change the channel after the first half of Law and Order but I stuck with it until the end of this book.  It is a satisfactory, no holes in the storyline good read although the ending is very predictable, and if your fan of this genre I would definitely recommend it, but I can't really compare High Crimes to Grisham or other writers of this kind of thing as courtroom fiction doesn't interest me.  If you are however only thinking about getting this because you loved Paranoia, just be aware it is not the same sort of thing.	2004-08-21

Fred Fitch is the ultimate mark, mark being target for con artists.  He is constantly taken advantage of by strangers who can somehow see the word gullible written on his forehead.  After years of being taken advantage of Fred is starting to think first before acting, well most of the time.  So when he receives a phone call stating he has inherited half a million dollars (over three hundred thousand after tax) from his uncle Matt who he has never even heard of he knows he is being taken for a ride, so calls his friend who is a cop to meet him at the office of the caller.  To his surprise the inheritance is genuine but that does not mean the con artists will stop now he has the inheritance.  If anything more of them will come out of the woodwork as well as thugs and killers who want the inheritance money, you see his uncle was also a con artist and he stole from some heavyweights in the South America crime scene.<br /><br />This is another great classic Westlake novel, as is another from that era Killy.

He quickly learns the previous owner of the number Lilly, was quite a popular girl, that she is a prostitute and that she is probably in quite a bit of trouble.  Pierce's sister was killed by a serial killer on the streets so he wants to track Lilly down and help her before it is too late.  He is not opposed to breaking and entering, computer crime, fraud or anything else to find Lilly.  Of course the type of lifestyle Lilly leads means she has associates who do not look kindly at their world being investigated. The police also do not seem to understand why a man like Pierce would be interested in a girl like Lilly who he has never met.<br /><br />This is one of those sensational novels that you just do not want to put down until you have read the final page.	2004-08-15

This novel is similar in style to a Dean Koontz thriller with a psychologically disturbed hitman, faithful dog, and likeable characters and you just can't put it down until the last page.  Just buy it!<br /><br />Twilly Spree inherited a lot of money and instead of investing it in his father's real estate development company spends his time defending mother nature from thoughtless slobs and environmental vandals.  If he sees you throw a lit cigarette, aluminium can or other rubbish out of your car window he will come after and teach you a lesson.  If you intentionally harm wildlife, he will intentionally harm you.  One thoughtless slob named Palmer Stoat infuriates Twilly with his blatant disregard for the environment with rubbish constantly flying out his car window so Twilly decides to teach him a lesson.  Stoat is a rather dim witted slow learner so Twilly decides to kidnap his dog until he mends his ways.  Twilly quickly discovers that Palmer Stoat is a corrupt politician who will destroy the ecosystem and all the inhabitants of Toad Island in return for developer's money.  He must stop this at all costs but politicians, evil Barbie obsessed developers and their deranged hit men will go to any lengths to develop Toad Island.	2004-08-08

Isolation is now a major factor being confined to his holding pen on board a giant spacecraft where the Velenjii (aliens who abducted him) barely communicate with him.  After a while he is aloud out into the grand enclosure, a sort of prison yard which links the cells, where he meets a dog from earth who he names George and many other aliens from different planets.  He quickly learns that himself and the other cargo will be sold as slaves and are being psychologically experimented on around the clock before they reach their destinations.  Just like in an earth prison there are captives who are friendly and those that are not, as well as those who will squeal on him to the Velenjii if he does anything against the rules.  There are also of course visions of escape.  The only thing is where can you escape to when there is nothing beyond the ship but outer space?<br /><br />This is an interesting book which tackles alien abduction and slavery.  The major thing I thought was overlooked was why the Velenjii only abduct one or two species from each planet.  Surely it would make better economic sense to abduct multiple numbers of the higher value creatures.  I also would have liked a more satisfactory ending and would have liked the Velenjii's point of view chapters to have continued throughout the book then just ending where they did.  There are better books out there but this is a satisfactory read.<br /><br />The first I have heard that this is book 1 of something called The Taken Trilogy according to the title in Amazon.  It does not say this on the actual book anywhere.	2004-08-01

Not deterred by this Spencer still decided to help Valerie who is being trailed by Roy Miro, a man who has access to a super government computer called Mama which can delve into and operate any other computer in the world such as the EPA's video satellite that can pinpoint an image of anything on the ground from space. He also does not mind the occasional murder believing in most cases he is helping the victims escape a bad life. He also likes to keep souvenirs of things of beauty from his victims. Both Spencer and Valerie have pasts they are trying to escape from and if anyone's computer skills are a match for Mama, Spencer's are.<br /><br />This is one of Koontz's masterpieces.

Not so with this non fiction novel, which reads like a fiction thriller, educating you on historical events along the way.  Inside you will find ten stories of how someone either escaped from captives themselves or helped someone else to.  All of the prisoners in this book are innocent or extremely hard done by for petty crimes so you are not reading about the escapes of serial killers or violent criminals.  Instead you are reading how people being held as slaves or in medieval castle dungeons, behind walls, as prisoners of war or from a crashing plane manage to beat the odds and obtain freedom.  I expected an average book and only really read this because I couldn't find anything good in the fiction section but was pleasantly surprised to find a masterpiece.  Great book, I'll definitely check out others by the author.	2004-07-24

Although this could be read as a stand alone novel, this is the first Jessica Jones adventure which I would say it is actually necessary to have read the prior novels beforehand. The necessitation is not to understand this story, but because it will wreck reading the prior adventures as major plot outcomes are given away from those books in this one.  I really do not understand why Nicole decided to do that, as the reminiscing factor didn't really add anything to the scenes or the story as a whole and any part of the story that was slightly improved by Jessica's memory flashbacks does not outdo the detrimental future experience for the reader who has not read the prior novels.<br />Anyway in this adventure much to Jessica's disgust she is about to be promoted to a non field, desk job type position and is told to take a months vacation beforehand.  She is then approached to do some private work for a rich man in obtaining his son from his mother who has taken him into the depths of a cult in Nigeria, Africa.  She takes her friend Andrea along for what should be a simple exercise but quickly discovers she was not told the whole story and major terrorist suspects are involved.  Jessica has dealt with all kinds of hostilities in the past but the Sahara Desert could well be her biggest foe.<br />A good story but make sure you have read the prior Jessica Jones novels first	2004-07-11

The information on the musicians inside is rather basic and nothing you probably won't already know if you are a fan of any of them.  There are no pictures at all inside and the text is written in a rather boring way.  I had hoped to be able to look up songs or movie soundtrack albums in the index and see who actually sang them so I could order them on Amazon or somewhere but only artists are listed in the index and the book does not contain soundtrack albums at all.

This is an excellent novel that takes you behind the scenes of American political campaigns, particularly Californian.  Having just done Campaign Strategies at university where I had to partake in mock political race I found this book fascinating. A similar style book I would also highly recommend which is even better is Syrup by Maxx Barry which is about public relations in the cola industry and is equally as addictive.<br />In this book returning from a few years of travelling overseas after completing high school, upon return Jim Asher volunteers for Republican Edward Winston's campaign office.  Not having paid much attention to American politics while travelling he quickly learns the importance of Winston as a political player and takes every opportunity that he can to further his own career.  He quickly discovers that he is a master of spin and through partying, sleeping around and other activities can get media favours left right and centre.  Quickly he becomes one of the most powerful behind the scenes players in history and the opportunity of Washington beckons.  Of course in politics, not everyone plays by the rules and breaking them yourself can be mighty tempting.  If Jim's going to make it to Washington he needs some good ideas and to be able to think on his feet to overcome the hurdles his enemies will put in his way.<br />Buy Spin and buy Syrup by Maxx Barry too.	2004-06-27

The chapters with Junior or undercover cops are pretty interesting but Susan could have been made a bit less complicated and a lot more interesting.<br />The story is basically about Susan who is a New York District Attorney who specialised in repossessing proceeds of crime.  New players in New York's garbage removal industry are having their dogs' heads cut off or drivers' heads smashed in.  The Mafia doesn't want new players and the hot headed, low IQ'd Junior, son of mob boss Tesla is addicted to violence.

This is the untrue autobiography of Slo Mo, a boy who grew up underground in a cave as part of a strict religious cult where he was not aloud to journey to or mix with the outside world.  Being extremely tall meant he was really unsuited to cave life and the elders and other cult members didn't really want him around so he was often punished and spent his time shovelling human waste.<br />One day the septic pipes clogged up and the cult was forced to allow an outsider plumber in to repair them.  Upon seeing the freakishly tall Slo the plumber handed him a basketball and wanted to see him dunk it.  Having never seen one before Slo couldn't perform this task but hid the basketball from the man so he could play with it later to relieve boredom.  He becomes a crack shot and when the plumber returns to fix the pipe again he knows he can make some serious cash off of Slo and since the cult doesn't really like Slo they have no problem with him going and playing basketball for a hefty commission on his payments.<br />Slo isn't that up to date with the world so this book is sort of a Forrest Gump joins the NBA type thing.  His naivety is sometimes stretched beyond plausible limits in some cases but it does help the book flow along.  You don't have to follow the NBA (I don't) to enjoy this great book.  If you don't take it too seriously you'll really enjoy this light, fun read.	2004-06-24

If you are going to buy just one book published in 2004 then this is the book for you.  Coben has again written another brilliant adventure full of twists and surprises but be warned his style is a bit different in this one to previous independent novels. It is not a bad thing but if you purchase only wanting his usual old style then you may want to know.  In Just One Look Coben writes a lot of pages through the main villain's eyes, similar to the way Dean Koontz or James Patterson do.  It works extremely well in this novel but obviously most Coben books have you guessing who the bad guy is for most of the book, I mean you still get to that with who hired psychopath pressure point assassin Eric Wu, but like I said it's a different style. Wu is an exceptional and very interesting villain, one of my favourites by any author.  The other main difference is the main victim/hero of this novel is female (Grace Lawson) whereas usually the main character is male in Coben books but again this works sensationally here.  I loved this new style and it complements and blends in well with Coben's successful traditional way of writing.  Coben even has aspects of his last Myron adventure in here by talking about Little Pocahontas' trial which is happening in the same real time as this independent adventure.<br />The basic plot of Just One Look is that Grace Lawson, crippled in the Boston Massacre years earlier and now mother of two young children picks up a developed roll of film from the mall and finds an old photo amongst it with a blond girl crossed out, and amongst other figures someone she thinks could be her husband.  When Jack (her husband) sees the photo he leaves the house without telling her and never returns.  This is because he has crossed paths with Eric Wu an ex Korean torturer now assassin for hire who knows how to bring anyone down with his bare hands and can paralyse just with one pinch. Who hired Eric Wu?  What will Eric do to Jack and others? Who put the old mysterious photo in with the others?  Why did Jack react the way he did to the photo?  Can Grace protect herself and her family from its secrets?<br />Check out Coben's other masterpiece independent novels as well such as Tell No One, No Second Chance and Gone for Good and also his Myron Bolitar series, I would recommend starting those from the initial Darkest Fear novel to get the most out of them.sterious photo in with the others?

I have read better mind control novels such as the books Night Chills and Whispers by Dean Koontz.  The one thing that lets this novel down is that it is written as Frances telling the story in the third person so you know obviously she survives all the thrilling episodes in the book.

How to hot wire a car or kick in a door is a must for any want to be criminal.  Some of the things in here you're not real likely to use but it is interesting to read up on how they are done.<br /><br />Lot of things you're more likely to be taught the correct way when partaking in the activity itself by actual instructors such as what to do if your air tank doesn't work while scuba diving but for people never likely to partake in some of the activites in this book who may be interested in what if questions then this book can suffice.  It is pretty unlikely you are going to whip this little book out of your pocket as you are plummeting to earth when your parachute doesn't open and things like that but this book is an interesting read on what the ideal thing to do is.<br /><br />A better book is the later version of this by one of the same authors of this book called The Action Hero's Handbook which also includes a lot of humour and acts as if the reader wants to be an action star in movies.	2004-06-12

The illustrations in this book are sensational though, and worth the price alone.	2004-05-29

Although not an hilarious read this book does have some extremely funny entries from North American college students on American and world history.  Learn that the allies landed near Italy's Toe and gradually advanced up her leg, Japan Bombed Pearl Harbour the main US base in California, the Germans subs sunk the Titanic and Aztec troops fought at Gallipoli.  The Black Death was passed around by midgets, Joan of Ark was famous as Noah's wife and other stuff you won't find in textbooks.<br />Some of these entries are obviously students trying to be funny when they have no idea of the answer to a question, some are from total reliance on their computer's spellcheck but others highlight the fact that maybe the academic requirements for college placements need to be increased with maybe a few less football scholarships in North America.  The book isn't actually that big and only takes about half an hour to read is my only complaint.  An interesting book, check it out.	2004-04-11

It vastly improves for the second half with the usual Patterson flair.  Although this could be read as a stand alone novel you won't really feel the emotional turmoil within the Women's Murder Club without having gotten to know them from 1st to Die and 2nd Chance.  1st to die is the best of this series but this one is still worthwhile.	2004-04-11

Dr Marc Seidman is a brilliant plastic surgeon who helps kids from poorer countries reconstruct their faces which have been injured in war or deformed from birth.  When not overseas he lives the ideal life with his wife and baby daughter Tara.  That life is cut short however when he awakens from a coma after having been shot in his own house where his naked wife was found dead and his baby daughter not found at all.  His rich stepfather then receives a note demanding two million dollars be delivered by Marc alone immediately, he is not to tell the police or he will never see Tara again.  The note clearly states that there will be no second chance.<br />This is a sensational thriller with many twists and turns in the plot.  The reader is given the option of trying to work out who shot Marc and his wife and took Tara or to just sit back and enjoy the ride.  Another Coben classic.  Also read Tell No One and Gone for Good which are masterpieces along with the Bolitar series.	2004-04-02

This is a sensational collection of interesting facts and is easily in the top of the pool of this kind of books.  I had no idea that the Swastika was originally considered a good luck symbol before the Nazi Party adopted it, beginning in the Hindu world representing the sun's daily path across the sky.  Learning about the origins and battles between Coca Cola and Pepsi was fascinating reading.  Greyhound Bus's origins as a car dealership driving patrons between towns when it was quiet and the origins orf Ronald McDonald was also great literature.<br />Strange Lawsuits is another great chapter amongst many in this sensational read.  I really loved the text across the bottom with funny and interesting facts as well.  If you want an interesting research book of strange, bizarre, funny and interesting information then this is the book for you. There are a lot of publishers and authors writing this kind of thing but this book is easily among the best.	2004-03-30

He was killed in a car accident but she believes strongly it was murder since he was colourblind and has been afraid to drive since hitting a pedestrian.<br />Kyle originally believes it was just a car accident as the traffic light has only green and red and with no amber their was no way her father could have known the difference but decides to humour her and investigate in the hope she will return to her husband. Some facts he uncovers do not make sense and he becomes really suspicious when he is hit over the head while examining the wreckage.<br />I have read better novels by Ormerod such as Dead Ringer which manage to keep you interested the entire book.  This book although a good read is quite boring in parts and drags on at times.  If you've never read one of his novels his style and characters are very similar to Donald E. Westlake or the British authors such as James Pattinson, Gerald Hammond and Christopher Nicole.	2004-03-06

All entries have previously appeared on the official Darwin Awards website. This book also contains as the second book did, a section where the author has retracted Darwin awards for entries on their website which were not Darwin awards. Following the reasoning behind those decisions if you applied it to most entries in all three books then they would also be rejected so one would think if you are going to do this sort of book you should stand by your decisions no matter how much abuse you cop.<br /><br />Everyone who has died will probably at least have someone who loved them so abuse is something that comes hand in hand with this kind of writing. I just find this chapter's inclusion pointless. The Darwin series of books are not as funny as you might expect them to be but they do have some funny moments. If you are looking for a book to keep you laughing hysterically from cover to cover then look elsewhere. If you are looking for a book with a few laughs then either this or the first book will be sufficient.	2004-02-28

Myron is the sports manager for ex street kid Duane Richwood who is playing in the US Open and is expected to be the next biggest thing in male tennis.  Valerie Simpson, the ex women's champion who had a breakdown is rumoured to be on the verge of a comeback. She makes an appointment with Myron but is gunned down at the US Open just before they are supposed to meet.<br />Police suspect Duane has something to do with her murder and Myron feels a responsibility to solve her murder to both clear him and because Valerie would have been his client.  When he discovers Valerie's ex boyfriend Alexander Cross (is Coben starting a friendly rivalry with James Patterson by killing of someone with a very similar name to Patterson's most popular crime solving character?) was also murdered he knows he has stumbled onto something big.  Alexander Cross was the son of a US senator and the mafia also doesn't want Myron poking around into their business but we all know Myron, he can't resist.<br />The Bolitar series are fast paced can't put down until the last page reads.  Start with the original masterpiece Deal Breaker though as plots of former novels are given away in later ones if you read them out of order.  Once you have read one you will have to read them all.  Coben's independent novels Tell No One, Gone For Good and No Second Chance are also masterpieces.  Buy them too.	2004-02-21

This new edition by Let's Go isn't too different to its predecessors but it is slightly smaller in size. Every centimetre and gram of weight does count when you're lugging the thing around the vast continent of Australia.<br />A fair number of hostel listings are in here but not all of them.  There are lots of free  publications in a lot of hostels with most hostels listed so if buying the book for this reason alone maybe save your money.  There is still a lot of weight unnecessarily taken up with stuff such as hotels and restaurants which backpackers obviously never use.  Let's Go should produce two versions, one for travellers interested in that kind of stuff and one for backpackers. This book would then be half the size and weight.<br />This book is good for general information on Australia especially if you've never been here before or don't know much.  You don't really need one of these types of books to travel Australia or anywhere else but if you must get one definitely get this over Lonely Planet.	2004-02-17

If you've never read one of his novels his style and characters are very similar to Donald E. Westlake or the British authors such as James Pattinson, Gerald Hammond and Christopher Nicole.  This is a very enjoyable book written as the lead character Jerry Boyes recounting the tale.<br />Jerry Boyes used to be a stunt double for famous actor Stuart Tyson before a stunt went terribly wrong resulting in the loss of his left foot.  Now just a lowly paid security guard he is approached by Tyson to be employed and paid well to be the drop off man for money to pay off kidnappers who have kidnapped tycoon Howard Maxwell.  His family does not want to involve the police.  Short of cash he reluctantly accepts but things don't go according to plan, the ransom is lost, Tyson is dead and Maxwell has turned up on his own accord.  Police soon suspect him and he must find out what is really going on to clear himself as well as help out the family and some of his friends.<br />My only criticism of this book is that the chapters could have been divided into shorter ones as they go on for a bit before you get a break but apart from that small detail this is a fantastic book.	2004-02-15

I've read all of Koontz work and disagree with most of the other reviewers on this site. This is not the greatest of Koontz writing. I wouldn't even put it anywhere up the top of the pile. Santa's Twin is a much better children's book than this one. I found this book boring compared to that action packed thirller. Definitely buy Santa's Twin, it is even previewed in the adults novel Mr. Murder.<br /><br />In this book toys which are alive are saddened at the death of their creator. They must find their new good toymaster before the evil toys escape their basement prison and take over the toy world. They want to go to children's homes to cause nothing but misery. The Oddkins (good toys) must get to the toymaster first.<br /><br />I just found this book too old style and unmodern. It has not stood the test of time like most of Koontz's other work has done. Koontz is one of the greatest writers out there but this is not one of his greatest books. Just because someone read this to you when you were a child which conjours up happy childhood memories does not justify saying this a good book. A good book is one you can read to your child in the present date which makes them happy as well as you. I loved movies such as Friday the 13th when I was kid but watching them now I realise how they just don't stack up much today, kids at our primary school even came up with our own Jason like character we called Nass who lived in the pine forest behind the oval, that's the thing, just because the memories are good doesn't mean the book or movie was. The same can be said for The Oddkins!	2004-02-12

Charlie and Oliver Caruso both work for an exclusive bank dealing with some of the world's richest clients.  After giving four years of his life to the bank Oliver realises that he is being screwed.  The brothers discover that someone has supplied a bogus identity for a dead man who has three million in his account and decide if someone is going to steal the money it might as well be them.  Caught by the banks security guard they are forced to cut him in on the deal but shortly after the crime is even more of a success then they could have hoped, the Secret Service murders him in front of their eyes.  They are lucky to escape themselves but now are on the run.<br />They cannot surrender to the cops as they will be handed over to the secret service who will no doubt kill them as they want the money for themselves.  An excellent financial thriller.  Ending isn't up to the standard of the rest of the book but still a good read.  The best financial thriller in the literary world is The Money Makers by Harry Bingham.  Check it out too.	2004-02-11

Other five star quality brilliant Koontz novels which you definitely have to buy as well are Watchers, Intensity, Night Chills and Mr Murder.<br />In Twilight Eyes the setting takes place in the era of JFK's death and the prelude of the Vietnam war where a young man under the alias of Slim Mackenzie is fleeing authorities who want him for the murder of his uncle.  Only Slim killed him for a reason, as Slim has the gift of Twilight Eyes that give him visions of the future and past as well as allow him to see the through the human disguises that the evil goblins are using to reap terror, murder and mayhem against the human race.  His uncle was one of those goblins.  Becoming a carnie and joining the nomadic Sombra Brothers Carnival is the only place he can safely hide.<br />His boss the beautiful Rya is impressed with the way he gets every cent out of the marks, Jelly the manager of the carnival knows his faith in hiring him will pay off and the side show freaks and other carnies know he is a great worker and trustworthy guy.  He only knows he has seen visions with Rya and Jelly both covered in blood and that the goblins have a major attack planned for the ferris wheel which he must stop.  The war against the goblins will rage on unless he can work out how to stop them all.  Sensational novel!	2004-02-08

This is a pretty good thriller which is extremely exciting in the scenes with Emily and her tormentors.  If the book was all like this it would have been five stars in rating easily but the lengthy scenes with Walter and other secondary characters do drag on from time to time giving the book a slightly less over all rating.  Great thriller though, highly recommended. Current edition in Australia has none of thesse numerous typos some reviewers are going on about.  If they bought books full of typos why did they not return them as they are obviously cheap rip off copies and not originals.<br />Emily Childs, wife of Walter a banker who is at the top of his industry and in charge of billions of dollars of accounts is violently kidnapped. The kidnapper wants one hundred million wired to an account in the Cayman Islands by Monday or Emily dies.  If Walter tells the police or his employer (they have a strict policy not to negotiate with terrorists or other extortionists) Emily dies.<br />Even though he was about to dump his wife in favour of his much younger assistant and by following company policy under these circumstances he will more than likely be promoted, guilt and pressure from others plays on Walter's mind to do the right thing and pay off the kidnappers to save his wife's life.  Andrew Hogan is an ex cop who left the force because he didn't want to be in anyone's pocket and is the bank's head of security so is the only man Walter can trust to get Emily back.  Greed however is creeping into the minds of those holding Emily and she must be found before it is too late.	2004-02-08

All of the town's female characters, even the police seem to very easy women which makes this book pretty unrealistic.  It seems like the author must be a teenager who has never had a girlfriend, even though as we know he is not.  If you can accept the constant sleaze and sluttiness of the characters this is a pretty simple fast read book.<br />A young couple, Bass and Faye out for a canoe picnic come across a naked decapitated female corpse with the killer running off across the river carrying the woman's head when he sees them.  Once back in the town Faye disappears and it becomes apparent someone is out to kill Bass before he can identify him to the police.<br />Among the Missing is no literary masterpiece but it is enjoyable enough to read if you can get it cheap and it will pass the time nicely.	2004-02-07

It seems the publishers are trying to get you to purchase the individual editions as well which is stupid as who is going to carry around North America twenty or so books with them or want to spend that much money.  Surely the entries for non backpackers can be put mainly in the individual state and city books as those able to afford to spend this kind of money on accommodation and food are hardly likely to be travelling the entire continent.  Let's Go needs to return to its traditions or in the future what will this guide cover, just New York, Chicago, Disney Land, LA and Montreal?  I hope not.<br />Homer, the Alaskan town where you're guaranteed to see thousands of American Bald Eagles is gone from the pages as is Bellingham, Washington which is majorly important as it is where the Alaskan Marine Hwy (the ferry to Alaska) leaves from.  Essex in Glacier National Park has disappeared which is just plain ludicrous as it is the only stop Amtrak makes inside that national park in Winter.  Fargo, North Dakota and Spokane Washington are just two more of the gems which have disappeared from previous editions.

Initially against his father, neighbour (owner of the dead dog), teacher, police and other people's advice and wishes he keeps bugging everyone in the street to see if they know who killed Wellington.<br />Eventually he stumbles upon the truth then flees to London to escape the killer who will not stop until he gets hold of Christopher.  All Christopher is really worried about is doing his A-Level Math test, because he likes Maths.  Doesn't really care at all about his father or others who are sacrificing their lives to make him comfortable and happy.<br />For readers who are unfamilair with autistic people they may unfairly assume this is a symptom of the condition which it certainly is not. Most autistic people do not act in the selfish ways Christopher does.  Sure some do, but so do some so called 'normal' people too.  My main problem with this book is that at no point is the reader ever told by the author that Christopher like any other human is choosing some of the actions he takes and ways he treats others.  People unfamiliar with autism may read this book and assume all autistic people will be violent or treat others with contmept etc. Sure some do but most do not. I understand this is Christopher's journal and he is unlikely to write anything critisising himself but since so many readers obviously assume he is a typical example of an autisitc individual the author needed to have made this clear in some way.<br />This book may not be very good in quality, is very predictable and the characters not very likeable, but make no mistake about it, it is very addictive.  For reasons I really do not understand, there was no way I could put this thing down until the last page which is why I rate this book three stars.

This is a sensational masterpiece of fiction that has you asking questions as it goes along and wondering what if this were true? This analyses the gun debate from both sides of the story. If read with an open mind you'll get more out of this novel then if you read with a tunnel very pro gun or very anti gun vision.<br /><br />This is one of the greatest books ever written and is about twice the size of a normal novel so is extremely good value for money. If you want a work of fiction that debates the issue of society without guns while taking you along for a fast paced thrill ride from cover to cover then this is for you. Warning though, once you start you won't be able to put this masterpiece down so buy some blank tapes because you won't be watching TV for a while.<br /><br />Jeffrey Horton working for Terabyte Laboratories unwittingly invents a device that makes bullets and any other explosive devices explode when 'the trigger' is turned on thereby making guns or terrorist bombs useless in an area covered by the machine. At first this seems like the greatest invention in mankind's history with cowards no longer being able to use guns to rob, murder or even intimidate society. Not everyone however is pleased by this. Not only are there gun totting rednecks who think it is their constitutional right to have guns but the US army can see they will be at a disadvantage to more populous countries without being able to use bombs and guns. The Trigger asks the question will society really be better of without these sorts of weapons?

Ernest also likes to cross dress and one night while having consensual sex with Audrey, who is handcuffed to the kitchen stove, he dies.  Without the intelligence to think of any other way to free herself from her dead husband, she uses an electric carving knife to remove his manhood and is of course still attached to the stove.  A deaf Indian burglar who can't talk stumbles upon the bizarre scene and after feeding the starving Siggy, and cooking a lasagne for Audrey and leaving her a Diet Coke takes the stuff he came to steal and goes home.  Burdened with the thoughts of Audrey chained to the stove he sends a fax to the cops who eventually decided to investigate and find Audrey handcuffed over the corpse of Ernie with his manhood nowhere to be found.  Upon being uncuffed she decided to overdoses on prescription pills but unfortunately the cops save her by rushing her to the ER to have her stomach pumped.<br />From this event comes incompetent police officers, corrupt jurors, public defendants more interested in gaining rights for women who are victims of men than the truth and a media that just makes it up as it goes along.  Audrey is charged with Ernie's murder which she could have avoided if she'd just told the cops what happened in the first place.<br />This novel is pretty interesting for the first third of the book but the second two thirds probably could have been cut down in length and do drag on unnecessarily for quite a bit.  A good book to fill in time.	2004-01-31

It is obviously not relaistic as no one ever picks up that Hal Jam is a bear, I mean his appearance should give it away, especially for the women who sleep with him, but if you can overlook this fact then you can get some enjoyment from this book.<br /><br />Basic plot is that a human writes one of the greatest novels mankind has ever seen on a typewriter so he has no proof or copies. (Can you even get typewriters these days another point you need to overlook and how much longer would writing an novel on one take correcting errors and stuff.) Anyway he is so stupid he leaves it in a brief case under a tree in the forrest and is actually surprised when he returns and it is not there. Wanting the briefcase to initially contain food a bear is disapointed, but then thinks, what the hey I can maybe get this pubilshed and breaks into a sports store to steal clothes and pass as human. The whole publishing and media industry's shallowness is highlighted in this novel as the bear's misunderstanding of human customs makes him a unique and cool individual in the world's eyes. The book is good enough that you'll want to finish it but it is very overrated. There are a lot better books out there.	2004-01-31

I will definitely look for more books by Abrahams in the future. The characters are very likable and interesting although Nat could have been given a male's name to avoid confusion at times. Buy this!<br />Nat, male even though has a girl's name, is the pride of his small town, raised by his financially battling mother he obtains a partial scholarship to Inverness College but will have to work every spare minute of his time to be able to stay there. Not being able to afford to return home for Christmas, on route to campus security to report his dorm mate's stolen TV he witnesses two hot girls drop a fish tank.

Most Myron adventures are full of action and although there is a small amount in this novel this book is a more of a get to know a bit more about the lives and past of supporting characters which haven't been explored in great detail in previous novels such as Myron's dad, Esperanza, Big Cyndi and even Myron.  Although Win is in this novel, he is really mostly a conversationalist in this one seeing very little action at all. Myron even decides Yoo-Hoo is no longer his favourite drink in this book.  It is almost as if fans have demanded another Myron Sequel and Coben has run out of ideas so has just decided to release more information on the other characters with a basic plot to tie it together.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of the Bolitar series and have immensely enjoyed them all but I don't think this one is up there in quality, suspense or the other aspects that made those great.<br />Whilst during the third quarter of the book you do experience the don't want to stop, can't put the book down experience, that does unfortunately die out and it certainly never was there before that part of the book. I hate to say it but in some parts there is so much uninteresting talking amongst characters that you are willing them to hurry up and get on to the next scene.  I think Coben should concentrate on the independent masterpieces he is writing for the moment until he can come up with better adventures for Myron.  It is a great series and like Patterson's Alex Cross series you don't want to read novels forced out to appease impatient fans and publishers which lessen the overall quality of the collection.<br />Anyway the basic plot for this novel is Myron has taken off for a lengthy period of time to a deserted island without telling clients or friends with anchor woman Terese Collins.  Meanwhile one of his clients Clu Haid, is found with a bullet hole in head and his MB SportsReps partner and best friend, Esperanza is in custody awaiting trial for his murder.  She also no longer wants to have anything to do with Myron.<br />This book I would only recommend to fans of the series. The Myron Bolitar books are sensational and you have to check out the seires.  Definitely do not start either your Coben or Myron Bolitar experience with this novel.  With the Bolitar books I would highly recommend starting at the first book Deal Breaker, as parts of the plots of earlier books are given away in novels which follow earlier ones in the series.  Coben's indenpendant books are masterpieces, check them out as well.hole in head and his MB SportsReps partner and best friend, Esperanza is in custody awaiting trial for his murder.

This is a sensational thriller which is even more terrifying when you realise the basic plot could be so easily developed one day by terrorists or other evil people in the real world.  Adalwolf worked at Auschwitz, he was a brilliant young evil medical prot&eacute;g&eacute; experimenting on children and pregnant women who managed to escape when the Russians arrived.  In 2002 he is at the top of the Justice department's Nazi hunt list and Melissa Gale is determined to capture him.  She also teaches ethics to trainees and doesn't believe in torture or the death penalty no matter what the benefit to others.<br />She soon realised that the chase has become deadly personal, and that she must stop him before he gets her and her unborn baby.  He has developed a virus that only attacks Jewish genes and can spread throughout the entire world' population in 45 days.  He needs a carrier and Melissa's unborn child will do just fine.<br />This novel starts of extremely fast and to be honest the paces dies down for a while and a bit of editing may have improved the book in the middle parts, but once you get to the final third section the pace heightens to a spine chilling fast read, which you will not be able to put down until the final page.	2004-01-26

I have read most of the Myron Bolitar novels and would have to say that although all are sensational, that this is by far the best and is in the same masterpiece category as the independent novels Tell No One and Gone for Good (I have not read No 2nd Chance yet).  I would say those two novels are slightly better than Deal Breaker, only because this is part of a series so you know (especially if you are not reading them in order) the main key characters are obviously going to survive for the sequels.  If this was a stand alone novel I would say it was equally as good as Tell No One and Gone for Good but even though it is in a series, Deal Breaker is still a masterpiece.<br />In this adventure Myron's star client Christian, who is set to take Myron to the big time of the sports agent world has received a nudie magazine called Nips in the mail, with his ex girlfriend in a 900 numbers advertisement who went missing years ago and that a lot of people suspect was murdered.  The girl in the picture named Kathy Culver was also the sister of Myron's ex girlfriend Jessie, who he is still in love with.<br />The mafia also believe another of Myron's stars had signed an although illegal, still binding in their eyes contract when he was a kid and demand Myron give his representation back to them, which of course Myron refuses.  Myron is now in more danger than he has ever been and he also has to find out who sent the magazine and what sinister games they want to play now that it is out.  His best friend/guardian Win is of course along for the ride as well.<br /><br />This is the best Myron Bolitar adventure by far. It is also the original first novel where it all began. That does not mean if this was your first Myron experience that you shouldn't read the rest, as that would just be plain ludicrous as they are all sensational.  My tip though is if you can, to read them in order as some of the plots of earlier books are given away in later ones.  Read all of Harlan Coben's books, both Myron and independent ones.  He is the master of this genre., both Myron and independent ones.  He is the master of this genre.	2004-01-26

There are some sensational stories in here such as Westlake's 'Take It Away' about a cop on stakeout buying takeaway food at BurgerWhopper.  This is by far head and shoulders above the rest of this book in quality.  Also read his masterpiece novel 'The Ax' if you have not done so already.<br />Anne Rule's 'The Road Trip' is also pretty good about a terrified woman driving alone who is being menaced by a truck.  Nancy Pickard's 'Love's Cottage' although not brilliant is good, set back in 1914 written as a diary by a black servant the day before a massacre in the house she works in.  Evanovich's 'Last Peep' is readable about two women bounty hunters who find a body of a guy they are after that disappears when they bring back the police a few minutes later.  Mary Higgins Clark's The Man Next Door about a serial killer living next door to his victim is readable but the story flows a bit too convenient for the characters to make the plot realistic.  Her daughter's story 'Too Many Cooks' is a very basic simple story about an actress who lands a last minute job for a BBQ sauce commercial.  It is a good read but doesn't really fit the genre of the rest of the book and is obviously in there because the author is the daughter of the presenting author.  The rest of the stories aren't worth reading.<br />There is a brief synopsis of all the authors in this book at the front as well as the charity that this book helped by being published when it first came out.  One unique thing about this collection is that all autors had to include 'A Thick Fog' 'A Thick Book' and 'A Thick Stake' somewhere in there stories which may explain why some stories aren't very good as they spent more time trying to do this than thinking of a story.	2004-01-26

These stories are brilliantly written and they mostly have twists at the end but sometimes midway.  I don't really want to get into the plots of any of these stories as otherwise because of the twist I would give it away for people who haven't read the collection yet and I hate it when people do that.  Settings are in the kitchen, courtroom and other places and characters roam across the gender and species.  Anyway you'll enjoy this collection, just don't waste your money on 'To Cut a Long Story Short' as only the first couple of stories are good in that collection.	2004-01-24

I would recommend Watchers, Mr Murder, Night Chills, Intensity and The Voice of the Night to name but a few of the Koontz masterpiece novels instead of this but if you can get this cheap or free it is a worthwhile read to pass the time.<br />In Winter Moon Jack McGarvey almost dies after he and his partner encounter a Hollywood film maker high on drugs with a sub machine gun who flips after receiving a Pepsi from a vending machine which he didn't order in a petrol station.

I made the mistake of reading Darkest Fear first as I did not even know there was a Bolitar series as it was not mentioned on the cover of that book (or this one for that matter) which was my first Bolitar book. So be aware that my rating and comparison to other books in this series may be tainted because of that.<br />Like all Coben books this is a great read.  It isn't the best of Coben's novels that I have read or even the best Bolitar series book for that matter however I did enjoy it.  You certainly don't need to have read any other books of his to enjoy this as a stand alone novel but there are other previous books in the series before this so you may get more out of this novel if you read them first.<br />In this adventure Myron is asked by Clip, the manager of the NBA team, the New Jersey Dragons, to find out the whereabouts of his star player Greg Downing.  Greg Downing is incidentally Myron's arch nemesis and former rival but the offer to play for the Dragons as well as a heap of money makes Myron overlook any hesitancies he may have had to take the job.  The discovery of a murder victim puts the police spotlight on Greg as well so Myron must find out what the deal is as well as avoid those of an unscrupulous nature who also wish to find him.	2004-01-18

When Keller is actually on the job as a hit man it is fascinating and must turn the next page to find out what will happen next reading, but when he is not on the job his life is very boring.  Stamp collecting, visiting an astrologer, jury duty and things like this just aren't interesting.<br />Basically this book is about a professional killer named Keller who has some competition.  Only problem is that his competition doesn't want any, and it soon becomes apparent to Keller that if he doesn't work out who his rival is and kill him first he will be killed himself.  If Lawrence Block had maybe concentrated a little more on this aspect rather than the boring chapters he wrote then this book could have been five stars.  Without the editing it barely makes two and a half.	2004-01-16

It is not the best of the genre out there but is a very enjoyable read.  Jane Nichols wants to retire from her life as a secret agent after coming off a mission that has taken its tole mentally and physically.  As well as being a secret agent she's also a very successful author under the pen name Max Murdock and decides she will concentrate the rest of her life on pumping out more novels about her successful character Andrew Jax.  First things first though she must avenge the death of her lover a fellow spy, by killing terrorist Jim O'Neil.  He is currently in Savannah, USA, which she also decides is a good place to base her next Jax novel from.  She rents a room from police chief Alex Callaghan who is on the case of a serial killer who likes to strangle beautiful women.  Jane herself is a beautiful woman and not knowing she is an M I-5 agent, Alex is constantly worried about her.  Meanwhile the British want her back at work and to find out what terrorist O'Neil is up to.  She however has not intention of returning to her former life and just wants him dead.<br />This is a very enjoyable read but there are better female British government agent novels out there.  The best would be by author Christopher Nicole, with his Jessica Jones character.  Titles such as The Voyage, The Search, The Pursuit and Poor Darling are just a few to look for.	2004-01-11

It is not in the masterpiece league of Christine or It, but is not far off either.  Billy Halleck is an obese family man, who is forced to undertake the ultimate weight loss program by an old gypsy avenging his daughter's death caused while Billy was enjoying the hand of his wife instead of concentrating on driving.  Thinner was the curse he prophesised, touching him as he walked out of court after not being convicted of the old lady's death.  Every day from then he has been losing weight.  Although he has quite a bit to lose, if he doesn't stop the weight loss he will eventually die.  The only way is to find the old gypsy and get him to lift the curse, but the gypsies have moved on and don't want to reverse it without a good reason.<br />This is definitely a can't put down thriller.  Although you don't have a great liking for Halleck, you are gripped to know if he can stop his ultimate weight loss program before his demise. His psychological terror is also a highlight. One of King's best, definitely buy it.	2004-01-11

Granted it doesn't grip your immediately from page one as Tell No One does but once you've read a few chapters, like with that brilliant book, you won't be able to put it down until the final page either.<br />In Gone for Good, Will Klein's mother has just died, telling him on her dieing breath that his brother Ken, who they thought was murdered along with Will's ex girlfriend, is still alive.  While going through his mother's possessions with his current girlfriend Sheila, Will comes across a recent photograph of his brother with snow capped mountains in the background, he has aged but it is obviously Ken.  The FBI want to know where Ken is, as do some other people who do not have a problem with murder and torture, one of them is known as the ghost and he's a particularly, evil character.  When Sheila is murdered it is up to Will and his friend Squares to find his brother before more people die.<br />If you've never read a Coben book before you are in for a literary treat.  If you've only read the Myron Bolitar series books then prepare to read a Coben book of an even higher level.  Whilst the Bolitar books are good, you know most about  Myron and that ultimately he will survive for another sequel but when Coben writes with fresh new characters the stories are full of mystery and the characters can go anywhere that Coben's imagination takes us. If you like the character Win, from the Bolitar series you'll love Square.  He's a more realistic but equally interesting side kick/guardian of the main character.  Gone for good is brilliant, it is full of twists and you won't put it down until the final chapter, so make sure there's nothing good on TV before starting, or just buy a blank tape as well.	2004-01-09

His new client is Brenda Slaughter, the greatest female basketball player in the USA, she's also hot.  Myron is quite happy 'babysitting' her but quickly finds out her life is rather complicated.  Her mother left her twenty years ago when she was five leaving her with an overprotective father.  He has also just gone missing.  Brenda asks Myron to find her mother and once Myron starts poking around into the past he discovers Brenda is also in a lot of danger and her mum disappeared for a reason.<br />This book is a little bit unrealistic in the fact that Myron and his tycoon friend Win (I wasn't aware this was the fifth book they've appeared in until I starting reading reviews on this page as it is isn't metnioned anywhere on or in the actual book)seem to have the ability to beat anyone or groups of people in a fight but it is a work of fiction after all.  It is an extremely interesting and enjoyable read. Doesn't grip you as fast as Tell No One does (which does not have Myron and Win in it) but once you get into it you can't put it down.  Definitely also buy Tell No One as it is a masterpiece.	2004-01-03

I couldn't find anything else around to read one day and having read and enjoyed every single other Patterson book, with the exception of Miracle on the 17th Green which was terrible, I thought why not?  I mean I was right, it is a 'chick flick' type book but it is thoroughly enjoyable.  Granted it is also predictable, I mean it obvious what is going to happen to the title characters before the book is finished as it is a diary written by one character for another that is given to a fourth character by a third character so you do know, but you don't know how, that's the main thing. Even though these events are expected Patterson's skill makes them quite moving and well before you reach them you are already hooked.<br />This is a short novel as well, so if you've got an hour and a half to kill before or on a flight or want something that you'll be able to start and finish while lying on a beach, then this novel is ideal.  Be warned though once you start, you'll be hooked and won't be able to put this masterpiece down.  I certainly don't read much of this genre, well any really, and prefer the serial killer, Alex Cross type novels to this sort of thing but even though the topic isn't something I would usually pick up I will admit this book is written just as well if not better than all the ones in my preferred genre.<br />This obviously isn't an Alex Cross novel, so if you're going to pick up a book then bag it because it isn't one then why waste everyone's time.  Like I said this isn't the type of book I am normally interested in but I couldn't put it down. If you give it a try then you won't either.	2004-01-03

It is still a great tale and it is only that One False Move and Tell No One are masterpieces in quality and this doesn't quite reach those heights.<br />The character Myron Bolitar is back from six other novels (it is not mentioned on the cover or inside the book itself) but too be honest this novel sort of assumes you've gotten to know him so he is not as interesting in this one.  In Darkest Fear an ex university girlfriend who left him for his arch enemy reappears and pleads for help to find a bone marrow donor who refuses to donate his marrow to help her dieing son.  Myron refuses so she confesses the boy, Jeremy is his son.<br />Of course Myron can not say no now, so puts his sport agency on hold and sets off with his friend Win who also like Myron can beat anyone in hand to hand combat and has numerous contacts, but unlike Myron is rich, very rich. You don't really get to know much about Win in this novel as previously said you really need to have read One False Move first or maybe some of the others in the series.  Anyway all indications are that the marrow donor is a sick serial killer who likes to torment the victim's family forever after he has committed the crime.  Myron knows he must find him no matter what the cost.<br />Make sure you have read his other novel with the same four key characters as this novel, Fade Away first as if you read this one before reading Fade Away then you will know how Fade Away is obviously going to turn out.  Not knowing the Myron Bolitar books were a series when I got this book I made the mistake of reading it first which kind of ruined my Fade Away reading experience.<br />Like I previously said this isn't up to the high quality of previous novels but it is better than most other authors' work.  It is an enjoyable read but if you haven't already gotten to know Win and Myron from other books you may struggle to get into it.

There are very few books you start reading and can't put down until the final page, no matter what is on TV or happening outside of the book.  This thriller is one of those sensational novels.<br />Dr. David Beck lost his wife eight years ago after being knocked unconscious by a baseball bat, to a serial killer named Killroy who tortured her for three days before branding and killing her. He has never gotten over her death but has tired to lead a normal life by helping out the underprivileged children through his surgery in a rough neighbourhood.  Nearing the anniversary of her death he received an e-mail which makes him question his sanity by giving him a small hope she may not actually be dead.<br />Meanwhile two more bodies turn up at the lake where Elizabeth was abducted alongside the very baseball bat used to knock Beck unconscious.  The FBI suspects Dr. Beck may have more to do with his wife's murder than they previously thought and when more murders occur that point to him, he becomes one of America's most wanted.  He can't surrender though, because his wife might just be out there trying to contact him and in custody he may miss the chance to ever find out if she is alive.  The violent people who murdered her eight years ago have also become interested in Dr. Beck and they want to have a little chat.<br />This is a sensational thriller.

It is not a forget what's on TV, can't put down till the last page book but is a good read.  Alex Delaware, his wife Robin and what they think is a dog, Spike are being kicked out of their LA rented home.  Their own home will not be ready for a few months so a mysterious letter from Dr. Woodrow who lives on a small Pacific island offering Alex a few months of all accommodation expenses (Robin and Spike included) and high salary paying job for a couple months seems too good an opportunity to pass up.<br />At first the work seems pretty easy and the opportunities for recreation such as snorkelling quickly make Alex and Robin think they have made a pretty good decision.  Giant spiders, insects, death and disgusting locals quickly make them question their decision as does bits of information Alex keeps discovering about their host and employer Dr. Woodrow.  There is a cannibal serial killer living on the island and the town folk resent what is going on up in Knife Castle.<br />Needed another chapter at the end finalising the Ben character, as the situation is not answered involving him but apart from that, if this is a good price buy it.	2003-12-28

Impossible you say, well no Barton has actually improved further on Biff Kincaid's adventures in the world of stand up comedy.  By the way this is a stand alone novel and you do not need to have read Killer Material prior to reading this one.  Heckler also does not give away any of the plot from the previous novel either so you will not ruin the enjoyment of Killer Material by reading this first.  The only repeat character is Biff himself so read the two in whichever order you can get them.<br />In this novel Biff is called up by the Vegas comedy club Comedysino, to replace Tiger Moore as the headliner.  Once there he is told Tiger has been stabbed in his hotel room with the words `Get Off The Stage You Suck' painted in blood on the wall.  It seems there is a serial killer who the media is calling the Heckler, who is reaping revenge on comedians.  Tiger was Biff's friend, as is Louie Baxter who is receiving similar notes to which Tiger did.  Biff sets out to find out the identity of the Heckler and stop him before it is too late.<br />This is a brilliant literacy masterpiece which will both make you laugh and thrill you.  Other lesser known but brilliant authors you may want to check out are Harry Bingham, with his novel The Moneymakers and Maxx Barry with Syrup.  If you enjoyed this book you will no doubt love those two as well.	2003-12-21

There he meets Charlie Green slightly younger than himself who tells him all about the dreaded place which is Letterby House.  The two become friends and partners in crime and decide they will voyage out into the world together.  This novel is the story of Crane's life as he grows up and as an adult.

Wayne Prentice is also a writer but due to, well in his mind anyway, computerisation he cannot get a book published anymore and Bryce offers him a solution to both their needs.  He will publish one of Wayne's novels under his name and split the money.  Oh and one other thing Wayne must do.  Kill his wife!<br /><br />This is a sensational thriller of what would go through someone struggling through life when faced with such an option.  Also how would the aftermath affect the minds of both parties involved?  This book is a bit dated with some things such as saving files on floppy disc but apart from that is sensational.  The only thing I had a problem with is Susan, Wayne's wife who does not have a problem with murder yet works in a major charity organisation and believes in that work.  Surely someone like this would oppose murder.  Apart from that though, great book.  If you haven't read The Ax by Westlake get it as it is even better than this.	2003-12-02

The designers a social outcast group calling themselves Monkeewrench have their own issues and pasts they are trying to avoid and do not need this.  Magozzi and the other Minneapolis detectives are being made to look like fools by the killer and are determined to pretty much never sleep until the killer is stopped.<br />You will not be disappointed buying this sensational thriller.  If you like plots where a killer and cyberspace game intertwine also read Jeffery Deaver's novel The Blue Nowhere.  Like other reviewers have pointed out the cover summaries and recommendations do not reflect the story of the book.  Obviously these people do not read novels they write about.  This is nothing like Fargo except there are also characters from Minnesota.  It isn't a comedy book either as Coben, Parker and Barr on the back cover would have us believe.  It is however a great book and should be read.  Those paid reviewers may have saved time by not reading this book but they missed out on a lot of enjoyment.	2003-12-01

The story is boring and nothing substantial ever really happens.  I first thought I was reading about a little girl who encountered elves due to the front cover having a picture of a girl with an elf burger on it.  To my surprise the girl just turned out to be an extremely pathetic guy. The story is written as a recount of his experience with him as the third guy. Basically he is a social outcast whose stepfather hates him (understandably) and who has no friends.  He sees an elf in his garden one day.  His parents want to get rid of him and send him away to a boarding school.  There he meets a girl who for some reason becomes his friend but he wants more.  He also accidentally kills an elf and encounters a few others.  One female one kidnaps him and takes him back to elfland where he is told he is half elf.  He must rescue the others from the human world who have been made to work in a shoe factory. Only thing is every time he comes back to the human world he is ten years older.  Pathetic book.

It is a crime in Philadelphia not to try and return something found with a value over $250.  His big plans and how absolutely terrified he gets when he realises the mob is not around just to help you change hundred dollar notes into smaller currency are examined in detail.

I never heard of the actual story before so I have no idea how accurate this book portrays events but I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Upon leaving they are both kidnapped by two moronic men who were only after Sarah but could not be bothered waiting for her to be alone.  Alice quickly works out they are in no danger from these fools and takes control of this situation.  She is after all bored and if Sarah and herself could get a bit of money then they could get a flat together and get better lives away from their parents.  The four will plan a crime to get them what they need.<br />This is a sensational thriller which you will not put down until the last page.  It is fairly short, under two hundred pages of larger than average font so is a quick read.  Both those who do not like reading lengthy novels and even those who do will enjoy this one.  There is a brilliant twist at the end, well near the end the epilogue does drag on for a bit after the main story is over.

People travelling to the town or just along Route 50 to other destinations mysteriously disappear.  The dead cat nailed to a roadside is a sure sign that this is not an area to visit.  Collie Entragian the local lawman will not be of much help.  In fact he should be avoided at all costs unless you are also seeking death.<br />This is a sensational thriller that is even humorous in a black sort of way at times.  The first half is a superb escaping from a madman serial mass murderer type thriller with the second half bringing in the usual Stephen King supernatural twist.  You will think twice before commencing a road trip through isolated areas after reading this classic.	2003-11-19

This is a great large simple book on most of the major music artists both solo and bands Important to point out this is the extremely lose, general basically anything other than classic music term for rock and is not just talking about bands classified under the title rock in music stores such as Bon Jovi, AC /DC and the like. Everything from soft rock, hard rock, pop to hip hop is covered in here.<br /><br />There are basically a couple of hundred words on each artist together with a large colour picture. This is what differentiates this book from its competitors, the large photograph of every artist covered. If you are a huge fan of any particular band or artist you probably will not learn anything new in here on them as it is just a simple summary of their career, where they became huge and where they crashed in some cases. It is important to note that this is information is written from a UK point of view but most is pretty similar to Australia, New Zealand or North America. Most artists are in here, both major successful ones and ones who had one or two hits, in fact I've never even heard of some of them. Some are missing though such as &#34;Weird Al&#34; Yankovic, Kylie Minogue, Leann Rimes, Ugly Kid Joe to name a few but you get that with any of these type of encyclopaedias. For this type of book this is the best laid out and simple to read. It is in alphabetical order but has no index or contents page.	2003-11-19

You have your bumbling idiot criminals, slow witted homeless man named Puggy, dumb Roger the pet dog and his arch enemy the evil, evil cane toad.  Combine this with the young lust of a boy playing a game called Killer who is trying to squirt Jenny the beautiful daughter of wife beating and money stealing Arthur with a water pistol.  There is Elliot a pathetic wimpy ad man who encourages his son Matt to stalk Jenny by lending his Kia for him to drive and you have a very different and interesting novel.<br />This is not the funniest novel ever written but it will not bore you at any time either.  Granted it is not very realistic especially the airport chapters but I will definitely be checking out other books by Dave Barry as I rather enjoyed this one.	2003-11-17

A Russian organised crime lord who calls himself The Wolf is fast making a name for himself.  Attractive women as well as a few men are being kidnapped and sold as bedroom slaves to those with enough money. Some are showing up murdered after their masters have had their fun.  Alex is still in FBI training but is asked to take a major hand in the investigation much to the disgust of some of his superiors in the FBI.  Meanwhile Christine is back and she wants her baby (little Alex).<br />This is not the greatest Alex Cross novel, but fans of the series probably will not be too disappointed. It is a worthwhile read, and a lot better than most other authors work.  You don't get deep enough into The Wolf's mind as you did with the Weasel, Mastermind and other villains from previous novels for my liking but he is still a character I would not want to encounter in real life.  This is not a bad read but I would read some former titles in the Alex Cross series if you have not done so first before this one.	2003-11-17

Her husband Roger is one of those people.  He secretly finds a house out on Long Island in a small town and drags the reluctant Emma out to see it.  She is not too thrilled with the place and does not want to leave her life in the city.  One room wins her over though, a room at the top of some hidden stairs which is the perfect writer's room, 360 degree views for inspiration.  Her son Zack also loves the place.  Much to the disgust of her sister and part of herself she reluctantly agrees to purchase the place and relocate.<br />This house has a secret though.  An old schoolteacher lady did some weird stuff here in her final years and the locals avoid the place claiming she haunts it.  Caroline a domestic violence support worker also moves in to the small cottage down the driveway that came with the house.  Roger does not like her but she quickly becomes Emma's friend.<br />Zack is easily the best of the players in his new soccer team and the coach a womaniser not afraid to be labelled so is very interested in Emma.  Meanwhile back at the house strange stuff is occurring when Emma is all alone.  Is she going insane?  Is the house haunted?  Or is someone from her past back for vengeance?<br />This is a pretty good book.  I recently read Hindsight, also by Rogan just before this one which is in a whole other league above this, but this is still a good book and a worthwhile read.	2003-11-17

Books	4	3	3	N	N	The Legend is True a Funny Book of Urban Legends Exists	I have read a few similar books to this one such as the Darwin Awards trilogy and can say without doubt this is a lot better and funnier.  This urban legend collection is also in a different format to the other collections in that every tale is presented as a one or two page comic book strip which adds imagery to the tale.  To be honest the artist's imagery is not always as good as your imagination would have been without it though.  There are two hundred stories in here, some you will have undoubtedly heard before or maybe slightly different versions of the same basic tale but there will also be a lot you will be unlikely to have come across in the past.  Even the big multinational company urban myths are in here too which I thought would have been left out due to legal reasons but no they are here for you to read and laugh at.  There are some myths not covered in this collection but how big would this book be if everything was in here?  This is a great collection which will entertain you and probably leave you searching for similar books after.  Enjoy!	2003-11-16

This is better than Koontz novels, Patterson or any other spinechilling master authors.  This is one of those books where you hope that nothing good is on television after you have started it because you do not want to put it down until the final page.  Full of twists and surprises you will not be disappointed, get this book.<br />This is a superb literacy masterpiece about a group of friends who in their high school days(1972) were the closest of friends.  They did not fit into the normal American stereotype groups so bonded to each other.  The two best looking girls in the school were amongst them as were the guys no one wanted to mess with.  Teachers hated them, they loved and were always there for each other.<br />It is no longer 1972 however, 20 years has almost passed and they have all moved on with their lives, some are famous or successful, others not so much.  They made a drunken pact on Beacon Hill while watching the rest of their grade graduate, that they would meet again twenty years later no matter what.  Now some have kids almost the same age they were back then, no one has kept in contact.  Willa is a famous author now and one of her classmates approaches her at a book signing.  They both remember the pact but will the others?  Willa decides, along with Patrick that they should contact the others to remind them and to their surprise everyone remembers the pact and was wondering if the others do as well.  Everyone that is except for Caleb and Angel who cannot be found.  Willa approaches her private eye friend to find them and organises the reunion for her house.  There are reasons though why some people can not be found. Sometimes they don't want to, sometimes they had no choice.  One of the group knows all the answers but does not want the rest to know their evil secret.  They will turn up to the reunion, after all, they do have a few days to kill!	2003-11-14

Richards is unemployed, poor and has a dieing daughter who he cannot afford drugs for.  The only solution for someone in his predicament is to go on television and participate in a game show.  Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy and that type of thing are not the rating blockbusters in this era.  People with weak a heart run on a treadmill which increases in speed whenever they get a question wrong.  If they survive to the end they win money.  This is just one example of what to tune into in the future.<br />Richards is not the most pleasant of men and is not too nice to his interviewers, doctors and everyone along the way.  There is a special game show for people like him.  In it he can potentially make one million new dollars if he wins.  If however like all contestants before him he does not win, then he will die.  He must outrun and avoid hunters intent on killing him for a number of days.  The public can win money by ringing the station and turning in his whereabouts so there is nowhere to run.  He can kill those after him but no civilians.  He also must constantly mail in tapes of himself talking to the camera every day so even though he is told the postal marks are not shown to the hunters he knows this is untrue and must keep on the move.<br />I saw the movie of this book when I was a little kid so saw no point in reading it until now.  Surprisingly, well I guess it shouldn't really be a surprise, the book really is nothing like the Schwarzenegger action movie.  It is a pretty good read and a must for fans of action thrillers.	2003-11-12

All entries have previously appeared on the official Darwin Awards website and the entire last chapter of this book's entries appeared in the original book as well.  The fact that the funniest entries appear in both books would be the reason I would recommend purchasing this one over its predecessor if you are not buying the entire series.<br />The author has realised by this book that 30 page introductions did not impress many and has thankfully drastically reduced them in this sequel.  Unlike the original, this book contains a lot more myths which the author acknowledges have been proved false which may not be what you were after if true tales of stupid human demise was what you were after.  If this is the case definitely get the first book instead.<br />This book also contains a section where the author has retracted Darwin awards for entries on their website which were not Darwin awards.  Following the reasoning behind those decisions if you applied it to most entries in both books then they would also be rejected so one would think if you are going to do this sort of book you should stand by your decisions no matter how much abuse you cop.  Everyone who has died will probably at least have someone who loved them so abuse is something that comes hand in hand with this kind of writing. I just find this chapters inclusion pointless.  Both books are not as funny as you might expect them to be but they do have some funny moments.  If you are looking for a book to keep you laughing hysterically from cover to cover then look elsewhere.  If you are looking for a book with a few laughs then either this or the first book will be sufficient.	2003-11-09

A lot of the tales in here are not confirmed and are written under urban legends.  I have actually heard most of the urban legends before, some told a lot more funnier than in here.  They are pretty funny though for example the scuba diver who was scooped up by a fire fighting plane and dumped on the middle of a fire. This book is divided up into eleven sections which group together deaths under specific headings. Unfortunately the writer seems to like to waffle on with boring introductions to each chapter.  Obviously they have good research and collating skills but not such a good writing ability when it comes to being creative off thier own bat. You also have to get to page 32 before even getting to the first death tale which is a bit ridiculous.<br />This is a good read but a bit of a let down.  If you buy it expecting a few laughs you'll be satisfied but if you expect to be laughing your head off from cover to cover then maybe purchase something else.  I've been told the sequels are a lot better, and this book was good enough to tempt me to read them and find out.	2003-11-06

Some of the characters are still around today such as Luke Ashton, Reg, Polly, Danny Glaze, Carver, Sgt Boyden, June Ackland and Tony Stamp to name a few.<br />You also get a behind the scenes look at some of the episodes as well as information on how and where The Bill is filmed.

I remember being a little kid in the 80's and playing Paperboy, Pac Man, Where in the World is Carmen San Diego, Frogger, Leisure Suit Larry, California Games, Railroad Tycoon, Maniac Mansion, Wings and It Came from the Desert.  I had a Commodore Amiga 500.  Other kids had Commodore 64's or the Atari and all those games are in this book too<br />This book has a lot of the games from the 80's and the 90's.  I wasn't still playing games in the 90's but I recognise a lot of the titles.  Not every single game is in here but there are a lot and the reminiscing you will do is worth the price of this book alone.  This book is an excellent conversation starter as well.<br />The companies that made the games and the game machines are in here in detail as well as well as the history of games over the two decades.

When career thief, Dortmunder is asked by a friend to rob a vacant holiday house in Long Island he agrees thinking what's the worst thing that could happen?<br /><br />Only the house is not vacant and billionaire media baron tycoon Max Fairbanks holds Dortmunder captive at gunpoint until the police arrive.  The police ask Fairbanks if anything is stolen and upon seeing a ring on Dortmunder's finger he decides he will turn the tables on his intruder and steal his ring.  He claims the ring is his and the cop makes Dortmunder hand it over.  Pleased with himself Fairbanks figures, what's the worst that could happen?<br /><br />Dortmunder is humiliated and enraged, he knows word is getting around the criminal world and everyone is laughing at him.  Vengeance and getting the ring back are all that occupies his mind, but Fairbanks is extremely powerful and hard to track down.  This is an interesting book. It's one of the best of the Dortmunder series.  Pubilshed in 1996 three years after the previous Dortmunder adventure Don't Ask, What's the Worst that Could Happen? is the 9th novel in this great series.<br /><br />Dortmunder novels can be read as standalone storylines but to better appreciate the characters and to not have the outcome of previous capers given away by the character's dialogue it's better to read them in order starting with the initial 1970 adventure [[ASIN:0446677035 The Hot Rock]].  Westlake has written a number of great non Dortmunder comic capers too.  The best are are [[ASIN:0445408812 The Spy in the Ointment]], [[ASIN:0446401331 Cops and Robbers]], [[ASIN:044640344X Smoke]] and my all time favourite [[ASIN:B000VZRPR0 Help, I am being held prisoner]].

This is the second novel which I have read written by Mason and I don't think I'll buy another.  The Malcolm in the Middle novels written by author Pam Pollack, are so much funnier and more interesting than this one.  Definitely read the Bad Luck Charm, Krelboyne Parrot and The Exchange Student.  They are all masterpieces of literature, great short novels that even kids or those who are not really into books will love.  They are just like watching the episodes on TV.<br />This episode is about Malcolm being elected by the Krelboyne class while he wasn't paying attention, to be class captain and run for his school grade's presidency.  He doesn't want to be President but doesn't want to lose either.  Meanwhile Francis pits Malcolm and Reese against each other in a who can get the other grounded competition.  The prize is to accompany him to a Dead Trout concert.<br />I don't think I will bother with anymore of Mason's novels, they are just not in the same league as Pollack.  I will definitely buy any more that Pollack writes.  At the very least read hers first before buying this one.	2003-10-24

For example this book states that the movie There's Something About Mary starred Adam Sandler.  It in fact starred Ben Stiller.  Some of the lists also contradict themselves such as top ten general fiction UK has at number one Bridget Jones Diary: A Novel with 534, 542 sales yet the next page has Children's UK with Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire at 948, 425.

It is named Banana Joe, an old man tells them its story of bad luck and death it brings to those who own it before he lets them purchase it.  They tell Dewey the story to punish him for squealing on them and then weird stuff starts to happen.  Reese and Malcolm quickly discover Banana Joe's stories are not fiction.  The monkey is evil and Malcolm knows he will kill them all soon.  With the help of Stevie they set out to rid themselves of the evil one before it is too late.  Meanwhile Survivor Day (at Camp Crystal Lake, as if this horror book wasn't good enough already, but your going to the setting of Friday the 13th) is fast approaching and as punishment Malcolm and Reese must compete in the same team along with Dewey.<br />This is an excellent book for readers of all ages, easily the best in the series.  It is a short novel so kids or those who do not like reading long novels can read it too.

It is a good read but is not up to the exceptionally high quality of the other author in this series' work, Pam Pollack.  That is not to say you should not purchase this as it is still a very good book and you will still laugh and laugh and laugh.  You will just laugh even more when reading Krelboyne Parrot or the Exchange Student.<br />Anyway this novel starts off with the family watching a live car chase on television which they quickly notice is driving down their street.  Screeching to a halt out front of their house the fugitive couple run up to their front door.  Dewey instead of locking the door of course opens it and asks them to play with him.  The family is taken hostage.  Lois and Hal tell the kids to run out the backdoor while the two fugitives are distracted but the boys start fighting with each other instead.  Hal and Lois are outside and realise the boys are not.  Lois keeps harassing the police outside to do something while Hal looks for doughnuts.  Malcolm keeps coming up with plans of escape which Reese keeps blowing, as with no parents telling him what to do and cool fugitive role models to talk to he is in paradise.  Dewey just wants to play.<br />This is an excellent book for readers of all ages.  It is a short novel so kids or those who do not like reading long novels can read it too.

When  Malcolm's teacher shows up with the student to everyone's surprise she is a girl named Camillia. Lois is thrilled, Camilla is the daughter she always wanted.  The boys are thrown out of their room for Camillia and she quickly starts to take Malcolm's role in the family and at school, much to his jealousy.  Reese and Dewey are not thrilled either with the inconvenience to their lives and there is nothing they can do.  Meanwhile Mother's Day is coming up.<br />This is an excellent book for readers of all ages.  It is a short novel so kids or those who do not like reading long novels can read it too.  Krelboyne Parrot also by the same author Pam Pollack is as good as this novel if not better.  Tom Mason another author also has some books in this series.  I have read The Hostage Crisis, which is good and worthwhile buying, but not in the same league as Pollack's work.  This is an hilarious novel, I will definitely be buying the other books in this series I have not yet read as you can never have enough Malcolm in the Middle.	2003-10-18

There are some great colour photographs from the movies along with a lot of information.  If you like the films he has done or are interested in his life then this would have to be one of the best books out there on that subject.	2003-10-14

Ever wanted to know how to deal with an evil gym teacher, avoid hand me down clothes, get away with not doing your homework, stay up late or build an effective alibi?  Well Malcolm has all the answers to these and other of life's dilemmas.<br />This book is pretty funny with the same sort of humour as the show.  Malcolm writes like he does when he talks to the camera on the show.  The book is a little bit dated as it is set a few years ago and a lot has changed on the brilliant TV show in that time.  It is still a great read and a must for fans of the funniest show on TV at the moment. Not just for kids, readers of all ages will love this.	2003-10-14

In this episode Malcolm has to take home his class' obnoxious parrot which he accidentally sucks into a super sucking vacuum cleaner that Lois has borrowed from work.  Reese and Malcolm come up with a plan to get away with this pet murder and still go to the miniature monster truck rally that they have built a vehicle for together with Hal. Reese being Reese blackmails Malcolm into becoming his slave or he'll tell mum.  Malcolm is also sure every bird in the world is plotting to kill him.  I won't give away anything more but your typical Malcolm ending is in here.<br />This is an excellent book for readers of all ages.  It is a short novel so kids or those who do not like reading long novels can read it too.  An hilarious novel, I will definitely be buying the other books in this series as you can never have enough of Malcolm in the Middle.	2003-10-14

Burke Devore was a paper company manager for twenty-five years until the day he loses his job through corporate downsizing.  For two years he is unemployed, attending many interviews but losing out to other people in the same situation as him with slightly better skills or experience.  His marriage is disintegrating and his son is in trouble with the law.  He finally has had enough and comes up with a brilliant plan to become employed again by getting rid of his competition. He does have a lot of time to kill after all!<br /><br />There has been a movie made of this story.  It is however in French and the setting has changed to Paris.  [[ASIN:B000TJFZLG The Ax (Le Couperet)]] does have subtitles, and there's not a lot of dialogue anyway plus if you've read the book you already know what's going on.  Obviously not as good as your imagination reading the book but interesting to see.<br /><br />This is a brilliant novel with an extremely interesting and unique idea.  I will definitely think twice the next time I have to send in a resume. I have read most of Westlake's work now after discovering him through this brilliant novel.  He's a great author, although nothing shares this unique storyline, check out his other novels as well!  [[ASIN:0446401331 Cops and Robbers]], [[ASIN:044640344X Smoke]] and [[ASIN:B000VZRPR0 Help, I am being held prisoner]] are all great places to start!	2003-10-10

It is not brilliant though.  It is about illegal Chinese immigrants who miraculously survive the scuttling of their refugee boat by their snakehead called the Ghost.  Not being a nice guy the snakehead spends the duration of this novel trying to track them down and kill them in the streets of New York. Meanwhile agents Rhyme and Sachs try to also find the illegals and stop the murderous rampage of the Ghost.<br />This book does give an insight into what it is like to be an illegal refugee and what it must be like to come from a poor country and see both the superior lifestyle as well as the wastage of the new country.  It also shows the resentment of family members to their parents who bring them there for a better life when things are not working out.  It is not a bad novel but nothing real exciting ever develops.  I have read The Blue Nowhere by Deaver, which is sensational.  Check that one out.  There are better books than this one though.	2003-10-09

It is a very slow paced novel with not much action.  Most of the words within this novel are trying to get you attached to Carol and her husband and in fact you never really do get attached.  I to be honest did not really care what happened to them.  Likewise Jane Doe did not do much for me either and I couldn't have cared less halfway through the book if she got over her amnesia or not.  There are a few cool chapters of a fight to the death between an old lady and her beloved cat but you've got get through a lot of boring chapters to reach this scene.  There are far better Koontz novels out there to spend your money on instead of this one.  Night Chills, Watchers and Intensity are three ones that I can remember just off the top of my head but there are more literature masterpieces by Koontz as well.  The Mask is definitely not one of them though.	2003-10-03

Life is not great for a lonely pig and instead of joining a sports team or social club of some sort he decides to play God and make himself a friend in his lab.  After a few unsuccessful attempts with results of a pig fish and pig bat (apparently he is too good to become friends with these lesser beings) he creates another pig, only thing is his new friend is huge and always hungry.  Now I'm not going to give away the rest of this dramatic plot but rest assured there is a reappearance of the big bad wolf.  The fact that he died in the pot under the chimney in the brick house a year earlier is conveniently overlooked with the author using \\"writer's licence\\" and the reader just has to conveniently play along with the story.  Anyway you'll have to read the book to know what happens next in this sensational can't put down horror thriller.  The only thing that lets this book down are the rather average illustrations both in quality and imagination which is a shame because it is a kid's book after all. I mean belts for Halloween costumes, come on a bit more effort would have been nice here.  The written text though is brilliant and this is a sequel tale those of all ages will enjoy.  Highly recommended.<br />If you like the fairy tale humorous style books also read There's a Hair in My Dirt an hilarious tale by Gary Larson about a princesses life in an enchanted forest.  For those a bit older Whatever Happened to...? tells us how the big bad wolf was framed for the killing of grandma (red riding hood), the pigs and Peter (and the wolf). Politically Correct Fairy Tales and Once Upon a More Enlightened Time are also great.  In adult fiction Once Upon a Crime is the ultimate novel based upon the classic fairy tales.<br />Avoid the children's book The Big Bad Pig and the Three Little Wolves.  It is terrible.  As is Fractured Fairytales, Snow White Blood Red and A Wolf at the Door.  Do not waste your money on these.ured Fairytales, Snow White Blood Red and A Wolf at the Door.

Most horror films are here but not all. Critters is one of my favourites that is not in this book. There is a short summary of each film along with a rating and opinion. Obviously you are not going to agree with all the opinions and ratings. There are also summaries of different directors who have been influential in the horror genre. A listing of alternative titles at the back of the book helps you to quickly locate a film, as all films are in alphabetical order if you can not originally find it. There is also a list of all the actors who have been in horror films and information on what other horror movies they have been in. Photographs from various horror films are also included making this not a bad reference book.	2003-09-30

A simple sentence by one man that has devastating consequences for those who reply with the words, I am the Lock. This is a masterpiece of literature by Koontz.  This is quite simply one of the most terrifying books ever written because it could so easily be true.  Not even in the not to distant future but today, technology exists for this sort of thing to be happening right now.  Koontz shows what subliminal mind control can do to a society not ready for it in the hands of people with no morals.  There will definitely be those who will use this invention to make women their bedroom slaves as is done in Night Chills as well as for murder and financial gain.  Of course subliminal advertising only can implant simple thoughts such as I would like to buy this product at the moment but whose to say that can not be improved upon like happens in this book.<br />Koontz is a master at fiction but how long will it be before this book isn't really fiction anymore.  This is a sensational book that will scare, and through fright will give you the night chills.  Do not hesitate, buy this now!  You will not be disappointed!	2003-09-30

Someone starts leaving her messages in her son's room and at work saying stuff like Not Dead!  She decides to exhume the body of her son which she was too distraught to see before he was buried to put her mind a rest.  Elliot her friend and lawyer is visited by two men who want to know why she is doing this and what she knows about their secret organisation.  She is also simultaneously visited by a friendly gasman and that is when the fun begins for them both.<br />This is a pretty good book and I don't want to give anything away by being clearer with my next comment but I do wonder why the writer of the messages to Tina could not be clearer rather than just writing Not Dead and other simple messages when they have such exceptional communication abilities.  That is my only question with what is a sensational novel that you will not be able to put down until the final page.  This is not a masterpiece like Night Chills, Watchers and Intensity but it is still definitely five stars in literature quality.  I highly recommend The Eyes of Darkness to anyone after a good read.	2003-09-30

This book is all right and funny in parts especially the first quarter but never really goes anywhere or reaches the peaks that similar novels by other authors such as Maxx Barry, Nancy Sparling, Jonathan Tropper or Harry Bingham do.  If you liked this book you will really, really like Syrup or Company by Maxx Barry, Being Alexander by Nancy Sparling, the Money Makers by Harry Bingham or the Book of Joe by Jonathan Tropper.  Maybe it is because I read these other exceptional novels before this one that I had extremely high expectations for Slab Rat that it could never achieve.  All right and worth reading if you can get it from your library but if you are going to spend money buy the other authors instead.	2003-09-27

I at first thought it must be by one of those authors with the same name as famous author Stephen King but no it is actually by the same man who wrote Carrie, Christine, It and other classics. This is also the first Stephen King book I have found which also has pictures. It is sort of like a children's book written by Stephen King although it is still a horror story. It is basically just a short story released on its own instead of as a collection together with other stories. Cycle of the Werewolf is not his greatest short story ever written. That title would have to go to The Mist, Autopsy Room Four, Riding the Bullet or Trucks but this story is better than a lot of his other sort stories and the illustrations are brilliant. This would be an excellent novel for either kids who are moving up from junior fiction or for your self to read as an adult.	2003-09-27

The problem I have with it is that the authors recommended are already famous authors which anyone who had read a fair number of books would already have heard of.  The non top one hundred chart selling type of authors are not listed here, either to look up their names or as recommendations.  These were the authors I hoped this book would help me find not the ones with the million dollar publicity machines behind them.  Granted some of these famous authors are great writers with literary masterpieces that readers will enjoy reading but I would imagine most people would have already heard of them and their books.  Very disappointing as the theme is a good idea but the execution falls short.  There are authors who are at the very least just as good as most of the authors in this book and usually better.	2003-09-24

The Visual Dictionary has more pages and is more interesting as it looks at all the characters, creatures, weapons and everything else as well as the ships although the ships and vehicles are not in as much detail as the ones in this book.<br /><br />The detail in this book is very extensive, so if you are fascinated by Star Wars vehicles then this is definitely the book for you.  If you wanted a broader picture of the whole Star Wars world then get the dictionary instead.  If your a huge Star Wars fan then you'll probably want both.	2003-09-24

He and Earl Kramer a death row inmate develop the plan and when Ian is released from prison he pays his step sister a visit. Giving into the blackmail for her mother's sake, instead of Ian at the drop off point for the money she finds Artura Garcia with a knife and only narrowly escapes death.  She does not know who he is but he wants money that Ian owes him and he will stop at nothing to get it.  Ian is dead and John Ryan is investigating his death and takes a very close interest in Abbie.<br />This is a pretty good book although a bit predictable at the end as the criminal mastermind is very easy to work out.

It is not one of the masterpieces Koontz has written but you have to remember this is one of his first books written by him over 30 years ago.  It is still an enjoyable read and would be ideal for those who are just moving up from the junior fiction world into novels and do not want thick or complicated novels.

Pinocchio tells us what became of the wooden boy after he became a real boy.  It is not a happy ending for him.  The Big Bad Wolf is the greatest fractured fairy tale ever written.  The Big Bad Wolf has been framed for the crimes made up by the pig in the house of bricks, red riding hood and Peter.  The wolf's version of those events is hilarious.

Most autobiographies are boring and so full of only positive stuff about the person that you just know you are not getting the full picture.  In this book Branson openly admits mistakes and bad business decisions.  He gives credit to others acknowledging Virgin's success would not have happened without them.  He also included instances when he has been brought back down to earth for example when two tourists asked for a picture he thought that he was being nice and started posing for them until he saw their confused faces and realised they wanted him to take a picture of them.<br />This book tells the reader everything about the Virgin empire from the first issue of Student magazine in 1968 to approval for their trains thirty years later in 1998.  Obviously a lot more has happened since 98 such as Virginblue in Australia but we will have to wait for the sequel for that.  This is a brilliant book which is as enjoyable as the great financial fictional thrillers like Harry Bingham's the Money Makers and Maxx Barry's Syrup.  This is so mush more inspiring when you realise Branson is not a fictional character and these achievements are real.  This book will inspire you to get out there and make money. Buy it!	2003-09-14

She marries a violent man and gives birth to his son which she shortly after murders.  She believed her son was pure evil.  Her husband Conrad is outraged, nearly kills her but decides to let her live.  He throws her out with the threat that when she remarries and has children he will come and kill them like she did his son.<br />She remarries and has two kids Joey who is 10 and Amy who is a highschool senior. Conrad has never stopped looking for her to extract his vengeance.  His carnival comes to town as does his new son.  The children go to the carnival for fun.  Conrad and his second son are there for vengeance.<br />This is a pretty good fast paced yet simple novel.  It is not the greatest book Koontz has ever written but it is still definitely worth five stars.  The Funhouse is a very enjoyable read.  I would have liked maybe an epilogue chapter to find out what happened after the final events.  I can not elaborate further without giving away anything.  Without an epilogue though it is still a great read.  Buy the Funhouse!	2003-09-14

For the full on superhero fans who know every episode inside and out of their favourite comic book character I do not think this book would suffice though.  It just doesn't go to those depths of research to satisfy them and they would probably know all the stuff inside here anyway.  For people like me who have read one or two comics and seen the odd television show as a kid this book more than meets our needs.<br />An excellent introduction by Dean Koontz starts this book and then the reader is taken to specific chapters on specific superheros which also makes this an easy to use reference book for assignments or something.  There are sections on Superman, the Incredible Hulk, Fantastic Four, Batman, Aquaman, Sub-Mariner, Spiderman, Green Lantern, Ant Man, The Flash, The X-Men and for some reason Donald Duck.  Time travel, doomsday, super science and other major parts of superhero comics also have their own chapter.  Like I said this book will not satisfy full on fans of guys who wear their underwear over the outside of their pants but for those with a slight interest in the subject this will more than satisfy.	2003-09-11

After reading and being disappointed with King's effort at three short stories in Dark Visions where the stories had no endings I was reluctant to pick up another collection of his short stories.  Then I remembered his short story classics like The Mist and Trucks and knew I should give him another chance.  I was not disappointed with this collection.<br />Riding the Bullet would be one of his best ever short stories as would Autopsy Room Four.  The first is a young man's tale of hitchhiking to visit his mother in hospital who has suffered a stroke and the as only king can create characters he encounters along the way.  Autopsy Room Four is a man who is paralysed but mistaken for dead who is conscious as his autopsy is being performed.  Sensational reading.<br />To be honest I found the stories between Autopsy Room Four and Everything's Eventual pretty average.  Everything's Eventual on the other hand is pretty good.  The story of a guy who has a dream job and a weird talent.  I will not give away any more.  The Road Virus Heads North a story about a horror author who buys a unique painting is excellent and Lucky Quarter is also worth a read.  1408 starts of great but the second half  does not keep up the brilliance.  I did not really like the other stories but that does not mean that you will not. This collection is definitely worth buying.	2003-09-10

The majority of people never bother to take the risk and follow those ideas.  Scat is not one of those people.  Scat has a revolutionary idea that will make him filthy rich.  He knows that Coke will be interested.<br />Scat learns quickly (the hard way) though that that ethics aren't part of the business world and you can't trust anyone or you'll end up flat broke and homeless.  He also learns that vengeance is a great business trait and he might even be able to make a bit of money along the way.<br />This is a sensational novel written in first person style as Scat tells his story.  Short chapters headed by clever funny marketing tips make this book a pleasure to read.  This novel will inspire you to get out there and make money.  If you like this feeling after finishing a brilliant novel also buy The Money Makers by Harry Bingham it's even better than Syrup.  Also read Richard Branson's Losing my Virginity his sensational autobiography.	2003-09-06

His friend Roy is not.  One day they have a conservation.  \\"You ever killed anything?\\" Roy asked.  From this moment Colin's childhood innocence comes to end and he has to grow up real fast or die.<br />This is a sensational thriller, following Colin's moral dilemmas of being dragged into a world of evil thoughts of rape and murder he doesn't want to be a part of.  Can Colin escape this world?  Can he do so alive?<br />This is one of Koontz's best novels.  Koontz takes you right into the thoughts of Colin and Roy's minds so much so that you think you know them intimately.  Read this book, as Roy would say.  \\"It's a real popper!\\"	2003-09-06

For a children's story this book is pretty average and boring.  For a parodied fairy tale it's also below average.  There are far higher quality both children's and adult fiction retelling of or in fairy tale format books out there.  Gary Larson's, There's a Hair in my Dirt! Would be my pick for the best fairy tale style children's book (adult's will love it too) and Once Upon a Crime would be my pick for the adult fiction readers.<br /><br />I really didn't like this book.  I think the author came up with a good idea of reversing the wolf and pig roles but obviously couldn't develop it further.  The artwork in the book is pretty average as well.<br /><br />Obvious situations don't happen in this book and aren't explained.  Why the wolves don't stand up for themselves or just call the police for one.  Why are other animals carrying around bricks, cement and other heavy building equipment while walking if they have no intention of using it themselves is another. Becasue you know I often carry around building materials when I go for a walk.<br /><br />The ending is terrible (don't worry I won't give it away) and very unrealistic.  Kids could be taught through the story how to deal with bullies or crime and other messages in this book if it was written properly.  Give this a miss.<br /><br />A great sequel to the original Three Little Pigs tale is the children's book [[ASIN:059062380X Porkenstein]]. In this tale the surviving pig from the house of bricks is a mad scientist and decides to make himself a friend.  Another great parody of the three little pigs is [[ASIN:0140544518 The True Story of the Three Little Pigs]]. Buy one of these instead.	2003-09-03

Stephen obviously wasn't home and his wife or kid had to search for the stories.  They found three in a drawer or something and quickly handed them over.  Obviously these weren't the ones King had intended as these three stories have no ending and are obviously incomplete.  They are good stories but they're like reading a novel where someone has ripped out the last hundred pages.  You get really into the stories then you're left wandering what is going on.  There's no closure, there's no hint that the story is about to end, questions aren't answered.  The other author short stories do have endings but are pretty average.

Countries like Australia, New Zealand, the UK, Canada, South Africa and Japan to name a few, no longer exist and are now just part of the USA.  Europe is the opposing superpower, along with China and South East Asia.<br />In this horrendous world corporations have taken over, with people's surnames being the company they work for.  You don't want not to have a surname in this age.  Police have been bought and are a company for hire themselves along with hospitals and other emergency services which if you can't pay for, won't help you.  The government is another business enterprise which no longer collects tax.  An FBI type division is part of it to which Jennifer Government works for.  Nike and the other major companies have no morals and are prepared to murder children for market share, which Jennifer will not accept.  John Nike is set on ridding the world of the government hindrance once and for all.<br />This novel takes the reader on a pretty thrilling ride, although Max Barry hasn't completely explained the new world, so you have a number of questions which are never answered.  One is with no tax how are the roads built and maintained and the USA able to fund and deter the rouge countries from attacking?  Terrorism is also not tackled at all, with everyone walking onto planes with guns.  I would imagine there'd be increased terrorism in this type of world from those unwilling to become American.  The fact of how the NRA exist in countries like Australia (I know it's now part of the USA) which have complete opposite views on guns to the USA also isn't explained.<br />If you're prepared to overlook things and not know everything about the setting then you'll enjoy this book.  Don't be put off by or even purchase this book because of the Kirkus review on the front cover that likens this novel to the Matrix.  It is not that type of novel at all and has nothing to do with sciencefiction, cyberspace, virtual reality or anything like that.  Obviously Kirkus hasn't read this novel and has just made a lot of assumptions from the cover art.  Buy the book though.  It's good.<br />Also buy Max Barry's first novel Syrup it's sensational.

Order a blank video when you order Mr Murder as you won't be interested in TV again until you've turned the last page.<br />Mr Murder takes the evil twin theme to new heights.  In fact Koontz manages to allow you to feel sorry for Marty Stillwater's twin, named Alfie who has been programmed by evil men to be a serial killer/assassin. Alfie doesn't know he has a twin, nor does Marty and his family, or the detectives investigating the murders.  Alfie in fact does not know much about his life, so assumes he actually is Marty upon seeing a photograph of what he assumes is himself on a book cover.  This is where the fun begins and the Koontz thrill ride really takes off.  Mr Murder is definitely one of the best Koontz novels ever written.	2003-08-17

Other rewrites of the Grimm brothers classics which aren't dealing specifically with political correctness such as Once Upon a Crime for books and \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic's Peter and the Wolf Compact Disc are much better quality and value for money.

Like any collection by various writers the quality varies for each story, in fact to be honest some especially the last few are pretty average but there are a substantial number of brilliant literature masterpieces.<br /><br />Find out the truth about Cinderella with the story After Happily Ever.  This is a superb spin on the classic tale.  Of the Fog is my favourite, a sensational thriller about a guy who is targeted for vengeance by a hitchhiker who he decides not to stop for.  The Better to Eat You With about a guy living in the Minnesotan wilderness who comes upon a plane crash attended by wolves is another great story.  It Happened at Grandmother's House gives us an insight into what it's like to be werewolf.  Clever Hans is another great tale of an Alaskan cruise gone wrong.  Now Fetch Me an Axe takes the reader into the terrified writing of a girl who has just worked out she is about to murdered and has no way of escaping.  Prince Charming is a who done it mystery where the hero works out who kidnapped a girl he just met and fancies.  Snow White and the Eleven Dwarfs is a superb planning of catching your father's killer who happens to be your evil stepmother while hiding out from her with a group of men.  There's other great stories to read as well.  This is really a pretty good collection of crime stories.  Once Upon a Time I read this and was happy ever after finishing it.	2003-08-14

The greatest Koontz character ever created lets you into his mind when he appears about half way through the book. That character named Woofer is a dog who gives the reader an insight into the way dogs actually think, ie being mainly obsessed with getting food. Woofer is a sensational character who although not a super intelligent dog like in other Koontz novels such as Watchers, is still the greatest character of the book. It's a shame he didn't appear a little earlier when the book hadn't yet picked up the pace.<br />Human characters in the book are also pretty interesting such as the detectives Harry Lyon and Connie Gulliver who are complete opposites but honest hard working police officers. Bryan (known as Tick Tock by his tormented) is an evil childish man with sensational supernatural powers who enjoys practicing his lethal powers while waiting to Become. He believes he is the next God whose job is to thin out the human population with the remainders holding him in awe and fear. He targets the two detectives for his next victims but they won't die without a fight.<br />Although starting a bit slow this book especially the second half is a sensational thriller and you really will enjoy meeting Woofer.

In fact she can't remember anything about her life at all except what happened to her fiance a long long time ago in the cave system known as the House of Thunder.  He was brutally murdered by four bigots who did not want him in their fraternity.  Those four men are dead now, she knows this for a fact but she swears she is seeing them in the flesh as other patients and staff.  She is also falling in love with her neuro-surgeon who has a few secrets of his own.<br />This is not a fast paced thriller with most of the book set inside the hospital with Susan in the bed with the reader going into her confused mind.  The House of Thunder picks up the pace at the end but the ending is too easy and not real exciting.  There are a lot better Koontz novels out there than this one.	2003-08-06

When she tries to contact her husband he is not where he told her he would be and after extensive efforts she can not find him.  Neither can the people whose money he has supposedly stolen and their not happy or nice people.  They don't believe Sara's claims of her husband's innocence or hers for that matter and definitely do not believe she does not know of his whereabouts.  The FBI doesn't believe her either so she must find out where her husband has gone or suffer the consequences.<br />This isn't the greatest book ever written but it is worth reading.  Sara Klein isn't the greatest fictional character ever created so you don't particularly care what happens to her.  For better financial thrillers try the author Harry Bingham, especially his novel The Money Makers.  Also Syrup by Maxx Barry is good but The Money Makers by Bingham is the best one.	2003-07-30

If you were not a fan of the first one then don't buy The Lake House as it takes genetic engineering and the kid's abilities to a new level.  If however you were a fan, then your journey into the weird winged children's world will take your imagination far.<br />The Lake House starts off a bit slow with Frannie O'Neill and Kit in court fighting for custody of the children against their biological parents.  Dr Ethan Kane head of a secret sub branch called the hospital of the evil labs known as the School that the kids were created in brings action to the book about a quarter of the way in.  The thrills and action keep up until near the end.  The ending is a little too convenient for my liking.<br />If you only like Alex Cross type Patterson novels then you probably won't like this but if you like most of what Patterson has written then you'll love this.  Unlike other Patterson series books which you can read as stand alone novels if you haven't read their predecessors, with this one you really need to have read When the Wind Blows first to understand the emotions of the children towards Frannie and Kit and some of the story line.	2003-07-10

If you can withstand the boredom to stick with it that long that is.<br />I think if Patterson hadn't already made a name for himself as a sensational author, and the publishers didn't know anything with his name on it would be eagerly snapped up by readers, then it would have been returned to him in the mail with a letter of rejection.<br />There's no story here, or miracle for that matter.  It's just the tale of a guy named Travis McKinley who is having marriage problems and gets fired from his job who follows his dream of playing professional senior citizen golf.  Nothing exciting happens along the way, the book is just a description of a few different golf games he plays in.  If you're really into golf this may be for you but if you're not give this one a miss.  Patterson's other books however are brilliant, buy them instead.	2003-07-10

This one doesn't take you deep enough into the characters' personalities so you really don't care what they achieve or if they get killed while reading. It does have the usual short chapter Patterson style which does make getting through it easier. It is an effort to finish though and a lot of the information in dated now both the Russian and terrorist New York react to it stuff. Unless you're a huge Patterson fan give this one a miss. If you've just heard Patterson is the greatest crime writer there is and you wish to sample his work you're right, but try his others books first. For a substantial number of novels series try the Alex Cross ones they're brilliant. If it's only a short series you want then the women's murder club may be for you with the novels 1st to Die and 2nd Chance. All Patterson books can be read alone but once you've read one you'll want to read all the rest so you're better to start off with the initial novels in the series otherwise it spoils it a bit for the previous rest of the series. The Midnight Club is an excellent stand alone novel as well.	2003-07-07

That year his life long and social outcast friend Arnie Cunningham saw a bomb of a car on the side of the road that he had to own. Dennis didn't like the car, nor did Arnie's parents or anyone else that knew him and they all told him so. The owner Roland Lebay a despicable old man called her Christine, Dennis didn't like that either. Arnie liked her though (the car was a she to him never an it) and he purchases her and loves her spending all his free time restoring her. Being a social outcast Arnie has many schoolyard enemies but Christine won't stand for those sh....ers (you have to read the book to know what this word is). A new girl Leigh comes to Libertyville and she likes Arnie. Christine however is Arnie's girl and Leigh doesn't like Christine but that's okay Christine doesn't like Leigh either. Imagine and evil Herbie the Love Bug or Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and you've met Christine.<br />This is one of King's best books. You're riveted from the first page. King does a sensational job of taking us into the inner minds of Dennis, Leigh and Arnie. I especially liked the start of his Epilogue as well. This is a sensational thriller. You won't go to sleep until you've finished Christine and maybe you'll be too scared to once you have.	2003-07-06

Fear Nothing had multiple parallel stories occurring which all linked as the story progressed, each with interesting unique characters.  The story is a one story novel revolving around the most interesting character from the first novel Christopher Snow, the character with xerederma pigmentosum whose condition only allows him to walk around at night.  His side kick Orson (the extremely intelligent dog) is not in most of this book.  In fact that's the main plot of this book.  Snow and a few of his friends set off to find him and some Moonlight Bay kids who have gone missing.  Along the way they encounter genetically engineered monkeys, time travel and other stuff at the ex military base on the outskirts of town.<br />Seize the Night is not in the same league as Fear Nothing and a lot of this book rehashes Snow's and Moonlight Bay's past to explain them to those reading this book as a stand alone novel.  If you've read Fear Nothing this can get rather boring and annoying.  I found Christopher Snow an exceptional interesting character in Koontz's Fear Nothing masterpiece and looked forward to reading a second book with him in it but to be honest was extremely disappointed.  This book seems to be written as a quick fix to satisfy Snow fan's desires to read more with him in it.	2003-07-03

Koontz combines ideas he has used in former novels and those ideas now polished to perfection have been combined with sensational characters to make a superb thriller.  Shadowfires (the living dead) and Lightning (time travel, guardian angels) are just two that you?ll remember while reading this masterpiece.<br />Ethan Truman a former detective is now head of security for the biggest and richest Hollywood star, Channing Manheim, also known by his adoring pubic as \\"the face\\".  The face's son Aelfric (Fric) is rather neglected and lives an isolated life inside his father's massive mansion.  One day he receives a phone call from a voice telling him to get ready, someone will come in a few days to kill him.<br />The face has enemies sending him packages in the mail with Ethan determined to find the source before the face returns home for Christmas.  At the same time Ethan's childhood friend Dunny (ironically with his name was murdered in a bathroom) has died and his body seems to have walked out of the hospital morgue.  Strange stuff starts happening to Ethan, he has visions of his death and swears he has seen Dunny.  Is he going insane?  He enlists the help of ex partner but still current cop Hazard (very similar to the character, Samson in James Patterson, Alex Cross novels) to help him find out the truth.<br />This is a sensational novel.  One of Koontz's greatest masterpieces.	2003-07-02

Unbeknownst to them a mentally deranged man also sets out on a similar journey with the same destination in mind only he has some time to kill on the way.  What Alex and Colin first think is a game they've created of the van which seems to be following them becomes deadly real.<br />This is a fairly short and simple novel which is very predictable in most parts.  There's not really any twists in this story and its quality does reflect that Koontz has had thirty years of writing experience since this book. You also wonder why they didn't just contact the police when they first encounter their pursuer in the flesh.  Still it's an easy simple read that will only take you a few hours.  This would also make an excellent novel for young people who are first moving from Junior Fiction to Adult Fiction.<br />This rewritten version of the 1973 short novel written under the pen name K.R. Dwyer is pretty similar to the earlier version with subtle changes like \\"the Russians are our friends now\\" and things like that in general conversations between the characters.	2003-06-29

Although this novel's jump was high it doesn't reach the brilliant height The Money Makers did.  Don't get me wrong, this is still a great book and you should still buy it but it is not the literary masterpiece The Money Makers was.  You'll learn a bit more about the financial world as you follow this brilliant plot but not as much as you did in The Money Makers.<br />This book's about the evil multi billion dollar drug manufacturing industry who upon discovering that a brilliant young female scientist named Cameron (giving her a guy's name does become confusing with other male characters at times) has discovered a way to reprogram human cells to fight viruses, set out to discredit her and ruin her career.  Meanwhile Bryn Hughes a financial banker whose wife has left him is terribly unhappy the way his career is going and upon a chance encounter with Cameron learns of her work and knows he can become a multi billionaire through her.  She is only interested in helping people and not the money but reluctantly lets him take control of her destiny.<br />The race is on.  Can Bryn and Cameron develop her work before they are stopped by the drug manufacturer Cornith Laboratories and its billions of dollars in research?	2003-06-29

It doesn't have as many sub headings as it's competitors and each city reads like a chapter in a novel with limited subheadings.  This can make quick searches for things take a bit longer.  This book is more for the person who uses the book to read up and obtain information to plan their trip before travelling.  For those who buy these sorts of guides just to find hostels, bus companies etc while travelling then Let's Go would be a better purchase.  In fact Let's Go is better for the former person as well. This book is better than Lonely Planet Australia though but then hey anything is.  Let's Go both Australia and New Zealand editions and Lonely Planet New Zealand are far better than this book and have heaps more hostel listings and information.	2003-06-27

If you're just using it to plan your journey or you will have a car in Australia then this isn't a bad purchase.  There are lots of coloured maps with things like waterfalls given dots, which is really helpful.  A lot of competitor books don't give you this precise information on their maps.  There's a short blurb of text information on most places in Australia.  If you want detailed information or hostel/motel/caravan park listings then you'll need additional books.

This would make an excellent present for either Australians to give friends, host families, relatives and so on in other countries or for people outside of Australia to buy just to have sensational photographs to look at.  All the major cities and natural wonders are in here.  This would also make an excellent book to use for school projects and the like.

It is a lot thicker than the Lets Go version and believe me, weight and space are important when lugging the thing around a whole continent.  Let's Go also has a fair bit more information than Rough Guide in fewer pages.  I also don't like the paper the pages are made of in this book as it's not a nice texture, is very thin and the pages stick together when the book's been inside a hot backpack and just don't feel nice turning the pages when it's a bit humid. Rough Guide is also rather opinionated on everything from each hostel to local information booth staff friendliness.  I must say I do agree with some comments but a lot I never had the same experiences.  That's the thing about travelling one person can have a great experience with a tourism operator and the next not so good.  It depends who else is on the tour, in the room, which staff member you get and so on.  If this was a constantly updated website that encourages feedback and changed the information regularly than I would see a place for it but not in a guide book. If you follow the author's opinion you'll miss out on some great experiences and even the places he recommends you may still have a bad time at.  That's just the way tourism is.  I'd recommend Lets Go over this for backpacking around Australia.	2003-06-27

There's hardly any information on the places listed and most is incomplete or completely wrong.<br />For example the author lists Townsville as the 2nd largest city in Queensland.  The Gold Coast and Brisbane are two cities alone which dwarf Townsville in both geographic size and population numbers.  I can't really see how the author could have forgotten about at least one of these two giants unless of course he's never actually been to Australia.<br />Most places he will say there is a hostel at ..., but totally ignore the ten or so other hostels in the same place by not listing them.  Even Lonely Planet is better than this disaster.  I guess the only thing it does is inspire anyone who is too lazy to do research that they can get a book published.	2003-06-21

There's heaps of one line or paragraph interviews from each of the four main stars throughout this book.  Most of the book will have a black and white photograph on one page with one paragraph on the opposite page.<br />You don't learn a great deal that you haven't heard elsewhere, but there are lots of photographs of the set and of the cast that you won't have seen before.  The only downside is that all the photographs are black and white and none are colour and that there isn't more information.<br />I would actually recommend Jerry Seinfeld the Entire Domain instead of this book as it has a lot more information.<br />Since the final episodes are never shown as a one hour episode any more this book does cover both of the final two episodes.  I realise the final episode was a one day special in the USA but not everyone lived in America and saw the two episodes as one when they were aired and a lot of people do enjoy watching them over and over again as the two.  The book itself mentions they are two now as well.  Either way if you are talking about one episode or two episodes it is the same episode and that is what this book is about.	2003-06-21

The modern era is severely neglected and the modern films mentioned seem there out of necessity so that the encyclopedia's facts are accurate. For example Emma is covered in depth, both the book and film with the same name but there are only a few brief paragraphs about the more modern version called Clueless.  Reading these paragraphs you definitely pickup that the author wasn't too interested in informing us too much about the modern versions and doesn't consider them worthy of their time.<br />There are two Stephen King novels (why only two?) in here but that's about it for modern literature.  These reports don't even compare the differences between the films and novels which make a lot of fans dislike the movie versions.  Such as Carrie is a beautiful girl in the movie but in the novel was an ugly fat girl which made a lot more sense.  With Misery the woman holding the author hostage cut off either his thumb or foot I can't remember which but in the movie only smashed it with a big hammer.  This sort of controversial information is what I thought this encyclopedia would be full of.<br />This is a good book if you like literature or films from first half of last century but if you don't give this book a miss.	2003-06-21

This is a good book to get conversations going.  \\"Jump the Shark\\" is a phrase used to indicate the moment when fans knew a great show was on the decline and the magic is or would be over soon.  Undoubtedly you won't agree with all the author's shark jumpings but I think that's the point.  They're there to make us remember and say, yeah definitely or I don't think so.  Best to read this amongst friends to really get the debate going.<br />Most of the American TV shows (there's none from the UK , Aus etc) are in here but some aren't.  There's also rock stars although they're mostly from a few decades ago.  Sports stars and politicians are here as well although all are American so I've never heard of most.

This novel is written as a computer talking in first person to its creator Alex, pleading with him to be let out of the box it is imprisoned in.  It recounts how it stalked Alex's ex wife Susan, took control of her house's cameras and security system, and then held her prisoner so it could impregnate her and recreate itself as a human. It also took control of a deathrow inmate named Shenk who it controls through chips in his brain who act as its hands.<br />The main flaw of this novel is since the computer is pleading for release from its prison of the box you know that it wasn't successful from the beginning of the book.  Written in first person talking style makes the book less enjoyable to read as well.  Since Koontz went to all the effort to update the movie star references so that the book would seem more modern you'd think he would have polished the rest as well being that he had 24 years more writing experience since the initial version.  It would have been a lot better if you were not aware it was in a box prison until the end.<br />There's better books out there with computers with human abilities such as the Blue Nowhere by Jeffrey Deaver.  This is an all right book if you're not into surprises.  If you don't like being able to work out the plot of a book from the beginning then give this one a miss.	2003-06-07

The end chapters do taint the beginning of the book as you are gripped into the lives of the characters and Norman is a brilliantly put together evil character, probably one of the greatest villains of all time!  I especially liked his Talk to you Up Close saying which made him seem particularly evil.  His dealings with other characters in the book while tracking down Rose are exceptional in turning this book into an edge of your seat can't put down thriller.<br /><br />You just want to read a realistic ending than this cheapened one, and see Norman either get his comeuppance from Rose or have Rose escape forever or whatever the ending will be, you just want it to be realistic!  You should still buy this book as the majority of it is brilliant but just be prepared for an ending which is different to the way the rest of this brilliant story is going.  I realise King is a horror, supernatural world writer, I've read and enjoyed practically everything he has ever written but I didn't think there was a need to introduce the supernatural element in this book. It was already his most terrifying thriller without it.<br /><br />If you like this plot also check out Lisa Gardner's fleeing cop domestic violence husband novel [[ASIN:0752814303 The Perfect Husband]].	2003-05-31

Where is Weird Al Yankovic, Ben Folds and others?  This book does have some basic information on the bands contained such as when and where they formed, were signed etc, but nothing you probably don't know if you're already a fan.  It is also missing albums such as for example Bon Jovi's One Wild Night Live album.  This book is good maybe for school assignments if you are researching bands that you have no knowledge of but this book's competitors have much better information.  There's also no index or contents page which makes finding who you're after take a bit longer.  The paper the pages are written on is also fairly cheap ... feeling yellow looking white paper.  If you want a book on this sort of thing try Q Rock Stars Encyclopedia and others.  They're much better.	2003-05-31

This book also has more expensive smooth glossy type paper for it's pages so will still look good after you've have it for a while.  Inside you'll find info such as where the bands are from, when they signed and the usual album information.  This book also tells you stuff like this star went to jail for 9 days for whatever they did and other interesting stuff.  It goes a lot more in depth than Rolling Stone does.  Definitely good for research for school or just for trivia nights.  The only downside to this encyclopaedia is that it doesn't list all the rock stars.  Where is Weird Al Yankovic?	2003-05-31

That story is The Mist about a strange mist engulfing a small town which makes bugs and other things which used to be small huge. Read and see if the meek shall inherit the earth.  It's a shame this one wasn't made into a full length novel as it's sensational.<br />Like in Nightshift there are great stories but also average ones.  Other people however think the ones I think are average are great so maybe you will too.  I liked The Raft, Uncle Otto's Truck, Cain Rose Up and The Monkey. Telling what each story is about will give away too much of the plot and the surprises you want to encounter.  If you liked Night Shift then you'll like this collection.  King does have a bit different style with short stories but even if you don't really like them you've got to at least read The Mist.	2003-05-31

This new edition by Let's Go isn't too different to its predecessors but it is slightly smaller in size. Every centimetre and gram of weight does count when you're lugging the thing around the vast continent of Australia. Let's go has also introduced some new small features down it's left hand columns on some pages.  They are In Recent News which reports on regional issues that may affect you tells you about recent local council works or stuff like what is happening with Tim the Yetti Man. Irrelevant, yes and weight adding but somewhat interesting if you're bored somewhere. The Local Story, From the road, The Big Splurge are a few of the others which are equally irrelevant to most backpackers and seem to have been created just to give the book a new look so you'll buy the current instead of an older version.  The big grey rectangle with interesting tid bits still exists. Find out why Hungry Jacks is called Burger King down here for example.<br />A fair number of hostel listings are in here but not all of them.  There are lots of free  publications in a lot of hostels with most hostels listed so if buying the book for this  reason alone maybe save your money.  There is still a lot of weight unnecessarily taken up with stuff such as hotels and restaurants which backpackers obviously never use.  Let's Go should produce two versions one for travellers interested in that kind of stuff and one for backpackers. This book would then be half the size and weight.<br />This book is good for general information on Australia especially if you've never been here before or don't know much.  You don't really need one of these types of books to travel Australia or anywhere else but if you must get one definitely get this over Lonely Planet.	2003-05-31

To be honest not all these stories are great but there are enough that are to make it a worthwhile purchase.  Trucks is the one I've remembered after all these years.  Imagine if all the vehicles out there didn't just come alive but wanted to kill you and everyone else.  You may have seen an average movie called Maximum Overdrive with Emilio Estevez which was based on this story but don't be put off.  The story in the book is a lot better and you're imagination is better than any movie.<br />Ever wanted to quit smoking? Then Quitters Inc. is for you, it's a great one. If you're really into beer then Gray Matter is for you. Children of the Corn is another classic that way surpasses the average movie made from it. You've got aliens controlling a guy in I am the Doorway.  Lawnmower man is pretty good to which the movie made from has nothing to do with this brilliant story.  A few movies have also knocked of Battleground which is about toy soldiers coming to life but no one can beat the original King version and your imagination.<br />If you're a King fan or a fan of short horror stories then this book is a must buy.  It's actually a shame some of these stories weren't made into full length novels because there's some good ideas here.	2003-05-28

There' a Hair in my Dirt may be written in children's story book style but it's definitely not just for kids.  No matter how old you are, you'll love this.<br />A worm is fed up with being a worm and complains to his parents at the dinner table.  His father then tells a tale of life in the forrest following a young maiden named Harriet who loves the magic of nature.<br />Of course nothing is as it first seems in the Larson world and like many of his Far Side human characters Harriet isn't the brightest and doesn't understand the consequences of her actions. That's all I'll say about the story, telling more would give it away.<br />Excellent Far Side style illustrations throughout make this a sensational book.  Look closely at each page and discover Far Side type activities amongst the animals.  Some situations have not seen before in his Far Side cartoons.  There's a fawn scaring its friend by wearing a hunter's mask, a bird cooking eggs on the stove disgusting his wife and a hawk carrying off a poodle.  If you're a fan of Far Side cartoons you can't go past owning this book.	2003-05-28

A deformed little girl Leilani tells her neighbour's niece Micky about her stepfather's murderous spree and her belief that aliens will take her away before she turns 10. Meanwhile another young boy named Curtis with strange powers is travelling around the USA helping strangers while being chased by those who wish to murder him. The stepfather's adventure is also a separate story.<br /><br />His and the boy's are the most interesting of the book, you are tempted to skip the Leilani ones as they're pretty boring until the end.<br /> When the stepfather takes Leilani away Micky of course assumes she's about to be murdered and tracks them down. Of course the boy Curtis links in, in the final chapters as well.<br /><br />Not the best Koontz novel out there but the step father and his revulsion for the deformed including his step daughter is an interesting villain. Curtis' adventures are also somewhat interesting but this book could have been edited better with a lot of cropping of boring parts especially Leilani's chapters.	2003-05-27

Nothing else happens. There's no revenge, no blackmail, no tragic warning, the boy friend doesn't get his comeuppance, there's no crime ring smashed, no serial kidnapper trying to kill the boy. Nothing! There's not even a real ending. This is the worst book I've ever read.

Imagine if dogs were a lot more intelligent then they actually are and you've got the main character of this book.  He escapes from some lab and becomes attached to a kind man (with a past that wants to catch up to him) and a beautiful shy woman.  He of course being a dog knows he should be their best friend and confronts those trying to do them harm.  Being a good dog isn't everyone's cup of tea and the same lab he escaped from has a creature hell bent on finding him and ripping him apart.<br />A human creature who doesn't know about the dog is determined to find the man he has accompanied and kill him.  I particularly liked this evil man who believes each person he kills take him closer to immortality and there are only a few more to go until he can never be killed himself.<br />With the way genetic engineering is going this is an extremely believable book.  You won't be watching TV once you've opened the front cover until you've turned the last page so buy some blank video tapes while you're online as well.	2003-05-25

This book is a real thriller and takes you into the mind of a particularly sick serial killer who likes his vacations driving his campervan across America and killing people along the way.<br /><br />A young woman named Chyna Sheppard visiting her friend's family farmhouse witnesses him in action. Since he doesn't know she's visiting she wasn't on his to kill list. Hiding in his campervan she unwittingly comes along for the ride and decides she must find out who he is and tell the police. Can she accomplish this without being seen?<br /><br />This is a great realistic book which with Koontz actually highlighting the only flaw it has in the story. What if a victim had a mobile phone? I respect him even more for that, this is a sensational read that you won't be able to put down. You'll never follow a campervan and think the same way again.	2003-05-25

Junior Cain chapters were riveting however and I couldn't wait for more.  Junior is of course a particularly evil character without morals that will do whatever, or kill whoever he wants to best benefit himself.  A detective becomes his early arch nemesis and suggests to him someone named Bartholomew will destroy him.  Cain believes this more and more as time goes on and sets out to kill Bartholomew first even though he has no idea who or where he is.<br />Bartholomew living on a farm with his social outcast uncles is a particularly gifted boy who has a huge physical hurdle to get over when he is three (I'm not giving away with what it is).  Meanwhile an African American woman is raped by a white man and gives birth to a girl named Angel.  Junior of course crosses their path.<br />This is a great read but some of the Bartholomew sections especially in the middle of the book could have been left out or compiled into fewer shorter chapters.  Following Junior's life is extremely interesting and fast paced and makes up for the slow chapters of the Bartholomew characters.  All three storylines get interesting towards the end though.<br />This is not the best Koontz book by a long way but an average Koontz book isn't far better than most other writers.  Buy others first but if you've read them all buy this.	2003-05-25

Someone doesn't like her being there and try to kill them both convincing Joe she may be telling the truth but she has fled.  What is the truth?  Joe must find out for the sake of his family.  Of course some things are meant to be a secret and there are people who don't want that secret out.<br />This isn't the greatest Koontz book ever written but I disagree with a lot of the negative opinions of it by other reviewers.  It's still an extremely worthwhile purchase and a great read.  My main criticism is it could have been longer.  Buy it, read it and form your own opinion but don't let others opinions put you off reading it.	2003-05-24

It is thinner than Lonely Planet which is great if you're backpacking as it's less weight.  If one company's version is a lot cheaper I'd say buy it.<br />The main difference between this and Let's Go is that this Lonely Planet is written for a North American audience whereas Let's Go is more for your British, European, Australian, South African and the like markets.  This means those not from North America may find a lot of the information contained in Lonely Planet as common knowledge, especially historic things and would prefer to have less weight by not having this common knowledge space and weight creating information. Assuming you already know the common stuff Let's Go actually gives you more information as it has stuff Lonely Planet has left out for their space reasons. Since the American education system doesn't teach the basics about the world, American audiences may prefer Lonely Planet but others I would think would get more out of Let's Go.  Lonely Planet does have a few colour photographs which Let's Go doesn't but you're going to take your own anyway.<br />A fair amount of the hostels in New Zealand actually do appear in this book with around the same number in Lonely Planet.  Be aware that there are other hostels out there though, so don't completely rely on the book and use the best method word of mouth from other backpackers as well. Of course the price information is out of date as usual.<br />Actually I'd say don't bother with either as you're just reliving someone else's experiences and it's better to explore for yourself but for hostel listings and background info if you don't know much about New Zealand then this is useful. There is heaps of information in every New Zealand hostel on every part of New Zealand so you don't really need it.	2003-05-24

Already lagging behind with previous editions Lonely Planet will have to pull out all stocks in September (when they update their version) to catch Let's Go.  The main difference between the two versions except for a few colour photographs in Lonely Planet is that Lonely planet seems to be written for your American audience so includes a lot of information those of us from elsewhere have been taught in school.  Let's Go assumes you know the basics and tells you other things which are left out of Lonely Planet for space reasons.  There's still a lot of irrelevant space and weight taking information such as hotels and restraints which is irrelevant to backpackers.  They should put out a backpacker version and hotel staying tourist version to reduce space.<br />I would highly recommend Let's Go over Lonely Planet in all versions except New Zealand where they're pretty even.  I would actually recommend not buying either as it's much more finding out stuff for yourself and creating your own tales and memories and not reliving someone else's experiences.  Asking other backpackers is the best way to find out good hostels, transport companies etc and they'll have the up to date knowledge.

It seems to be moving away from being a backpacker book and trying to capture different target markets at the same time.  Backpackers don't care about hotels, restaurants and stuff like this.  We'd rather a few more supermarket listings.  If they want to go after the non backpacker market fine but they should create another book because we're not going to read that stuff and it takes up a lot of room and weight.<br />The information on the actual towns, cities and national parks listed is ever increasing which is good but the number of places listed is fast declining although granted there are more than in Lonely Planet's version.  For an overview of the entire continent of Europe this edition should concentrate on having as many places as possible not just the main ones.  The whole differentiation of backpackers from tourists is that we see places package tours don't go.  The Black Forrest for example is now reduced to a half a page blurb and only mentions Freiburg which isn't really the Black Forrest fairy tale experience type place.  Previous editions had towns such as Schlushee and Titisee which are great places but no one will know to go there.

If you're after a sensational murder thriller book then you've come to the wrong place as this book isn't that sort of James Patterson novel.<br />This book's about kids with wings, yeah you read right, kids with wings!  Of course not everyone is happy for these kids to be out in the real world with their wings so the classic good verses evil Patterson style comes into effect.<br />If you only read Patterson books for the serial killer theme then this book probably is not for you.  If you like the fast paced short chapters and anything Patterson writes then you should get this.  The Beach House and The Jester are better non detective/serial killer books in my opinion.  This is a good read and worthwhile purchase but I would recommend every other Patterson book over this one.  Buy this if you've read all the others first.	2003-05-20

Two virgins fall pregnant and one is supposed to be the antichrist and one the world's saviour. Which one is which, is the question here. One is a poor girl living in rural religious heavy, Ireland and the other a spoilt rich kid living in North America. Both claim to be virgins but are they telling the truth? Religious leaders get involved and want the mother of the antichrist killed. Of course other characters in the book want nothing but to protect the girls. Which one is carrying which baby?<br /><br />Definitely the least good Patterson book out there. If it wasn't written in Patterson's short chapter style it probably would be a lot harder to want to finish it. Unless you're into religion and believe the plot could maybe happen this book will probably be a bit far fetched for you although it does come down to earth near the end.	2003-05-20

This is my favourite book from my childhood as I could relate to all the main 7 characters, being that they were very similar to people I knew or had in the past. Not many people read It, and do not feel the same way.  This book is set in Derry, Maine.  Now grown up, moved away and having gotten on with their lives the main characters are drawn back to Derry.  This book is basically two stories, what happened in Derry when they grew up as kids and in the present with them confronting It and trying to kill It before It kills them. What is It?  Well that's the brilliance of this novel, It is an entity that can become anything.  It, is your worst imaginable thing you fear and it prey's upon those fears which it knows all too well.<br /><br />This is a sensational must read even if you don't like Stephen King novels. Do not be put off by the extremely bad TV miniseries of this book or by people who have seen it.  The book is nothing like the TV show.  Some reviews on this site are clearly referring to the TV show, you can tell by they say It is a clown so don't be put off by them.  Buy this brilliant masterpiece horror thriller.  You'll immensely enjoy it.<br /><br />Update June 2017 - I decided to re-read It, sometimes book, movies or whatever from your childhood that you loved, turn out to not be that great when you revisit them after a few decade.  Not so with It, it's still brilliant!  If you haven't tried It, check it out today!	2003-05-20

Year after year they get a lot of information completely wrong and no one seems to update it with the correct information.  For example this edition lists Surfers Paradise, Coolangatta, Burleigh and practically every other suburb of the Australia's sixth largest city Gold Coast as towns. Obviously they are getting confused with the region north of Brisbane which is known as the Sunshine Coast which is made up of a lot of individual towns. Obviously the editor has never travelled to southern Queensland or this error would be corrected.  The misleading thing then about this book is that it implies it is written by backpackers who have visited these places when clearly with such obvious mistakes someone just read a mistake somewhere while researching and reprinted it.<br />This book also does not contain the majority of hostel listings in Australia which is the main reason most people purchase these books.  There are many free backpacker publications in nearly every Australian hostel so I would recommend not purchasing this book.<br />It does have some background information (although not entirely accurate) and some colour photographs.  There are better books to buy to do research on Australia if planning a trip here then this mistake riddled thing.	2003-05-17

The basic plot is that there is one organisation that every mafia, crime and drug organisation is controlled by. The killer in this book is the head of this organisation.<br />The detective in The Midnight Club is also an interesting character being that he is confined to a wheel chair.<br />A lot of reviews seem to dislike this book but I think it is sensational.  For those who have never read a Patterson novel it is also great as you do not have to be familiar with any other books to fully appreciate the characters.  For those who have read them this is a different detective to follow other than Alex Cross and the Women's Murder Club.	2003-05-17

This means those not from North America may find a lot of the information as common knowledge, especially historic things and would prefer to have more further detailed information which is contained in the competitor Let's Go.  Since the American education system doesn't teach this stuff American audiences will find it fascinating and will have a need for it maybe.<br />A fair amount of the hostels in New Zealand actually do appear in this book which is very surprising for a Lonely Planet as they usually miss about 75 per cent of them.  Be aware that there are other hostels out there though, so don't completely rely on the book and use the best method word of mouth from other backpackers as well. Of course the price information is out of date as usual.<br />If only Lonely Planet could achieve as good a book for their other country/continent versions then they might be a worthwhile purchase.  I'd say buy this if you're a North American but get Let's Go if you're not.  Well actually I'd say don't bother with either as you're just reliving someone else's experiences and it's better to explore for yourself but for hostel listings and background info if you don't know much about New Zealand then this is useful.	2003-05-13

William Gibson invented the word Cyberspace and it seems he is at a rush to use it so he can tell the people who publish dictionaries it has been published and used how ever many times in necessary so his word will appear in them.<br />The stories are very poorly written, you have to read them over and over again to understand what is happening if you can at all. Obviously a writing course was not part of Gibson's multimedia education.<br /><br />He does have some good ideas for plots but he should have given them to someone who knows how to write so they would have been good stories.<br />If you want a good cyber novel try the Blue Nowhere by Jeffery Deaver. If you want a novel on a cyber being thinking it can become human try Demon Seed by Dean Koontz. For a look at the future taken over by corporations try Jennifer Government by Max Barry.

The 140 cartoons in the bulk part of the book contain some classics such as the Inferiority Complex Sufferers cartoon and the ACME Wingbaby cartoon.  The majority are good but there are some that you can tell were being left out of earlier books due to their standard. I love the two cartoons on page 80 (the end of the general cartoon section) that tell us The Far Side cartoons were all a dream of a man and the cavemen, cows, nerdy kids all looked like members of his family.  The 13 full page cartoons at the back of the book are drawn after retirement and in most cases I would say aren't up to Larson's usual brilliant standard.<br />There is also an Afterword by Gary Larson that tells a tale his father drew on his kitchen table about a kid in school, drawing a box that becomes a lightbulb then becomes his mum bending over.

All the children will be killed in 38 hours if the demands are not met.  I liked this book as the author isn't afraid to let his villain be evil in the fact that he kills a child during the bus hijacking lets the reader know this isn't going to be a soppy Disney type book where the hero saves all and no one is hurt.<br />No this book is a true thriller where you know the clock is counting down for the main hero character a female detective who must work out where the children are and what the kidnapper is really after.<br />This is an extremely realistic well written book.  This could easily happen in the non fiction world which is why you won't be able to put this book down.	2003-04-30

The plot is sensational, basically a rich tycoon dies and to inherit his vast fortune his three sons who have basically just been spoilt rich kids and never worked a day in their lives must earn at least one million pounds from nothing in three years. Only one of them can inherit the money, winner takes all. Meanwhile their sister who has been left a place on a secretarial course from her father's will must look after their mother who has become a vegetable through shock of the will's contents so all the moral questions of diverting funds they have made to help their struggling sister are tackled along with morals in making money.<br />Each brother is completely different personality wise and you actually learn a fair bit about running businesses, share trading and everything else along the way. You get addicted to these characters and will not be able to put this book down. It is a riveting read. I honestly hadn't heard of Harry Bingham as an author before this but he's up there with James Patterson, Dean Koontz and other masters of thrillers.	2003-04-29
