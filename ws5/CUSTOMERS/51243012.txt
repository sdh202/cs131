Forbes discusses the Kennedy and Reagan tax cuts and the impact on economic growth and prosperity. The current tax code has over 9MM words; whereas, the Bible contains 773T words.<br /><br /> The author believes that we pay too much. Resultingly, our quality of life suffers. An important dynamic is discussed in the Forbes book. This discovery is that work is discouraged as the top tax brackets are reached by taxpayers so that the tax policy itself tends to discourage innovation and productivity beyond a certain point.<br /><br />The author's goal is to have 65MM returns owing no tax by 2010<br /><br />and Social Security payments nontaxed. The reviewer would like<br /><br />to discuss the dynamics of a uniform consumption tax on goods<br /><br />and services. A consumption tax would discourage excess<br /><br />consumption and impact the poor to a lesser extent than the rich.<br /><br />Persons paying no tax at all would pay a minimum tax based upon<br /><br />excess consumption. The Forbes book is a good start. It should<br /><br />contain some discussion of the consumption tax in Europe and<br /><br />its possible application here.	2005-09-28

The author attempts to represent power used in a positive modality. He cautions us to disarm adversaries with honesty and generosity. Manipulations can be dangerous. In some cases, they can backfire.<br /><br />The author suggests that we can pose as a friend to gain trust<br />and information. This can have positive consequences; however,<br />it can backfire as a strategy. The idea that absence can increase<br />respect is interesting. If we are having an important beneficial<br />impact on an organization,  our absence will surface holes in<br />the throughput of productivity. As a consequence, management<br />will perceive value in the absence of a valuable employee<br />until his/her return. The author suggests that we should<br />concentrate force for maximum value. This can be beneficial;<br />however, the tactic can backfire if the group perceives that<br />it is being manipulated for personal gain. The maxim \\"to learn<br />when to stop\\" is important. There are times when less is better.<br /><br />There are other personal qualities enunciated in this work.<br />These qualities are as follows:<br />- nonchalance or unobviousness in execution/implementation<br />- flattery will get you everywhere<br />- do not be the bearer of bad news<br />- be frugal in asking favors of superiors<br />- master your emotions<br />- become a source of pleasure rather than a burden<br /><br />This book contains some good advice, if applied in the correct<br />context(s). It is well worth the price paid if the precepts are<br />applied dispassionately.	2005-09-28

The answers to many questions posed are<br /><br />quite personal. They will differ based upon each person's<br /><br />experiences, mistakes and capacity to learn and move forward.<br /><br />Each of us have varying values, belief systems and acquired<br /><br />wisdom. In fact, acquired wisdom will differ substantially<br /><br />on a case-by-case basis. Some people will never acquire wisdom.<br /><br />Others will do so incrementally as time and events pass on into<br /><br />the future.	2005-09-28

The concept of a multi-nation peacekeeping<br />force is offered as an important ingredient in the peace process.<br /><br />The author poses the all-important question. This is whether or not the Palestinians want their own state badly enough to behave<br />peaceably once the land is in their custody. Concurrently, all<br />strategic constituencies must support a peaceful coexistence with<br />Israel in order to seal the deal into the permanent fabric of world history. The Arabic word for a face-saving sequence of<br />events is \\" farradbin\\" which literally means \\" no humiliation\\" .<br /><br />In exchange for the promise of an unconditional peaceful coexistence, Israel has talked about a substantial withdrawal from strategic territories-some held since the 1967 War.<br />In fact, the difficult process has begun in earnest shortly<br />after the writing of this book.<br /><br />There is a discussion which addresses whether or not a fence is<br />a necessity. The Great Wall of China was a necessity and it kept<br />out trouble for centuries. The existence of a wall is a defensive<br />mechanism. If it keeps out trouble or reduces terrorism, its use<br />is practical in the short to intermediate term. The ultimate question is whether or not the neighboring parties can formulate<br />meaningful trust relations so that the wall can come down at some future time.<br /><br />The author provides a barometer or predictor of viability.<br />This barometer is the existence of democratic institutions,<br />economic structures, the education system and respect for the<br />rule of law. We cannot know the best solution until an iterative<br />series of alternatives are explored and tested. Ultimately, a<br />demilitarized Palestine will be the best outcome of peace,<br />according to the author. A condition precedent to an evolving<br />de-militarized Palestine would be the neurality of Syria and Iran<br />and the cessation of support for extremist organizations that<br />train and fund terrorism.<br /><br />In addition, a comprehensive financial aid package from the West<br />will provide the resources necessary to put into place the<br />governmental infrastructure and jobs for the Palestinians.<br />Neighboring Jordan can provide assistance with the formulation<br />of a governmental superstructure.<br /><br />Although the author doesn't dwell on it, a whole generation of<br />revolutionaries will have no revolution if there is a peaceful<br />coexistence. The challenge will be to channel these considerable<br />energies into crafting meaningful careers and raising families<br />with priorities other than revolution in the streets.<br /><br />This is possible provided that a coalition of professionals and academicians in the Arabic community coalesce quickly to begin<br />building governmental and private institutions to service<br />the communal needs of the Palestinians. The local residents will<br />need viable housing, medical services, schools and employment<br />scenarios in order to make peaceful coexistence a reality.<br /><br />This work is an important first step in identifying some of the<br />logical processes necessary to handle the many complexities which<br />will follow with certainty as the future unfolds.<br /><br />The newly formulated government in Iraq will be engaged in<br />containing a budding Civil War . Accordingly, there will be<br />no time or inclination to become a threat to the State of Israel.<br />In addition, Saddam Hussein has been contained and he will never be a threat to neighboring countries; such as, Kuwait , Egypt, Jordan, the Palestinians or Israel.<br /><br />The region is in a state of flux. This disequilibrium provides a chance to organize constitutional processes from the ground up.<br />There is an important opportunity which may never present itself<br />again.er present itself<br />again.	2005-08-28

These concepts are the following:<br /><br />- Earth is not the center of the Universe<br /><br />- Newton's laws of motion<br /><br />- Energy and entropy<br /><br />- the relativity of space and time<br /><br />- quantum theory and causality limits<br /><br />- symmetry<br /><br />The author discusses the notion that energy can neither be created nor destroyed. In addition, there is a fine distinction<br /><br />between kinetic energy and momentum. Kinetic energy is a scalar concept ; whereas, momentum is a vectorial concept because of<br /><br />the element of direction.<br /><br />The Copernican theory is that planets travel in circular paths. Kepler explained that planetary orbits are in an<br /><br />elliptical path in relation to the Sun.<br /><br />The work attempts to unite all of science into a simple model<br /><br />based upon the considerable work of Copernicus, Kepler,<br /><br />Newton, Einstein and others over the past millenia.<br /><br />The book is a goldmine for students of science everywhere.

The maximization of lean muscle burns fat. Low carb diets make you fat by  depleting sugar and flushing water from muscle. They tend to fatigue people and derail the \\"at rest metabolism\\" of the body.<br /><br />The author advises to eat breakfast within an hour of waking and every three hours afterward until three hours prior to bed.<br /><br />The book urges us to eat a balanced diet with Omega 3 fatty acids. Eating once every three hours turns off the starving<br /><br />mechanism and increases energy and metabolism. Aspirin supplementation reduces heart attacks. A multi-vitamin helps to provide nutrients consistently. Vitamin B adds folate to the<br /><br />body. The book urges us to keep our living quarters clean by<br /><br />throwing out old sponges and maintaining surfaces with bleach.<br /><br />Overall, the book is a good addition to the personal medical library.

The importance of liver detoxification is a classic part of the alternative medicinal regimen. Generally, the liver burns fat, acts as a metabolizer and detoxifies the blood of waste materials.<br /><br />Overloading the liver results in weight gain, cellulite, bloat,<br /><br />increased blood pressure and fatigue. Liver stressers are caffeine, sugar, medications and emotional stress.<br /><br />The standard flush consists of a mixture of Cran juice and water,<br /><br />psyllium and/or flaxseed. This produces a potent phytonutrient<br /><br />mix which is rich in antioxidants which provide classic cofactors for optimal liver functioning. In addition, the combo helps to digest fatty globules in the lymphatic system. The cocktail<br /><br />discharges fat generally. Eggs help to regulate bile.<br /><br />Broccoli and kale are sulforaphranes which convert toxins to<br /><br />non-toxic materials. Ginger root is known to increase metabolism.<br /><br />Lipotropic herbs are dandelion root and milk thistle. Milk thistle is a classic producer of liver enzymes which helps to repair damaged tissues.<br /><br />Certain foods trigger destructive activity in the immune system.<br /><br />i.e. dairy, wheat, sugar and yeast which together account for<br /><br />approximately 80% of food reactions. B complex prevents fat buildup. Candidiasis yeast overgrowth occurs. To counter this<br /><br />overgrowth, the body needs essential fatty acids (Omega 3),<br /><br />vitamins and amino acids. Decreased cortisol levels increase stress.<br /><br />In the first phase of the detox program, subjects drink 64 ou. of cran and water and 48 ou. of plain water in a later phase.<br /><br />The Long Life Cocktail consists of diluted cran and flaxseed or<br /><br />psyllium. The classic fat flush would have us avoid coffee,<br /><br />alcohol and sugar. The dietary regimen described should be enhanced with daily exercise.<br /><br />The presentation has a considerable following in the alternative medicinal community , as well as adherents to complementary medicinal approachs. The program should be coordinated with a professional nutritionist and applicable medical providers.esentation has a considerable following in the alternative medicinal community , as well as adherents to complementary medicinal approachs.

For instance, aging causes increased blood pressure in the arteries<br /><br />as does smoking and bad (LDL) cholesterol and inflammatory reactions. Nitric Oxide assists the arteries in opening up to avoid dangerous constrictions. The C-reactive protein is an important barometer of inflammatory response. Nuts, Omega 3 fish oils and green tea assist the body nutritionally.<br /><br />Many classic diseases have magnified inflammatory response as<br /><br />a primary culprit. Examples of these diseases are heart/circulatory problems and chronic arthritic problems.<br /><br />Foods; such as dairy, fried fast food and coconut oil aggravate<br /><br />problems with bad cholesterol. Classic bioflavinoids are<br /><br />tea, red wine, cran, onion and tomato juice. These foods provide<br /><br />badly needed phyto-nutrients to the body.<br /><br />This is an important work in the alternative medicinal area or<br /><br />the complementary medicine area.

This work contains pertinent examples on the English language<br />portion of the exam, as well as the Mathematical computation.<br />A strength of this presentation is that it focuses the<br />candidate's attention on problems certain to be tested.<br />The authors set forth a thorough review of techniques for<br />approaching problem sets and completing the exam within the<br />time allotted. This is an exam where each question is allotted approximately 1 and 1/2 minutes. There is barely enough time;<br />however, there is none to waste.<br /><br />Much of the higher math is beginning and intermediary algebra.<br />The student might encounter the following exam questions in math<br />(according to the author):<br /><br />-  3 SQR 8  minus  SQR 18 =  3 SQR 2<br />-  The area of a square is  4a^2. Find the perimeter.  Ans. 8A<br />-  Estimate  y=  4x^3  where x= 2/3  Ans.  1.2<br />-  A triangle has an angle of 50 degrees and two equal angles.<br />  Find the angles.  180-50= 130  and 130/2= 65 degrees<br /><br />-  Solve  ( a SQR 42/  b SQR 7 )=  a SQR 7  x SQR 6/  b SQR 7<br />  The SQR of 7 is in the numerator and denominator:.  aSQR6/b<br /><br />  Plenty of math questions (identical to the above) are<br />provided by the author throughout the text. As such, this is an<br />important strength of the work. As a former teacher of<br />College Algebra,Probability/Statistics and Computer Applications,<br />I can attest to the importance of solving many pertinent problem<br />sets to grasp the subject matter comprehensively.<br /><br />The English language portion of the exam requires paragraph reading<br />and interpretive questions. On paragraph reading, the<br />candidate should read the questions first, then attempt the answers.<br />Very often, there are questions on \\"the purpose or theme\\" of the presentation. The answers may be in the first sentence or the first paragraph. IT PAYS TO UNDERLINE ON THIS EXAM. The authors of this text explain the cited methodology.  Some students could benefit from additional reading practice.<br /><br />Vendors; such as \\"Speed Your Read\\", \\"Eye Q\\"  or Evelyn Wood provide  instructional algorithms which set the reading speed incrementally  up to 2000 words per minute or thereabouts. A weakness of this work  is that the author may assume too much information about the reading component of the exam. Some students would benefit from<br />a supplemental reading course in order to strengthen their<br />overall performance on the SSAT exam.<br /><br />In addition, candidates are provided sentences to place in a logical order. The exam is straight-forward for the well-prepared candidate.<br />The optimal study regimen would involve<br />purchasing this text or one like it. Study a formal review<br />text or course for approximately 3 months prior to the actual<br />test administration. This acquisition is valuable because it<br />explains how to study for the exam comprehensively without cramming<br />the night before the test administration.<br /><br />A minority of students (perhaps 1/2 of 1%)  can literally look at individual problems and solve them . Most students are not in this category.

Religious scholars<br />may take exception to several errors in the chronology and fact<br />checking with regard to some of the earlier Papacies. The work<br />correctly cites the election of Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger to the<br />Papacy. He was elevated from being Dean of the College of Cardinals and the Prefect of the Congregation of the Faith. Pope Benedict the XVI has written over 100 books by the roster on Amazon.com.<br /><br />The author points out that iterative change is the cornerstone of the Papacy-particularly in the early years. The volume cites Popes Leo I and Gregory I as having great spiritual power. Pope Innocent III was elected at the young age of 38.<br />He was a brilliant canon lawyer at the time. Pope Leo XIII<br />served through two centuries. Saint Malachy provided an historic vision of Popes until the time preceding the greatest tribulations and Gloria Olivae could be associated with the<br />elevation of Pope Benedict XVI. Previous German Papacies were<br />cited; namely, Clement 2, Damasus 2, St. Leo 9 and Victor 2.<br /><br />Benedict XVI was born on April 16, 1927 in Marktl am Inn.<br />He grew up in Bavaria. Later on, he founded the Communio- a<br />Catholic journal. He studied St. Augustine and St. Bonaventure<br />avidly. In addition, he spent much time trying to divine the<br />interconnection between salvation history and revelation.<br />Pope Benedict XVI is considered one of the three most important<br />Catholic theologians in recent history. He was elevated to the<br />Papacy because of his unique knowledge as a theologian and<br />expert on Church teachings. As Pope, Benedict XVI will be faced<br />with a triparte reconciliation or amenable coexistence between Catholicism, Judaism and the tenets of Islam.<br /><br />The American Theological Experience will be another important frontier for the new Pope. On matters of Church teaching, the new Pope will speak with considerable authority firmly grounded in prior Church teachings. It remains to be seen whether or not Pope Benedict XVI will be facilitative with regard to the challenges posed by the American Theological Experience in this century. The current work is a good primer on what to expect from now onward.ty firmly grounded in prior Church teachings.

At the time, the Church had absolute power. A person's fate could be sealed by the<br />whim of a local lord or bishop. The character of Lady Kathyrn<br />was caught between taxes in the realm and the tithes of the Church.<br /><br />In addition, a seemingly unsolved murder of a local cleric caused<br />much consternation . The story unfolds with the<br />character of John Wycliffe- a master of Balliol College,<br />Oxford University working as a cleric by day and operating in<br />Spartan-like chambers by night. There is much intrigue<br />with the taking in of the Illuminator and the daughter for<br />protection by the monastery. The book ends with a classic<br />conflict between practical worldliness and the stuff of dreams.<br /><br />The work quite correctly depicts typical predicaments for people<br />living in England during the time period of the story.<br />The main characters are shown in a complex web of intrigue<br />as the story unfolds from a simple beginning to many twists<br />and turns until the end. The author wrote a predictable script<br />for this 14th century tale. The language of the book depicts<br />the fine literary expression of the period in the belles lettres<br />style of writing.	2005-07-19

It shows the diversity of the animal kingdom. For instance, the same human genetic that controls the arm is similar to the genetics of a bird's wing or the fin of a fish.<br /><br />These types of relationships allow us to study fossils more<br /><br />carefully in order to make projections to the modern animal<br /><br />kingdom. An important strength of the work shows us how genetic<br /><br />information is stored, coded and de-coded. There is a master gene<br /><br />which controls eye formation in flies. Broca and Wernicke found<br /><br />areas associated with speech function. This acquisition would<br /><br />be important for biologists, geneticists and others in modern<br /><br />medicine. It contains important scientific information and<br /><br />would be a good purchase for any medicinal research library.	2005-07-19

Classic manifestations of thyroid<br /><br />cancer are discussed. i.e. neck lumps, voice changes, breathing<br /><br />and swallowing difficulties and lymphatic node swelling.<br /><br />The TSH test is an important thyroid test tool with a problematic<br /><br />reference range in excess of 2.5mIU/L. Classic thyroid problems<br /><br />are with T4 cell production,  T4 to T3 cellular conversion<br /><br />and cellular absorption for T3 cells with regard to weight loss.<br /><br />Important thyroid treatment modalities are probiotic pearl, zinc,<br /><br />selenium, L-tyrosine, guggul and Omega 3 fish oil.<br /><br />Food caloric intake is an important formula parameter:<br /><br />Food calories= basal metabolism + calories expended with activity<br /><br />  + calories expended in digestion<br /><br />Classically, too many carbs cause an adverse insulin reaction.<br /><br />Therefore, the endocrine system experiences imbalances due to<br /><br />diabetes and leptin resistance.  Certain foods promote goiter<br /><br />formation. These are broccoli, kale, millet, soy, brussel sprouts and mustard. A single muscle can take up to 50 calories per day<br /><br />to maintain. Fluoride levels should be kept to below 4,5 mg/ day<br /><br />for optimal thyroid functioning.<br /><br />This volume provides good advice for persons having thyroid<br /><br />issues either hyper or hypothyroidism, as well as metabolic<br /><br />issues.

162087:US	51243012	R1JC1CXNP0L8Q8	0975599518	192748477	Natural Cures "They" Don't Want You to Know about	Books	5	31	56	N	N	Natural Cures et al. by Kevin Trudeau	The book presents some known and little-known health maintenance<br />protocols. A strength of the work is that the author discusses<br />the foundations of classic diseases; such as, MS and others.<br />Trudeau offers solutions; such as, elimination of toxins,<br />super nutrients, kelp/ seaweed nutrition, allergic food groups, minimization of electromagnetic chaos and other modalities- not necessarily known to all doctors. Overall, the volume would be<br />very helpful in crafting a wellness maintenance strategy far into<br />the future.<br /><br />The book doesn't cite specific examples of classic research<br />into the supernutrients which combat chronic disease processes<br />and maintain health through the control over inflammation.<br />For instance, Dr. Linus Pauling MD did considerable<br />research on the role of ascorbate in combating cancer. Additional<br />work was done with Dr. Ewan Cameron MD on the role of Vitamin C<br />in combating cancer. Dr. Pauling's research covered the role of<br />micronutrients in recombinant RDA. Many naturally based protocols<br />have been made part of medicine in German practice- most<br />notably \\"Bundesurztekammer and Patienteninformationen\\" .<br />In Germany, garlic is utilized in some antibiotic medicinal<br />applications. In the USA, Dr. Burzynski MD has an ongoing<br />clinical trial for a number of carcinogenic applications.<br />Dr. Gary Null has a number of interesting protocols grounded<br />firmly in the medical journals of Europe.  i.e. The Lancet<br />The author should incorporate the existing clinical trial evidence and medical practice in alternative medicinal protocols<br />throughout the world- not just here in the USA.<br /><br />Despite the noted weaknesses, the volume introduces new areas of inquiry for consumers when he discusses specific treatment options with physicians and other medical providers. The areas of complementary and alternative medicine provide cheaper alternatives for a whole collection of diseases and chronic conditions. Kevin Trudeau enunciates these cheaper alternatives with specific scientific applications. A strength of the volume is that it explains simple medical protocols for managing chronic diseases more expeditiously and economically.<br /><br />The book does not do enough justice to the role of surgery in medicine. For instance, appendix surgery, bone-setting, blood transfusions and a whole host of short-term medical interventions can be done no other way except via immediate surgery. The diagnostic side of conventional medicine should be given credit for blood testing, MRI examinations and a whole host of vital methodologies which help physicians discover illnesses so that treatment can commence with some sort of modality- naturally based or not.<br /><br />The whole area of organ donation and transplantation is given<br />little coverage. Kidney, heart, intestine and lung transplants<br />are common ways of restoring a patient to health without<br />permanent pharmaceutical dependence. Artificial intelligence<br />systems in medicine assist in diagnosing chronic diseases<br />with finite differences in the symptomatologies presented by the<br />patient. Mechanical pump technologies can deliver precise doses<br />of insulin to patients, as well as morphine and other vital<br />medications. The eye laser surgery has been successful in<br />enhancing vision without glasses. Surgery for glaucoma is quite<br />standard practice. Advanced hearing aids assist in auditory<br />amplification unavailable decades ago. Even medical school<br />teaching has been helped by artificial intelligence and 3D<br />graphics. Artificial limb technology has progressed to the point<br />where patients can obtain incremental functionality despite<br />lost hands, arms and legs. Cosmetic surgery is capable of doing<br />wonders for burn victims and persons recovering from accidents<br />of every kind. Even hip replacement surgery is standard practice.<br /><br />Some of the contents of the work have been written<br />for years in the Journal of the Lancet and other well-known<br />complementary medicinal journals. The author points out that natural health maintenance modalities are not patentable.<br />Natural substances are not patentable because their<br />composition is obvious. The whole idea of patentability is that<br />the art is unobvious.<br /><br />Machines are patentable; such as, massage devices, acupuncture<br />devices , biofeedback instrumentalities, spinal manipulation<br />devices, traction instrumentalities , acupressure devices,<br />advanced imaging devices ,treatment instrumentalities<br />i.e. saunas  , health monitoring devices , cardio-workout<br />machines and other types of physical therapy treatment devices.<br />Inversion machines are aimed at positioning the body multi-<br />directionally to promote better lymphatic system drainage.<br />Clearly, the United States Patent Office supports all types of<br />machinery which helps patients to manage disease through exercise<br />as a supplement to medications or in place of them.<br /><br />Furthermore, substances in the natural state are not patentable unless some unobvious process alters the natural state to provide a unique utility not recognized previously. For instance, the<br />Vitamin C might not be patentable. The Ester C is<br />patentable because the esterification process alters the natural<br />state to produce a more potent vitamin. This process has<br />intuitively unobvious elements; namely,<br />- the chemical combination would be unworkable in the purely<br />  natural and unaltered state<br />- the ester chemical patent successfully employs a technique<br />  previously thought to be unworkable<br />- the new ester Vitamin C has achieved commercial success<br />- it contains a modification not suggested in the natural state<br />  of Vitamin C<br />- it provides an advantage never before appreciated  i.e.<br />  making the Vitamin C more bioavailable<br />- it is contrary to the teachings of prior art  i.e. Vitamin C<br />  in the natural state<br /><br />Ester C is a patented form of ascorbyl palmitrate. The ester is a combination of an acid and an alcohol. With Ester C, there is less discomfort due to excess stomach acid and the benefits of the vitamin extend over longer time periods. The esterification process potentiates the Vitamin C so that it is more bioavailable<br />than other forms.  Supplemental Vitamin C is useful in treating<br />the following ailments and chronic conditions:<br />- anemia<br />- bronchitis<br />- capillary fragility<br />- glaucoma<br />- heart problems<br />- infections<br />- infertility (sperm agglutination)<br /><br />In addition, the FDA does not necessarily recognize natural protocols over pharmaceuticals unless an unobvious process translates the product or process into patentable art with<br />provable claims.<br /><br />Classic drug side-effects are discussed at length. This is an important part of the text because patients may not fully realize the impact of inorganic compounds on bodily vital organs.<br /><br />The idea that there is a natural cure for almost any disease<br />is overly ambitious, although there are health maintenance<br />protocols for most disease processes. These protocols focus<br />on pain management and the minimization of disease progression<br />in order to preserve the quality of life. A number of disease<br />processes have chronic or life-long consequences  i.e.<br />asthma, sinusitis, bone fusion diseases, chronic nutrient<br />deficiencies and certain chronic forms of anemia.<br /><br />Trudeau points out that the control of disease begins with the following steps:<br /><br />- toxin elimination, body cleansing and metabolic waste disposal<br />- eating nutrient rich foods and substances<br />- elimination of electromagnetic chaos<br />- reduction of stress<br />- organic food choices are better than canned or frozenfoods<br />- exercise provides greater body oxygenation and lymphatic<br />  system rejuvenation<br />- greater usage of sea salts, Omega 3 fish oil and Vitamin C<br /><br />Overall, the book is a good purchase as an adjunct to the personal medicinal library. It is reasonable and the research<br />is topical. The author discusses complex medicinal topics in simple English.<br /><br />This book would be useful if you have any of the following:<br /><br />- an undiagnosed condition which requires pain mitigation<br />  treatment until a firm diagnosis is achieved<br /><br />  The problem is to stay alive long enough so that a correct<br />  diagnosis can be achieved over time.<br /><br />- an incurable disease which can be managed with lifestyle<br />  changes, nutrients, physical therapy or any other modality<br />  aimed at reducing the symptomatology of the disease<br /><br />  Certain types of arthritis are in the nature of an incurable<br />  disease.

Books	4	2	8	N	N	Where's My Country by Michael Moore	The author covers many diverse topics in a book designed to retrace the losses in jobs, home affordability and the education system of the early 1950s and 1960s. The population in the U.S.A. grew to well over 280MM. In NYC, the population grew from 8MM to 10MM in the span of a few decades. This population increase has<br />placed added demands on the public infrastructure. In addition,<br />the purchasing power of the dollar has eroded considerably since the 1950s. It is now approximately a nickel on the 1950s dollar.<br /><br /> Health care costs have risen despite the fact that life expectancy in the USA is about the level in Cuba and behind the wealthier countries of Asia. It's difficult to take full advantage of the plethora of medical choices available globally because the protocols in the United States are limited. Conventional medicine is favored, as well as, methodological approaches employed by the government agencies. Within the past decade, the government has begun to review more rigorously the areas of alternative and complementary medicinal approaches.<br /><br />The Asian economies began a significant growth cycle in recent decades. Our technology got to be more sophisticated with greater gains in engineering throughput. Energy technologies did not advance to the point of making solar energy commercializable.<br />Until the energy technologies progress to a point of independence, every Administration will be required to have<br />significant contacts with the OPEC countries and constituencies.<br />At some point (maybe by mid-century), the world economy will<br />be free of foreign oil dependence. The next critical issue will<br />be the replacement of foreign oil production with some other<br />industry in order to maintain the economic stability of the<br />OPEC countries. Otherwise, pockets of structural poverty will<br />develop on a more permanent basis along with the political<br />instability.<br /><br />In addition, the population of the United States is greying . Life expectancy is on the rise and the baby boom of the 1950s and 60s has slowed significantly. The public infrastructure has been declining and the new construction barely has kept up with the need for more modern facilities. The home of the 50s could be purchased for $20T. That same house in today's market is worth well over $250T . Despite the significant price increases in<br />housing, many will inherit homes and personal wealth from family.<br />Those in the preferred position to inherit substantial legacies<br />will be homeowners with an equitable position far into the future.<br /><br />The real estate gains due to holding value do not benefit<br />younger workers starting out with little equity, purchasing power<br />or other resources. The classic financing techniques which<br />benefit big and small businesses are not necessarily known or<br />employed by a plurality of American home purchasers.<br /><br />As a result, the working class saves less and has less. This is not necessarily a permanent phenomenom. There are possibilities<br />for uplifting the working class. First, education needs to be<br />kept affordable and available. There needs to be a renewed<br />emphasis on training for blue collar workers and other highly<br />skilled professionals. Our university system tends to emphasize academic training/preparation instead of professional training<br />and workplace training. Accordingly, the system of rewarding<br />the professorial staff tends to reward pure academics rather than people with professional and industry experience. This aspect needs to change if the society is to benefit from the existing<br />knowledge base in industry, the professional cores and small business people.<br /><br />Utilization of a consumption tax would help to transfer wealth to the working class. Much of America remains underbuilt and mass transit systems need to be developed to transport people to areas where land mass is still plentiful. Work-at-home scenarios could<br />alleviate some of the chronic crowding of roads, major transit<br />system bottlenecks and the imbalance between child care needs<br />versus existing facilities and funding constraints.<br /><br />Housing codes should be liberalized to take advantage of<br />manufactured homes and granny flats as a cheaper alternative.<br />The small business sector has been a growth area for the past decade or more. The government needs to subsidize small business with outright grants instead of loans alone.<br /><br />Many of our government programs are unknown to the lower and middle class. The government needs to provide more outreach to instruct people as regards how to apply for the various programs available to the poor and working class. There should be more accountability for private pension funds with greater participation by the account holders in fund decision-making<br />and Board of Director activities.<br /><br />The rebirth of the manufacturing sector begins with the identification of consumer needs, purchases and preferences. The government has instituted enterprise zones to encourage business growth. Component part manufacturing, assembling and product development are all areas where American manufacturers have historical strengths. Both the public and private sector must develop a partnership to satisfy business needs with outright grants and assistance as necessary.<br /><br />Our collegiate education system is still the strongest ace.<br />Primary and secondary education could benefit from support gained through partnerships with the professional core of engineers, physicians, scientists, actuaries and a plethora of technical specialties too numerous to list. These constituencies have the knowledge and expertise. The challenge is to structure the education system administratively so that it can benefit from the technological knowhow already present in the economy.<br /><br />Rebuilding a growing country will take time; however, the<br />resources and knowhow are in place in the current economy.<br />The strategic constituencies with the resources need to be<br />engaged constructively so that the society as a whole can benefit<br />from the considerable knowledge base created over generations.<br /><br />The author posed some perplexing questions for the country at large. Somewhere in the paragraphs above lies an answer with<br />a practical implementation process.rk-at-home scenarios could<br />alleviate some of the chronic crowding of roads, major transit<br />system bottlenecks and the imbalance between child care needs<br />versus existing facilities and funding constraints.<br /><br />Housing codes should be liberalized to take advantage of<br />manufactured homes and granny flats as a cheaper alternative.<br />The small business sector has been a growth area for the past decade or more.

A strength of the work is that<br />the author takes the time to define insulin resistance at length<br />and explain the importance to patients. Most people have no idea<br />of the biology of insulin resistance or the impact on quality<br />of life outcomes or chronic disease progression without treatment.<br /><br /> For instance, the standard detoxification diet protocols eliminate sugar, white bread, coffee, alcohol, most dairy and red meat. The allowable items include water (maximally), whole grains (i.e. millet), nuts, seeds, blackberries, strawberries, beans, acidophilus, fresh foods, chicory, escarole, dandelion root, ginger and licorice.<br /><br />Water is a marvelous detoxifier. Certain food groups go well together in combination. For instance eat fats and carbs to reduce insulin. Balance carbs with proteins to reduce insulin.

Various exercise sequences are described in detail. The author describes<br /><br />a one hour period as the optimum workout period to stress the muscles. Any longer can be counterproductive. There is a recommendation to perform the full range of motion exercise.<br /><br />This advice is good from my own personal experience. The full range motion develops real power and torque movements for excellence of execution. The author indicates that exercise assists with mental focus at work or study. The ideal diet consists of many small meals interspersed throughout the day. Foods should be broiled, grilled or steamed in place of frying. The workout charts provide much detailed information on the benefits of each exercise. I don't know that this information is equally beneficial to both men and women in every instance.

For instance, several famous quotes are set forth. i.e.<br />Archimedes stated \\"Give me a lever long enough and a prop strong enough. I can singlehandedly move the world.\\"<br />Bertrand Russell stated that a good life springs from creative<br />emotions. Flowing from this, our focus should mirror the reality<br />sought very closely. Empowerment may be enhanced by asking critical questions at the precise moment of crisis. Tony inspires us to stop asking questions and overanalyzing in favor of<br />constructive action now. Aldous Huxley inspired us by stating<br />\\" Words form the thread on which we string our experiences.\\"<br />The author challenges us to pinpoint specific experiences<br />which make us feel better. Once identified, we should diarize<br />these events to repeat them in moments of depression or melancholy. Tony explains how to minimize depression by avoiding<br />happenings which precipitate failure because their attainment<br />are outside of our control. Some of our activities simply<br />provide little benefit and bring much worry and trouble. The<br />challenge is to identify the useless pursuits and minimize or<br />eliminate them to relieve mounds of worry and purposeless toil.<br />Tony asks that we engage things that engendre confidence and<br />happiness, as opposed to conflict, stress and disappointment.<br />The work is a good rendition on managing human dynamics in<br />everyday life. It is well worth the cost for the considerable<br />information content provided. There is a word of advice.<br />Purchase the book of course; however, once in hand- you need<br />to apply the contents dispassionately in order to move the<br />agenda forward. Many people tend to gravitate around the<br />infamous \\"analysis paralysis\\" wherein they overanalyze facts<br />and situations until the presented opportunities disappear.<br />Do not become one of these people. Instead, apply a modicum<br />of analysis to good opportunities and seize them as soon as<br />your gut feel tells you to do so.nalyze facts<br />and situations until the presented opportunities disappear.<br />Do not become one of these people.

For instance, we should compliment prior to<br /><br />rendering criticism. When we complain, alternative solutions should be offered. As a rule, never volunteer to do something which<br /><br />you have no intention of doing.  Freely admit error. It is disadvantageous to argue when there are verifiable facts available to resolve the issue quickly and without contention. Unsolicited advice can be a blunder. We should never miss an opportunity to praise people publicly for their achievements/accomplishments.<br /><br />Criticism should be rendered privately. Never jump into a<br /><br />conversation when you want something specific and lack advance<br /><br />preparation to argue the point persuasively. When promised,<br /><br />provide a final answer or response. Always provide multiple<br /><br />choices in a  complex decision-making process. Overall, the volume is worth the price for the many pearls of practical wisdom offered. This book is much in the character of Andrew Carnegie<br /><br />or Tony Robbins in its philosophy and practical approach to<br /><br />the behavioral dimension of human beings.	2005-05-29

It would help to have illustrations of<br />formal hypotheses and conclusions for the concepts enumerated. The nature of the work is theoretical with the delineation of world subcultures and cultures not set forth. The existence of<br />these subgroups and strategies to deal with them is a major<br />stumbling block in areas; such as Iraq, the West Bank and many<br />other areas of the world where chronic conflict continues to<br />exist.<br /><br />Chopra discusses how the concept of demonization leads to separation much in the character of classic philosophical arguments of negations and negations of the negations. Nationalism is equated to militarism, as war<br />is associated with power. The old order is likened to an iterative series of tangled webs, fear and greed. The author asks that we concentrate on the inner self and the transition of our inner values into societal relationships, breakthroughs and<br />positive environmental changes. We need to examine our inner<br />values to make certain that they are not too self-centered.<br />Instead, these values should place a premium on other actualization and giving.<br /><br />The work helps to put into place a process for hammering out the details of any global movement toward peace by dealing with the universalist principles enunciated. The work would be invaluable for social planners, philosophers, theologians, historians and a wide audience both inside and outside formal academe'.<br /><br />Peace is a universal mindset. A goal of the author is to have the peoples of the world embrace peace in a collective mindset, as a condition precedent to moving positively in that direction. The author needs to enunciate how to accomplish this feat practically and what to do when a few individuals gain the attention of the<br />world community for any meaningful time period. How is this<br />process harnessed so that it does not get out of control?<br />Once very large groups of people have been engaged successfully,<br />there needs to be a mechanism to channel this energy constructively and on a continuing basis. A global economic boom<br />would help immensely in this regard. Absent a global economic<br />boom, people must be able to sustain themselves independently.<br /><br />Another practical problem is dealing with substantial deviancy from group norms. This leads to another complexity. What are the group norms and who determines them? Any collective movement<br />needs to review the normative aspects of the group's existence.<br />Without a clear system of values, the group structure may<br />disintegrate into an amalgum of individual squabbles over<br />conflicting goals and intractable stumbling blocks in implementation.<br /><br />The work embarks on a meritable theme; however, the details of<br />values, goal congruency and implementation need to be worked out so that the process moves forward constructively.control?<br />Once very large groups of people have been engaged successfully,<br />there needs to be a mechanism to channel this energy constructively and on a continuing basis.

The volume describes a pyramidal structure with<br /><br />faith and patience at the top. Essentially, we must believe in<br /><br />the goals enunciated in order to have the requisite energy and<br /><br />enthusiasm to pursue them rigorously. A certain level of healthy<br /><br />competition and personal poise are necessary to translate ideas/<br /><br />concepts into implementation and action. Each of us must exude<br /><br />confidence and personal health/conditioning to inspire others<br /><br />to action. The concept of team membership and self-control are<br /><br />necessary to move the agenda forward in a disciplined manner.<br /><br />Team members must set goals and work toward attainment with<br /><br />loyalty and collective enthusiasm. The volume describes<br /><br />the conditions precedent to move ideas/concepts into action<br /><br />and finalization.	2005-05-28

The book predicts increases in demographic spending and technology as fuel for the stock market. As an investment, stocks beat real estate according to the author. I'm not convinced of this because world population has been on the increase. For instance, NYC has grown from an 8MM population to 10MM in just a few short decades. In addition,<br />real estate growth is a factor of prime location and the certainty of cash flow. When these conditions are present, real<br />estate valuations increase significantly into the indefinite future. For instance, NYC housing valuations have grown by a<br />factor of 20 or more since the 1950s when a small home could<br />be purchased for about $20,000.<br /><br />The author likes large cap stocks over the long term and smaller cap stocks up through the bursting of the investment bubble. Somewhere in the early 20s, the author sees a major readjustment followed by a considerable boom in the late 2020s through 2040 or beyond.<br /><br />The work does not state how to maintain the boom indefinitely. Practically, a boom must be maintained by increased productivity, new products and markets, budget stabilization, advanced training for employees and the growth of small businesses. Historically, overspeculation in the markets has caused problems together with<br />gross budgetary imbalances and political instability. To the extent that these things can be controlled/harnessed,  we may see a continuation of the boom for a protracted period. In addition,<br />new energy technologies will become an important factor in continued business growth and greater discretionary income for<br />household purchases and savings.	2005-05-28

The author explains how to train the mouth with a bit.<br /><br />Strap holding techniques are described together with strategies<br /><br />to manipulate the horse safely. The volume describes how to cook<br /><br />crushed grain for optimal feeding purposes. Even the evolution of<br /><br />horse teeth is explained. For instance, teeth mature up to the<br /><br />sixth year where shortened teeth evolve. The book is well worth<br /><br />the price for horse enthusiasts and persons charged with caring<br /><br />for horses on an ongoing basis.	2005-05-28

The work is perfect for theologians and<br /><br />philosophers everywhere. It begins with a discussion of the Epoch<br /><br />as a personal vision of G-d and the relationship to earth. The<br /><br />recitation of Jubilees retells Genesis up through the Exodus<br /><br />with a strong emphasis on the foundation of the Halakhah (the Sacred Law).<br /><br />The comparative history begins with Genesis and reviews events<br /><br />up through the parting of the Red Sea. There is a rich discussion<br /><br />of the Haggadah or oral tradition handed down through the centuries. The origin of the world is a series of stories composed in Alexandria. The Gospel of Philip discusses classical<br /><br />ethics and the sacraments. The Maccabee tradition is the 4th<br /><br />book which leads up to the ultimate triumph of reason. The<br /><br />passion of Perpetua and Felicity is discussed within the context<br /><br />of Christian heroic figures. The secular wisdom of Ahikar is<br /><br />discussed in detail with numerous examples. There are numerous<br /><br />Odes of Solomon which contain pearls of wisdom. A classic<br /><br />saying is \\" I hide from those who do not love me.\\"  The Gospel<br /><br />of Truth alludes to salvation through knowledge. A series of<br /><br />25 poems is set forth for the enjoyment of the readership.<br /><br />This work could be a considerable doctoral critique for a<br /><br />theology student. It is well worth the cost for the information<br /><br />content contained.	2005-05-28

This book is invaluable for anyone contemplating a disability claim or for anyone seeking to preserve benefits. The authors explain the elements of a claim; namely the severity of an impairment and its impact on the ability to function in a work environment or setting. The MINE claims are predefined by the law. These are \\"Medical Improvement Not Expected\\". i.e. a number of debilitating arthritic diseases or diseases of the musculo-skeletal system<br /><br />The 20CFR 404 provides an impairment list of conditions. The basic question is whether or not you can do a prior job or another similar one. The criteria will consider factors including<br /><br />exertion, posture, manipulation, vision, communication,<br /><br />environment and symptomatology. Major joint disfunctions are<br /><br />an important marker for disability, as well as, loss of spinal<br /><br />motion. Obstructive breathing disorders may qualify for disability, as well as, inflammatory conditions and chronic<br /><br />digestive conditions which interfere with work.<br /><br />This book will prove invaluable if you are dealing with the<br /><br />government on a claim. The details of the evaluation process<br /><br />are set forth in an easy-to-read format. The volume is worth the<br /><br />price if you intend to apply its contents dispassionately.	2005-05-22

This work contains non-conventional answers to important societal<br />questions. The authors are critical of teachers who teach to the<br />test and assist students in achieving inflated grades. This phenomenon is not necessarily the fault of teachers. It is the fault of administrators who live or die by the infamous \\"Bell<br />Curve\\". The book calls into question the current statistic for<br />homelessness. The authors believe that homelessness numbers are<br />inflated. A part of the book discusses the increase in police per<br />capita as a causal factor in decreased crime. The authors even<br />suggest that abortions have had a part in decreased crime due to<br />unwanted pregnancies. Some of these inferences may or may not<br />be true ; however, there is no particular statistical<br />inference encapsuled in a \\"confidence interval\\" to support<br />the conclusions discussed. A section of the book discusses the<br />banning of abortion in Romania by Ceausescu with an immediate<br />doubling of the birthrate within a year of the abortion ban.<br />The work references popular names in the 21st century.  i.e.<br />Aidan, Beckett, Finnegan and Will.

The presentation is clear and the price is reasonable.<br />Freakonomics is an attempt by the authors to explain the social<br />sciences in an integrative or interdisciplinary manner.

For instance, the author describes how old inventory items can sell for big profits. There are strategies to drop ship directly from manufacturers without ever handling the merchandise. The drop ship directly from the manufacturer to the<br />customer obviates the necessity for carrying inventory and incurring large storage costs. Customarily, the manufacturer<br />sends out the order under your name so that your customers<br />believe that they are buying from you.<br /><br />Auction feedback is an invaluable tool for Ebay sellers. Perhaps,<br />the best source of permanent customers is the group you have sold<br />to already. People who have bought from you are the best source of future sales because they are familiar with the quality product delivered and the particulars of the selling experience. This book is not a cure-all; however, it will assist you in maximizing the Ebay selling experience. My experience in selling tells me that it is to your advantage to answer customer questions on a timely basis and to deliver a product on time<br />and in good condition. This work also covers masse selling to<br />large groups of customers. It is a solid value for the price<br />charged. There is a word of advice. The million doesn't come over<br />a single night.

The baby-boom retirement will create both opportunities and challenges. The opportunities will<br /><br />be to grow markets to serve the new customer mix. The threats<br /><br />will be underfunded pension and retirement accounts.<br /><br />The author provides the next decade as the time to be careful financially. Although he recognizes that<br /><br />many investors are educated, there is a difference between school and street smart investing. The book encourages us to invest cautiously and conservatively in mutuals while diversifying to avoid excess pockets of unacceptable risks.

It was written in the 1500s. This period was years before the classic theories on organizational conflict matured. An important theme of the work is to change with the times in order to have good fortune. This is a critical lesson because it requires us to be accommodative or suffer the consequences of obsolescence-planned or otherwise. Another pertinent maxim is that it is rare for a republic to be fully organized from the beginning of a conquest or reformation. Therefore, it will be necessary to recognize and incorporate<br />old institutions into the newly contemplated governmental<br />apparati.<br /><br />Nowhere is this principle truer than in Iraq.<br />The model government which evolves in Iraq may have elements of<br />old institutions , as well as newly organized structures,<br />institutions and organizational designs. The details of the<br />final outcome may allude historians now; however, the process<br />toward an acceptable organizational apparati will unfold over<br />the next years. Whatever the outcome in Iraq, the principles<br />set forth by The Prince will apply. The optimal government organization will flow from the general acceptability<br />by the various subgroups in the region.<br /><br />The author states that the conquered must develop a natural affection for the new governing class; otherwise, the territory will be difficult or impossible to hold or cultivate. Conquests in France taught us that it was important to win over the Barrons as a condition precedent to a smooth transition of power.<br /><br />Machiavelli's work still has some value today, although there are new organizational techniques and technologies to refine the governmental structures and ensure continuity. In some areas, Machiavelli generalizes too much without supporting data to attest to the conclusions reached. Despite some of the more obvious weaknesses noted, the volume contains many common sense approaches aimed at maintaining order in the aftermath of territorial disputes. The work may be enjoyed by a wide<br />constituency of readers; such as, students, teachers, historians,<br />psychologists, leaders in government and the general public.olume contains many common sense approaches aimed at maintaining order in the aftermath of territorial disputes.

This is not true in my experience. The standard<br /><br />lecturing and case study methods are employed because their<br /><br />use facilitates covering extensive bodies of material in a short<br /><br />period of time. The work is correct in supplementing existing<br /><br />methods with innovative approaches to learning. Several examples are cited. i.e.<br /><br />- students visit a nursing home and paint pictures for the residents<br /><br />- a final exam may contain a mock trial for critique by the students<br /><br />The author divides students into classic groups .  i.e.<br /><br />- learners<br /><br />- true believers<br /><br />- pluggers<br /><br />- rebels<br /><br />The pluggers struggle with the material and rarely learn it<br /><br />comprehensively. Rebels resent classic teaching methods and<br /><br />act out their feelings accordingly.<br /><br />This work has value to teachers/administrators willing to<br /><br />admit weaknesses in the current system in favor of some<br /><br />new and innovative approaches. The book also supplements existing<br /><br />methods with fresh approaches to teaching by the formal lecture method. The author did not emphasize the role of technology<br /><br />sufficiently .  A future version of this book should integrate<br /><br />computer teaching and teacher technological assessments into<br /><br />the overall presentation.	2005-05-01

The exam has a number of<br />lengthy paragraphs followed by a single question. Such a format<br />requires that you read the question first and then read the<br />paragraph utilizing a highlighter. The visual questions aren't<br />much different from a standard intelligence test on spatial forms.<br />The math and science are very straight-forward. The grammar can<br />get confusing with the presentation of very awkward sentence<br />structures requiring correction. Questions on art and culture<br />can get tricky with very discriminating differences between<br />architectural forms. Some of the fine arts questions require that<br />you be able to distinguish between classic forms; such as,<br />Romanesque, Baroque, Byzantine, Greek etc.<br /><br />This test will measure very general knowledge in the arts and<br />sciences. The format gets very awkward in spots. It will be<br />necessary to do a fair number of problems to develop experience<br />with the material. The Postman work is well organized. The<br />problems are challenging. A criticism of the work is that the<br />problem sets are somewhat limited in number although the level<br />of difficulty is appropriate. This book should be utilized in<br />conjunction with others on the subject. I would utilize other<br />review texts for weak areas in order to develop a representative<br />set of problems in unfamiliar subject areas. Testing on amorphous<br />spatial forms and problems contrasting classic architectural<br />differences typify new or unfamiliar material for the candidate<br />reviewing the material for the first time.<br /><br />The volume will benefit test candidates provided that they<br />make a real attempt at the problems with a view toward studying<br />very discriminating differences between the model answer and<br />slight variations from it. This volume is not a reader. It contains numerous problems which depict the material to be tested. Therefore; candidates must utilize the book as though it represented a series of test problems to be encountered on the<br />live examination.ndidates must utilize the book as though it represented a series of test problems to be encountered on the<br />live examination.	2005-04-30

The Barron's book by<br /><br />Postman focuses on the Teacher Certification Exam with much less<br /><br />material. The math and science is very manageable. The English<br /><br />grammar can get tricky with sample responses formulated with the<br /><br />worst diction I've ever seen. Candidates are asked to correct<br /><br />the grammar utilizing the standard English. The questions on<br /><br />art and culture can be discriminating with references to various<br /><br />forms of architecture ranging from Baroque to Greek. Spatial<br /><br />questions aren't much different from standard intelligence tests.<br /><br />In fact, you might try several classic intelligence tests which are geared to measure your interpretation of amorphous forms.<br /><br />This exam requires a very careful reading of every question.<br /><br />In fact, it will be to your advantage to read the question first<br /><br />followed by a fair reading of the introductory paragraph.<br /><br />This technique will save much time . The passing percentage<br /><br />is between 70-75% depending upon results of grading. The best<br /><br />strategy for this exam is to become familiar with the standard problem sets and get a good rest the night preceeding the examination. I would identify weak areas first and utilize<br /><br />other preparatory books to focus on strengthening the weak<br /><br />areas. The Barron's work and Kaplan NYSCE are worthy competitors<br /><br />in the teacher exam preparation market. Do not take this exam<br /><br />for granted because it will be to your advantage to familiarize<br /><br />yourself with the format and preferred model answers. In some<br /><br />cases, the rule structures on selecting the model answers<br /><br />have very fine nuances imperceptable to typical exam candidates.	2005-04-30

Much time is<br /><br />spent on \\" space protection\\" and \\"territory\\". The author explains<br /><br />classic behaviors when we \\"invade\\" another's space. Behavioral<br /><br />manifestations involving unwelcomed space trespass are nervousness<br /><br />and simply walking away or fleeing temporarily.<br /><br />There is a part on \\"masks\\"; wherein , the author explains various<br /><br />contexts where we seek to hide our true feelings-although this<br /><br />aspect gets harder with advancing age. Even crossing legs<br /><br />can have meaning or it can be innocent depending upon the context. Overall, the author makes us mindful of many behaviors<br /><br />which can be interpreted variously in a variety of contexts<br /><br />both personal and business. These are considerations which<br /><br />we should keep in mind rather than \\" hard and fast rules\\".<br /><br />The book is valuable for the fine nuances it makes clear.	2005-04-20

The flaws of classic<br /><br />studies are exposed  i.e.  HERS.  The use of estrogen may lead to<br /><br />the incidence of greater heart attacks in the first year. The author describes a classic labelling chasm which makes medicinal<br /><br />comparability hard to measure/quantify. The concept of tiers of<br /><br />acceptability is discussed in contrast to the FDA current approval process which emphasizes the safety and efficacy of a drug.<br /><br />The Avorn MD work is valuable because the author explains \\"little known\\" measurement problems in establishing a baseline for drug comparability and valuation. This book would make a good project for any science/medical student.	2005-03-31

Often, this is a key<br /><br />to what motivates us and the rationale behind our actions and<br /><br />choices.  Next, he espouses the value of selecting win/win options or scenarios in order to gain greater consent. The author advises us to hire fewer people with greater potential and capacity for sustained work/ contribution to the enterprise. Service is espoused as an important value because it is the hallmark for attracting and retaining valued customers. Relationships are \\"cultivated\\"  over longer time periods rather than the short term.  The notion of cultivation implies a steady but certain incremental development of clients and employees which will make permanency more probable. It is important<br /><br />to understand and have empathy with people in order to cultivate<br /><br />relationships for the longer term. Lastly, the author asks that we \\"raise the bar\\"  of our own personal standards both<br /><br />qualitatively and quantitatively. The work provides us with<br /><br />the basics, as well as the fine nuances with regard to winning with people. This book is a bit more structured than the<br /><br />Andrew Carnegie works; however, the themes and ultimate objectives have substantial congruency.	2005-03-20

This diet will increase<br /><br />life span because it is nutrient rich devoid of too many fats and<br /><br />too much processed sugar. This is a high fiber diet. The fiber<br /><br />assists in flushing toxins from the body amongst other things.<br /><br />Plants, particularly green ones, are nutritional powerhouses of<br /><br />phytochemicals which detoxify and repair cells, as well as damaged DNA. These chemicals also have an inhibitive effect on cancer cells.<br /><br />The book contains comparative data on the nutrient value of different foods in the pyramid. For instance, a steak has 5 gm.<br /><br />of protein ; whereas, broccoli has 11 gms. Omega 3 is a classic<br /><br />anti-inflammatory beneficial for a host of disease processes.<br /><br />A typical diet consists of raw veggies, beans, fresh fruit, nuts, seeds and flaxseed, although there are a plethora of other<br /><br />combinations. This book will help with weight loss, metabolism<br /><br />and the identification of nutrient-rich foods for the daily diet.<br /><br />It is researched carefully. The author's ideas compare favorably<br /><br />with other authors on the same subject. In addition, articles<br /><br />written in the Journal of the Lancet support a number of themes<br /><br />in this work. i.e.  the role of phytochemicals in cellular repair<br /><br />The book is a worthy investment for any personal health library.<br /><br />From personal experience, the book makes sense. I would supplement it with a modest exercise program to tone muscles and<br /><br />develop optimal breathing and increased stamina. Finally, the older you get- the more you will need this book and others like it.	2005-03-20

Unless you are a professional portfolio<br /><br />manager, real estate is still the best investment.  There are<br /><br />important tax benefits/write-offs and it is one of the only<br /><br />investments where you can make money when you buy.  For instance,<br /><br />suppose I purchase a home from a motivated seller at 60% of<br /><br />its value.  If I obtain a loan up to 80% value, the difference<br /><br />can be instant cash pocketed from the deal. Properties that are<br /><br />bought and quickly resold can produce huge piles of cash with little work except for the effort in finding the deal and<br /><br />cultivating the buy and ultimate resale of the property.<br /><br />As an asset, real estate retains its value in contradistinction<br /><br />to an auto which depreciates the minute you drive away from<br /><br />the showroom. In real estate, location is paramount because<br /><br />this attribute will cause the property to have a high buyer<br /><br />demand and rental value. The author asks that we always buy<br /><br />from a motivated seller and do so with no money down. The no money down can be done in various ways. i.e. flipping a property<br /><br />or purchasing a distressed property and obtaining a loan for<br /><br />the fair value of the property<br /><br />As a general rule, the author asks us to purchase from a<br /><br />motivated seller in order to obtain the property for the least<br /><br />cost. The book names several inexpensive ways to make a property more valuable  i.e. building a carport. There are more real estate tidbits at [...]  for the curious.<br /><br />A strength of this book is that it is not a get rich quick scheme. The methodologies are classic and time-tested.<br /><br />They work provided that you do the all-important analysis for<br /><br />each real estate deal attempted.	2005-03-20

These classic stumbling blocks are:<br /><br />- Lack of trust<br /><br />- Fear of commitment<br /><br />- Organizational conflict<br /><br />- Accountability<br /><br />- Inattention to results<br /><br />Trust is difficult to develop unless team members have substantial goal congruency. By fear of commitment, the author<br /><br />refers to \\"analysis paralysis\\" and the fear of failure which<br /><br />everyone has in one form or another. Some team leaders do not like to deal with conflict of any kind. Conflict can have benefits in refining the methodology employed in the project or<br /><br />dealing with disagreements which can delay or derail a project.<br /><br />Accountability is a difficult notion to instill because it inevitably involves assigning some credit or blame to specific<br /><br />persons. Without accountability, there would be no methodical<br /><br />or fair way to map outcomes to personal responsibility centers<br /><br />in an organization. Lastly, the inattention to results is a critical failing point because there can be no improvement without measuring performance against realistic goals .<br /><br />Overall, this work provides realistic measuring rods for moving<br /><br />teams of people toward a successful conclusion of any project.<br /><br />Unless a project manager deals with these classic dysfunctions,<br /><br />it will be nearly impossible to move any project to finality.	2005-03-20

She was known to John Brown who referred to her<br /><br />as General Tubman. She travelled from the slave states to the<br /><br />northern states and into St. Catherine , Ontario -Canada. The<br /><br />Clinton work shows memorable pictures of Harriet during the<br /><br />Civil War.  She gave important help to the Union during the war.<br /><br />As a fugitive, she changed her name from Araminta to Harriet.<br /><br />She was once named as property in a will because slaves were<br /><br />considered inheritable. The book is written like a narrative<br /><br />story with pictures of Harriet throughout. It is a good purchase<br /><br />for serious students of America's struggle through a period of<br /><br />slave ownership to freedom for all citizens.

The examiners test theory by posing situations and asking for the<br /><br />optimal solution. For instance, a discharging motor<br /><br />would present an exothermic reaction in theory. A melting iceberg would present an endothermic reaction. The distinction<br /><br />would lie in a tremendous release of energy (exothermically)<br /><br />as opposed to absorbing energy to melt an iceberg (endothermic).<br /><br />In statics, a rigid body (by its nature) experiences no unbalanced forces. In dynamics, rotational motion describes<br /><br />the motion of a particle around a circular path. In materials<br /><br />science, materials with low values of  thermal expansion are<br /><br />desirable for Pyrex ceramics. Bernoulli's equation is a<br /><br />conservation of energy equation. In thermodynamics, the heat<br /><br />of fusion for a pure substance is the energy required to melt<br /><br />the substance.In chemistry, the amount of energy absorbed when<br /><br />a substance enters a solution is called the endothermic heat of<br /><br />solution. Remember , an endothermic reaction ; such as a melting<br /><br />iceberg, absorbs heat in order to melt the ice. The property of<br /><br />a device that defines how well it stores an electric charge is<br /><br />known as capacitance. A modem converts data from digital to<br /><br />analog signals and back again. A means of obtaining an equation<br /><br />describing a physical phenomenom without actually understanding the physical mechanism is dimensional analysis.<br /><br />All of the above questions have a single characteristic in<br /><br />common. The answers require verbalizing the concept without<br /><br />any particular numeric calculation required. This typifies<br /><br />approximately 25% of the questions tested on the FE.<br /><br />The best way to handle these types of problems is to do some<br /><br />heavy reading of the texts in order to grasp fully the basic<br /><br />definitions . In addition, it is necessary to do as many problems<br /><br />as time will allow . Problem solving will help candidates develop<br /><br />educated hunches to apply to a plethora of situations posed<br /><br />on the FE examination. The exam has 180 or so problems.<br /><br />No candidate can hope to finish the exam. Most candidates<br /><br />will complete a high percentage of the questions with enough<br /><br />time left to review marginal answers and attempt the remainder<br /><br />of the exam. The Whitehead text will assist in developing<br /><br />the judgmental skills to recognize correct choices without<br /><br />utilizing too much exam time. I passed the FE exam utilizing<br /><br />the Potter text alongside Whitehead's text and several other<br /><br />review texts. Lastly, it is important to understand the<br /><br />guidebook handed out during the exam. Sometimes, questions<br /><br />are derived directly from the guide. These are the \\"gifts\\"<br /><br />for candidates who take the time to review the material<br /><br />thoroughly. This is not an easy exam; however, it is doable<br /><br />for a reasonably well-prepared candidate. No matter what the<br /><br />others are doing, do not leave this exam early. Utilize every<br /><br />minute to complete the exam, review the answer sheet and<br /><br />recompute answers as necessary.

This work is perfect for industrial planners, city managers and a whole host of professionals in and out of government. The<br /><br />authors provide a model of change which is a function of<br /><br />competitive choice levels. The book encourages us to harness<br /><br />disruption, study it and develop an anticipatory model to make sense of the random changes. Growth can happen in a variety of<br /><br />ways including exploitation of fringe market opportunities which no one else may identify. The authors decry inhibitors of<br /><br />innovation both governmental and private. Concentration on<br /><br />major problem items may produce significant incremental yields<br /><br />over a focus on parochial issues at the expense of the overall<br /><br />picture. The book provides a framework for gaining the right<br /><br />foothold and eliminating unnecessary effort on areas that are<br /><br />not worth expending significant effort/resources. This work<br /><br />is an important contribution to organizational dynamics for<br /><br />readers open to the in depth discussions and analyses. The book<br /><br />is worth the price charged provided the contents are internalized with a view toward constructive implementation.	2004-08-29

Christ's teachings are<br /><br />universal in nature. They extend beyond the community where you live.<br /><br />The Taoists are concerned with the connectivity between nature and the earth. Even famous religionists are described.<br /><br />Abu Hamid al-Ghazsali (1058- 1111) was a considerable Islamic<br /><br />scholar of jurisprudence and Sufi practices.<br /><br />This work will be useful for any student project on the subject<br /><br />of religious theory and scholarship.	2004-08-28

Real Estate<br /><br />is no different. In fact, it's even easier to invest today<br /><br />because the United States Government wants to encourage people<br /><br />to pursue home ownership.

Overall, the book is a celebration of the human body.<br /><br />A criticism is that it seems to lack a unifying theme or purpose.<br /><br />It is unique in that the information content is out-of-the-<br /><br />ordinary. The author even has a passage describing the arrid<br /><br />landscape on the Marsian planet.

The regimen has included<br />exercise for most of my life. Atkins is not saying that<br />we should eliminate all carbs.<br /><br />He calls for a reduction in the carbohydrate intake.<br />A strength of this work is that it provides model menus for<br />emulation by dieters.

The author is a noted trial lawyer; oftentimes arguing for<br /><br />defendants in high profile cases.

The concept of power is perceived. Even powerful<br /><br />people are fallible and their exercise of power can backfire.<br /><br />Jurors listen very intently for carefully contrived words,<br /><br />sound words/bites and words which portray physical elements.<br /><br />Credibility is important. At times, it is critical to challenge<br /><br />the jury to contemplate undoing an injustice as a condition<br /><br />precedent to entertaining a significant award. In addition,<br /><br />it is important to appeal to a juror's self interest and survivalist interest.

The work begins with his early years at Harvard; wherein, he was denied tenure initially. Dr. Kissinger<br /><br /> worked for 4 Administrations. He argued very strenuously with<br /><br /> the Vietnamese, Chinese and the Soviets. After a short period<br /><br /> in government, he emerged as an interesting diplomatic figure.<br /><br /> He quickly rose to be Secretary of State, although he was<br /><br /> anti-Nixon originally. The former President sought to hire him<br /><br /> immediately and to bring him to the center of power as soon as<br /><br /> possible. The Kissinger diplomacy required high intellect,<br /><br /> strategy and patience in its implementation. His performance<br /><br /> was a virtuoso balancing act. Occasionally, he would sacrifice<br /><br /> form in order to gain substance in a negotiation. Initially,<br /><br /> Harvard denied him tenure because they believed that he had<br /><br /> greater designs in the area of government service. By late 1957,<br /><br /> Dr. Kissinger returned to Harvard to secure a tenured position.<br /><br /> The Kissinger technique was to pose a &quot;spectrum of possibilities&quot;<br /><br /> in order to confound the Soviets in the foreign policy arena.<br /><br /> His approach to the NSC was to combind the best of the departments of State and Defense. The Secretary disliked too<br /><br /> many small details in favor of studying the &quot;big picture&quot;.<br /><br /> Conceptually, he envisioned strategies more in the Kennedy<br /><br /> style than the Eisenhower paper trail. Dr. Kissinger concerned<br /><br /> himself with the important details of &quot;verification&quot; in the<br /><br /> SALT treaties. He found in President Nixon- a willingness to<br /><br /> accept re-unification of Vietnam in exchange for a verifiable<br /><br /> peace. In the later part of 1971, he visited Peking to pave the<br /><br /> way for a visit by President Nixon in May of 1972. The famous<br /><br /> visit accomplished a normalization of relations with China.By<br /><br /> January of 1974, Dr. Kissinger bartered a disengagement of<br /><br /> Egyptian and Israeli forces from the Suez Canal. He continued<br /><br /> to influence public policy long after his tenure as the<br /><br /> Secretary of State. This work attests to a solid career in<br /><br /> public service with many diplomatic achievements and honoraria<br /><br /> to attest to his many accomplishments.sit by President Nixon in May of 1972.

The author begins by describing the lymphatic system<br /><br />together with the linkage to the T3, T4 cellular structures.<br /><br />The T cells deal with foreign invaders and antigen identification. The viral profile, stress, genetics, age, lifestyle and the environment are all factors which impact the<br /><br />autoimmune system. Sufferers of autoimmune diseases should avoid<br /><br />environmental toxins (lead-Pb, mercury- Hg. etc.) Muscular sclerosis is a disease classified in the autoimmune category.<br /><br />There are specific strategies to manage the disease by stress<br /><br />avoidance, diet and purging environmental toxins. Modern medicine is beginning to embrace the notion that a whole host<br /><br />of diseases can be managed or controlled successfully in lieu<br /><br />of a cure. For many diseases, there is no cure-per se.<br /><br />The diagnostic and medical monitoring goals are management of<br /><br />pain, disease progression and psycho-social adjustment and<br /><br />functioning. Some of the more exotic treatments involve<br /><br />emcellular transplantation, oxygen therapies and mutiple organ<br /><br />transplants.

For instance,<br /> washers tend to clean their hands multiple times, take many<br /> showers and repeat actions obsessively or due to shear habit.<br /> Repeaters tend to repeat actions compulsively until they are<br /> performed perfectly or to the perceived satisfaction of<br /> the person with &quot;a repeater&quot; behavioral trait. Hoarders tend<br /> to gather &quot;things&quot; out of a fear of discarding something<br /> valuable. The hoarder may keep every possession ever owned<br /> for fear of throwing out a single valuable thing. Hoarders<br /> never consider the opportunity cost of space. As a self-help book, the authors identify classic situations that trigger these<br /> unhealthy behaviors. Once identified, specific strategies are<br /> provided to combat the undesired behaviors/behavioral traits.<br /> A strength of this book is that it helps you to conquer a host<br /> of unhealthy demons which trigger neurotic retaliatory<br /> responses. The authors encourage readers to act contrary to<br /> these destructive proclivities every time they surface.<br /> The book is worth the price charged-many times over.<br /> The issues addressed are rarely talked about or admitted to<br /> during the conduct of public discourse. This book provides<br /> readers with a private forum to discover their eccentric<br /> behaviors without the penalty of public chastisement or<br /> derision. The book is recommended highly for this purpose<br /> alone.	2004-07-21

Is the Universe<br /><br />real? Combinations of physical relativity and engineering<br /><br />quantum mechanics make it more difficult to prove tautologically<br /><br />whether or not the universe exists. Science is still struggling<br /><br />with a concept of matter at its most elemental level. i.e. quarks<br /><br />The theory of relativity seeks to encompass both speed and<br /><br />direction as does the area of vectorial mathematics. The concept of velocity only makes sense by making comparisons. A theory<br /><br />of space necessarily encompasses a theory of empty space.<br /><br />Therefore, empty space has space inherently. The authors differentiate between what happens in a lab and what happens in space. Quantum mechanics  seeks to break down radiant energy into  subdivisions  of finite quanta. The quanta are representations of energy on an atomic or molecular scale.<br /><br />The authors discuss a theory of MACH which exists at sonic,<br /><br />subsonic and supersonic levels. The sonic level is at the<br /><br />equilibrium level. Sub-sonic is below the equilibrium and<br /><br />super-sonic is above the equilibrium level of MACH.<br /><br />Einstein's theory of relativity encompasses MACH's general<br /><br />perspective. The authors describe how entropy or disorder<br /><br />increases outward toward the future . This means that there are<br /><br />more permutations of disorder-the farther out you go into the<br /><br />future. According to the theory of an expanding Universe,<br /><br />space tends to grow infinitely until a boundary and collapse<br /><br />is reached; whereupon, there is an implosion and iterative<br /><br />repetition of the entire process over and over again. This book<br /><br />is perfect for theoreticians on physics, mathematics, engineering<br /><br />and the philosophical sciences.	2004-07-21

For those drugs included,<br />the author provided a complete synopsis to include:<br />- indications and proper dosages<br />- contra-indications<br />- side-effects<br />- implications in combination with herbal preparations<br />- contraindications in combination with alcohol, smoking or<br />  certain types of foods<br />  i.e. be careful of taking a powerful drug in combination with<br />  a very spicy food, heavy cream, heavily spiced barbecue<br />  sauce or high proof alcohol<br />- precautions<br />- damage to vital organs<br />This work would be more valuable, if a more representative<br />sampling of drugs had been listed. What happens, if you are<br />about to purchase a drug and it's not listed in this work?<br />Nonetheless, the book has significant value for the drugs<br />listed. In addition, there is an exhaustive medical glossary<br />which explains major terms in simple English. I would recommend<br />that the author consider expanding the volume in future editions.<br />Despite the criticisms noted, the book is still a significant<br />value for the price charged.	2004-07-12

The author espouses the virtues inherent in selflessness and individual/collective<br />wisdom. He challenges the reader to embrace creativity and<br />generosity in interpersonal relationships. Most importantly,<br />the work demands that we do a critical self-examination to<br />determine what is within us. It is only by knowing ourselves<br />thoroughly that we can transcend our current condition.<br />This self-transformation is a condition precedent to achieving the creativity and generosity of spirit needed to help others.<br />The book challenges us to transcend ourselves and achieve<br />levels of learning and experience outside the normal everyday<br />patterns of life. It is an important contribution to<br />religion, philosophy and the psycho-social sciences.	2004-07-10

Under the leadership of Zhu Di,<br />worldwide travel flourished in China. Advanced concepts of<br />Maritime Engineering were implemented. Chinese seafarers<br />ate fish and Oolong tea. The explorations began in China and<br />traversed India, the Far East, Africa, the Falkland Islands and<br />Australia. For the first time, the DNA of the American Indians<br />contained diseases which originated in China. The Maize<br />plant was unknown in China previous to an explorer named &quot;He&quot;.<br />Zhou Man's fleet reached Australia as evidenced by numerous<br />fortresses in the general area. Chinese records dating back to<br />1430 showed illustrations of &quot;Strange Countries&quot;.  There are many<br />beautiful pictures in full color. Spectacular shots of<br />Antartica are depicted, as well as numerous maps of the Old World. This book has a wide constituency of readers including<br />historians, teachers, students, political scientists and a considerable general readership. The work would be perfect<br />for a student project in World History/Culture. This rendition<br />provides a rare perspective on China in the 14th and 15th centuries. Just the pictures alone are worth the price of the volume. The author's<br />perspective is unusual. In many ways, it rewrites the history<br />of the period. There are sporadic factual patterns to support<br />the contention that the Chinese were early travellers to the<br />new world. The findings of this author will require more<br />investigation and authentication by historians. In the interim,<br />the presentation will continue to fascinate readers and<br />contradict fairly well known and established facts on the<br />history of the new world.	2004-07-10

The author explains how the general or collective<br />will intervenes when it is proper to do so. In addition, the will<br />is believed to be omnipotent. In the long run, states tend to act in ways that promote self-preservation and perpetuation.<br />Governments are divided into democracies, monarchies, royalties<br />and in other organizational frameworks consistent with accomplishing a variety of missions. The State is far removed<br />from the family. Nevertheless, it is charged with promulgating<br />laws and conventions agreeable to the general or collective will.<br />This work is an important contribution to comparative governmental organizations and structures. It explains the<br />applicable rationale for implementing political distinctions<br />of virtually every variety and type.	2004-06-27

Indium has many medicinal and industrial/petro-chemical utilizations. For instance, it is used in the manufacture of control rods. It was discovered spectroscopically in the mid 1860s by Heronymus Richter .<br />It melts at 157 C and boils at 2080 C with an atomic wt of<br />114.82. It is rarely , if ever, found in free form. Typically,<br />Indium is bound to sulfur according to In S3. It may be bound to<br />zinc (zn) blendes, tungsten, tin and iron ores. It may be utilized in conjunction with bearing alloys, semi-conductors and<br />medicinally. Specifically, Indium helps the body absorb and use<br />more of the other trace minerals . It is known that the levels<br />of copper and manganese in the kidneys are in direct proportion to the level of Indium. Generally, Indium exists in small amounts. It is insoluble and virtually non-existent in the food<br />chain.  To be of use as a nutrient, Indium must be bound to a<br />sulfate to be water-soluble. Indium is being investigated for<br />its positive role in reducing cancerous tumors. Its positive effects are also seen in pain management, inflammatory disease<br />management & diabetes.  Dietary supplementation is found in the<br />Indium-sulfate liquid drop method of ingestion. This book would be perfect for a class project in chemistry at virtually every<br />level in academe. The book has applications throughout industry,<br />academe and medicine. The subject matter of the research contained in this<br />work would require a considerable effort of time and expense to replicate. For this reason, the work has a unique value to a wide<br />constituency of people in the scientific community.	2004-06-27

The author explains how the<br />TV has created a global village of local, national and international news. In addition, the television plays classic<br />movies, shows for children and the daily soap operas. Important<br />comedy shows provide entertainment for millions of viewers.<br />The book explains that our television is a necessary part of modern society.

This is no exception. The book<br />places great value in reviewing hospital bills in detail to detect unnecessary charges and areas where generic drugs could provide cheaper alternatives over the long term. In addition,<br />the institution you choose should have a good nosomial infection<br />record . Many patients die from the disease they contract in the<br />hospital rather than the condition upon entry. Some patients<br />actually have family members that get jobs in the hospital to<br />oversee loved ones and take advantage of benefits and reduced employee costs. Board certification is another important item for<br />the treating physicians and surgeons. Perhaps there is no greater<br />benefit to the patient than having a comprehensive knowledge<br />of the condition being treated and the alternative treatment<br />modalities whether conventional or alternative medicine.<br />Wise utilization of the ambulatory care centers and outpatient<br />clinics are another important set of options for patients.<br />Conditions requiring continuous monitoring and post-followup<br />reviews are best treated in the outpatient care centers.<br />This volume is a treasure chest of medicinal information pertinent to any medical consumer. The work is a good value<br />at the price charged.	2004-06-25

The author describes the human being as an amalgum of<br />innate structure at birth coupled with the sum total of our<br />experiences. He makes a point of saying that we cannot be placed<br />into a convenient mould for ease of analysis. Resultingly,<br />human nature tends to be ignored or marginalized by the thousands<br />of personality tests used for every purpose and design imaginable. Common category traits are interests, attitudes, intelligence, relationships, moods, accomplishments, values, adjustment, health and derangement-according to the author.<br />Personality tests are crafted by designing the ideal traits in<br />perspective hirees and composing questions which elicit the<br />ideal traits from perspective candidates. In general, candidates<br />must score well on health, physical and mental states. In addition, the authors cite responsibility, emotional stability, confidence, dominance, objectivity, agreeableness, friendliness,positiveness and extraversion as important secondary<br />or supplmentary traits. If your objective is to secure a sales position, then you must value persuasiveness as a preferred<br />aspect of the job. For instance, a person who detests the give and take of persuading people might not want to be a salesperson.<br />Sentence completion portions of a personality profile seek to<br />identify extreme personalities or traits. A beauty of this work<br />is that it provides standard test questions and model answers<br />of applicants. The purchase is worth the price for a serious<br />student of human resources personality tests.	2004-06-22

President<br />Clinton has that rare dual capability to excel at both the<br />English language and the analytics inherent in higher math.<br />The former President recites the challenges of life during<br />law school and the tremendous cramming sessions inherent in<br />preparing for the many formal exams. The initial social<br />meetings with Mrs Clinton are depicted, as well as her unforgetable commencement address.<br /><br />President Clinton was always an excellent speaker and lecturer.<br />The role of teacher portrays the President at his very best.<br />The work has many memorable pictures of his parents,<br />early youth and forays into politics. Simultaneously, he decried<br />the Vietnam War yet appreciated President Johnson's many<br />social programs. The book explains many of the challenges<br />encountered during his years of public service. The Mississippi<br />River Flood Relief is explained, as well as the Bosnian conflict<br />and the contentious dealings with the Palestinians. He described<br />the effort to fund 100T new teachers and to preserve the national forestry. The issue of trade with Vietnam was addressed<br />formally, although France had established considerable economic<br />relationships earlier. China's acceptance into the World Trade<br />Organization was another item cited by President Clinton.<br /><br />The former President had a global perspective encompassing the notion of an interdependent world demanding<br />more than a modicum of attention by the Executive Branch.<br />Toward the end of the book, President Clinton described his<br />journey to the Presidency and beyond as \\"an improbable life\\".<br />By this, he meant that the laws of probability mitigated against<br />his rising to become President given his modest background.<br /><br />The work is a fairly comprehensive rendition for posterity.<br />His overall assessment will be above average.  Historians have<br />yet to sort out the details of what his involvement accomplished<br />in the complicated mesh of world history .  This book may help<br />future political scientists and academicians navigate the<br />post Cold War period with its attendant opportunities,<br />uncontrollable factors and complicated transitory sequences.<br /><br />His administration tackled the stabilization and balancing of the<br />federal budget. That alone was a considerable task which required<br />making very difficult choices between raising taxes, cutting<br />military spending or trimming social programs. None of those<br />tasks would be easy to accomplish politically and<br />President Clinton tried to balance all of them simultaneously.<br />While slowing the growth in federal spending, President Clinton<br />sought to preserve the infrastructure of social programs.<br />The programs were designed to preserve the safety net for the poor and to support business entities both small and large.<br /><br />The former President has a facilitative personality which has<br />worked well in dealing both here and abroad. This book attests<br />to his political career logically, sequentially and in a<br />representative belles lettres style of writing. Some reviewers<br />have complained about the length . The length is appropriate<br />because President Clinton is reciting a story about a lifetime<br />of experiences. Posterity will want to know many details and it<br />is better for President Clinton to present his personal accounts<br />in place of others doing it without having first-hand knowledge.<br /><br />The book is a solid investment for a wide constituency of political scientists, historians and academicians. The existence<br />of thiswork will facilitate the task of future historians<br />because a considerable superstructure of a life story will exist.<br />Historians could never recreate a document with the perspective<br />contained herein because the experiential aspects wouldn't be present.

The author discusses theoretic universals<br />in some level of detail. For instance, he roughly equates<br />consistency with truth. In mathematics, a proof is not complete<br />without enough consistent examples of an application and no<br />deviations from the theorem. The author discusses the distinction<br />between knowledge and opinion. He states succinctly that ignorance can be preferable to academic errors. In addition, he points out that opinions are accepted voluntarily. Emotions are<br />likened to instinct in that they are not learned.  Freud discussed things to avoid; namely, bad love, pride and too much<br />reliance on monetary things to the exclusion of aesthetics.<br />The good thing is desirable over the bad. Goods are classified<br />into wealth, goods of the body, goods of the soul or spiritual<br />domain, knowledge, truth and wisdom which is the highest<br />form of knowing. Children spend much time learning skills;<br />while adults and elders develop and impart wisdom. Learning is<br />discovery and discussion. We learn things in the natural sciences<br />by observing them in a lab. For instance, a drop of blood may<br />be examined under the microscope for specific characteristics.<br />A frog may be dissected and examined under the microscope to<br />learn more about the vital organs-their placement and functioning.<br /> This book is a wonderful acquisition for a continued discussion of philosophical, theoretical and scientific techniques and processes.

He gives<br />great credit to animals for the intuitive reasoning that they<br />possess in the conduct of daily life. According to Osho, intelligence is not per se subject to precise measurement.<br />In addition, there are conditions which impede intellectual<br />rationalizations and applications. For instance, great stress<br />can inhibit our ability to function meaningfully on the creative or intuitive level. The author gives credence to the notion that relaxation methodologies; such as, formal meditation<br />provide the requisite environment for the creative side of our<br />intelligence to flourish and grow. The book provides a fresh<br />perspective on what constitutes intelligence and creativity.<br />It would be appealing to a wide constituency of readers in<br />business, academe and the general readership.<br />It is a good value for the price charged.	2004-06-19

At first, silly puddy was deemed an impractical<br />idea with very little commercial application outside the<br />laboratory. It turned out to be a multi-million dollar idea.<br />Baking soda was not seen as a practical idea initially, although<br />most homes have it today. The concept of drinking urine to<br />heal arthritis was deemed to be bizarre; however, there is<br />some scientific validity to the concept according to the author.<br />Arthritis may be relieved by keeping raisins in gin for 9 days.<br />GLA, primrose oil and chicken cartilage are all helpful<br />complementary strategies to controlling arthritis. Vaseline<br />oil was not seen as a great idea initially. Its inventor,<br />Robert Chesebrough created an enduring legacy with the product.<br />Chlorinated drinking water saved millions from bacterial diseases.

A good mentor will have achieved<br />a modicum of success. He or she should be legitimate and it<br />doesn't hurt to dream big. The mind must be re-programmed to<br />aspire to greater things. Successful mentoring requires a<br />disciplined commitment and a carefully crafted strategy.<br />The potential candidate for a mentor should draw up the<br />strengths and weaknesses of the potential mentor. Many successful enterprises require partnering to complement individual efforts. A person who sets extraordinary goals should<br />be prepared to expend a great amount of time pursuing them.<br />Preparation is the key to achievement-particularly for difficult<br />or elusive goals. This work is a good prep guide for a small<br />business-person building an enterprise from scratch for the<br />first time. It directs the reader to important characteristics<br />of partners and mentors. These characteristics are the conditions<br />precedent to success for goals which are harder to achieve.<br />This book would make a good addition to the personal planning<br />library.	2004-06-17

Participants have the opportunity of an unlimited<br />discovery of new knowledge and processes. The teaching itself<br />demands a considerable level of curiosity and continuous<br />questioning of assumptions. As humans, we should never cease<br />to learn. The arena of a teacher is very much like a theatre<br />atmosphere. Great teachers demonstrate, as well as lecture.<br />The process of teaching tends to kindle minds and suggest rather<br />than indoctrinate. If you are interested in teaching as a career, this work could be very helpful in directing you to<br />optimum strategies in the career workplace of a teacher.	2004-06-17

The authors<br />advise us to keep our voices low in public places. They also<br />explain the importance of smiling and greeting people. Occasionally, it may be necessary to notify neighbors of partying-particularly extensive engagements where there are many<br />people involved. Politeness and giving up a bus/train seat<br />may be in order. There are occasions where a toast is in order<br />just prior to the commencement of a meal. In a restaurant, it is proper to raise your hand to signal a waiter rather than making loud and disruptive noises. In addition, proprietors must realize<br />that customers have rights.

The metaphysical world is a transient experience<br />which explains the conditioning of man- according to Schopenhauer. Truth must have substance. Everything is physical. There is a continuous transition from simple to gradations of simple to the outer limits of being and rationality. Free will must be self-dependent, if it is to have meaning at all. \\" It cannot depend upon another in its being and nature any more than in its conduct and action.\\"  Underlying free will is our ability to engage in independent actions with consequences and accountability for the choices we make. People are most influenced by appealing to the ego. The sexual impulse is likened to the inner life of a tree. \\" But the fear of death<br />is a priori only the reverse side of the will to live.\\"<br />Life and death are intertwined experiences which integrate into<br />the whole of existence i.e. beginning, living, death (end leading<br />into the spiritual dimension)<br />The will is what Emmanuel Kant calls \\"the thing in itself.\\"<br />Senses are channels for sensation and perception. The sense<br />is a relation of the earth (terra), fluid is associated with<br />water, taste with vapours,  air with elasticity and light with<br />sight. Sight is the highest rank because it is the widest with<br />the greatest periphery.<br />These philosophical works of Schopenhauer and others could occupy<br />multiple doctoral theses. The book is a solid value for a wide<br />constituency of academicians.	2004-06-05

The concept of a free will<br />brings with it misery and suffering as practical consequences.<br />Hope tends to be free of the egoistic side of man. Goethe<br />debated frequently with Schopenhauer. The fact that all colors<br />are an amalgum of light and dark lay at the foundation of<br />Goethe's discussions. Schopenhauer believed that the will<br />permeated everything. In fact, when the will replaces knowledge-<br />the result is obstinacy and ignorance. As an illustration,<br />the author showed that a true impression of someone could be<br />gleaned in letter-writing. This work is good, if you are a<br />student of Schopenhauer ; and, you find the need to integrate<br />his works into a unified whole for interpretive purposes.	2004-06-05

It describes the unique characteristics of insects in a factual context.<br />For instance, an insect has a compound eye, antenna, 2-3 simple eyes and a 3-part thorax. There are approximately 11 abdominal segments and a characteristic respiratory system. Worldwide, there are approximately 700,000 species of insects. In North America alone, there are 90,000 species. Insects live everywhere on earth. Plant life needs insects. Man needs insects for honey,<br />silk and shellac. Hairy-winged beetles are among the smallest insects. An insect can pull up to twenty times its weight.<br />A locust can fly up to 9 hours continuously. African beetles are<br />the largest insects in the world. Insects have multiple<br />types of antennae. i.e. Plumose, lamellate, setaceous, clavate,<br />pectinate, filliform and aristate.  An insect can fly up to<br />15 MPH. The wings of a mosquito can vibrate up to 1000 times<br />per second.

Hubbard defines the human being within a three-part<br />triangle. It consists of the mind, body and the spiritual dimension. The reactive mind has the well-known stimulus/response<br />mechanisms which underlie many behavioral theories. The theory<br />of the Universe points toward a higher purpose or being.<br />Our attempts at education can be stymied by the inability to<br />explain many different types of phenomena. Rationality has many different kinds of dimensions; namely, self-dynamics, sex,<br />group relations,existence and other life forms  i.e. animal and<br />plant life. The famous 4 elements are referenced by Hubbard.<br />These are freedom, barriers, purpose and the ultimate choice.<br />The theory of the universe admits to infinite time and space<br />together with a spiritual dimension and infinite being or state<br />of existence. The author aspires to an implementation of<br />Scientology without great conflicts/struggles coupled with the<br />freedom to aspire to greater heights. The methods strive toward<br />an evolutionary march toward congruent goals rather than a chaotic revolutionary approach. Human rights, free speech and<br />a saner earth are the mainstay of Hubbard's philosophy in its<br />implementation. This work could serve a useful purpose as<br />an adjunct to existing philosophical thought. The ideas contained herein certainly merit debate in the academic<br />arena of ideas.	2004-06-04

Evidence is<br />relevant if a reasonable fact-finder could feel that it renders<br />some fact more probable or less probable in any degree than it<br />appeared before the introduction of the evidence. Relevancy does not require that the fact be made to appear highly probable.<br />We are not testing sufficiency of the total proof of a case.<br />Instead, the basic rule seeks to establish an entry  threshold<br />upon which a building block may be constructed. In some cases,<br />the judge and jury may have to resort to matters not in the record to determine whether or not a piece of evidence renders<br />a proposition more probable than before. As a basic principle,<br />relevancy subsumes materiality. The remainder of the book explains presumptions under the law, heresay, impeachment of<br />witnesses, exemptions and a whole host of complicating factors<br />relevant in a trial setting.<br />The book is written for a legal constituency. It assumes some<br />legal background or knowledge of basic definitions. The constituency of this book consists of legal scholars, lawyers,<br />law students and a wide constituency in business and academe.<br />It is well worth the price for serious students of the law.	2004-06-01

The six main categories are described initially and explained in the ensuing text. These categories consist of:<br />1. Express contracts consisting of the standard offer-acceptance<br />  and consideration trilogy<br />2. Implied in fact contracts distinguished by conduct rather than<br />  by express words<br />3. Promissory estoppel referred to as detrimental reliance<br />4. Subsequent promises to perform pre-existing obligations<br />5. A minority theory of imposing liability based upon a subsequent promise to pay for material benefits previously conferred.<br />6. Implied in law quasi-contracts which are non-consensual obligations<br />The theory of an offer arouses an expectation in the mind of a<br />reasonable person. Such an expectation may create a power of<br />acceptance in the offeree. An offer must be sufficiently certain<br />to make any resulting agreement enforceable and damages calculable. The offer must be certain as to the parties, subject matter, price and time of performance. An offer in which the<br />offeror or offering party promises to do or not to do something in exchange for a promise by the offeree to act is an offer for<br />a bilateral or two-sided contract. Further details as to<br />bargained exchanges, the statute of frauds and a whole host<br />of complicating factors are set forth simply with a generous<br />sprinkling of stare decisis cases to illustrate the legal<br />points explained. The text will be helpful for law students,journalists, constitutional scholars and a whole host of<br />other constituencies in academe.<br />This text is a good supplement to the standard legal texts on contract law. It is well worth the price charged.	2004-06-01

For instance,<br />a litigant must have standing in order to have a case considered by the United States Supreme Court. The concept of standing requires that the party have a stake in the outcome. The Constitutional legal apparati consists of the following:<br />o It establishes a national government.<br />o It controls the relationship between the states and the federal<br />  government<br />o It defines personal liberties<br />o It contains provisos for the perpetual operation of the<br />  government. i.e. the operation of law of the Magna Carta since<br />  1215.<br />The basic pattern of the distinction between liberty and governmental power/prerogative is present in virtually all constitutional cases. The Courts are asked to set or interpret<br />the dividing line between liberty and the governmental powers of the states and the federal government. For a Court to overrule a previous decision/precedent-it must be confident that the<br />decision-making criteria in the past stare decisis is in error<br />or in need of substantial revision.<br />According to Justice Jackson, &quot; The very purpose of the Bill of Rights was to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the Courts.&quot;<br />Overall, the work has a generous coverage of individual liberties and protections, the National Powers, State Powers, the Constitution, the process of Judicial Review, Intergovernmental immunities, the relationships between and amongst the states, inter-governmental and foreign relations.<br />The Constitution of the United States is published in the<br />appendix.

The work is a worthy<br />purchase for a wide constituency of users in government, law<br />and academe.<br /><br />The author explains many details on the fundamental<br />rationale of torts which admits to the fact<br />that someone has been harmed. The common law<br />developed a tort from a group of wrongs including<br />trespass, deceit, slander, assault and battery<br />convergence and a number of other offenses.<br /><br />The mainstay claim amplified by the author<br />is that someone has sustained a loss because<br />of another's act or failure to act. Therefore,<br />a common element of tort liability is fault.<br />The tort conduct must fall below an accepted<br />community threshold or standard of behavior/<br />performance.<br /><br />Tort law has three main functions explained<br />in the book. It seeks compensation to the<br />person(s) incurring a loss as a result of<br />another's conduct. It places the cost of<br />compensation on those who should bear<br />responsibility. The ultimate goal is to<br />prevent a future recurrence/harm. In its simplest<br />form, cause in fact is established by evidence<br />which tends to show that the defendant's act<br />or omission was a necessary antecedent to the<br />plaintiff's injury. Generally, a jury need<br />only draw a reasonable inference of causation<br />so that its determination is final.	2004-06-01

Dr. Kellman MD tries to deal with overall health maintenance<br />and well-being in this work. There are many theories about<br />colorectal and gastro-intestinal health. In fact, there is a<br />book out entitled \\"Death Begins in the Colon\\".  Dr. Kellman MD<br />outlines some basic strategies for health maintenance.<br />The control of stress is a cornerstone of his 4-step process<br />to overall health. Concurrent with this goal are the diagnostic<br />dimensions of acute illness, the bio-ecological diet and the<br />proper supplements i.e. Vitamin C, Selenium, Vitamin B 12 etc.<br />The bio-ecological diet deals with eating a balanced menu,<br />eliminating sugar and gluten, identifying lactose intolerance<br />and eliminating chemical preservatives from the daily diet<br />regimen.<br /><br />The most obvious place to treat overall health is in the gut.<br />Consuming a high quality acidophilus can introduce good bacteria<br />into the gut in order to balance the bad bacteria. In addition,<br />elimination of oral contraceptives, elimination of toxins,<br />elimination of sugary foods, refined food elimination and gut<br />stress control are hallmarks on the way to good health.<br />The authors  make a gut/arthritis linkage which involves \\"leaky gut\\" syndrome, gut toxins and gluten intolerance as general<br />irritants and detractors to optimal gut functioning. The book<br />documents a heart/gut link, a brain/gut link, an allergy-gut<br />link, a hormone-gut link and a general cooperative functioning<br />of the various bodily systems .<br /><br />He describes a plethora of diagnostic tests which deal with<br />identification of critical disease processes. For instance, the<br />colonoscopy identifies dysbiosis, diverticulitis and other<br />problems in the colorectal area.  A gastroscopy, digestive<br />stool analysis, the adrenal saliva test and stool test are<br />employed for gastritis. A gut permeability test may be employed<br />for leaky gut syndrome. Control of parasitic infections helps<br />to deal with abdominal pain, diarrhea, fowl-smelling stools,<br />chills, fever , fatigue and chronic joint pain. A highly<br />sensitive TRH Stimulation test may be employed for thyroid function. The Great Smokies (CDSA) stool analysis is the gold<br />standard for:<br />o triglycerides and long-chain fatty acids<br />o markers of digestive enzymes<br />o short-chain fatty acids<br />o vegetable and meat fibers<br />o microorganisms and low levels of friendly bacteria<br />i.e. lactobacilli and bifidobacteria<br />The author provides some important tips on purchasing quality<br />produce at the grocery store.  i.e.<br />o buy in season<br />o wrap fresh greens in brown paper towels<br />o don't peel fruits and veggies<br />o eat a variety of colorful produce<br />o lightly steam raw fruits/veggies<br /><br />Avoid simple carbs, eat more nuts, seeds and antibiotic-free meat, fish and poultry. The author has an entire section on<br />model foods to eat; such as , banana, kiwi, strawberries, baked tofu, almonds, raisins, natural flank steak, cod, Greek salad,<br />spinach and dried apricots. When you are in pain, the author<br />indicates that fresh vegetable juices and juice bars provide<br />highly digestible nutrients which promote healing. Herbs; such as, Chamomile provide a chemical called apigenin which is an<br />anti-inflammatory flavonoid with anti-spasmodic characteristics.<br />Curcumin and tumeric have strong anti-inflammatory power<br />utilized in the treatment of arthritis and liver ailments.<br /><br />Echinacea is utilized for colds. It is not a cure. In fact,<br />scientists still debate whether or not there is any cure for a<br />cold. The herbal teas provide some relief from the gross<br />symptomatology and discomfort of a cold. They do not per se<br />cure colds. Many diseases in modern medicine have no known cure.<br />The standard treatments are aimed at alleviating symptoms and<br />making the patient more comfortable. In some cases, the treatments may help to stem the progression of a chronic disease.<br />Some chronic diseases have a spontaneous remission due to unknown factors or factors which cannot be isolated easily.<br /><br />The authors provide sample supplements to be taken to control<br />a plethora of ailments including dysbiosis, the gut, heartburn,<br />Crohns disease etc.  Dysbiosis may be controlled with Vit. A,<br />L-glutamine, proent, garlinase, olive leaf extract, digestase,<br />candibactin Br , Candiobacter AR,  Bifidonate and Ultra Flora<br />Plus.

He explains why it is crucial to identify life's goals and the pursuit of them.<br />His chapter on the authentic self explains the importance<br />of understanding motivations and reactions to external<br />events-including the perceived expectations of others.<br />He quotes Emerson:<br />\\"What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.\\"<br />This statement attests to the importance of knowing the inner<br />self and having the all-important internal dialogue frequently.<br />A chapter on \\"defining moments\\" forces us to examine the bottom<br />line effects of these events on our own concept of \\"the self\\".<br />A part of the book reviews alternatives in terms of choices<br />presented, choices made, alternatives given up, the concept<br />of self before and after making the choice, the long term<br />residual effect of the choice, the distortion of the choice<br />(if any) on your self image and your reaction to the critical<br />choice.<br />The book forces us to take an internal inventory<br />of many critical factors including appearance, work,<br />outlook, competence, skills, abilities and worth. The five-step<br />action plan provides a superstructure so that we can assess our abilities, evaluate<br />learning history/experience, examine external factors,<br />internal dialogue and the resolution of the authentic self.<br />Finally, the author deals with putting a plan of action to work<br />and dealing with routine problem areas/challenges in executing<br />the plan. Too often, we tend to<br />avoid taking decisive action because of \\"analysis paralysis\\".<br />i.e. We spend so much time analyzing a choice that the opportunity to act constructively is gone before a definitive<br />decision to act has been reached. Resultingly, many good opportunities are lost due to inaction or untimely action.<br />Analysis paralysis is a natural instinct arising from fear of the unknown or risk-taking. There can be no meaningful progress<br />in a forward direction without taking calculated risks.<br />Most people do not have the level of organization and enforced<br />discipline outlined by the author.

Put another way, one must be interested in the<br />subject matter in order to have the requisite incentive to recall<br />it. At some point, you must make up your mind to have the<br />requisite interest in order to remember numbers, people , dates<br />and a host of other trivia too numerous to list here.<br />A popular PEG system of memory is employed in the work .  The<br />system was first introduced by Stanislaus Mink von Wennsshein<br />circa 1648. In the year 1730, the entire system was modified<br />by Dr.Richard Grey, of England, who called the idea, letter or<br />number equivalents. In order to learn the method, participants<br />must first learn a simple phonetic alphabet representing keys<br />or memory aids. In essence, the mind becomes trained to translate<br />alphabetic representations into easy-to-recall numbers and<br />vice versa. The author even provides simple ways to remember<br />foreign language vocabulary and sentence structures. Similarly,<br />faces can be remembered by associating particular characteristics<br />with the person whose name you wish to recall. For instance,<br />assume that Mr. Style dresses well all the time. Remembering<br />this name would be easy. Every time you see the same person<br />dressed stylishly- associate the style of dress with the name<br />Style.

For instance, the author describes fat stores as<br />a general equivalency with energy in less energy out. This has<br />implications for &quot;fueling the body&quot; and expending energy through<br />rigorous exercise. He names fatty foods, sedentary life style,<br />food triggers, decreased thyroid hormonal function and decreased<br />metabolism as important factors in identifying the reasons for<br />weight gain. We need some fat in the foods  i.e. Omega 3 fish<br />oils.  The bad fats are deep fries and foods laden with high<br />cholesterol. Desk workers tend to be too sedentary and; therefore, a program of enforced calistenics in a gym is an<br />absolute necessity. Some employers recognize this problem and<br />they provide facilities for workers to &quot;unwind&quot;. Food triggers<br />can be lethal. Examples of triggers are food as a compensation<br />for stress,  &quot;so called holiday eating&quot; and a plethora of<br />other situations which cause us to eat for no apparent reason.<br />Thyroid hormonal function can be tested with a number of<br />very sensitive diagnostics.  There are a number of dietary<br />strategies aimed at maximizing the thyroid function. Metabolism<br />is another area where exercise can help general functioning.<br />The author discusses an energy expenditure formula:<br />Energy expenditure=rest metabolic rate + thermodynamic effect<br />  of food + physical activity<br />Energy expenditure is a thermodynamic concept closest associated<br />with the exothermic release of energy . The rest metabolic rate<br />refers to the normal metabolism when a body is at rest.<br />Food thermodynamics refers to the energy in-take and breakdown<br />of food into usable energy.  Physical activity activates the<br />metabolism of the body and literally burns fuel.

This work has a representative sampling of the major rheumatologic disturbances-their etiology, treatment, post-followup, nutritional implications and implications for<br />conventional medicinal preparations and alternative medicine.<br />For instance, the rendition on low back pain is excellent.<br />\\"During any month, 32-37% of the population will suffer from low<br />back pain for a period longer than 24 hours.\\" The cause of<br />low back pain has many factors; namely, smoking, body vibration,<br />job stress, sedentary jobs, static posture and strenuous movements. Low back pain is the most common cause of disability<br />in workers under 45 years of age. Higher levels of exercise and<br />targeted physical therapy protect against low back pain.<br />Three major types of forces in the lumbar spine can cause<br />nerve injury leading to pain; namely, stretch, compression and<br />vibration. \\"Increased tension increases intrafascicular pressure and decreases cross-sectional area in the nerve. This interferes<br />with blood flow, causing venule stasis at 8% stretch and total ischemia at 15% stretch.\\"  A decrease in cross-sectional area<br />makes sense in engineering because the increased length and<br />decreasing elasticity will cause the nerve to be significantly<br />distorted . As a result of the distortion, the cross-sectional<br />area will represent an exaggerated multi-dimensional geometry<br />having a smaller cross-sectional area. The discussion on<br />spinal stenosis explains the rationale for compression of nerve<br />roots. There is an excellent workup for low back pain.<br />Lumbago has a dull and low back pain component. The herniated<br />disk has an electric-knife-like stabbing pain. Spinal stenosis<br />has aching and burning in the thighs. Metastases has serious<br />and unrelenting pain. Ankylosing Spondylitis has insidious<br />onset of pain, uveitis and sometimes aortic insufficiency.<br />The epidural abscess has sharp and severe bilateral buttock<br />and leg pain. There is an excellent section on nutrition and<br />rheumatic diseases. The late Paleolithic diet consists of<br />34% protein and 21% fats; whereas, the American diet consists of<br />12% protein and 42% fats or twice the Paleolithic dietary<br />content of fats. A number of vitamins benefit patients<br />with rheumatologic diseases; namely, beta-carotene, Vit E,<br />Vit C, Vit D, Zinc, Selenium, Cu and Fe to compensate for<br />iron deficiency anemia. Linoleic acids, Omega 3 and Omega 6<br />fatty acids have been found to be essential in the diet.<br />For the arthritic diseases, \\"Vegetarian diets, when supplemented with sufficient proteins, vitamins and minerals , can result in a<br />modest improvement in pain and stiffness.\\"<br />There is an excellent section on acupuncture. The authors state:<br />\\"Because the most obvious application of acupuncture to patients<br />with arthritis or fibromyalgia is to relieve pain, there has been significant research over the past 20 years on the mechanisms in Western terms that might explain the relief of<br />pain by acupuncture needles. With the discovery of natural<br />human opiates, many different studies have shown that reduction<br />in pain may result from release of endogenous endorphins by<br />acupuncture needling.\\"  In addition, magnetic therapy and<br />massage therapies have provided relief. The concept that<br />electrical or magnetic fields modify the perception of pain<br />fits the gate theory of pain perception. In addition, the introduction of a magnetic field produces a constant molecular disturbance<br />which may inhibit fusion and; thereby, provide relief. Patients<br />utilizing magnets must make certain that they are utilizing the<br />proper NORTHERN polarity and gaussian thresholds to ensure<br />maximum benefit.<br /> The author has an<br />excellent section which describes the benefits of exercise<br />for rheumatologic patients. Three types of exercises benefit the<br />patient; namely range of motion, strengthening/resistive and<br />aerobic/endurance exercises.In the rehabilitative section,<br />multi-dimensional gait postures are described. For instance,<br />there is normal gait, four-point gait, three-point gait and<br />swing to gait or alternatively swing through gait.<br />The authors have a good section on statistical sampling to<br />include Type I and II errors, sample size, bias and confounding,<br />randomization, blinding (unawareness of treatment), outcomes,<br />study coordinators, subject recruitment, data analyses,<br />new drug evaluative processes, biologic treatments, clinical<br />trials and ethic considerations. There is an exhaustive section<br />on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. These drugs consist of<br />inhibition of arachidonic acid metabolites and Cox 1/Cox 2<br />inhibitors.

In essence,<br />the concept of time is meaningless except in relation to<br />light . Without light, there would be no reference point<br />for measuring distance in space because the whole area would<br />be dark and unidentifiable for scientific measurement and<br />comparison purposes. The use of the volumetric triple integral<br />seeks to make a measurement on 3-planes.  i.e. x,y and z<br />Later in the work, Einstein explains that the laws of<br />configuration of rigid bodies with respect to K' do not agree<br />with the laws of configuration of rigid bodies that are<br />in accordance with Euclidean geometry. He provides an example<br />wherein two similar clocks rotate simultaneously on the<br />periphery and the center of a circle, then judged from K- the<br />clock on the periphery will go slower than the clock at the<br />center. He explains this difference as the result of the<br />gravitational field influence as determinants in the metric<br />laws of the space and time continuum. What happens when the<br />clocks are in a perfect vacuum? In addition, time travel is<br />a function of how light travels. Finite differences in the<br />radii of the clocks (periphery and center) imply distances with<br />slight changes in respect to the time light takes to travel<br />from one end of the radii (periphery or center) to the other.<br />In the Riemann Tensor, Einstein depicts an amorphous masse<br />dependent upon the path of displacement. The outline of the<br />masse approximates a square so that the area or volume is<br />determinate by approximation to the closest geometric form<br />to the amorphous masse  i.e.  a square<br /><br />On page 92, Einstein states that the rate of a clock is slower<br />the greater is the masse of the ponderable matter in the<br />neighborhood. This comports with the theory and computation<br />of inertia. As the base and height increases, the inertial<br />computation is geometrically greater in accordance with the<br />formulas of inertia [ ((b x h^3)/12)  ]. In the discussion of<br />Mach, Einstein states that the inertia of a body must increase<br />when ponderable masses are piled in the neighborhood. This is<br />proven by computing inertia utilizing more massive bases and<br />heights. As the base and height increases, the inertial<br />computation is geometrically greater thereby proving that the<br />inertia of a body must increase when ponderable masses are<br />piled up in the neighborhood.<br /><br />Einstein discusses the theory of Mach in relation to inertia<br />and the mutual action of bodies. The actual measurement of<br />Mach has at least 3 different levels; namely, subsonic,<br />sonic and supersonic measurements<br /><br />Einstein argues that the hypothesis that the universe is<br />infinite and Euclidean at infinity is complicated from the<br />relativistic point of view. The universe expands and contracts .<br />Accordingly, the nature tends to approximate non-Euclidean<br />or quasi-Euclidean objects in the evolution toward the<br />expansive and infinite state which Einstein postulates as<br />potentially Euclidean in order.<br /><br />Einstein argues against an infinite space by stating:<br /><br />\\" 1. From the standpoint of the theory of relativity , to postulate a closed universe is very much simpler than to postulate the corresponding boundary condition at infinity<br />of the quasi-Euclidian structure of the universe.<br /><br /> 2. The idea that Mach expressed, that inertia depends upon the mutual action of bodies, is contained, to a first approximation,<br />in the equations of the theory of relativity; it follows from these equations that inertia depends, at least in part upon<br />mutual actions between masses.<br /><br />3. An infinite universe is possible only if the mean density<br />of matter in the universe vanishes. Although such an assumption is logically possible, it is less probable than the assumption that there is a finite mean density of matter in the universe.\\"<br /><br />Critique:<br /><br />The idea of a closed universe is simpler. It comports with experience. For instance, why does Haley's Comet return every<br />75 years. The idea of an infinite universe would imply the existence of a less dense outer-superstructure.

Otherwise, every speeding object<br />would continue into an infinite universe with a denseless<br />path of space.<br /><br />To prove the third postulate, scientists must have better information on the mean density at the outer edges of the universe.

The HMO co-pay can be burdensome for patients. In addition, there is a slow migration<br />toward the universal health care coverage in order to correct<br />some of these inefficiencies and distribute the resource to<br />persons uncovered or undercovered by the present protocols<br />and medical delivery systems.	2004-02-26

Early admissions is cited as an important<br />advantage for students who meet the college profile. The authors<br />believe that the elite private colleges have early admissions<br />policies. Average SAT scores and high school grade point averages<br />are cited as important indicators. Some believe that students<br />with advantaged backgrounds have priority on gaining admittance.<br />In my own experience, it is important to visit the institution<br />early and talk to students about their experiences in gaining<br />admission. Student experiences with the coursework and available<br />financial aid are important indicators which will complement whatever has been disclosed previously about the college.	2004-02-26

For instance,<br />John Maynard Keynes wrote:<br />&quot;Hume's skeptical criticisms are usually associated with<br />causality; but arguments by induction-inference from past<br />particulars to future generalizations-was the first real<br />object of his attack. Hume showed, not that inductive methods<br />were false, but that their validity had never been established<br />and that all possible lines of proof seemed equally unpromising.&quot;<br />Keynes wrote further that:<br />&quot;Hume has pointed with infallible finger to those passages which,<br />in the eyes of posterity as well as those of the author 'shake off the yoke of authority, accustom men to think for themselves,<br />give new hints which men of genius may carry further and, by the very opposition, illustrate points wherein no one before<br />suspected any difficulty.&quot;<br />The work is an important contribution to economic and political<br />theory, propositional logic and the historical development<br />of formal logic systems and arguments thereof.	2004-02-23

It depicts the<br />struggles of coal miners in a classic pitting of the interests<br />of owners as against the workers. The author puts the<br />controversy well when he asserts that \\"the worker is the<br />victim of the facts of existence-capital, competition,<br />industrial crises ...<br />In the late 1860s, Zola set out to document societal conditions<br />in a number of important contexts including the principal<br />professions, trades, classes, political, religious, artistic<br />and so on. The idea was to craft a scientific or rationally<br />documented picture of every level of society during the<br />French Second Empire which ultimately lead the writer to<br />develop the character of Etienne Lantier. Zola's object was<br />to study the coal miners and extrapolate inferences for the<br />working class conditions in general. In the process, the author<br />attempted to draw fine distinctions in the historical<br />clashes between capital and labour. Zola commences with the<br />first days of work in the life of Etienne including a<br />description of the mining pits, the plight of workers, living<br />conditions and a wide circle of circumstances which beset<br />everyday miners in the conduct of their work. Zola is not<br />happy with merely demonstrating the dynamics of a socialist<br />theory of trade unions. He attempts to draw a universal theory<br />about human nature, the dynamics of self-interest, survivalist<br />motives and self-preservation which concern social scientists<br />up through Maslowe. Zola attempts to be fair. He criticizes<br />both rich and poor for laziness, bad faith and uncontrolled<br />vices. The book ends almost as it begins with a description<br />of Etienne travelling through a coal-mining territory in the<br />hustle and bustle of the early morning.<br />The book would be important reading for literary critics,<br />historians, economists, political theorists and a wide<br />constituency of readers in formal academia. It is<br />geared for students in late high school or early collegiate<br />studies in world literature or foreign language studies.r />historians, economists, political theorists and a wide<br />constituency of readers in formal academia.

And he strengthened himself, as Socrates had<br />strengthened himself, with the conviction that no harm can come<br />to a good man after death, and that the gods do not neglect him<br />or his affairs. In Utopia and on the scaffold we have those two great articles of More's creed.&quot;<br />This is an important literary paragraph which encapsules<br />More's positive view that  destiny will be sealed with<br />a Divine intervention on his behalf.<br />More was a scholar of great standing in the community.<br />&quot;More had to answer extempore to the eloquent and loyal orations of the universities, and he missed no chance of attending and<br />joining in the official readings and disputations. His services<br />to Oxford varied from those of Sanitary Inspector in time of<br />plaque, to the defence of Erasmus and Greek against preachers<br />who attacked both.&quot;<br />The contents of this rendition of More has been debated<br />for centuries. It is still fascinating to literary and<br />theological scholars. I'm certain that the work will be<br />debated far into the future.

The &quot;nothing down sale&quot;<br />may involve a motivated seller willing to provide financing or<br />a distressed estate sale where cash is needed on an immediate<br />basis. Generally, the perspective buyer will purchase a property<br />well below market value and get financing at approximately<br />80% of the market value. In some cases, a buyer can take cash<br />home after the closing.<br /> Allen identifies the profile<br />of a seller who will unload a property for literally nothing<br />down or very little down. Some buyers buy low and sell higher.<br />Others manipulate balloon payments up front or at the end<br />of the mortgage while adjusting the monthly mortgage prices<br />accordingly. Occasionally, a seller will take a higher price for the sale of a house in return for easier monthly payments.<br />A beauty of this work is that the author provides specific<br />schedules which explain the relevant cash flows associated with<br />different decisions on the same property. Sometimes,<br />government financing is substantial with regard to the purchase.<br />For instance, specific constituencies of the elderly,<br />disabled, municipal workers, minority businesspeople and others<br />may be entitled to substantial housing grants or reduced loans<br />from a plethora of government programs at the federal, state or<br />local level.

A rule-based<br />system has at least 2 parts:<br />- a condition/premise representing a computer recognition pattern<br />- a consequence that specifies an action to be taken by the computer  i.e. a neurometric analysis of the brain<br />[ earth color is normal;  red is abnormal and blue is an absence<br />of tissue]<br />Access to knowledge within the knowledge base is handled by the<br />inference engine. An antecedent rule is applied when its premise becomes a rule. This is known as forward chaining.<br />This work explains how to integrate complex chaining techniques<br />into the overall programming of the expert system.	2004-01-25
811929:US	51243012	R1Q7BTKWRVPBXP	020106443X	174964629	The Cognitive Computer: On Language, Learning, and Artificial Intelligence	Books	5	9	10	N	N	The Cognitive Computer by Schank and Childers	The authors explain how artificial intelligence involves seeing<br />something familiar in a new light. The challenge is to emulate<br />scripts built up over time and experience. There are significant<br />problems with programs which do not change as the result of<br />new knowledge. In addition, there are problems in computer<br />learning from failure. In practice, it is impossible to<br />articulate every possible error condition. Even if the knowledge<br />engineer could articulate every possible error, the next problem<br />is programming the computer system to do a multiplicity of<br />validations. Too many validations built into a system, can cause<br />the throughput to degrade substantially . When throughput<br />suffers, the overall efficiency of the system collapses.<br />This work is an important advance in artificial intelligence and<br />expert systems.	2004-01-25

The Sowa work is important for anyone who designs a knowledge based system with a fairly complex rule structure. The mechanics of programming design of a knowledge system involve metalevel programming. The systems designer writes rules and rules on how to use the<br />rules. A rule has a head, a body (goal). A goal is either a<br />single or conjunction. A single goal always succeeds. A<br />conjunctive goal succeeds if both parts succeed. A single goal<br />succeeds if there is a rule whose head matches the goal and whose<br />body succeeds.<br />The programming mechanics of artificial intelligence must be<br />presented in an easy-to-follow format; otherwise the technical<br />programming theory and implementation will be more difficult<br />for a novice to grasp. This work is perfect as a supplemental<br />text in an introductory or intermediate-level course in<br />artificial intelligence in a computer science or engineering<br />program. A strength of the work is that the author provides a good explanation of the basic theory of AI programming<br />with accompanying examples depicting implementation.<br />The work is a solid value for the price charged. This presentation would be very helpful in a formal research project<br />of Artificial Intelligence.	2004-01-25

The authors discuss how to connect artificial intelligence<br />modules to an expert system. The various techniques involve:<br />- loosely coupling AI to the database DBMS<br />The reader (Joseph S. Maresca) believes that a loose coupling<br />of AI to the DBMS permits easier customizations if further<br />changes are planned &quot;down the road&quot;.<br />- extend DBMS with AI functionality<br />The reader believes that this method has value. It will be<br />easier to change the artificial intelligence algorithm simply<br />by changing the AI function with minimal impact to the DBMS.<br />- extend AI systems so that they have DBMS functionality<br />-tightly integrate DBMS and AI capability<br />The reader believes that this method has a disadvantage in<br />instances where it becomes necessary to seek further<br />customizations of the DBMS. In addition, it is harder to test<br />this model because any customizations to the AI adversely<br />impacts the whole system including the DBMS.<br />A frame is defined as a data structure to describe attributes,<br />constraints and the type of an object or class.

For instance, computing power<br />has grown exponentially. There is a computer on every work<br />desk in most corporate offices. Children work with computers<br />at school. A growing number of people work at home. Electronics<br />has permeated virtually every part of society from home<br />calculators/computers to electronic panels in automobiles to super-stereo systems and advanced training systems in industry<br />and academe.

The author describes the<br />theory of forward chaining which involves matching rules against<br />a factbase to find successful matches, conflict resolution of<br />the data and action after concluding a specific alternative<br />from the various rule structures.<br />The author describes the expert system life cycle consisting of:<br />o feasibility analysis of the domain and task studied<br />o conceptual design of how the expert system carries out tasks<br />o knowledge acquisition gets the knowledge from human experts<br />  and case sources<br />o validation<br />o technical transfer and maintenance<br />o choice of a manageable task or domain of possibilities<br />Knowledge is stored in frames with slot names and values.<br />In backward chaining, the system has a goal to prove and it<br />works backwards to prove it gaining the evidence with each<br />iteration. By focusing on conclusions, the system will identify<br />what caused the pattern of symptoms. The system attempts to<br />match conclusions in the database until it finds one. In<br />addition, the system may prove the rule premise. If a matching<br />rule is found, the system will try to prove each premise in the<br />rule. Lastly, the AI system may try to backtrack within a premise. If a clause fails, go to the previous clause and<br />try to find new bindings for variables in the clause. In the event everything fails, find a new rule structure.<br />This work is a treasure chest of information for anyone seeking<br />to design a workable AI system utilizing sound programming<br />and logic principles.	2004-01-14

There are many examples of strategies/approaches that<br />have been proven to work in a multiplicity of situations at<br />work, at home and in societal contexts. The work emphasizes<br />important aspects of human nature that are not taught in texts.<br />In many ways, the volume is a precursor to the personal relations art taught by Tony Robbins and others in the field.<br /><br />Carnegie stresses that every person cherishes the desire to be<br />great amongst a motley mixture of wishes. We all want health,<br />food, sleep, money, a peaceful afterlife, sexual gratification,<br />the well-being of family and a feeling of importance. Above else,<br />the desire to feel important is the distinguishing characteristic<br />between people and wildlife. In addition, the author describes<br />the importance of listening to another's viewpoint before<br />formulating an alternative argument. This is critical for<br />a salesperson. Too many salespeople try to sell based upon<br />what they think people need .<br /><br /> The art of selling is to listen to the customer's explanation of what he/she needs and wants before making a pitch. An important personal trait is to listen to other people rather than initially trying to make them like you. In addition, people like to be called by their first name. The more you find out about a person-the more you can relate to them on a personal level and gain their trust and interest.<br /><br />Another important rule is to always make the other person feel important in any type of relationship. \\"In a nutshell, there are six ways to make people like you:<br /><br />RULE 1: Become genuinely interested in others<br />RULE 2: Smile<br />RULE 3: Remember that a man's (person's) name is to him the<br />  sweetest and most important sound<br />RULE 4: Be a good listener<br />RULE 5: Talk in terms of the other man's interest<br />RULE 6: Make the other person feel important-and do it sincerely\\"<br /><br />Another important aspect of dealing with people involves<br />calling attention to people's shortcomings and errors indirectly.<br />The author provides a detailed analysis of how Roosevelt made<br />appointments in consultation with the local political bosses.<br />He asked for input. He rejected as many candidates as necessary<br />until the bosses submitted a qualified candidate. Then he would<br />thank the political bosses for their input. In this way, he<br />pushed through many types of reforms which otherwise would have<br />been impossible.<br /><br />Lastly, Carnegie lists 9 important ways to get people to do things without offending them:<br /><br />RULE 1: Begin with praise and honest appreciation.<br />RULE 2: Call attention to people's mistakes indirectly.<br />RULE 3: Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other<br />  person.<br />RULE 4: Ask questions instead of giving direct orders.<br />RULE 5: Let the other person save face.<br />RULE 6: Praise the slightest improvement and praise every<br />  improvement.<br />RULE 7: Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to.<br />RULE 8: Use encouragement.<br />Rule 9: Make the other person happy about doing the thing you<br />  suggest.<br /><br />For wives, Carnegie advises to:<br />1. Give your husband complete freedom in business or career<br />  matters.<br />2. Make the home attractive.<br />3. Vary the menu<br />4. Have an intelligent grasp of the spouse's business to discuss<br />  it intelligently<br />5. Meet financial problems maturely<br />6. Make a special effort to get along with relatives<br />7. Dress with an eye to your spouse's favorite colors<br />8. Compromise on little differences of opinion to make room<br />  for negotiation on the bigger and more important things<br />9. Make an effort to learn games your spouse likes to play<br />10.

The authors discuss important<br />economists of the past. For instance, Adam Smith's theories are<br />given quite a bit of space in this book. Smith taught that<br />the division of tasks into component parts will increase output<br />due to the shear specialization and learning curve effects.<br />He explained that free trade benefited England because goods<br />could be bought cheaper than they could be produced in the mother<br />country. As a result, English labor could specialize in areas<br />of comparative advantage. Malthus warned that the population<br />boom would result in greater poverty down the line. Economists<br />can argue this even today. Malthus argued for delayed marriage<br />to enhance the standard of living for married couples.<br />Ricardo argued that consumers could consume a greater variety<br />of goods with free trade regardless of the stage in the<br />advancement of trading partners. Marshall and Jevons<br />argued that marginal utility diminished with each portion.<br />That is, more of a good thing would lead to less pleasure<br />incrementally.  If people consumed all of their income,<br />Says Law found that &quot;Full Employment&quot; could remain.  This is<br />overly optimistic because consumers don't always have the same<br />level of demand for goods and services-particularly during<br />weak economic cycles.  This book is a good supplement to<br />the existing library of Economics volumes.	2003-12-30

The authors segment a career into the<br />promise phase, momentum in mid-career and harvest phase<br />at the height of a career. In addition, the need to build strong<br />management teams, motivate people and restructure organizations<br />is explained with appropriate examples.

The author realizes<br />that families solve many problems on their own. The role of a<br />good therapist is to realize that he/she cannot eliminate all<br />ills in the world. In addition, people have limits. The author<br />shows examples of how a healthy person can grow and learn from<br />an experience. People enjoy the process of working toward goals.<br />The attainment of the goal is not always the most joyful<br />event.  Instead, it is the extensive process of socialization<br />involved in reaching the new plateau. The author also explains<br />that too much endurance of others permits them to be slackers.<br />Endurance is a balancing trait which has limits. The author<br />illustrates how fortunate children benefit by having<br />parents able to assist in sorting through the avalanche of<br />life's choices. She cautions writers to show up faithfully,<br />be diligent, pay attention, tell the truth and avoid becoming<br />too attached to the results. A good writer must learn to be<br />dispassionate. Compassion should be coupled with clearheadedness.<br />Lastly, the author described the importance of reflection<br />with a reference to Charles Dickens. For every hour he wrote,<br />Dickens would walk an hour to reflect. This book makes for<br />good general reading. The author provides passages extolling the<br />beauty of nature, the need for pets to complement a household<br />and many more tidbits too numerous to enumerate here.<br />Finally, she provides some thoughts on marriage which is defined<br />as the triumph of faith over experience.

Netanyahu	This is an excellent work from beginning to end.<br />It outlines in great detail, a history of anti-semitism<br />dating back to Egypt in the BC era. The focus of the<br />work is on the brutal anti-semitism of the Inquisition<br />in Spain. The story of the Inquisition has great significance<br />to all Jews and Sephardic Jews (of Spain) in particular.<br />Technically, the Diaspora refers to the experience of Jews<br />including Ashkenazi, Sephardic, Oriental, Ethiopian and<br />many others living throughout the world.<br /><br />The main argument seems to place the process of anti-semitism<br />within a racial context rather than a religious one.<br />This context may have served as a basis for<br />a continued persecution of Jews up through the 20th century.<br /><br />There is a brilliant work which deals with the protection of<br />the Jewish community against harm. It is \\"The Keeper of the Gate\\"<br />published by the Jerusalem Publishing Company/House. The<br />\\"Keeper of the Gate\\" teaches how Jews protected neighborhoods<br />from harassing raids by marauders during the Middle Ages.<br /><br />In fact, Benjamin, Daniel and Joseph have been the historical<br />gatekeepers of the Jewish community.  Netanyahu's work<br />provides a thorough delineation of the foundations of hatred<br />against Jews. In so doing, the author has provided a wealth of<br />information to reshape hostile attitudes .  [...]<br /><br />For now, I plan to re-read this work in even greater depth<br />when the time affords. The author has demonstrated a wealth of<br />knowledge as a top historical researcher of our time.<br /><br />The fact checking for this extensive book must have<br />been a monumental task.

It emphasizes proven techniques to enhance learning<br />and the environment for learning. A strength of this volume is<br />that the techniques can be utilized in daily life to introduce<br />the conditions most conducive to a meaningful learning experience. American education teaches reading, writing, math,<br />computer schools and the liberal arts. Most schools do not teach<br />learning utilizing any step-by-step or disciplined approach.<br />The Ostrander work teaches us how people learn and provides<br />model exercises to nurture life-long learning skills. For<br />this reason alone, the acquisition is well worth the price paid.<br />This book answers the question \\"Why doesn't my kid learn?\\".<br /><br /> For instance,the author introduces the reader to breathing exercises to oxygenate the body so that the mind is relaxed and prepared for concentration. Classical music is introduced as a motivator in facilitating the process of learning and setting the<br />conditions wherein it can occur optimally. The book is well worth<br />the price if the reader actually PRACTICES some of these<br />techniques in order to master them. Nothing less than a serious<br />effort at following these techniques will be required in order<br />to appreciate this text. Dr. Lozanov was a pioneer in perfecting<br />techniques to facilitate healing through relaxation techniques<br />aimed at obtaining optimal functioning of the mind. I have<br />modified some of these learning techniques during intensive<br />study sessions and they are useful incrementally. Nothing takes<br />the place of intense motivation aimed at accomplishing important<br />goals. These relaxation techniques can facilitate the conditions so that learning can occur; however, the individual needs the<br />motivation to learn. This motivation is accomplished frequently<br />by setting goals and visualizing attainment as a condition precedent to performing the work necessary to accomplish<br />elusive goals.  Again, this work is valuable incrementally<br />as a motivator. It is incumbent upon the individual to apply<br />these techniques to translate motivation into action . Goal congruency is critical as a condition precedent to goal attainment.  If an individual does not believe in the necessity to attain the goal, then all of the motivating forces will be to little or no avail.<br /><br />This text is useful for readers who keep an open mind .<br />It is necessary to read these techniques dispassionately and<br />honestly attempt implementation before assessing whether or not this work will be helpful to you.<br />The techniques have validity; however, the reader must struggle through the considerable processes outlined in the text in order to achieve the maximum benefit.<br /><br />This work could be helpful if you have a child with learning<br />issues and you've tried everything to no avail. The techniques<br />outlined may be helpful in structuring a learning experience<br />to compensate for motivational problems, attention-span problems<br />and a whole host of issues related to early childhood intervention . To be maximally beneficial, you must make an<br />honest attempt at implementing the techniques outlined in this<br />book before making any pre-judgments.<br /><br />People pay professionals thousands of dollars to intervene in<br />complicated cases involving learning difficulties and motivation.<br />This text provides very valuable advice at little cost.

He covers space, time,<br />the expanding universe, uncertainty, black holes and a unifying<br />theory of physics and all matter. Einstein first postulated that<br />matter could neither be created nor destroyed. Ptolemy's model<br />predicts positioning of heavenly bodies. Galileo proved that<br />each body increased speed at the same weight despite it's own<br />weight except for a feather which fell slower due to air<br />resistance. The author explained that it takes 8 minutes for<br />light to reach the earth from the sun. In fact, this distance<br />is an important portal in the quantification and measurement<br />of time. Without light and distance, the measurement of time<br />would be difficult and perhaps impossible. The author explained<br />that the expanding universe slows down and stops.<br />Chandrasekhar calculated that a cold star would not be able<br />to support itself against its own gravity. This work is<br />excellent for science enthusiasts. It would be perfect for a<br />student class project in science.	2003-11-20

This book provides quality information on<br />individual drugs so that consumers have a single source<br />to evaluate effectiveness. A pharmacist should provide this<br />information; however, this text lists the data in an<br />easily readable form without too much medical jargon.<br />It would be helpful to have a comparison with the alternative<br />medicinal protocols utilizing natural substances. There is a<br />difference between organically recognizable substances that are<br />natural derivatives versus the inorganic substances of<br />prescription drugs. Inorganic substances are not necessarily<br />recognizable by the body and may not break down as easily into substances that the body can deal with as easily as<br />the organically based treatments. Nonetheless, this work<br />is still helpful for consumers taking the pharmaceutical<br />approaches.<br />This work would be most effective if the patient utilized it<br />in conjunction with his/her physician medical encounter.<br />Some medicinal protocols can be accomplished via diet,<br />exercise and the use of nutrition to accomplish medicinal<br />goals.

He praises the Keogh<br />plans for providing fully taxable contributions now. The overall<br />thrust of this book is excellent. I would supplement it with<br />investments in real estate to maximize cash flow in the<br />retirement years. If you don't own a house now, buy one.<br />If you already own a house, make the sacrifice to buy another.<br />The added cash flow from a second home will more than supplement<br />your future social security check. There are many programs<br />out there which deal with real estate accumulation. The<br />Carleton Sheets Program \\"Nothing Down\\" is an excellent source<br />for purchasing real estate.

I'm not so sure that the paperback<br />version will stand the test of time and elements. The work<br />contains an exhaustive conjugation of almost every important<br />verb utilized in conversational Spanish, as well as the<br />literature of Spain and the Americas. This book will help if you<br />are learning the language for the first time. It's important<br />to understand the correct grammatical formulations because<br />there are many tricky exceptions. For instance, the verb<br />&quot;comer&quot; means to eat. Its conjugations are como, comes, come,<br />comemos, comeis and comen. The verb volver (to return) is not<br />so obvious. Its conjugations are vuelvo, vuelves, vuelve,<br />volvemos, volveis and vuelven. Although the verb &quot;volver&quot; begins<br />with &quot;vo&quot;, the conjugated form begins with &quot;vue&quot;. This is one<br />of many important exceptions in the Spanish language. With<br />usage, you'll begin to apply the exceptions correctly. This<br />book is a good reference to help you get started and stay on<br />track. The work is good for studying the Regents exam in<br />Spanish, as well as formulating paragraph structures in a<br />Spanish literature course. The Spanish literature courses<br />can be difficult because the medieval literature has many<br />idiomatic words and phrases which have no traceable modern<br />derivative. Reading &quot;Don Quijote&quot; is very difficult in spots<br />because of the older idioms and the paucity of their use in<br />modern Spanish. A strength of this book is that the author<br />separates the irregular verbal forms for ease of reference.<br />For beginners, memorization of the irregular forms is the<br />best option. With repeated use, these forms will become<br />second nature to you. The conversational Spanish newspapers<br />are much easier to read than the classical Spanish literature.<br />Current newspapers and magazines are devoid of the confusing<br />idioms which are quite common in the older literary works.<br />Modifiers are a real challenge.

It gives<br />a peek into the unpretentious ways of the early Chinese thinkers.<br />It begins with a discussion of the uncomplicated life of<br />Confucious. His version of Tao was that it was the way of the<br />ancients. He stressed filiel piety and practiced what he<br />preached. His lasting discovery was a testament to the moral<br />nature of man/people. He provides a simple explanation of<br />the famous yin/yang theories. Yin stands for darkness, cold, negativeness, weakness etc. Yang stands for light, heat,<br />strength and positiveness. The first rule of mysticism is to<br />disregard your own personality.<br />\\"The secret was for the insight<br />Of eyes unclouded by longing;<br />Those who are bound by desire<br />See only the outward container\\".<br />Put another way, they don't see or appreciate the inside of<br />the container.

The book discusses dietary implications based upon blood<br />types. For instance, Type A is the agrarian which is comfortable with grains and livestock. Blood type B people require a<br />balanced diet of meat and dairy. (B-Antigen)  Type AB is the modern man with an inherited tolerance of AB with enhanced<br />abilities to manufacture more antibodies. (A & B antigen) The blood type is key to the immune system. Blood type 0 persons have no antigens. (Anti-A and Anti-B antibodies) Type B people may have milk ; whereas, Type A people tend to have systems which agglutinate and reject it.<br /><br />The author mentions an Indican urine scale for bowel putrification; wherein, the liver and intestines do not metabolize proteins. Instead; they produce indols- toxic byproducts on the Indican Scale. Foods with toxic Indicans should be avoided.  i.e. Bologna  magnifies nitrites. Lactin activity inflames the intestines, causes bloating and slows food metabolism. Wheat gluten slows the<br />metabolism and interferes with insulin efficiency.<br /><br />Kelp, seafood, liver, kale, spinach,broccolli and red meat are ideal for metabolism and weight loss/stabilization. Bacon, ham, pork, American cheese, cheddar and ice cream should be minimized. Soy may be utilized as a good alternate to the dairy group. Flax oil and olive oil are beneficial. Corn oil and peanut oil should be avoided. Type B persons have stronger immune systems and may eat meat, green veggies, eggs, liver, licorice tea and ginger. Type AB persons benefit from TOFU, dairy , green veggies and millet.<br />Persons with sinusitis and Type B should avoid fenugreek. Type O persons should avoid alfalfa. Type B persons react badly to vaccines. Type A persons should avoid cayenne due to potential nausea. Type O and B should avoid aloe vera juice.<br /><br />This book contains a wealth of important dietary material. It should be read carefully.

The authors distinguish<br />between mechanical digestion and chemical digestion which<br />is the enzyme breakdown of food in the body. IBS happens when<br />the muscular activity or motility is altered. Contraction<br />either speeds up or slows down food movements through the<br />digestive tract. John Hopkins University found that 6 - 8<br />peristaltic contractions were the ideal; whereas, IBS patients<br />can have as few as &quot;0&quot; contractions and as many as 25.<br />A slowdown of food movements can lead to putrification of<br />the food, fermentation and bacterial overgrowth. Classic<br />triggers of this condition are dairy, insufficient fiber,<br />excessive smoking, stress and certain types of drugs.<br />The challenge for the patient is to diarize the food each<br />day and the adverse reactions as a condition precedent to<br />managing this disease. A related work by Hamlyn recommends<br />the evaluation of stool samples for parasitic infection and<br />the sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. Loperamide may be utilized to<br />reduce bowel contractions and Mebeverine is an anti-spasm<br />drug. Ispaghula husk may be used as a bulking agent to harden<br />stool prior to elimination. Peppermint oil classically relaxes<br />gut muscles. Hamlyn's work recommends that IBS patients<br />reduce sugary foods, reduce or eliminate smoking, increase<br />omega 3 oils and decrease milk consumption.	2003-11-04

The main character, Mr. Chips<br />evolves into a personable old man who gains substantial<br />sympathy from the readership. This book is assigned in early<br />high school because of its excellent presentation and<br />innocent themes. The main character represents an instructor<br />who teaches generations of boys in a local middle or high school. The setting is in Brookfield, England. There is a<br />quaintness about the town, as well as the characters in the<br />book. The portal of time preceeded the 20th century when<br />teachers stayed in the same job and the same locale for<br />multiple generations. With each passing generation,  the<br />graduating students would reminisce about teachers within<br />each others' common domain of experience. Mr. Chips was a<br />character not likely to be forgotten due to his longstanding<br />presence as a pedagogue to the many young students in Brookfield.<br />Students would critique his memory and style of teaching<br />year after year. The main character suffered through adversities<br />and celebrated better times. The work is memorable due to its<br />shear ordinariness. At times, the author shifts from the<br />present tense verbal structures to the past tense without<br />adequately preparing the reader. The general grammatical<br />thrust of the book is appropriate for the readership; namely,<br />young people. The work foretells a time past; however,<br />it's important for students to read literature from different<br />centuries in order to gain an overall perspective on world<br />history and comparative styles of writing in the English<br />language and other languages. Contrast the character of<br />Mr. Chips to that of Ebeneezer Scrooge in &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;<br />by Charles Dickens. The character of Scrooge is far more<br />sophisticated and worldly. The story is more involved with<br />a complete evolution of the main character from a stingy<br />pennypincher to a generous patron of the local community.<br />The authors are similar in that the storylines are centered<br />on a single character throughout a lifetime. These English<br />authors were marvelous storytellers. They escorted the readers<br />through decades of experiences in the lives of the involved<br />characters. The works are important for readers of all ages<br />because they document ordinary and sometimes extraordinary<br />lives during the various stages of evolution and transition.ete evolution of the main character from a stingy<br />pennypincher to a generous patron of the local community.<br />The authors are similar in that the storylines are centered<br />on a single character throughout a lifetime.

Dr. Nelson<br />mentions various Vit C dietary combinations utilizing<br />orange juice, strawberries or grapefruit to provide Vit. C.<br />Next, the authors cite important anti-inflammatory combos;<br />such as, Omega 3 fish oil and flaxseed oil. Sunflower oil<br />has the requisite Omega 6 ingredients. Sulfasalazine and<br />methotrexate are important protocols for treating seronegative<br />spondylarthropathies. In addition, the lungs, heart and eyes<br />may be impacted by ankylosing spondylitis and related diseases.<br />For instance, Iritis may impact the eyes. Calcification of<br />the heart valves and electronic problems with the heart have<br />been noted. Decreased lung capacity is another important<br />resultant of ankylosing spondylitis.<br />The authors point out that Chronic Juvenile Arthritis stunts<br />growth. In addition, the SED RATE (sedimentation rate) and<br />rhematoid factor are the gold standard for blood tests to<br />detect arthritis. In my own experience, the MOST- micro-oxidative<br />stress test may be helpful in articulating the yeast component<br />as an aggravating factor in arthritic conditions.<br />The authors provide an important series of exercises which<br />may be helpful for arthritic patients. The physical therapy<br />training consists of moderate squatting, toe stand<br />(standing erect on your toes), moderate push-ups by pressing<br />the wall, back extensions by facing the floor and raising the<br />head, modified sit-ups, knee extension flexing, full range<br />motion employing light weights in torque motion, face flat on<br />the floor raising the back legs, the lunge stretch,<br />cross-over hips, placing one knee on the chair and standing<br />upright or erect, shoulder stretches and a host of others.<br />Dr. Nelson indicates that excess joint fluid is a sign of<br />inflammation. In addition, surgical intervention can be<br />helpful. For instance, an artificial joint may last 15-20 years.<br />Acupuncture helps to stimulate endomorphins and change blood<br />flow patterns. There is evidence that acupuncture relieves<br />arthritis, although there is less evidence for Chiropractic.<br />This book is worth the price. It provides important alternative<br />medicinal protocols for arthritis as well as classic physical<br />therapy exercises aimed at preserving joint mobility and<br />elasticity. I would supplement the exercises with Alpha<br />Lipoic Acid to enhance bodily elasticity.

The authors provide<br />3 rules for repairing cells by recharging them via CoQ 10<br />enzymes, fat burning and revival. The CoQ 10 and Carnitine<br />constitute the important ingredients of the &quot;energy pack&quot;<br />enuncited by the authors. There is a purification protocol<br />which requires patients to drink a gallon of water a day<br />and abstain from milk which causes mucal secretions.<br />The common cold protocol works from my own experience.<br />It consists of taking 1000 mg of Vit C ( 3 times daily),<br />Echinacea and Zinc lozenges. The protocol for hypoglycemia<br />or low blood sugar consists of eating many small meals,<br />eating prior to exercise, taking Mg. supplements and watching<br />for early warning signs of diabetes.

The authors relate various out of body experiences.<br />For instance, some children have had near death experiences and<br />visions which they recalled after recovery. The work contains<br />angellic artwork throughout. For instance, &quot;The Annunciation&quot;<br />by Botticelli is depicted, as well as &quot;Concert of Angels&quot;<br />by Gruenewald. The phenomenom of the famous &quot;bright lights&quot;<br />is described in near-death experiences. A child named Jamie<br />describes &quot;the resurrected body floating in the thin air&quot;.<br />Angels are hailed as a buffer between the temporal realm<br />on earth and G-d.

This work would be perfect for a collegiate literary course emphasizing multi-cultural aspects in classic world writings. This<br />poetry traverses many different cultural<br />perspectives. Here are some tantalizing samples:<br />\\"Now the New Year reviving old Desires,<br /> The thoughtful Soul to Solitude retires,<br /> Where the White Hand of Moses on the Bough<br /> Puts out, and Jesus from the Ground suspires.\\"<br />Alongside these lines is a picture of a young lady strolling<br />in the countryside ostensibly searching for something or<br />someone in vain. The combination of the poetry and the<br />drawing provide the reader with much to ponder. Surprisingly,<br />the musings of a Persian writer make reference to Jesus<br />in a work written in the 12th century or thereabouts.<br />Let's look at another quatrain.<br />\\"And this I know: whether the one True Light,<br />Kindle to Love, or Wrath consume me quite,<br />One Glimpse of It within the Tavern caught<br />Better than in the Temple lost outright.\\"<br />The writer praises the act of coming to the truth. Apparently,<br />he doesn't care whether or not it is arrived at in the Tavern.<br />Alongside is a penciled drawing of a drunk man raising a<br />glass of wine to the heavens.<br />Another quatrain addresses our futile attempts to change fate:<br />\\"Ah, Love! could thou and I with Fate conspire<br /> To grasp this sorry Scheme of Things entire,<br /> Would not we shatter it to bits-and then<br /> Re-mould it nearer to the Heart's Desire! \\"<br />The lines describe changing the scheme of things. If we could<br />change things, what would we put in place of the old and whose<br />desires would be placated? G-d gave us free will and the<br />individual and collective control over destiny. When things<br />go wrong,  how can we blame G-d for the fateful turn. It is<br />man (person) who controls destiny through free will.<br />When free will goes awry, it is not G-d's fault. Rather,<br />unintended twists in the road are consequences of our own<br />choices devoid of influences by G-d or any deity.<br />Let's look at one final quatrain-just for measure:<br />\\"Ah, fill the Cup:- what boots it to repeat<br /> How Time is slipping underneath our Feet:<br /> Unborn To-Morrow and dead YESTERDAY,<br /> Why fret about them if To-Day be sweet! \\"<br />The author conveys the importance of enjoying a good day.<br />He asks that we not spoil celebration with worries about<br />the morrow or regrets about things that are done and cannot<br />be changed in any event.

The author tackles some very<br />difficult philosophical issues that have been the subject<br />of much debate over the centuries. He explains how St.Thomas<br />gave philosophy its charter with important theological and<br />philosophical arguments. In essence, he argued that God is the<br />cause or reason for our existence. St. Thomas was a realist<br />in that he attempted to formulate his arguments through logic.<br />The early philisophic Christians drew hostility from pagans and theoretical atheists who decried the role of God in the affairs of man/persons.<br />The Gnosticists spoke of a duality between God and matter conceptually similar to Grecian arguments. St. Anselm sought to prove God's existence pointing to a perfection of creation through the greatness of the deity and wisdom-presumptively Divine wisdom.<br />Copleston's work is a comprehensive rendition of philosophy<br />over thousands of years. He tries to cover too much.<br />In so doing ,  the author brings a certain &quot;unity&quot;  of the<br />work to the complex subject of philosophy. This concept of<br />unity is seen in the works of St. Augustine and St. Bonaventure.<br />St. Augustine  was a great theologian and writer of foundational<br />Latin, literature and grammar. He developed a theory which<br />postulated that everything would evolve given the passage of<br />time in the famous &quot;rationes seminales&quot;.

The university provided modern Europe with<br />grammar,logic,geometry, math, astronomy and other subjects<br />in the sciences and social sciences. Ibn Sina was a great<br />Moslem philosopher who lived around 1000 AD. He developed<br />logic, physics and higher mathematics into practical<br />applications. St. Bonaventure studied in a Franciscan order.<br />He perfected programs in philosophy and theology.

Ricardo states that value<br />is a function of effort and not the price paid for labor. He<br />reminded us that labor plus the tools to assist labor affected<br />the creation of value. Therefore; increases in value were in<br />direct proportion to increments in labor. Value was also a<br />function of the time it took to bring the goods to market.<br />Surprisingly, the cultivation of inferior land resulted in a<br />higher exchangeable value of raw produce because more labor<br />was required in its production. If we become more efficient in<br />land cultivation, rents will go down because more can be<br />cultivated with less land. In addition, the exchangeable value<br />of commodities is undisturbed by natural or accidental causes.<br />Laborers derive their greatest pleasure when the market price<br />of labor exceeds the natural price. Therefore; wages will<br />increase in response to increases in the demand for labor.<br />Rises in rent are accompanied by increments in the share of<br />produce because landlords want more rent when harvests are<br />greater. Accordingly, the price of corn is a function of the labor to produce it. If wages go down, then prices must fall.<br />As the price of labor goes down, profits increase but the<br />price of the commodity may not go down. Taxes on profits<br />tend to increase the price of a commodity .  If money is not<br />taxed, then all commodities will be subject to price increases.<br />Ultimately, a tax on land begets a tax on produce. In addition,<br />a tax on labor will raise its price. In addition, the price of<br />provisions determine the price paid to the worker. If money<br />decreases in value, all commodities will be subject to steep<br />price increases. This was seen in modern times with the<br />fluctuation of the Russian currency. Ultimately, bounty<br />lowers the price to foreigners because the government subsidizes<br />the bounty paid to the local merchants to stimulate trade.<br />The theory of rent transfers value but does not create it.<br />Ultimately, wages are determined by the price of food and<br />cost of production.<br />This theory of wages differs from Adam Smith who said that<br />wages were a function of the ease or hardship to do work, the<br />difficulty or expense of learning a trade, the constancy<br />of employment, the trust reposed in the workmen, the probability<br />of success or failure of the venture or the fear of misfortune.<br />David Ricardo's work is an important milestone in the theory<br />of economics and comparison to the work of Adam Smith.he government subsidizes<br />the bounty paid to the local merchants to stimulate trade.<br />The theory of rent transfers value but does not create it.<br />Ultimately, wages are determined by the price of food and<br />cost of production.<br />This theory of wages differs from Adam Smith who said that<br />wages were a function of the ease or hardship to do work, the<br />difficulty or expense of learning a trade, the constancy<br />of employment, the trust reposed in the workmen, the probability<br />of success or failure of the venture or the fear of misfortune.<br />David Ricardo's work is an important milestone in the theory<br />of economics and comparison to the work of Adam Smith.	2003-10-28

He explained that all work had to be<br />highly organized in order to be productive. In addition, he<br />recognized that machinery facilitated work. This notion serves<br />as an important foundation for more modern patent practice.<br />He praised the ingenuity of inventors and makers of new<br />machinery. The author spoke of increased production as a<br />condition precedent to enhancing the power of labor. From this<br />precept, he explained that the size of a market would dictate<br />the division of its constituent labor. For instance, a small<br />community in the suburbs might be serviced by a local<br />&quot;General Store&quot;; whereas, a county in a large city would be<br />serviced by a retail chain store with hundreds of employees<br />and a highly sophisticated management structure.In Adam Smith's<br />time, metals were popular in the manufacture of commodities.<br />Problems were encountered in weighing the metals and arriving<br />at a uniform system of metrics. The theory of pricing was<br />a function of the toil needed to purchase a good. For instance,<br />the price of an auto was a function of the many hours of labor<br />necessary to earn the money to buy the car. In addition, the price of an item was related to its constituent parts.<br />For instance, the price of linen was a function of the labor<br />of the flaxdresser, spinner, weaver, bleacher and overall<br />employer. The natural price varied with the price of component<br />parts. For instance, if the semiconductor was reduced significantly in price- then the overall price of an electronic<br />appliance would go down. Adam Smith saw labour as a function<br />of national wealth. He recognized that laborers had to earn<br />more than a mere subsistence in order to live dignified lives.<br />He told a story of a mother in the Highlands of Scotland who<br />had to raise 20 children so that 2 would survive. Presumably,<br />18 children would die from various diseases and poverty.<br />The interest rates at the time were low. In England, rates<br />hovered at 5%. In France, the rates were 3-5% . The government<br />could borrow at 2% in Holland.<br />Adam Smith defined a wage as a function of the following:<br />o the ease or hardship to do work<br />Consider the case of a diamond cutter. The art of cutting a<br />diamond is a precise process which requires extensive training<br />and expert worksmanship. The demand for precious stones was a<br />function of their inherent beauty, scarcity and workmanship<br />involved in polishing them and preparing them for commercial use.<br />o the difficulty and expense of learning a trade<br />A skilled surgeon required years of medical training and a<br />long apprenticeship in anatomy and surgery.<br />o the constancy of employment<br />o the trust reposed in the workpeople<br />Consider the case of a landowner who took a year-long vacation<br />to the Orient. He/she would leave behind a manager to run the<br />entire business on a 24/7 basis. This high degree of trust<br />reposed in the workperson required a commensurate compensation.<br />o probability of success or failure of the venture<br />Consider the effort required to cross the Atlantic. The trip<br />was lengthy, dangerous and prone to failure due to the vagaries<br />of nature, pirating on the high seas and disease. Naturally,<br />a worker had to receive a greater compensation to take these<br />factors into consideration.<br />o the danger inherent in doing the work<br />Consider the danger inherent in entering a diamond mine.<br />The possibility of collapse was a constant threat. Accordingly,<br />workers were compensated commensurate with the threat level.<br />Adam Smith explained that fear of misfortune dampened the taking<br />of risks.

He makes<br />clear the necessity to understand risks clearly at the outset<br />of any important decision. For instance, a physician must take<br />into consideration \\"false positive \\" test results so that<br />he/she does not over-react. An over-reaction could cause the<br />physician to take unnecessary precautions that could do more<br />to endanger the patient than help. In addition, the author<br />cautions against fabrication of certainty or the use of<br />statistics to prove a predetermined result. This book is<br />useful in arriving at a realistic design for a statistical<br />test or any other test from which an important scientific<br />inference will be made.	2003-10-28

For instance, the successful implementation<br />of the existential work value seeks to provide the<br />individual with freedom and the opportunity for creativity<br />in order to function in assignments having very little<br />structure counterbalanced by considerable challenge.<br /><br />Many of today's most difficult problems have very little<br />structure, an immediate demand for a solution and a critical<br />need for individuals who can build successful implementation<br />programs from scratch. Michael Korda names some classic<br />innovators in his work. For instance, Paul De Domenico made<br />his mark in selling macadamia nuts. Harry Freidenberg made a<br />fortune in marketing Star Trek memorabilia. The author points<br />to personal fitness as an important goal for aspiring to<br />top level positions. High energy is another important ingredient<br />in successful careers. This involves the ability to perform<br />sustained work on an ongoing basis. The process begins with<br />good posture and attentiveness to your surroundings. In addition,<br />the author points toward the need for self control in on-the-job<br />situations. In addition, it is vitally important to make<br />lists and checklists in order to ensure that things get done.<br />The author points toward a high level of organization as an<br />important condition precedent to success. The author teaches<br />how to dress for success beginning with a simple clean white<br />shirt and subdued tie with polished shoes that fit well.<br />Importantly, Korda teaches how to turn failures into success.<br />Abraham Lincoln didn't achieve anything substantial until age 51.<br />Sir Winston Churchill had a difficult road leading to<br />Prime Minister.<br /><br />Overall, this work points out some important factors in<br />planning for and implementing successful strategies in your<br />personal life and work career. Some of Korda's basic principles<br />are still relevant today.  Nonetheless, executives need to be<br />cognizant of the public's perception of earned income and<br />percs. Korda's work may help in providing some structure<br />in your career planning and implementation program. For this<br />alone, the work may be worth reading. Dale Carnegie's works<br />are an important complement to Korda's principles because<br />people respond well to genuine interest, the use of first<br />names and dialogue aimed at the listener's specific interests.<br />Andrew Carnegie inspired many with his book called<br />\\"Gospel of Wealth\\"./><br />Overall, this work points out some important factors in<br />planning for and implementing successful strategies in your<br />personal life and work career.

The author begins by defining the superconductor in terms of the ability of metals to carry electricity without the loss of energy. Numerous applications<br />of superconductors are provided. For instance, they may be utilized to store power or run trains as in the Japanese meglev<br />levitational train. The book describes the evolution of the<br />Kelvin absolute temmperature scale to articulate Absolute Zero.<br />The author describes important critical temperatures of<br />superconductors; such as Hg at 4.1K, Pb at 7.2K and the theory<br />that an increase in magnetic field results in a decrease of<br />critical temperature. The Meissner effect is described; wherein,<br />there is an expulsion of magnetic fields from the interior of a<br />superconductor. A phase change causes material to become<br />a superconductor. The goal of labs for the longer term is to find<br />materials that superconduct above temperatures where nitrogen<br />or N liquifies. New products; such as SQUIDS are superconductors which may be utilized to detect brain signals. In addition,<br />computer technology is creating superfast switches called<br />Josephson junctures; wherein, a thin layer of insulating material<br />is sandwiched between layers of a superconducting material.	2003-10-23

The author defines Hep C as the non-A<br />and non-B strain. The Hep A strain is contracted from<br />contaminated water. Hep B is contracted from blood and body<br />fluids; whereas Hep C enters through the blood. Hep A and B<br />have a vaccine; whereas, Hep C does not. HCV risk is increased<br />in non-sanitary blood transfusions, shared needles ,hemophiliacs<br />and persons with multiple sex partners. The onslaught of Hep C<br />brings flu-like symptoms and  joint pain with chronic fatigue<br />and gastro-intestinal problems in some cases. The treatment<br />goals are successful remission, delaying liver damage,<br />maintaining liver function, alleviating symptoms, infection<br />control and health maintanence. Relevant diagnostic tests<br />are the HCV antibody; ALT and AST liver, RIBA-HCV antibody,<br />increased alkaline phosphatase , increased bilirubin, decreased<br />albumin and the PT time test for clotting. Treatments vary<br />from interferon to anti-inflammatories and anti-oxidants<br />and vaccination of the Hep A and B or combined Hep AB vaccine.<br />This book is very helpful to the layperson because it explains<br />some very complex medical jargon in conversational English.<br />For this reason alone, it is well worth the price.You MUST<br />read this book if you plan extensive travelling overseas.	2003-10-16

Those<br />persons exposed have a 75-80% chance of infection with the HCV<br />virus and a 70% chance of developing the chronic form of<br />the hepatitis virus. In addition, there is a 10-20% chance of<br />developing the liver complication cirrhosis over a 20-30 year<br />period and a 1-5% chance of dying from a chronic liver condition. Hepatitis C is an RNA virus as opposed to a DNA<br />strain. Vaccination helps for the Hepatitis A and B strains<br />wherein 3 shots are administered over a 1/2 year period.<br />To reduce the likelihood of the disease, it is necessary<br />to reduce smoking , as well as exposure to all toxins.<br />The disease may be monitored with tests for bilerubin, albumin,<br />PT time and the anti-HCV antibody test. Treatment is enhanced<br />with reducing stress, commitments and responsibilities<br />until the condition is well under control.

The work starts with a quote from the Bible in<br />Genesis 2:17 which admonishes us &quot; Do not eat the fruit of<br />technology 'that makes the edible' the inedible.&quot;<br />The author traces the history of dieting, the agricultural revolution, a mosaic of diet tips, the five week neanderthin<br />diet and maintenance of a food diary to accomplish the same.<br />Some of the recommended food preparations are spinach,<br />mushroom and bacon frittata; fried apples; vegetable juice<br />omelete, nut milk, applesauce, green onions and eggs,<br />green chili stew, soups, shrimp cocktail, nut pizza,<br />neanderthin guacamole and venetian salad. He reminds us of how<br />R Buckminster Fuller lost much weight and lived to be 88 years<br />of age by choosing an elemental diet consisting of animals<br />that fed on vegetables.<br />In addition, the raw diet meat should emulate pemmican.<br />This high-energy food is made by mixing raw lean meat with<br />animal fat in a one-to-one ratio. Pemmican is known to<br />store for a long time without the traditional refrigeration.<br />Foods which require technological intervention to become<br />edible are candidates for elimination; such as, corn, grains,<br />sugar and potatoes. Alcohol is another forbidden food because<br />it is a by-product of yeast digestion. Amazingly, it is important<br />to have fats in the diet and to drink large quantities of water.<br />The book emphasizes that the body needs lean red meat so that<br />it gets the enzymes to metabolize iron. The work lists<br />internet sources; such as neanderthin.com and paleodiet.com.<br />The author believes in getting the daily allotment of calcium<br />from dark leafy green vegetables, nuts and fish. This book<br />is a refreshing departure from the standard diets.<br />Many people have tried this with apparent results in maintaining<br />weight loss and gaining energy.

The<br />definition of unobviousness is a legal nightmare. Pressman<br />facilitates understanding of the concept.<br />He explains that:<br />1. An invention must succeed where others fail.<br />2. It must solve a problem never before recognized.<br />3. It must solve a problem thought to be unsolvable or<br />  impractical to implement.<br />4. It must attain or be capable of attaining commercial success.<br />5. It is classified in a crowded art where even a small<br />  improvement means a lot.<br />6. It omits an element without losing functionality or<br />  engineering throughput.<br />7. It contains a modification not suggested in prior art.<br />8. It provides an advantage never before recognized.<br />9. It provides an operative result where past attempts failed.<br />10. It successfully implements an ancient idea. i.e. time machine<br />11. It fulfills a long-felt need in practice or industry.<br />12. It runs contrary to the teachings of prior art.<br />  i.e.  It defies gravity or teaches scientific principles<br />  which contradict known principles  i.e. Newton's laws<br />Usually, art must have at least one or more of the above<br />characteristics. In addition, the examiner must be convinced<br />that the implement can be built or converted to<br />commercialization. Applications qualifying on these criteria<br />are approved provided that a rigorous search does not turn up<br />prior art. Pressman provides copies of the relevant<br />Patent Office forms and fee schedules. In addition, he<br />lists the patent library collections in each state together<br />with the contact numbers.There is an exhaustive section<br />on patent vocabulary and claims formulation. This book is<br />a gold mine. It is worth 5 times the price of admission.<br />I recommend writing your patent application and showing the<br />first try to a patent attorney until you become proficient.<br />In complex cases, you may need to file continuation in part<br />applications to get an allowance. In any event, this work<br />will help you deal more effectively with the PTO or an attorney.<br />In addition, this work will help you argue in court utilizing<br />the precise &quot;unobviousness&quot; terminology of the PTO.<br />You must know that a case is rarely allowed by the PTO in a<br />first review. Usually, there is at least an initial report<br />disallowing specific aspects which must be overcome. This process<br />requires that you &quot;dig&quot; into the unobviousness rules and<br />prove your case to the examiner. If you can't prove the case<br />(usually after two tries)  , a continuation in part application<br />may be necessary to add more features in order to distinguish<br />your invention from the current art. The author teaches<br />how to write the optimal claim which encapsules your<br />invention into the most all-inclusive mode in practical<br />application. Lastly, you may be required to describe the<br />operation of the invention in its preferred mode. Pressman<br />helps you to formulate any device into a working model or<br />prototype which can be emulated in practice by an ordinary<br />practitioner in the scientific art. If you look on the internet,<br />there are engineering firms which will build a model to<br />specification for a price.<br />After having stated all of the above, you must realize that<br />there is absolutely no way you can read the legal code and<br />glean all of these rules yourself. Hence, it is easy to see<br />why Pressman's work is so valuable. It is valuable to<br />an inventor, law school student or even a patent attorney.<br />Good luck and don't file a patent applicationwithout first<br />reading this book or one like it.without first<br />reading this book or one like it.	2003-10-06

The author traces the life of Wang Lung-<br />a Chinese peasant who eventually becomes wealthy through<br />land acquisition. The story progresses from a life of poverty<br />to the wealth of Wang Lung. The transition into a higher<br />social status is not a panacea of pure contentment because<br />the main character suffers a series of disappointments and<br />adversities. The Good Earth documents a facet of life in the<br />Old China. We are reminded that poverty has a unique set<br />of problems and challenges. Wealth acquisition does not<br />necessarily resolve all of our problems. In fact, money<br />brings other types of issues into our personal lives because<br />we can never be fulfilled completely by subsisting on<br />worldly acquisitions and their accoutrements. The work<br />teaches young readers to aspire to great things but to expect<br />hard work and adversity on the long road to success and the<br />attainment of material rewards. In addition, the reader<br />should understand that faith and a belief in a better life<br />help to facilitate living through the series of adversities<br />that will come for certain during life's journey.	2003-10-05

Strains, sprains, spasms and disc problems are the cited sources of back pain. Treatment<br />modalities are bed rest, exercise, spinal manipulation, braces, pharmaceuticals, counter stimulation chemonucleolysis and<br />acupuncture. The details of spinal surgery are described in<br />great detail. For instance,<br />&quot; In a simple fusion procedure, the surgeon makes an incision-<br />usually in the back, but sometimes in the abdomen-about<br />three inches long and, as in a discectomy, pushes aside<br />muscles and ligaments to reach the vertebrae. He attaches bone grafts, about the size and shape of matchsticks, onto the facet joints. Larger pieces of bone are used between vertebrae.<br />Over time-generally four to nine months-the bones and bone<br />grafts grow together, and the two vertebrae are fused into a single, solid unit.&quot;<br />The author provides numerous prevention strategies which<br />anticipate back pain.

Kennedy	This work ranks as a first-rate political commentary on the<br />courageous positions taken by a select group of Americans.<br />The author cites a number of famous and not so famous<br />Americans . i.e. John Quincy Adams, Daniel Webster and<br />Edmund Ross.  I was impressed by the character of Edmund Ross<br />in making a very principled choice in the impeachment proceedings<br />of President Andrew Johnson. Ross transcended considerable<br />past disagreements with President Johnson to cast an<br />impeachment vote effectively retaining the unpopular president.<br /><br />For the post-Lincoln time period, this act required more<br />than a modicum of political courage. President Kennedy<br />presented these stories utilizing a simple belles lettres<br />style of writing which adds to the thrilling crescendo<br />built into the book. The work follows the extemporaneous or<br />impromptu nature of President Kennedy's public speaking.<br />Accordingly, the authorship is genuine in every sense.<br /><br />Students of American history will find this work invaluable. In addition, it is written well. The vocabulary is superior as is the sentence construction. Readers would expect this because<br />President Kennedy was known to be a voracious reader.<br />The book is required reading on many high school literary lists.<br /><br />After having read the work, students will have gained a<br />better perspective on the life and times of the early<br />American thinkers and politicians.	2003-09-29

The purchase<br />of a property on \\"nothing down terms\\" requires a lot of very<br />meticulous verification work. Carleton's book points out all of<br />the opportunities and pitfalls. Basic terms are defined clearly.<br /><br />Carleton reviews the \\"nothing down\\" techniques for acquiring<br />a property utilizing other peoples' money. There are various<br />ways to accomplish these techniques. For instance, suppose<br />you locate a motivated seller who will give you a note for<br />a portion of the purchase price. Assume that the house has a<br />loanable value far in excess of what you will be paying.<br />In this case, you can acquire a house with nothing down<br />because the financial institution is well-protected by the<br />value of the home. In estate sales, you can acquire the<br />contents of the home , as well as the home.  In foreclosures,<br />the seller (usually a financial institution) is looking for<br />someone to assume the mortgage so that the monthly maintenance<br />costs will no longer be assumed by the bank. Sometimes,<br />you can literally roll over a property by acquiring it and<br />selling it immediately at a much higher price. There are<br />government homesteading programs wherein the government<br />will give you the property just for living in it for a period<br />of time. There are special programs which provide 50%<br />discounts for teachers and special discounts for the disabled.<br />Carleton Sheets covers most of these programs in his works.<br />In addition, he sells a \\"Nothing Down\\" series of workbooks<br />which outline the process on pre-designed worksheets.<br />The HUD (Housing and Urban Development) Website has a description<br />of many of the government programs. There are special programs<br />for veterans and the home-business utilization of a property.<br />Due to the favorable foreign exchange rate, homes in Canada<br />are cheaper. Carleton's book on \\"Real Estate-The World's<br />Greatest Wealth Builder\\" is a good place to start investing<br />in real estate. When you look at a property, you should bring<br />an experienced plumber and electrician to advise you on<br />the applicable code. In addition, keep in mind the structural<br />requirements in a house.  Money spent on an experienced<br />\\"home inspector\\"  is money well spent. The government has<br />low cost earthquake insurance for homes in earthquake zones.<br />Lastly, you should look at the town or county inspector's<br />books in order to find out about previous violations,<br />fires and other reportable events on the property. Real Estate<br />is a good investment because the social security allotment<br />will not cover everything in your retirement. In addition,<br />people change jobs and the pension vesting is not always<br />continuous.  Real Estate can help you to make up the difference<br />in your personal investment portfolio and planning.<br />In instances where a house requires fixing, the HUD provides<br />Title I loans up to $15,000 for fix-up expenses.  These loans<br />are at a very low rate of interest.<br />The work is worth every bit the price paid because mistakes<br />in this area can be costly and lawyers don't always provide<br />a comprehensive assessment of the critical issues involved in<br />purchasing individual properties.homes in Canada<br />are cheaper.

The author develops<br />the concept of individual freedom and intuitive reasoning.<br />He traces the Shakers of the 1750s and their need for<br />Divine Action. The colonists were classic preachers- they<br />educated large audiences of believers. There were some divisions<br />in the early American religious tradition. Presbyterian<br />conservatives feared the theology of the Northeast. The 1850s<br />brought about a period of intellectual fragmentation.<br />This period preceeded the Civil War and came just after the<br />political discourses of Karl Marx. The work develops an<br />American Methodism consisting of an Apostolic Church as<br />the engine to salvation through God. Religionists of the<br />period held important beliefs and convictions which were<br />debated against the intellectual relevancy of the Civil War<br />political theorists. This period saw an explosion in the<br />printing of new Bibles. Lincoln deferred to the will of God.<br />This work is an important exploration into the American<br />Religious traditions. As such, it provides entertaining<br />literature for a wide constituency of readers.  i.e.<br />historians, religious educators, American history enthusiasts<br />and a host of scholars in many related disciplines	2003-08-29

It describes the fundamental<br />imbalance of the pH factor and the differential impact on a<br />whole host of disease processes. The ideal diet should contain<br />a fair amount of foods in the alkaline category.  Too much<br />acidity has been associated with many chronic conditions and<br />diseases.  The pH level may stabilize at approximately 5.5<br />to 7.0 on a scale of 0-14 with 0-7 being the acid foods<br />and 7 or more being the alkaline foods. Our daily diet<br />should consist of an optimal balance of the acid/alkaline<br />foods. The Baroody work describes this pH balance in considerable<br />detail.  As such, it is a necessary part of the overall<br />nutritional program for both children and adults.<br />The standard diet of junk food tends to create a pH bias<br />which is acidic rather than a representative balance of<br />acid and alkaline food groups.  This aspect is further developed<br />in the book.  As such, Baroody's work is a valuable supplement<br />to your nutrition planning.	2003-08-26

The authors discuss an important concept<br />which involves merging infrastructure activities to exploit<br />strengths in the bureaucratic systems and distribute these<br />advantages across a wide spectrum of users. The book makes<br />a point in explaining that half of what people buy today<br />was not available a century ago. The authors envision a solution<br />in home employment to empower the babyboomers well into the<br />future.  This is an important work. It could be developed<br />further in some of the aforementioned areas. For instance,<br />there is a wide array of government assistance available to<br />small business owners and aspirants. This aspect could have<br />been developed more fully.  Matthew Lesko has a number of<br />government self-help books on the subject of government<br />grants, giveaways and low cost loans for small business.	2003-08-02

It has appropriate  coverage of the computational aspects; such as, matrix  addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, the  theory of dimensions, the square matrix and determinants.    The computational aspects of the course can be burdensome and  a thorough review of the techniques will assist greatly in  understanding the course applications on a timely basis.  Some of the computations can be performed on a scientific  calculator. Serious students should become familiar with how  to initialize matrices and enter data onto the scientific  calculator.    There is good coverage of the theory of linear algebra;  such as, inner product spaces, eigenvectors/eigenvalues and a   number of the more exotic applications geared for math majors.  Mathematics majors must go beyond the computational aspects to  comprehend the theory of linear algebra as evidenced by the  many proofs covered in the course literature and lectures.    The work is highly recommended for engineering and business majors. It will be helpful for mathematics majors. This work may assist students in preparation for formal collegiate and certification exams in business, engineering, actuarial sciences,  mathematics, econometrics and the computer sciences.    A few of the problems may have alternate solutions; however,  the thrust of the work is good. The theory of linear algebra  serves as an important foundation for computer programming  and spreadsheet formulation and analysis. The work is a good  value for the price charged.	2003-08-01

It is well written much in the character of a<br />romance novel. The work teaches the futility of managing<br />small groups via coercion and excess force. Captain Bligh<br />is nowhere near the equal of Fletcher Christian in managing<br />the crew and handling daily ministerial decisions.<br />In almost every instance, Captain Bligh resolves conflict<br />with excessive punishment and flippant directives.<br />With every moment, the crew resents his presence even more.<br />The readers can appreciate the easy contrast between Captain<br />Bligh and Fletcher Christian. Further into the novel,<br />a military court procedure leaves the judges perplexed<br />and ultimately disappointed in the disproportionate<br />punishments administered by Captain Bligh. Near the end of<br />the novel, his judgment is questioned and the audience<br />develops more sympathy for the person of Fletcher Christian<br />and his crew. The novel portrays a beautiful wilderness and<br />island paradise replete with exotic wildlife and fresh<br />fruit of every color and taste. Students will debate this<br />novel for years to come. It is appropriate for the high<br />school reading audience.	2003-07-31

I refer to it often in order to clarify<br />fine nuances in the Spanish language. The work has a beginning<br />section which focuses on pronunciation of the Spanish<br />alphabet. Afterward, the Spanish word is listed and translated<br />into English for A-Z.  At the midway point, the English word<br />is listed and translated into Spanish. In addition, there is<br />an extensive section on verbal tenses. The origin of words<br />is fully described .

Golding achieves high<br />drama throughout most of the work as the audience wonders<br />whether or not the group of stranded boys will come to their<br />collective senses. The setting is an island semi-paradise<br />where a group of boys are stranded temporarily. As time<br />progresses and no-one seems to notice them, a restlessness<br />takes over. Before long, the boys begin turning their<br />attention to the leader of the pack and his friend &quot;Piggy&quot;.<br />The book depicts some of the worst human emotions of<br />children . It progresses from an understandable<br />restlessness to progressive violence and ultimately murder.<br />This is a good rendition of group dynamics including<br />leadership, role-playing, group cohesiveness, the breakdown<br />of group cohesiveness and the complex dynamic<br />involving rewards and punishments in the pursuit of<br />group goals.<br />The work depicts both the positive side and negative side<br />of group conflict. Its positive side is constructive<br />argument leading to a successful resolution of a problem.<br />The negative side is violence in the pursuit of group<br />survival goals. In the instant case, the violence is directed<br />toward &quot;Piggy&quot; whose pleadings to move the group toward<br />constructive conflict resolution are ignored. Ultimately,<br />the group embraces &quot;the herd mentality&quot; until the consequences<br />of its murderous actions are irreversible. The chaos<br />seems to halt when an authority figure steps off a search<br />boat and views the scene for the first time. There are<br />many lessons to be learned from this work. These range from<br />group cooperation to the negative impact of group deviancy<br />from normal modes of civil conduct. The work is appropriate for<br />young teenagers, persons studying group dynamics and others<br />interested in quality English literature. The work is well<br />written. The sentence construction is good for a book depicting<br />small talk between and amongst typical teenage boys in middle<br />school. The work shows how groups deteriorate into destructive<br />behavioral modes when logical problem resolution fails to<br />produce generally acceptable alternatives.<br />A typical assignment might be to read this book and have<br />the class critique it in small groups of 4-5 students.<br />Participants could discuss control points surrounding the<br />breakdown of order, as well as alternative negotiation<br />strategies aimed at enhancing group cooperation/cohesion.ion is good for a book depicting<br />small talk between and amongst typical teenage boys in middle<br />school.

The work provides<br />an important perspective for future generations of historians.<br />He relates the details of a potential land deal involving<br />Russian territories offered to Hitler during the War. The book<br />contains many pictures of political figures in the previous<br />century.  Importantly, Khrushchev recited some regrets.<br />For instance, he regretted not supporting Pasternak.<br />\\" ... I feel sorry that I didn't support Pasternak. I regret that I had a hand in banning his book and that I supported<br />Suslov. We should have given the readers the opportunity to reach their own verdict. Judgments should depend on the readers.<br />I'm truly sorry for the way I behaved toward Pasternak. My only<br />excuse is that I didn't read the book.\\"<br />The book contains a very detailed history of Khrushchev's career<br />in the Appendix.  This work is a \\"must read\\" for serious<br />students of world history. It will be read for years to come<br />by historians throughout the world.

The author describes the good life, mastering<br />passions, personal unity, the true self and acceptance of<br />personal imperfections. The author believes that we must learn<br />to love or perish. He points to simple human needs consisting<br />of acceptance, approval and companionship. Democracy is<br />defined as tolerance in political relations. Insecurity is seen<br />as a manifestation of prior and perhaps continuing<br />inadequacies. The work encourages us to accept ourselves and<br />others with limitations and imperfections. The author<br />defines the inner human core of the soul, nervous system,<br />mind and an inner strength which binds the various<br />components. Finally, he encourages us to remove inner<br />insecurities by buttressing our individual and collective<br />self esteem.

There are many seamans' terms<br />and the colloquialisms are difficult to discern at times.<br />The overall thrust of the work is good because it portrays<br />life at sea which very few of us ever encounter to any<br />significant extent.  As such, this experience enriches us all.<br />Finally, the work raises some important questions about what we<br />should teach our children. Should children learn that life<br />consists only of pure pleasure?

This book is an excellent purchase for any first time buyers<br />of antiques. The work begins with a discussion of the factors<br />to be considered in an appraisal  i.e. material, origin,age,<br />size, condition and purpose/utilization. The author teaches<br />how to examine an antique by making mental notes and observing<br />important details; such as, carvings, initials etc. He provides<br />an example of the Gorham Company markings on objects. For<br />instance, a bell shape stamp means that the item was made<br />circa 1900. An item may have several valuations; namely,<br />retail value, cash value, liquidation value, replacement value<br />and the fair market value.

It covers<br />the management framework in the data center, systems development,<br />the program life cycle, database administration, operations<br />management, data capture, audit trail controls, evidence<br />collection and evaluation. The work is written from the EDP<br />professional's point of view. This text would complement a traditional auditing course by covering the EDP Audit component. It is a bit weak in the telecommunications area; however, the thrust of the work provides a solid foundation in the theory and practice of EDP Auditing for students studying the area for the first time. This book should be taught with a supplemental class project to help students understand how this theory is applied. I would suggest that the author consider an update of the current version to cover more theory of network administration.	2003-07-24

Burroughs has an almost perfect command<br />of the English language. Few words are wasted.  Every word<br />moves the reader onto the next until the full picture<br />becomes evident somewhere later in the story. I like<br />Burroughs because his writings have a solid grammatical<br />structure and advanced vocabulary. This is needed for<br />today's students because they struggle to articulate even<br />the most basic concepts.  Burroughs is not entirely<br />politically correct; however, his works are a treasure chest<br />of our language and what used to be called<br />&quot;The King's English&quot;  .	2003-07-23

The author enunciates a theme which<br />depicts tough economic circumstances for the intermediate<br />future. He states that our government will cut taxes to place<br />more money into the hands of individuals. In addition, he<br />believes that consumers will be more discriminating in their<br />purchases because they will have less money. I find that the<br />key to the future is an investment in a good education and the<br />development of a satisfying career. In addition, real estate<br />has always been the classic investment vehicle for the future.<br />Many other investments have been unpredictable but real estate<br />has consistently risen in practically every market.<br />This book will help you to craft an investment strategy far into<br />the future. It is not a cure-all; however, many of the key<br />investment factors are explained simply and in understandable<br />english.	2003-07-19

This text is a good general introduction<br />into the area of MIS. It explains basic definitions and<br />provides an organizational hierarchy or framework for<br />strategic systems, MIS, Knowledge-based systems and<br />artificial intelligence, operational systems etc.  It is a<br />good introduction to MIS because students need an overall<br />framework to apply the technology.  They cannot get this<br />framework from computer programming alone. The Laudon text<br />provides many diagrams, system flow charts, CD-ROM<br />supplements and a plethora of meaningful learning tools.<br />At the end of the work, the author includes a number of<br />fairly complicated case studies which provide random<br />operational facts which students must organize utilizing<br />the MIS technology taught in the Laudon text.

In primary and secondary school,   the emphasis is on sentence   construct.i.e. A good sentence   must have a subject, verb and   object.    Although students may learn   the mechanics of writing,they   do not pick up fine nuances   in literary expression. This work   forces the student to develop   a basic idea or theme.    Once developed the point of view   must be defended persuasively.  The thesis of the work is   contained somewhere in the first paragraph.  Sentences should be   simple and stated actively.    Finally, each work should be developed in successive drafts from the first   to the final draft. I've found that students have a problem differentiating literary criticism from a simple regurgitation of what they read.     The Practical Stylist helps to   focus each student's attention on enunciating criticism of a person   nature or within the experiential  domain of a first hand knowledge.   It's painful to learn to develop   quality literary criticism because   the primary and secondary education simply does not focus on this   aspect in any meaningful depth.	2003-07-13

I would supplement<br />this with a formal engineering review course and a reasonably<br />comprehensive text on organic chemistry. A strength of this text<br />is that it provides many practical examples.  It is highly<br />abbreviated in form.  I would utilize the contents to practice<br />a variety of problems customarily found on collegiate-level<br />examinations. The author has a detailed explanation of the<br />preferred solution set.

It is most helpful in assisting litigants with case<br />organization and presentation. The work explains how to document<br />a case throughout the various phases of a lawsuit with particular<br />emphasis on presentation of exhibits for trial.

The book could<br />be useful in organizing a case so that a lawyer could pick it<br />up at a later time.

Books	5	10	11	N	Y	FE Examination Preparation	The Potter text is excellent. The author focuses on the subject matter of the exam from the outset. The coverage of higher math, statics, dynamics, materials science and chemistry is comprehensive. I would supplement this work with the Lindberg book and REA for thermodynamics. My own background is heavy industrial engineering-type courses with more higher math than most engineers are required to take. In addition, I have a good computer background which is helpful on this exam. There comes a point where examination testing technique enters into the picture. This book helps in that regard because there are hundreds of pertinent problems. Additionally, it helps to read the reference guide carefully because some questions are derived from that guide. Some of the operational amps questions can get tricky so I would study this area carefully. It is to your advantage to emphasize strength areas prior to the 2 month study period preceding this exam. Once you get into the study period, it is important to study exclusively weak areas. Near the end of the study session, it is helpful to hammer away at all of the subjects repeatedly until they become second nature.I just passed<BR>the October 2001 rendition of the FE Examination-General section.	2001-08-24

The data employed is current &amp; this version is supported by the publisher in various prior versions , as well as, this successive version. The work has considerable technological support in the form of the CD Rom and various instructional materials.The authors provide a useful &quot;News Analysis&quot; to integrate current events into the text. This is very useful in providing background information for students. The problem sets are topical and challenging. There is a considerable discussion of international economics and transitional economies. Overall, the text can satisfy a wide range of student interests. i.e. Those students having a quantitative orientation will appreciate the considerable graphs throughout the text. Students having a more visual learning experience will enjoy the various news items throughout the text &amp; the extensive discussion of basic definitions. The chapter summaries and WEB exercises are helpful in integrating the material &amp; applying the various concepts using current technologies. This text should be employed for intensive renditions of introductory economics at the collegiate level.There is an appropriate amount of microeconomic coverage in the Principles of Macroeconomics, as well as, the more comprehensive Principles of Economics work. After having read this book, students should have a firm grasp of economics and the various data employed by industry. In addition, students will become more knowledgable on current events applicable to studies in this field. This work would provide very helpful background for further studies in Price Analysis and Econometrics (Mathematical Economics).	2001-08-24

This work is complete as to its coverage of the various diseases and modalities to treat them. When a patient encounters a serious illness, the keyword is protocol.  Very often, there are multiple protocols for the same illness and the patient/doctor must sort through this maze. The Burton Goldberg volume helps tremendously in this effort. As people get older, they no longer get diseases that go away overnight.  People tend to have conditions that require ongoing maintenance.  The combinatorial impact of many different medications taken at the same time can be detrimental to the kidneys. Therefore, the alternative medicine protocols provide a mechanism to address the medicinal issues with substances that the body recognizes organically. In addition, this volume cites the medical experts in the different areas. It describes the biology of the disease  processes in a way that is understandable to a novice. This work is a worthy investment for any personal library. People spend money on many frivolous things very often ignoring the future of their health. This work helps to craft a personal health plan/outline for the future by  presenting comparative protocols in understandable english.	2001-08-05

It has an easy-to-read treatment of basic probability with a gradual introduction into conditional prob. The coverage of mean, variance, weighted mean and the standard deviation is good. I was impressed with the explanation of the z statistic and hypothesis testing. The author had a good  rendition of regression and correlation in single, as well as, multiple models. The style of this work is a belles lettres<br />treatment-almost akin to reading a story. Despite the simplicity, there is enough complexity for the quantitatively oriented readers. I would like to see an update of this book with some cross-referencing to the internet and more modern terminology. Despite the fact that it is an older work, there are few books which explain the material with the clarity of this text. Its weaknesses may be overcome by utilizing the REA Statistics or the Schaum's outline. This book is excellent for students who find math hard to comprehend. It serves all levels of students from the most advanced to the students requiring more time with the material.	2001-02-06

It is easy to read and the work may be supplemented with outside lectures. Students can achieve a good understanding of the subject in a short period of time. This work could be updated to reflect the technological  innovations of the internet etc. In addition, the work could contain an appendix referencing the area of mathematical economics. Lastly, the author should provide more notes on  classical economists.	2000-11-07

The text is an improvement over prior texts by the REA. All the areas contain more topical material. I've passed AM twice and these problems look good. My concern is the PM which is a bit more slippery. This book alone  will not suffice for PM; however, it's a good starter for PM-GENERAL. The Potter text and the sample exams<br />available with the registration materials provide a better profile<br />of the PM component of the examination.	1999-07-24
