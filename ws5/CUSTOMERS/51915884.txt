She was a mechanic in the police garage, when the chief took the opportunity to get a Native American woman in his department(Joanne, aka Siohoban Walkingstick is half Irish and half Cherokee), so Jo went to the academy, graduated and went back to the garage.  She is in trouble with the new chief, because she left to spend time with the mother in Ireland that abandoned her as an infant, and instead of staying her allotted 6 weeks, she stayed four months.  While on the plane, she sees a woman being stalked by a man with a knife.  She leaves her luggage at the airport and goes to save her.  Turns out Marie is a banshee, and Joanne's death is predicted.  The god of the Great Hunt tries to oblige, but fails.  A serial killer connected to him somehow is killing people in Seattle.  The supernatural powers that be insist that Joanne be the one to stop him.  Joanne isn't so sure, up until now, she has shown no shamanistic powers and doesn't know how to use them.  Looks like a learning experience for everyone.    Urban Shaman is a really fast moving paranormal.  The author blends Celtic and Native American lore very skillfully.  The idea of a petulant Herne, and his father, the Lord of the Great Hunt running amok in a modern city leaves the author many opportunities for good plot twists and she really does a good job. Also well done are the interactions between Joanne and Chief Morrison, Gary the elderly but not old cabbie, Herne, and the Lord of the Hunt. This is a series that I will keep reading.	2005-09-15

Detective Leo O'Grady is determined not to let another die at the hands of the Claddagh killer, and a fierce attraction develops.<br /><br />This book was much better than I expected.  The author blends the elements of the paranormal, mystery, and romance with great skill.  The characters and plot twists are very well done.

Mia Snow is a Hunter.  She hunts predatory aliens in the city of New Chicago, in an alternate reality.  She and her partner Dallas, are assigned to a homicide in an area called Whore's Corner.  The victim is male, naked, drained of blood, and has his hand tied to his penis with a blue ribbon.  Mia smells Onadyn in the air, a drug used by the alien Arcadians to process oxygen.  Her hunt for the alien responsible, leads her to the Club Extasy and Lilla, an Arcadian with strong mind control powers.  She escapes.  They find her at the house of another A.I.R. agent, and take them all in.  The agent's daughter, her mind controlled by an Arcadian, shoots Dallas and leaves him close to death. <br /> <br />Kyrin was present at the club and has been speaking to Mia in her mind.  He apparently has the power to save Dallas, but will only help in exchange for the release of his sister Lilla.  Mia will do anything to help her friend, but is unwilling to release a supposedly predatory alien without finding the real killer.  People are disappearing at an alarming rate, and the only link seems to be a fertility clinic and another Arcadian named Atlanna.  Atlanna seems very familiar to Mia. <br /> <br />This was a really good book, though not at all like Showalter's other works.  The characters are very realistic and well developed.  The relationship between Mia and Kyrin is gripping.  Once I started this book, I didn't put it down until it was finished.	2005-06-06

Unfortunately, shortly after Jolie really gets into the spirit of the FWC, her husband is murdered, and his penis cut off and missing.  More unfortunately, Jake is the detective assigned to the case.  She never fell out of love with him and he apparently feels the same way.  In spite of an ironclad alibi, she really LOOKS guilty.<br /><br />I loved this book!!!  The members of the FWC are very vivid and funny.  The author enabled you to really get into the story.  You get annoyed at Jake, hate Chris, and feel sympathy for all the future widows.  I will definitely be looking to read more books by this author.	2005-06-01

Truth to tell, she misses her roommate's couch more that either of them, but she vows to stay away from gorgeous men from then on.  Enter Justin, the new photographer for the company catalogue.  Not only is he gorgeous, but Olivia has to work very closely with him.  In spite of his looks, they get to know each other and Olivia finds out that Justin is more than just a pretty face.  Justin, who thought that he wanted bachelor freedom after ten years of raising his younger sisters, finds out that he really just wants Olivia.<br /><br />This is a nice quick read.  The love scenes are pretty steamy, and the story line is a little predictable, but entertaining.	2005-05-25

She defended a man accused of brutal rapes, because she thought he was innocent.  He was acquitted and shortly after, another woman was not only raped, but killed.  Her guilt led her to turn her back on that aspect of the law and join the FBI.  A few years later, her father is diagnosed with cancer and she has to come back to take over the firm.  Also, murders very similar to the case that ended her career, have occurred and once again the Paxton firm is defending the accused.  The victims in both cases share one characteristic, they all look just like Lindsey.  She asks the man who replaced her, Mark Reeves for his help, in spite of the fact that he left the firm under less than friendly circumstances.  A relationship developes while they hunt down a killer. <br /> <br />I am familiar with Ms. Jones' work and have always enjoyed her ebooks. This book is a little bit of a departure in that it is longer and more involved.  Her characters are for the most part well developed, the main ones, a few peripheral characters could use a little filling out.  The story line was engrossing.  Hopefully, this will be the first in a long line of novels. <br /> <br />	2005-04-12

She doesn't look at herself in the mirror, but searches behind her for something she can't identify.  She goes to the Killbourne estate for a sale and finds the mirror that she has been looking for her whole life.  That evening, one of the Killbournes, Peter, shows up at her apartment wanting to buy the mirror.  Peter is murdered that night, sweeping her into many more mysteries than those found in the mirror. <br /> <br />I would compare this book to some of the older Barbara Michaels books, romance and paranormal blended beautifully.  The various characters were very realistic, and there is a twist at the end.	2005-02-17

This is not the best book that Miranda Lee has written for Harlequin, but it meets all of the criteria.  It is a fast read and entertaining.  Paige is indeed a poor rich girl.  Her father doesn't show her any love and she is tormented by an ugly(in appearance and spirit) housekeeper, who spies on everyone in the household.  She has a teenage crush on her father's assistant and when she tells him about it, is so humiliated by both Antonio and the housekeeper, that she runs away and moves in with a surf bum.  Her father keeps and eye on her through a private investigator and is further disappointed by what he observes over the years.  Appearances can be deceiving.  Now Paige arrives back home with a bruise on her face from a disappointed lover that she only moved in with that day.  Her father decides that his assistant Antonio should marry Paige and he will make him CEO of the company.  Antonio is wary of Paige's past but attracted to her none the less, so he agrees to seduce and marry her.  Little does he know that he really doesn't know as much about Paige as he or her father thinks!! <br /> <br />Like I said previously, this is a light entertaining romance, not the saga of the century, but it is very enjoyable.	2005-02-04

The FBI's SCU unit headed by Noah Bishop sends Isabel, a claivoyant and Hollis, a medium to investigate.  As in most of Hooper's novels, the lead psychic makes a connection with a local person, in this case the sheriff, Rafe.  Rafe is a latent psychic who confuses the case by creating a shield around Isabel, effectively blocking her abilities. The question is, will they be able to circumvent this problem to find the killer. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed this novel and would have given it five stars, but it just didn't stand on it's own enough.  I feel as if I am missing something because I haven't read each of the preceding books.  It really didn't detract much, just enough to annoy me a little, until the other books arrive. <br /> <br />	2005-02-03

It was very hard to wait for this novel, but it was worth waiting for.  Fran Cahill is the daughter of one of the wealthiest men in NY at the turn of the century.  She is engaged to an even wealthier and more powerful man.  They have a bit of a conflict over the fact that she had been in love with his biggest rival, his half brother, who just happens to be the Police Commissioner of NYC.  Fran and Rick have solved quite a few crimes together, and still work together, in spite of strain over her recent engagement, and his injured wife. <br /> <br />This latest story involves a killer called the Slasher, who kills young women of Irish descent.  One of the victims lives near Fran's friend Maggie Kennedy's home.  She fears that Maggie and another acquaintance from a previous case, could become victims also.  The murder mystery is full of twists and turns and possible murderers.  Bragg's problems within the Police Department continue to evolve, Chief Farr is a definite problem.  Calder's reputation endangers the engagement, Mr. Cahill is very much against it.  Daisy Jones, the former mistress causes alot of trouble also.  All in all this one is one of the best of the series.  I couldn't put it down once I started it, unfortunately, it will be a long time before the next one.	2005-01-31

There is a serial killer targeting humans on the reservation, so interspecies law enforcement is called in.  Unfortunately, the lead investigator Cade Jones, is a man from her distant past.  She was involved in what amounted to a cult of werewolves and half breeds connected to a serial killer very much like the present one.  Cade was undercover at the time and a very young Savannah thought that she was in love with him.  They are very bitter now, but Cade uses the remaining time on an old moon promise to force Savannah to play by his rules to catch a vicious killer. <br /> <br />While not as good as Beneath a Rising Moon(which would be very difficult), I really enjoyed this trip back to the werewolves' world.  There is alot of action and very vivid characters as well as a good mystery, also I really enjoyed finding out all of Savannah's secrets, since she hinted at them so much in the previous book.  Great Story!!	2005-01-13

He is on his way to the castle at Beal when he runs into Birdalane, a spae.  Pretty much without thinking about it, he tries to save her from her pet wolf and thinking her gravely injured, takes he with him.  They have a few adventures and fall in love, even though neither one wants to be tied to the other.  Angus has to have his castle and Birdi has her own reasons.   <br /> <br />The various characters are vivid and amusing and the story line makes the book very hard to put down.  Only one criticism, a glossary of medieval Scottish words would have helped greatly, at times the dialog can make you so wode you want to greet.  Otherwise a really great book.	2004-12-30

This book is a bit formulaic, woman wakes up with a strange man(innocently of course), man wants woman to \\"pose as his fiancee\\" to relieve the mind of his sick grandfather, and we have a romance novel.

In the course of things, she finds out that the stranger, Drake Vireo, is a wyvyrn of the Green Dragons and that he thinks that she is his mate.  Everyone also thinks that she is one of the Guardians of the Portals of Hell, and when she tries to use this to raise a demon to help her, she ends up with the only demon ever to be thrown out of Hell and stripped of his powers, so what good is this Guardian stuff anyway?  All she wants is her dragon(the gold one not the green one) and to go home. <br /> <br />This book is typical of the author.  She takes a serious aspect of horror fiction and makes you laugh out loud.  The characters are well developed and the story line has me reading until way past my bed time.

Worse, her ex boyfriend, the one that stood her up at her elopement, is presiding over the funeral and her uncle's will.  Things get stranger when Aunt Lucy disappears, Stella gets arrested and all hell breaks loose. <br /> <br />Fans of the Stephanie Plum novels will love this fast moving story.

Lily finds herself strangely attracted to Rule, even though she finds him in a sleazy club with women hanging all over him, including one from a bad period in her past.  Lily is also a sensitive, meaning that she can sense and identify different kinds of magic.  The killings are more than just a werewolf gone mad, the problem is much much bigger. <br /> <br />This book was inspired by a short story in the Lover Beware anthology, but the story line is completely different.  The characters are very real and the descriptions of the settings very good, very much needed in these alternate reality type books.  I waited a long time for this book and was not disappointed.  This is the start of a very good series and I can't wait for the next one.	2004-10-18

It turns out he is distracted by her also, and they seek to fix the problem with one night to get each other out of their systems. The problem is one night won't do it. <br /> <br />This is a fun romance novel that reads quickly in spite of the trade paperback size.

She is a successful interior designer, with her work published in several magazines, and she is marrying a handsome wealthy banker in the morning, after she gets through this nightmare rehearsal dinner.  When a drunken guest gives her a margarita shower, she rushes off to clean up.  As she passes the boardroom door, she hears the distinctive sounds of her fiance and her maid of honor \\"doing it\\" inside, she opens the door, catches them in the act and throws a hissy fit that will go down in the history of Madison, Georgia.  Naturally, the wedding is off, but for some reason, everyone except for her family and a few others, blame Keely.  To top it all off, the family of the almost groom are trying to run her and her aunt out of business.  Into this mess walks, Will Mahoney.  He has bought the local bra plant and plans to bring it back to prosperity.  He has also bought a local plantation house and wants Keely to restore and decorate it for him and his future bride.  The problem is, he hasn't actually met her yet and doesn't exactly know her tastes.  He saw her on a PBS pledge drive and fell in love.  Since the Murdochs business is not exactly booming, they take on the job and its crazy deadline and get to work.  <br /> <br />The plots, subplots and characters of the novel are all wound together wonderfully.  I love the southern setting and the quirky characters of the story.  They all seem very real.  This story has it all, humor, romance, mystery and a great cast of characters.	2004-09-17

Against everyone's advice, she gets her dream job, selling shoes at Macy's in the Mall of America.  She gets first viewing of the new styles and a discount, Betsy is in heaven, or she would be if the vampires would just leave her alone.  A local anti vampire group, The Blade Warriors are executing vampires and have attacked her friend Tina and a new arrival Monique.  After healing Tina, Betsy agrees to help Eric find and stop the vampire killer.  Betsy's housemates in the meantime, have bought a huge mansion, haunted by a little girl that only Betsy sees.  <br /> <br />This book is just as funny and hard to put down as Undead and Unwed.  Ms. Davidson never fails to make me laugh out loud whenever I read one of her books and this is one of her better ones.  Her characters are funny and vivid and the situations Betsy finds herself in are hilarious as is her quest for the newest shoe styles.	2004-08-09

Olivia Peters is a Bereavement Counselor, she works for a funeral home named Forever Crossed.  Briefly, a bereavement counselor sees the the circumstances of a person's death and comforts the survivors  (or helps the homicide investigation).  She is also the only known survivor of a wereleopard attack to not either die or become a shapeshifter herself.  Her boss assigns her to work with the ruler of the Vampires, Antonio.  He is trying to find a rogue Vamp who is killing vamps and humans in his territory of the Triangle.  Coincidently, she is also retained by the local police to investigate the same case.  The shaman of the local wereleopards was the latest victim, so their Ra Jahn is also involved and a mutual attraction is formed. <br /> <br />  The book is filled with action and very vivid characters.  The author has created a very believable alternate reality.  The world that the vampires and weres live in is very well drawn and you can easily picture it.  The love scenes were very well done, and there are others that are as interesting as Luka.  This book is a definite must for fans of Anita Blake, but Olivia is a much less dark and more likable character.  She is better adjusted and not a dark personality.  I definitely recommend this one and can't wait until the next.	2004-08-09

Lately, she seems to be having a huge run of bad luck and only gets cases that beginners are assigned.  As luck would have it, she is assigned to execute a warrant on a leprechaun.  A pixie named Jenks is her backup, the fairies won't work with her anymore.  She runs into a vampire colleague at the leprechaun's place of business and somehow at the end of it, they all quit IS, and each have a wish.  Ivy, the vampire, and Jenks are free and clear of their contracts, but Rachel has a death threat issued on her until she pays off her IS contract.   <br /> <br />She sees a way to make this happen.  All she has to do is prove that a prominent councilman is running illegal brimstone, easier said than done.  The adventures that the trio have during the case make this book very hard to put down.  The next one should be even better since all the major characters have been introduced and described.  This is a great read, I started it and didn't put it down until I got to the last page. <br /> <br />	2004-07-23

Thank goodness for the GPS and apartment key in the truck Ranger loaned her.  He is away for a couple of weeks, so she should be safe in the Bat Cave, or so she thinks. <br />This is a fast moving story with bizarre and funny characters.  This one is fun but doesn't develope the relationships between the characters much.  I agree with Ranger, Stephanie is very entertaining.	2004-06-29

A computer genius and former FBI agent is hired by the man who didn't stand by her when she was drummed out of the Bureau on trumped up murder charges.  She now works for a private security firm and Calder Preston asks for her help in a case.  She has to investigate a woman named Hope Enslar, head of R &amp; D for a large car manufacturer.  The job is really just a reason for Calder to recontact Raine.  He is looking for a way back into her life and is as surprised as Raine when the case connects to a very real and dangerous one.  Calder has to make the decision whether to stick by Raine at the expense of his career this time or turn away like he has done before.<br />This was a very fast moving suspense novel with a lot of twists and turns and emotional drama.  I particularly liked the references to the movie, To Catch a Thief.  Raine is the daughter of a socialite and a former jewel thief named John Robey.  A very good read and I expect to enjoy the next one just as much.	2004-06-09

Not as simple as it looks.  The healer Doreen, is the daughter of a deceased religous fanatic, who lived in Zinnia until her death in a fire 12 years before.  There are many intertwining plot lines, much like Sarah Booth's love life.  Coleman is still sort of in the picture, with his manipulative wife pulling his strings and Hamilton returns with the intention of taking Sarah Booth back to Paris with him.  Aunt Jitty doesn't play as big a part in this one as the others, but CeCe and Tinkie really make up the difference.  I hope the next one comes out quickly.	2004-05-28

Apparently, every person who even thought that they might be related to the man has tried to collect his/her &quot;fair share&quot; of the wealth.  The slimey attorney in charge of the inheritance sees this as many billable hours and is encouraging them.  Cally's mother feels that she is entitled to the money, even though she divorced Wilde for his partner before he made all his money.  She, in turn, has convinced her son from her second marriage that Cally has cheated them of their rightful wealth.  It is no wonder that Cally has a hard time letting people get close to her and is a disaster in her love life.<br />If this isn't all bad enough, someone is trying to kill her and the obvious suspects are all related to her!  On the other hand, the detective assigned to the case is very attractive and seems to find her attractive also.  He will not act on this until the case is closed, which is an additional incentive to find the culprit.<br />I was very impressed with this first effort.  There was plenty of action, the characters are very well developed and I had a really hard time putting the book down.  I can't wait to read the next one.	2004-05-13

After a short time she accepts, and the events leading up to the wedding are hilarious.<br />Ms. Davidson's novels are always alot of fun and I really couldn't find out much about this one before I bought it.

It is soon found out that another child in a nearby community has also been abducted.  Are the two cases connected?  Detective Maggie Ryan must sort out all of the facts and finds that there are many secrets in the small community, including her own abuse as a child.<br />The author writes a gripping story about the kidnapping and murder of a small child.  The Ryan character filters her perception of the events through her own history of child abuse and is a very sympathetic character.  The author packs alot into a short novel.	2004-04-20

While it was nice to see the four main characters again, the story line was not as strong as usual.  This is not to say that I didn't like the book.  Susan, Jed, Kathleen, and Jerry go to a Carribbean island for a vacation.  Jerry and Kathleen seem to be having marital problems.  It turns out that his ex sister in law is on the island also.  She tells everyone that she is having an affair with Jerry.  She also tells every one that she will die a tragic death.  She does.  Jerry is arrested.  Everyone expects Susan to clear him.<br />The characters as usual, are very interesting and well developed.  The mystery is problematic. All of a sudden they all want Susan to solve the crime.  Other than Kathleen, everyone discouraged her before.  The other thing that bothers me is that Jerry wanders off for hours at a time and no one questions him at all?  I just didn't get it.  Hopefully the next one will be back to usual.	2004-03-12

The horse set is known for all kinds of extremes and many are found here.  The main character, Elena Estes, is a former detective.  As a narcotics officer, a bad decision cost a colleague his life, and she lost her job, her self esteem, her looks, and sometimes, she thinks, her sanity.  After months in the hospital and rehab, she takes refuge in her first love, horses.  Her childhood friend and fellow rebel against well to do parents owns a successful horse farm and needs someone to work a few of his horses.  He allows her to stay in his guest house.  A young girl, seeing her picture in a horse publication, identified as a private investigator, tries to hire her to find her missing sister.<br />This is a very well developed novel.  In the beginning, I felt little sympathy for Elena.  The author makes you identify with her feelings for herself.  As her self confidence and sense of self worth improve, so does the reader's opinion of Elena.  Combine this with a really good mystery, and this is one of the best books I have read this year.	2004-03-10

Neva infiltrates the stronghold of the silver werewolves and becomes involves with one of them to further her investigation.  It quickly becomes apparent that both she and Duncan are in danger from the murderer.<br />Ms. Arthur has created a werewolf society similar to, but very different from out own.  The characters of Neva and Duncan are very well drawn and the romance elements very good.  The mystery is interesting.  I can't wait for the sequel.	2004-02-23

The characters are well developed and the story line full of twists and turns.  She just doesn't have a real feel for the ethnicity of the characters, or so I feel.  In spite of claims by some of the characters that they are not, she paints the Irish as revolutionaries to a man, most of them violent.  Other than that, I recommend the book.	2004-02-10

This novel is less a mystery and more an in depth look at the alternate reality that Hamilton created in her first book.  Although it is not my favorite of the series, I wouldn't have missed this one for anything.  Merry and her Ravens' characters are further developed, and Merry is sent back to the Unseelie court, where we get a more in depth look at life there.  I was a little uncomfortable with the lesbian overtones in two of the scenes, and the violence is much more explicit in this novel than the previous two, but the book was a very enjoyable read none the less.  The next one should be very interesting.	2004-02-10

There is alot of background information in the beginning of Sunshine's story.  She lives in a sort of parallel world to ours.  She works at the family's bakery/cafe and reportedly makes the world's best cinnamon rolls.  She has a warm family, a biker boyfriend, and a killer work schedule.  One night she drives out to her family's former vacation cabin to think and gets kidnapped by a gang of vampires.  They chain her within reach of a very hungry looking and also chained vampire.  They escape and together try to defeat a very nasty master vampire.  <br />The characters are very colorful, half demons, vampires, weres and magic handlers.  I would have liked to have learned much more about all of them, but I probably wouldn't have been able to lift the book if the author had gone into any more detail.  All I can say is that I hope there is a sequel.  There are a few matters hinted at that need further clarification.	2003-12-17

Burning Water is entertaining but much less vivid than the Blake books, most obviously Obsidian Butterfly.

A national specialty is a huge event that draws people from all over the country.  Naturally Aunt Peg is involved in the planning and Melanie is drafted into helping out with the raffle.  The two odd sisters that run the raffle are interesting, they have a dog that is a contender for the best in show prize, although another exhibitor will do anything to stop them.  One of the sisters is found dead on the grounds of the hotel, and whether or not it is murder is up to the police, and Melanie to decide and solve.<br />This latest in the Melanie Travis series was alot of fun.  The descriptions of a large dog show are right on, down to the snobbish attitude of the breed exhibitors towards the obedience competitors (Terry makes a particularly nasty and inappropriate remark here, but some breed people are like that, thank goodness not all).  Melanie and Sam's relationship is touched on, nice to see it back on track.  The solution to the mystery is not readily apparent, lots of red herrings.  All in all, another great mystery.	2003-09-27

Her daughter is either distant or angry and she is responsible for her semisenile cantankerous mother in law.  The obvious solution (to her), is to have Parker declared dead and use his insurance money to keep their heads above water.  Unfortunately, a former cop and supposed tennis partner of Parker's is taking a very close interest in Mary Bliss, both personally and professionally.<br />I really enjoyed this author's first book and was happy to find a second.  Her characters find their way out of difficult situations in very unusual and amusing ways.  I hope she publishes another one soon.	2003-08-06

The boyfriend strikes up a friendship with Ivan, the son of Carol's father's paramour, and the trip seems to disintegrate from there.

The boyfriend strikes up a friendship with Ivan, the son of Carol's father's paramour, and the trip seems to disintegrate from there.  His previously mild drug habit becomes worse and a strange man seems to be following Carol. <br />There are a few unexplained plot points and loose ends here, and the language is a bit dated, but this is an entertaining book, good for the beach.	2003-07-01

She is breaking in a new partner (human) when a werewolf serial killer strikes the town.  It is imperative that humans are not made aware of the existence of werewolves, and that they capture this rogue before she kills again.<br />This was an entertaining and action packed novel.  I found myself reading far longer than I wanted to find out who the killer was and why.  The characters were a little flat and did not really hold my interest, fortunately, the murder mystery was engrossing.	2003-05-06

The subplots of Amy's brother Paul and his pregnant wife Marcie, and Jake the thrall and Amy's best friend Sophie are equally interesting.  I can't wait to find out more about the &quot;faerie godmother&quot; who reappears throughout the novel.

Lori's husband Bill informs her that he is one of the Earl's lawyers and they were going already.  Lori and Emma wonder what other surprises are in store for them, and what secrets of the past will be revealed.<br />This is one of my favorite series and I always look forward to the next.  Although a little short for my taste, this is a wonderful cozy.  Derek's background was always a mystery, and everything is explained in this novel, Nell is featured as usual, and we see a little more of Peter, who has been largely invisible since, Aunt Dimity and the Duke, which is a shame.

He follows her home, she finds him passed out on the side of the road.  Dr. Schell runs a private mental hospital and takes him in to treat his dipsomania.  It turns out that this is not his only problem, and she resolves to treat that as well.  Their relationship developes at a strange pace from there.  Someone from the past is trying to disturb the Haven as well.<br />This is not of the same caliber as the earlier novels.  I really didn't approve of the way Quentin cured everyone's ills.  It was too simplistic.  Overall, it was an enjoyable book, but I was hoping for more.	2003-01-16

The characters are very real and so are their interactions and problems.  The murderer is somewhat difficult to identify, but it all comes together in the end.

Another medium is also murdered and Fremont wonders if it is a trend and if Frances' brutal husband is involve.<br />The two plotlines of this novel blend beautifully.  The murder mystery was a little more difficult than most, maybe because I was distracted by Fremont's reunion with her father.  This is the best of the series so far.	2002-10-22

The marquess is found in a shallow grave intended for one of the Duchess's many dogs, but the letter is not on the body. Brummell promises to retrieve the letter and solve the murder.<br />I really liked the first two books in the series, but this one tended to drag until the middle.  Once the Lavenders made their appearance the story line picked up considerably.  I guess the idea of Beau Brummell and the Duchess of York in love is way too far fetched for me.  The mystery progresses nicely once everyone is back in London and the conclusion is as unexpected as it is neatly accomplished.	2002-10-09

A new woman in town suggests that they stage a series of fake crimes to get him back, it works.  Mrs. Baird is something of a femme fatale, encased in a layer of fat.  She is a former professional hussy and has amassed a fortune with her looks.  She has taken in a niece recovering from cancer, and turned her into a secretary, unpaid of course.  When she goes away to restore her looks, her niece is charged with typing up her filthy memoirs.  The girl wants to learn how to drive and to get a proper job, but Mrs. Baird forbids it.  Hamish teaches her to drive and she is feeling independent until her aunt returns home and announces that she is getting married again and cutting the niece out of her will.  She is killed shortly thereafter and the niece and Mrs. Baird's four suitors are the main suspects.<br />This is a typical Hamish McBeth book.  The mystery isn't difficult, but the characters and story line are alot of fun.	2002-10-06

Unfortunately, she had to leave the love of her life behind in NY.  Her daughter is also away at school in Georgetown.  The putative new head of the English Department is hitting on her, at least until she finds his body at the College holiday party.  He has been a busy boy, did any of his enthusiasms cause his untimely demise.<br />This is becoming a favorite series of mine.  The academic atmosphere is very real without being too stuffy.  The professors are as quirky as in real life and Piotrowski is very human.  Great series.	2002-10-06

It was based on a true scandal in a college town.  The author disappeared a few years later never to be heard from again.  After the interview, sales of the book skyrocketed, and the reporter searched for Mildred Deakens, the author.  He found her and ended up dead in her driveway.  Millie was arrested, but claims to be innocent.  Letters from her to Karen have been stolen, and there are rumors about her and a visiting writer.<br />This is a very good addition to the series.  All of the characters from the previous novels have been developed more fully and so has Karen's relationship with Lt. Piotrowski.  I really loved this one and finished it in one sitting.	2002-10-06

She was not willing to become his companion, and he really didn't want one, which leads to many complications.  When someone starts killing vampires and leaving them for humans to find, he actually suspects her.  A very old vampire from Istvan's past has designs on her cousin, so Selena enlists the help of a group of unwilling companions to save her, since Istvan is gone, or is he?<br />This is an even better novel than the one before.

Once imprisoned by a witch and tortured by demons, she managed to kill one of them, and developed new powers.  Followers of the witch are all around her, as is Lothar, another half elven prince determined to possess her.  He is a dark healer and needs her to inherit his father's kingdom.  Apparently there is some sort of competition between him and a brother.  This novel is very entertaining, not up to her later standards, but excellent.

You can't judge a book by its cover apparently.   A new vampire has gone missing and a serial killer is operating in Seattle.  There seems to be a connection, so Char, a new Enforcer is sent to solve the problem.  She is also assigned to kill a vampire hunter by the head Enforcer Istvan.  Jebel Haven and his partner were hired by the baby vamp's mother to find him also, so they are also in Seattle.  Char finds that she needs his help to kill the demon and sorcerer who hold the vampire, and who are behind the murders.  She is not sure that she will be able to kill him when the job is done, and he can't seem to hate her like he hates all the other vampires.<br />This was a pretty entertaining book.  The Enforcer concept is interesting and the novel was full of suspense.  Good read.	2002-09-23

They find a town divided between the &quot;chubs&quot; or locals and the incomers who think they know all there is to know about the town.  The body turns out to be the missing wife of a failed businessman of the area, and of course, he is the prime suspect.  Soon after he turns up dead and the mystery deepens.  The danger also increases for Jude and Carole, and they must find the murderer before he or she finds them.<br />This is a very good series.  The retired civil servant and the new age healer make a very good team.

Both her work and her lifestyle guaranteed her the attention of the world.  Mr. Kurth's biography brings the innovative dancer back to life clarifying many details at the same time.  Ms. Duncan tended to either gloss over or sensationalize various aspects of her history and this book separates fact from fantasy.  The photographs are very good, as is the narrative.	2002-09-20

The proprietress has designs on Luciano, and Titus is using his computer to make clones.  Pandora is upset about leaving Multitudina and Tarantella behind.  Then, there is the mystery of the Strega Borgia diamond.  <br />This is a really great book for both children and adults.  It makes bedtime stories a little more fun for everyone.	2002-09-20

Together they search for the creature and his master before all hell breaks loose.<br />I was pleasantly surprised by this mystery.  The characters are very vivid and the story moves quickly.  Henry is not the typical vampire of this genre.  He seems to live a fairly normal writer's life(if only at night) and is more or less mild mannered.  This is definitely a worthwhile series.	2002-09-18

Emily is having a crisis of her own, her agent is not returning her calls, she can't sell a script, her lovelife is a shambles, and she is running out of money.  <br />This book follows both of them as they find themselves in the most unrealistic place in the world.  Maggie is not too believable as a good girl gone crazy, but you want to believe.  It has a happy ending and passes the time, but I don't think I would buy another in this series.	2002-09-16

While she was away, the boys have had their positions challenged, Jean Claude has handled it, but Richard is having difficulty.  The new Nimiraj seems too perfect and has secrets, and his pard is nearly as damaged as Anita's.  Anita must mend her relationships and is worried that she might become furry herself on the next full moon.<br />This novel opens up many possibilities for the future.  Micah is an interesting addition. La Belle Morte seems to be interested in the triumvirate.  Asher's character is becoming more interesting. Jean Claude's character is also developing nicely.  I also liked the new assortment of werecharacters.  The next novel should be very interesting.	2002-09-09

People are being torn apart, the lucky ones are skinned alive and live, or do they.  Edward's alter ego, Ted Forrester, also has a few other surprises for Anita, he has a fiancee with two children.  She never knew Death had a life!<br />This novel was very exciting.  It was nice to take a break from her problems with Richard and Jean Claude for a brief time only.  The characters are very vivid and just as scary as previous novels.  I think Edward's human friends are even scarier.  Olaf could give Hannibal Lecter a run for his money.	2002-09-09

With the full moon only five days away, Anita and a few of the monsters rush down to save him.  The master of the city will not allow Jean Claude, so Anita is basically on her own.  As usual Richard is no help.  There is alot more going on here than is obvious.  People are being found ripped apart and the attacks are blamed on trolls, even though trolls don't kill.  A rich man is trying to buy the trolls habitat to look for holy relics, and the local master is very angry and scared of the Executioner.  On a good note, a local witch seems to understand some of Anita's problems and is willing to help.<br />This as usual was a very gripping novel.  Anita is trying to balance the hit man with all of her new responsibilities.  Jean Claude helps when it helps him, and Richard is more of a selfish baby than ever.

Dr. Hart has left a strange will, she left 10 million and the mansion to Enfield College with the condition that Karen run the new Northbury Center for Women's Literature.  This makes many very unhappy, was one of them the murderer?<br />This was a very quick moving novel.  I liked the characters, for the most part, they were real people, not dry academics, like many of this genre.  Karen is not your typical English professor. The author is very good at intertwining the various plots.  Very good mystery.	2002-09-09

But, he never let anyone else talk and bullied anyone else who tried.  Hamish caught him dropping a retired schoolteacher into the water and tried to stop him.  He ended up challenged to a fight that would only lose him his job and possibly a few teeth.  On the day of the fight, however, Randy didn't show.

All of the guests band together against him(a good thing because the inn is pretty terrible).  Bob ends up dead, and Hamish discovers that his fellow holiday makers aren't all that they seem.<br />This was a refreshing break from Lochdubh.

One day Petra disappears and is found dead by the gravel quarry with an apple in her mouth.  It is up to Hamish to solve the crime, and Priscilla's business.<br />This is a very funny mystery.

Mrs X is a self centered would be artist and trophy wife.  She needs to spend all of her time in empty pursuits and little time with her son.  Mr. X is a philandering no show.  From what I have heard, there is alot of truth to Nanny's story. The author manages to make her plight entertaining.  Fortunately for her there is a light at the end of the tunnel.  She is earning her degree at NYU and has a good job offing in the not too distant future.  I loved her descriptions of the registration process at NYU.  I spent my grad school years there and had to fight to register every time.  Apparently someone with a similar name never paid their tuition, and it was too much trouble for the bursars to get the accounts right.  I wondered if Nanny had enough ID to get through the process.  Nanny also had the advantage of coming from a similar social strata as the X's.  Many of the nannies are immigrants, legal and illegal who don't have families nearby to back them up.  The book was very good it made me laugh and made me angry.  You will end up hating the X's, feeling sorry for the little boy and rooting for Nanny.	2002-08-30

The rogue vampires are causing all sorts of problems in the area, and the Bouvier family does not want Anita to raise the dead in their cemetery.  Apparently, they are holding the monster in place.<br />This is a very quick moving and action packed addition to the series.  Jean Claude is still proving himself as a Master of the City, and seems to really need Anita's help.  Larry is really coming along as animator and vampire slayer, a very good addition to the cast of characters.  The relationship between Anita and Jean Claude is also heating up nicely.

A man eating zombie is terrorizing St. Louis and Anita has to face down a voodoo queen to stop it.<br />This second of the Anita Blake series is just as exciting as the first.  She takes on the Senora, a very powerful voodoo queen and ex lover of her mentor Manny.  There are many bizarre twists and turns. Anita has to look to her past and her mother's side of the family for answers to this crisis.  Very hard to put down.	2002-08-28

He has hidden his powers for so long that the local vampire population is underestimating him.  Weakness also attracts stonger predators and some very old vampires are coming to take over his city.  It would help if his putative human servant would be more cooperative.  Anita Blake is noone's servant and isn't shy about telling Jean Claude.  Another vampire might see this as a challenge and an opportunity to take even more of the Master's power.  Will Anita help him consolidate his powers or destroy him?<br />Ms. Hamilton has written an incredibly gripping story here.  I read it in one sitting.  The series is progressing nicely and the new characters add much to the story line.  Great series.	2002-08-28

Just before his farewell party, Brenda's first exhusband Nado shows up at her business after having a fight with his present wife Kathilynn, an old high school nemesis of Brenda's.  Once upon a time, Kathilynn sabotaged Brenda's romance with someone named Vinnie T.  Brenda finds Nado a parking space in her friend's garage and he becomes a suspect in a murder.  Then Kathilynn shows up to find her husband and Brenda moves back into her shop.  Johnny calls but Kathilynn is selective about what messages she gives Brenda.  Then, who shows up but Vinnie T.  He looks like Johnny and is interested in Brenda again.  In the background, one of her friends is having an artistic crisis, another is having a romance with a liar, and Dweena is still stealing diplomatic cars, her creative relocation project.  Brenda naturally feels obligated to clear Nado, and then find him so she can send him and his wife back to Belup Creek where they belong.<br />This is always an entertaining series, with many bizarre characters as are always found in the Village, I wonder how Brenda stays in business, she certainly doesn't spend much time in her millinery shop.  This was a very good example of the series.	2002-08-26

Sam has returned, and although she still loves him, she still hasn't forgiven him for running out on her.  Her ex is still in the picture and hasn't totally accepted the fact that she doesn't want him anymore, except as Davy's father.  His latest gift to Davy is a pony however, and he is now dating the owner of the stable, Pam.  Pam is awfully possessive for a new relationship, but she is great to Davy and is teaching him to ride and take care of his pony.  Bob is also buying into Melanie's brother's coffee bar and they are talking about expansion.  Faith's puppy, Eve, is ready for competition, fun, but exhausting.  The last thing she needs is to get in the middle of one of her two aunts' disagreements.  Rose has accepted a daschund puppy as an item in a charity auction she and her husband are running.  She needs help caring for it, and Peg is furious that they would even consider auctioning off a living breathing creature.  Melanie finally agrees to take care of the pup.  Strange things are also happening in her home, lights are on when they shouldn't be, TV's on in the middle of the night, cumulating in the pups disappearance, and her own dogs being let out of the yard into the street.<br />As usual, I really enjoyed the book.  The mystery isn't really difficult, but there are many twists and turns and some red herrings also.  I don't think I can wait another year to find out what happens in the next book.  There were a few loose ends I can't wait to see tied up.	2002-08-23

Two drunken fools damaged one of her rides and Deborah was the judge to hear the case.  More trouble occurs in Dobbs.  The eldest son of the owner is found dead, by Deborah, at the Dozer with a mouth full of quarters. While investigating the case, she finds that Tallahassee Ames, the part owner of the carnival is really, her niece, Olivia.  She hasn't seen Olivia since she was a small child, but promised her late mother to always treat her as family.  Too bad Olivia's father doesn't feel the same way, since it was his grandson that was murdered.  Deborah is also changing her relationship with Dwight Bryant.  <br />This is one of the best novels of the series.  Ms. Maron is always at her best when she involves Deborah's huge family and its different characters in the story.  A new family member is always welcome and Tally and her family add color to an already colorful brood.  Deborah's new relationship with Dwight makes me wonder why nothing ever happened before.

Her mother sends her a scrapbook of her life and Sidda, with the help of the other YaYa's learns to understand her mother and herself.<br />This book made you want to laugh in parts and cry in others.

He now runs a shrimp boat with his cousins.  The RobBobs and Mozella have also relocated and CJ is visiting.  Abby has just about given up being accepted by the very exclusive society of the city when she is invited for a business tea by Amelia Shadbark.  Amelia has a fabulous collection of Lalique glass and wants Abby to broker the collection for her.  Unfortunately, she is murdered that very night and the collection destroyed.  Abby relies on a nosy neighbor to help her, but that neighbor is murdered also.  Amelia has a very disfunctional family, each accusing the other of greed and illegitimacy.  Abby will solve the mystery as usual with the help of her friends.<br />Nothing has really changed in this series. Greg Washburn has become a nonentity, her mother is even more annoying and CJ's Shelby stories are worse than ever.  The mystery was pretty good, although we could have done with more of a description of her new home town, and new life.  Overall, not bad, but this author has done better.	2002-08-14

Not only is the story badly written, the author leaves out large portions of her life.  Even though she is a grown woman, the book is written from the perspective of a little girl.  Everyone except her and her brother are self centered and not a little bit evil.  This book might have done wonders for her psyche, but it should never have been printed.	2002-08-12

Beaten as a child, repressed and forced to support his mother at an early age, he hasn't had much of a life and really has nothing to look forward to.  Since his father's death, he has been her sole support, and has no privacy or life of his own.  He doesn't even have a key to his own house.  Upon the death of his mother, he finds out that he has inherited a substantial amount of money.  Since his parents have cried poverty all his life, just where did all the cash come from?  To avoid having his mother's sister move in with him, he tells her that he is engaged to a coworker, Maggie Partlett, and convinces Maggie to move in with him to substantiate the lie.  Maggie had been living in much the same circumstances as Fell, and is happy to escape a miserable life.  The two of them get together to investigate the source of Fell's wealth.  Fell is afraid that his father had been part of a train robbery in the town, and decides to investigate that crime.<br />This was a very good mystery, very different from Beaton's usual works.  Two unhappy repressed characters find each other and blossom and solve a mystery as well.  There is even a happy ending.  A fast read and very entertaining.	2002-08-12

This one focuses on a wierd person named Stephenson or D'Onston, his first name changes from Robert to Rosslyn.  The case seems to be based on hearsay, and the subject's own ego.  He repeatedly wrote giving his theories to the media and police, and really anyone who would listen.  The theory is largely unsubstantiated and the author does little to make us believe in his theories.  He just says that all the others are wrong and he's right.

The Hon Basil DeLancy, an out an out cad, is baiting the cox, a Mr. Bott for not being as well borne or socially apt as the rest of them. Harold Bott has a huge chip on his shoulder and responds just as DeLancey wants him to.  This all cumulates in DeLancey pushing Bott in the river after he disgraces himself by being sick during the race.  Since DeLancey got him drunk the night before it really was his fault.  Then, DeLancey dies after becoming sick during a four man race.  Bott is naturally a suspect, and Alec takes over the case.  He and Daisy seek the murderer.<br />These golden age mysteries are alot of fun.  The murderer was fairly obvious, but getting to the conclusion was still worth reading.

Minty is not too well balanced to begin with, she seems to have some sort of obsessive compulsive disorder.  When Jock (as she knows him)leaves her, taking her life savings, she begins to see and hear ghosts.  Jock is among these, he sent her a letter saying that he had died in a train crash.  He also sent one to his wife, who takes the opportunity to remarry, to a gay MP in need of a cover. In return, she gets the security that she has always wanted for herself and her two children.<br />Minty sees what she thinks is Jock's ghost in a movie theater one night and stabs him to death.  Fiona is heartbroken, and inadvertantly steers the police in her neighbor's direction.  Matthew is a writer who suffers from anorexia and writes a column and hosts a TV show on the subject.  His wife Michelle is a morbidly obese woman, obsessed with bringing her husband back to health.  They both saw Jeff(the name he gave himself here) for what he was and disliked him.  Natalie, another old flame of Jeff's, is a journalist who sees this all as the story that will bring her fame.<br />The author deftly intertwines all of these women and their stories.  It is amazing just how much damage one cad can cause.  He seems to pick damaged people and preys on their weaknesses, and there are a great many to be found her.  Obsessive-compulsives, codependents, anorectics, schizophrenia, sociopaths, it seems to be a veritable abnormal psych textbook.  I had a hard time putting this one down to even eat or sleep.

Shortly after arrival Emma finds a body on the beach and is threatened by a pothunter with a gun.  Strangely, a senior colleague with no interest in New England archeology stops by to examine the site.  Worst of all, Pauline's house burns down with her in it.  She had just changed her will to benefit Emma, so now she is a suspect.  There are also alot of strange things going on in the anthropology department at her college.  Emma has to get to the bottom of things, hopefully without adding her own corpse to the body count.<br />This is a very quick moving mystery.  The author takes the reader into the world and work of the archeologist.  She goes into just enough detail for illustration and not so much that you are bored.  The characters are very vivid and there is alot of action.  It wasn't too difficult to solve the mystery, she leaves alot of clues, but it is alot of fun getting to the solution.	2002-07-27

The detective has left for a holiday and an aristocratic client shows up three hours after her scheduled appointment.  She wants them to find the daughter of a  disgraced and dismissed parlour maid named Flossie Jones.  Flossie had apparently been accused of stealing a brooch and fooling around with the gardener and was fired.  She died not long after giving birth and terrible things have been happening to the family since then.  Lady Krumbly wants to make up for accusing Flossie(the brooch has turned up recently) and to end the curse on the family.<br />This isn't the best of the series, but it is still alot of fun, Ellie and Roxie really could have used the services of the Flowers Detective Agency, but went on their own with adequate results.  Hopefully, some of the older characters will make a reappearance soon, but in the meantime I really enjoyed this one.	2002-07-27

The Villa formerly housed a b and b, but was now the private home of a Silicon Valley billionaire and his family.  Lynne was lucky to convince them to honor her reservation.  The group seems to meld together well, except for the wealthy attorney, Hake, and his trophy wife, Heidi.  During the social hour on the first night, the former owner, Lance Belleduce, shows up and makes everyone uncomfortable. The next day, Lynne finds him dead on the grounds.  Lance is very handsome, and very unpopular in some quarters, but who hated him enough to kill him?<br />This is a very enjoyable mystery.  The premise of a tour group enables the author to really mix up her characters and she really does this well.  Her descriptions of the California wine country are very vivid and her characters surprisingly well developed in a short period of time.  I can't wait to read the next one.	2002-07-25

Her mother is married to the thorn in her side, Sheriff Brook, she is suffering from post partem depression(or so her husband says), Sylvia Pershing has asked her to write a biography of a famous local woman, and the mayor is trying to introduce riverboat gambling to the town.  One night she sees someone sneaking around the putative site of the casino, apparently he was trying to get inside a wall.  He is found dead inside the abandoned house.  When the old house is torn down, the remains of a baby are found inside the very same wall.  A baby was kidnapped in the area in 1938 and never found.  Since Colin and her mother are in Alaska and the deputy in charge is obviously in over his head, Tori helps to solve the mystery.<br />This is always an entertaining series.  The author uses the main character's vocation as a geneologist to blend a mystery from the past into the present.  The characters are all very vivid and the story is great.  I can't wait until the next book to find out how the vote on Riverboat Casinos went.	2002-05-17

It will appeal to all of the kids going through Harry Potter withdrawal.  Oliver Smith is an orphan living happily in a Home.  He suddenly finds out that he has inherited a great estate.  Unfortunately, he has two evil cousins who also want the estate.  They hire two vile ghosts who like to kill children to haunt the house.  Unfortunately, there is a mixup at the agency, and the ghostly Wilkinson family take their place, for the time being anyway.<br />This is a really fun read.  There are some illustrations, but the author's descriptions are so vivid they are practically unecessary.  My nephew loved this book.	2002-05-14

Daisy decides to kill two birds with one stone and invites Alec Fletcher to meet her mother.  The week before the eventful weekend, Gloria is kidnapped.  The villians will kill her if her father calls the police, so Petrie asks Daisy to help him find her.<br />This was an incredibly quick read (under three hours).  I just couldn't put it down.  It was nice to see all of the usual characters in a different setting.  The author lets us get to know them a little better.  Lucy is in every book, but very little time is given to her for example.  I am looking forward to the next one.	2002-05-14

She leads the owners to the body only to find that it has disappeared.  Betsy now has to find the body and the murderer if only to defend her own sanity.<br />This was a pretty good mystery.  I know nothing about needlework, but the author makes it easy with very vivid descriptions of the different disciplines.  This is a quick and entertaining read.	2002-05-14

She takes an order for two thousand dollars worth of chocolate from a much hated local woman.  She delivers the chocolate, and is hired to help serve drinks at the party that evening.  The hostess pitches over a balcony shortly before the start of the event, evidently poisoned by one of the chocolates.  It seems that everyone in town is a suspect, even Aunt Nettie and the local police chief.<br />This is a really fun new series, the story line moves along quickly and the novel itself is short.  A great beach book!	2002-05-10

Alpiew is a former employee of the Countess'.  Ashby thinks she ran away with her husband, but in reality, Alpiew was just another of the items he stole when he took off for the New World.  They meet again in debtor's prison, each vying for a job with a scandal sheet.  They end up combining talents and sharing the salary.  In the course of their business, they are asked by a Mrs. Wilson to follow her husband.  She suspects that he is cheating on her.  They lose track of him the first night and witness his murder on the second.  The come to discover that he is also an alchemist who will do anything to get the money to continue his research.  But how far did he go, and what has he done?<br />At times the language of another era is somewhat difficult to follow, but usually all is explained soon after.  The characters of the aged former royal favourites and their servants are very entertaining, as are the characters themselves.  The mystery can be difficult to solve, but all the clues are there if you only look.  I am definitely going to read more of this series.	2002-05-06

In her hallway, the police find boxes of bogus flyers meant to upstage the ingenious promotion Annie's Death on Demand is sponsoring to celebrate the newest Emma Clyde mystery.  Henny is convinced that Kay (the deceased) had nothing to do with the flyers, and Annie and Max promise to help find out who killed her.  In addition to this mystery, Laurel is in search of drug dealers,scandalous doings are going on among the faculty and students at the high school,and retired police chief Frank Saulter is being stalked by a killer from the past.  It seems that Annie and Max have gotten themselves into more than they bargained for this time.<br />This is among the best of the series so far.  The story lines merge well into each other, and even though the author gives you all the clues, it is still difficult to solve the mystery.  It is especially hard to separate the different plot lines, but alot of fun to read and try to figure it all out!	2002-05-06

Maybe it is because the books involve the raising and training of field spaniels instead of show dogs.  In any case, I wish these books weren't so hard to come by.  I had to order mine through Amazon.UK.  <br />When the stereotypical village nasty is found upended in a cistern, noone is sorry.  She has threatened, badgered, and bad mouthed just about everyone in the village.  She even killed and ate a neighbor child's pet rabbit.  Unfortunately, one of the village's best liked residents is arrested for the crime by a detective who tends to jump to conclusions.  It is up to John and the crew at Three Oaks Kennels to solve the crime and get Alistair out of jail.<br />This series is always enjoyable, and this is one of the better entries.  The addition of local children as casual help at the kennels only helps in the investigation.  Who knows more about what goes on in a neighborhood than its children? No one.  Hopefully this series will become easier to purchase, so I can read all of the books.	2002-05-03

He caught a tropical virus while serving in the Falklands War.  With his pension, savings, and a partner, he is striving to make Three Oaks Kennels a going concern.  He trains the dogs, his partner Isobel handles them at field trials, and Beth, John's significant other acts as both kennel maid and nursemaid to them both.  In this novel, Beth's uncle, the famous artist, George Muir, is killed in an explosion and has left Beth a painting and his Labrador puppy, Jason.  John and Beth travel north to collect both and visit with the widow, Aunt Hattie.  John isn't satisfied that the explosion was an accident, and notifies the local police, but doesn't tell Beth or Hattie.  Other family problems arise involving the inheritance and Muir's other paintings.<br />There is more than enough going on in this mystery to keep anyone happy.  Family squabbles, murder, swindlers, and goodness knows what else.  I was a little offended by the author referring to Beth as John's mistress, but other than that, I enjoyed the mystery thoroughly and hope to work my way through the whole series.	2002-05-03

He seems to have been the most popular member within the royal family, although not with his mother, who seemed to see him as a convenient drone.  She was notorious for trying to keep her children on a leash long into adulthood.  Leopold appears to have overcome these obstacles.  In his short life, he accomplished a great deal, he was the first of the royal family to attend Oxford, he was on the boards of a great many charities, he managed to travel, and he worked as an unofficial secretary to his mother.  <br />This is a well written and researched book.  The author provides information on other more obscure members of Queen Victoria's family, such as her half sister Feodora and her family.  The family tree of the female side of Victoria's family is the most extensive and interesting I have seen, although it does not solve the question of where the haemophilia in the family came from.	2002-04-26

Apparently Elizabeth has been taken in by an email scam, to the tune of one and a half million pounds.  Then a debtor of Agritechnics is found dead by Henry, who embroils himself in yet another murder mystery.<br />This was a very good mystery, although I missed the folks at Throaks.  Henry is an often overlooked character in the series, and this novel developes his character more fully.	2002-04-22

There are no photos or other illustrations, no genealogical tables to help sort out the relatives, and worst of all, no index, footnotes, or references.  A high school student could do a better job.

While snooping through the house, she finds the body of Tal's fiancee in a closet.  Naturally, she is arrested for the murder.  <br />This is a wonderfully fun novel.

Weezie rekindles a romance with a high school sweetheart, and last but not least Weezie tries to get the money together to buy the cupboard.

There is very little in the way of text, but there is little need for it, the pictures speak for themselves.  Queen Victoria was connected to most every royal family in Europe and there are pictures of many of her royal relatives here with a little of their stories.  The pictures are very interesting, and the author has managed to get most of the family represented.	2002-03-25

I loved Leslie O'Kane's contribution, as well as those by Patricia Guiver and other well known authors of dog mysteries.  There were several unfamiliar authors and their stories were just as good.  Each short story is very well crafted. I have to say my favorite story was by Virginia Lanier, her JoBeth Siddons series of Bloodhound mysteries has always been one of my favorites.	2002-03-25

The only problem is, his last meal was from the Penn Dutch Inn.  Oddly, several local spinsters claim to be married to him!  Melvin actually asks for her help, and she has to save the reputation of her Inn.<br />This is a pretty typical Penn Dutch mystery, there is really nothing too special about it.  The grits recipes are way too plentiful.  Grits are not everyone's favorite food.	2002-03-17

When last we saw her, she was suffering from both a head injury and heartbreak.  Her vet and lover had married someone else and she was injured during another of her escapades.  Rita has recommended a psychiatrist to help heal her mind and body and her elderly friend Ceci asks her help in solving a problem at the dog park.  A dog owner with a vicious Golden is making things difficult for all of them.  Holly solves the problem temporarily, and then a murderer solves it permanently.  Holly helps to solve the murder.<br />This is the best Conant mystery in a long time.  Conant has taken the time to add more dog elements to the mystery and as usual she makes them work brilliantly.  The dogs and the mystery blend wonderfully, so this novel should appeal to all readers, not just dog nuts.  The author understands dogs and murder mystery like very few others and I always enjoy her dog mysteries, even though the previous two were more mystery and less dog.  They were markedly less enjoyable, and I am glad she has returned to the previous formula.	2002-03-08

Mrs. Murphy and Co. get suspicious and then worried, because as usual, Harry is in the middle of the mess.<br />This is the best RMB mystery in a long time.  The mystery has many twists and turns and the characters of the town of Crozet are as vivid and funny.  The mystery wasn't difficult to solve, but getting there was an awful lot of fun.	2002-03-06

The night after their operations, a well known ex football player in the next room dies as well.  Since they have nothing to do but think about what's going on, Judith and Renie put their minds to solving the mystery and to find out aabout the other strange things happening at Good Cheer hospital.<br />This is the best that this series has produced in a long time.  Hospitals are naturally creepy and this one is really strange.  The setting of a hospital isolated after a snow storm really adds to the drama.  Enjoy it, I did!	2002-02-27

She encounters a tiresome acquaintance from school and her equally unpleasant relatives.  They are all on their way north to convince their grandfather and his twin brother(who is also on the train) to change their wills in favor of one or another of them.  Alec's daughter Belinda has run away from home and is stowing away on the same train.  Fortunately, she finds Daisy who buys her a ticket.  Belinda befriends Uncle Albert and his protegee, Dr. Jagai.  The elderly man is murdered and Bel finds the body.  The train is full of suspects.  Alec is called in to solve the crime.  <br />This is a good addition to the series.  Most of the suspects are pretty unlikable and snobbish.  This makes Daisy, Alec, and Co. all the more likable.  I admit that the mystery was easy to solve, but as usual with Dunn's books, the process is thoroughly enjoyable.	2002-02-14

His fragile(both physically and mentally) wife, her companion, the fired coachman, and his wife's rejected lover, the famous Dr. Gully.  The author tells a very vivid tale of abuse, lies and murder, and I enjoyed it thoroughly.  The author also follows the suspects in the following years.  The effects on them and their families is also described in detail.  This is a very thoroughly researched story of the murder of the last century.	2002-02-11

The CID in Strathbane as usual, have no idea where to start and Hamish and his new friend Elspeth decide to investigate.<br />This is a good addition to the series.  Elspeth is a welcome new character as is Carson.  I was getting tired of everyone treating MacBeth like the village idiot and himself without a backbone.  A very good and fast read.	2002-02-07

Then, James starts to spend alot of time with a local divorcee, Melissa Sheppard, and she suspects him of having an affair.  He thinks she has restarted her affair with Sir Charles.  They have a couple of blowout fights in front of the whole village.  Agatha takes her life back and takes a temporary public relations job.  James is furious and they are barely speaking.  Then one night, James is missing, there's blood on his doorstep, and Melissa is found dead in her house.  James of course is the main suspect with Agatha a close second.  Agatha knows that she did not do it, and of course James didn't, so naturally she and Charles have to find James and the killer.<br />This was an incredibly fast read, and one of the best of the series, so far.  I definitely recommend it.	2002-02-06

Most books on Russia begin and end with Nicholas II and Alexandra with a little Ivan, Peter and Catherine.  This huge family has more than a few interesting members and the author of this book has included many of them.  The theme is the last century of the Romanov empire, and the author tells many interesting stories of Romanovs, their relatives and even a chapter on their English nannies.  I loved the book.  The family trees were more detailed than most I have read, and the family relationships are explained to some extent.  I will definitely read more of this author's work.	2002-01-29

She lives in her childhood home with the housekeeper Violet and the senile butler Martin.

When Beryl is later found dead, Lizzie has a far more serious job, to find the murderer.  The village is sure that it is one of the American soldiers stationed nearby, but Lizzie isn't so sure, especially since some of their officers have requisitioned her home as their new quarters.<br />While I will miss the Pennyfoot Hotel series, this is a very good replacement.

Josie Pigeon has landed a dream remodeling job.  A millionaire has bought the Point House, the largest house on the island, and plans on remodeling it as a summer home for himself and his daughters.  Josie and yet another new crew of carpenters have only just started to work on the building when a hurricane hits.  Just before she is forcibly evacuated from the island, she sees the body of the owner, Mr. Hudson, dead in the living room.  Unfortunately, the house is completely wiped out by the storm.  Josie and her friends and crew, while rebuilding the island, have to solve the murder.<br />While I wish that the construction crew would retain at least one steady member, at least Betty returns to help Josie.  The locals are as eccentric as ever and the mystery is entertaining.  I can't wait to read the next one.	2001-12-30

Paw is semiconscious in the hospital and tells Laura that he didn't fall, he was pushed.  A young local woman also went missing about the same time.  Soon after, Paw dies and Laura is determined to bring his killer to justice.  Laura has always felt like an outsider in her family and the possibility that one of them murdered her much loved grandfather can either bring the family together or blow them apart completely.<br />I wish that I had read this mystery first, it explains alot of the family dynamics for the later books.  It is also a first rate mystery and I highly recommend it.	2001-12-30

She enters the local Music Jamboree with the assistance of her sleazeball boyfriend.  The boyfriend ends up dead on the Rambler's bus and Ilene is accused of murder.<br />This is a good addition to the series.

I know Abby Timberlake and Tamar Myers have been dying to kill off the Tweety Bird.  I am surprised that she lasted as long as she did. Abby finally has recovered enough to invite Tweetie and Buford to her Halloween party and house warming ( you have no idea how warm it got).  Buford was in Japan on business, so Tweetie came alone dressed as Little Bo Peep complete with sheep.  This annoyed Abby, but Tweetie left the ewe outside and came in to enjoy the party.  Mama showed up dressed as Lady Godiva complete with horse and things got a little rowdy.  Irene forgot her promise to turn out Lady Liberty's torch and Abby's rug was afire.  She kicked every one out, but not every one left.  Tweety was found dead later in 17th century Italian armor.  Who hated the airhead enough to kill her?<br />This mystery was adequate, but hardly the best of the series.  I couldn't get involved in the story as I was in so many of the others.  I was annoyed at the main character's habit of constantly calling everyone dear.  I found myself wondering why the main character would so easily forgive Greg's lies, and drop everything to move three hours away from a successful business to an uncertain future.  She already did that once and hated it then, so why now.  Once again, entertaining at times, but the author has written better mysteries.	2001-12-17

Sophie Gordon was an epileptic.  She used a seizure alert dog to tell her when she was going to have a seizure.  The dog was getting old, so when someone approached her in the dog park proposing to clone her dog, she jumped at the chance to have a dog just like Blanche.  In due time, she received Bianca, who looked exactly like Blanche.  One problem, she did not alert.  Sophie wanted to find the people who cloned her, to tell them that the alert trait that they were looking for wasn't there.  Enter Rachel Alexander, private investigator and former dog trainer.  Sophie hires her and Dash the pitbull to find the organization, so she can inform them.  Not long after, Sophie is found dead of a seizure, or was it?  There are alot of strange circumstances in this case and Rachel is determined to find out why Sophie died and to place Bianca and Blanche.<br />Each one of Benjamin's books seems to be better than the last.  I just couldn't put this book down.  It was very exciting in parts, lots of action, and a very satisfying ending.	2001-12-15

Sidra is marrying a dot.com millionaire and is working as a talk show host's assistant in NYC so she asks her mother to take care of the details.  Then, Ron, the groom, and Thelma, his mother arrive on a huge rented yacht and take over, the dock, the wedding, everything they come in contact with.  Sue feels pushed aside, and her husband Sid seems to really hate Ron.  There is also a local controversy with the harbormaster.  He is micromanaging every aspect of the town dock and is squeezing the local fishermen out in favor of the large yachts of summer people.  Sidra and her horrible friends come into town for her bridal shower on the yacht, and Ron is found dead in the water.  Sidra's ex boyfriend is accused and Lucy tries to find out what really happened.<br />This book was OK, but a little flat somehow.  Lucy and Bill seem to have problems, but they are never really explained.  Sue is not the same person as in the previous books.  Lucy's children are pretty irritating and seem to figure too prominently in the story.  I didn't figure out who did it, but the ending seems to have been just thrown on.  I hope the next book brings the old Lucy back.  I really love this series and the book is good, just not as good as her others.	2001-12-15

Sure enough, the town and the Burdettes are split about the sale.  To top it off, there is a firebug in town, and one of the prospective buyers is killed in a fire.

Kate is charged with saving the University College, sort of like NYU's New School, primarily for adults returning to finish their education.  The powers that be do not want the school to continue, the reasons are not clear.  The leader of the movement is Professor Cudlipp, a stereotypical academic snob, he appears in all of these novels in one form or another.  Predictably, he is murdered and Kate and Reed are bound to find out the truth.<br />I usually enjoy these academic mysteries, but this one is just too dated for my taste.  The radicals of this time were the repressed conservative professors of my time, and this mystery doesn't age as well as her others.  The writing and mystery are still fine, but the setting is old fashioned, but not enough to be historical or quaint yet.	2001-12-12

They are relieved when a dazed Faye Ann appears from under a pile of comforters.  Unfortunately, she is covered with blood.  When Jake enters Merle's butcher shop to see who is actually dead, she finds him, neated chopped up and wrapped in butcher paper.  Jake and Ellie need to find out who killed Merle, because Faye Ann is not capable of either the crime or defending herself.<br />This was a little more grisly that the usual Graves mystery, but very good.  The author introduces us to even more of the unusual characters of Eastport, and life in a Maine seaside town in winter.  Very Very good mystery!!!!	2001-12-12

Pix makes a few phone calls, and the Fairchilds turn up at the end.  This, like The Body in the Fjord is about Pix Miller and her family.  Pix is overseeing construction of the Fairchild's new summer house on the island, Samantha is working at the famous Main Sail camp, and Ursula is enjoying the summer at her house The Pines.  Pix is appalled that the builder has done little work on the house, when her dogs are seen digging furiously at the bottom of the excavation.  A quilt, then a human hand are uncovered at the bottom of the hole.  The body is of Mitch Pierce, sometime house restorer, full time con man.  Other strange things are occuring around the island.  Increasingly vicious practical jokes are taking place at the camp, and counterfeit antiques, mostly quilts are turning up in the area.  Then, local celebrity, Addie Bainbridge is found dead at her B &amp; B.  Pix is determined to get to the bottom of these mysteries.<br />I have always liked the Pix Miller character.  She is more realistic than many mystery heroines.  She doesn't have any special talents other than being incredibly organized, which seems to me to be more useful in solving murders.  I am glad the author has given Pix another mystery of her own to solve.  The author also helps us to get to know the people on the island better, hopefully she'll be taking us there again soon.	2001-12-01

Only wizards seventeen and older are eligible.  Somehow thirteen year old Harry's name is put into the goblet and he is part of the contest.<br />This is by far the longest of the Potter books and a great deal is happening throughout.

Lily knows that she didn't commit the crime and tries to prove it.<br />As, you can see, there is alot of action in this novel.  The novel is set in the depression era 30's, and is very descriptive.  The author brings that time back to life.  Although this is a very different series from the Jane Jeffries series, it is every bit as good.  The local characters are becoming more and more developed with each book, and are very real.  I look forward to the next book in the series.	2001-11-20

A dog is guarding a dead body and the police can't get in the apartment.  Christie rushes to the scene and finds that the body belongs to the young man who ran him off the road, and of course the dog is the one that was beside him in the car.  <br />This was an excellent mystery.

Her dog Gulliver has cut his paw on a can on the beach and can't walk with her.  Carole has difficulty talking to strangers and doesn't want to go to a place that has many walkers.  She goes to a nearby village of Weldisham and takes a walk on the deserted downs there.  It starts to rain, so she takes shelter in a dilapidated old barn.  Underneath her bench she finds two bags of human bones.  She calls the police and assumes that her involvement ends there.  Carole keeps thinking back on the mystery, however and the people of the small village.  With the help of her friend Jude.  They solve the mystery together.<br />This is a rather dark mystery.  There are no characters that the reader automatically roots for.  Even the protagonist Carole Seddon is a quiet, withdrawn and not altogether sympathetic character.  The mystery is very good, with lots of twists and turns, and although I suspected the murderer, I wasn't sure until the end.  This is a very good series.	2001-11-12

Fiona the wolfhound is pregnant, and the TD next doot has his house blown up.  More disturbing, while on a walk through some ruins nearby, both Nuala Anne and Nelliecoyne see a scene of murder from the distant past.  Apparently, a man was wrongfully accused of the murders and hanged for the crime.  The local priest, Jack Lane, finds part of a journal, written by an American reporter who was there at the time, that tells the whole story as it happened.  Nuala, Jack Lane, and Dermot have to find the rest of the journal and the fate of the murdered man's family.<br />This is pretty typical of the series.  Nuala has a crisis of some kind, she finds a mystery in the past, she solves the mystery and her problems at the same time.  Each one of the mysteries, however is very well done, with just a little bit of Irish history thrown in.	2001-11-12

Blackie Ryan is asked by Cardinal Sean to accompany himself and his sister Nora to Paris.  Apparently, a TV priest has disappeared and the Cardinal in Paris wants Blackie to find out what happened to him.<br />The Blackie Ryan series is one of my favorites.  This book is formulaic, but it's a great formula.  The author even adds characters from his Nuala Anne and Chuckie O'Mally series to the story. This works well as Blackie seems to find his way into most of Greeley's books.	2001-11-09

Neighbor Wilbur Paine is the Easter Bunny.  Judith thought that all had gone pretty well, until she is informed that one of her neighbors, who had just received a big inheritance, was stabbed to death in the nursery.  Joe asks for her help and she of course can't say no.<br />This is one of the best books in the series.  Judith and Renie's attempts to investigate are hilarious, as are their neighbors and family.  Every time I pick up one of Daheim's books I hope for one like this but unfortunately, the later ones are less and less funny and more silly.  I hope to find more like this one.	2001-11-05

Anne Hardaway was looking forward to summer on the Jersey Shore.  She has a lucrative contract as a ghostwriter for a radio psychologist and life was boring, but going well.  Then the psychologist, Dr Arlene, shows up on her doorstep, claiming to want to work more closely with her on the book, and her good friend Delia's ward, Tracy, disappears.  Well, the publisher is angry because nothing seems to be going on with the book, Dr Arlene is shopping all the time, NOT working, and Tracy seems to be a member of a witches' coven.  One of the members of that coven is found dead on the beach, by Anne of course.  Anne and the very attractive Detective Mark Trasker are determined to solve the mystery.<br />I have only read one of the books in this series.  I really enjoyed it and always meant to read another.  I am glad that I did.  There is alot going on in this mystery.  Dr. Arlene has other issues than the book and there is more to the coven than meets the eye.  I didn't guess the murderer until the author wanted me to, and that's getting harder to do, the more mysteries that I read.  I am definitely going to read more of this series.	2001-11-04

I love the cats and the mysteries. Other than the information about Russian Blues, this mystery really doesn't have that much to offer.  The plot is thin, and the romance pretty unbelievable, and other than her neighbor, I really didn't care about the characters.  This is a wonderful series, but I just didn't love this one.	2001-11-03

Leatha spent most of China's childhood and adulthood in an alcoholic fog.  Leatha is now on the wagon, but with so much baggage the relationship is still difficult.  Leatha is staying with her sick Aunt Tullie on the family plantation in Mississippi, and there is something very wrong.  The manager, Wylie, has announced to Leatha and Tullie that he has a deed to the land under the plantation's main house, is assaulted by the angry old woman and disappears.  Leatha, naturally very worried, begs China to come out and help her solve the problem.  Reluctantly, China drives to Mississippi to resolve the problems, but they are deeper and more difficult than she realizes.<br />This is a much more personal mystery for China.  In her other stories, she always seems just a little removed from the action. In this one, she is deeply involved with each and every one of the main characters, and related to most of them.  Her family has more secrets than she or Leatha ever realized.  The ghosts are a nice touch.  They add to the atmosphere of the old house.  This is a very enjoyable mystery.  China Bayles fans will love it and it will appeal to many others who would not otherwise read one of these mysteries.	2001-11-03

So, the Chief turns to his childhood friend, the monk, Brother Bartholomew, to help him.  Brother Bartholomew has problems of his own, from the past and present, but he agrees to help his old friend.<br />This was a very suspenseful mystery.  You never knew the killer's indentity until the author wanted you to know.  There was plenty of action in between.  A very fast and enjoyable read.	2001-10-31

He is in Brighton visiting Prinny at his Pavilion.  The Prince Regent is in fear of his life and has appointed a slimey baronet, Sir Simon as his food taster.  The Beau and his friends don't trust him, but are alarmed when he drops dead at dinner after trying Lord Petersham's snuff.  Suspicion rests on Petersham and Brummell's reputation is is shreds, so he must solve the mystery.<br />I am really enjoying this series.  I always liked the character of Beau Brummell, and was saddened at how his life ended up.  He had a good run while it lasted.  I have a hard time reconciling my memories of what I have read about the Duchess of York to the apparent grand passion Brummell has for her.  The hair and messes of 107 dogs would revolt the man I have read about.  But I have only read fiction books with him as a character, and even then a long time ago.  I look forward to the next book.	2001-10-30

Most Regencies describe him as a rather one dimensional character.  Ms. Stevens has quite rightly made him the center of a mystery series, much as he was the center of the fashionable world of his time.  He is asked by his dear friend, the Duchess of York, to clear a protegee of hers of the murder of her employer.  The woman was exceedingly unpleasant, and was even rumored to have beaten her servants.  The night before her death, Lady Wrayburn was incensed with Miss Ashton for inadvertantly telling her that her ladies' maid was pregnant.  Now all of London thinks that Miss Ashton is the murderer.  To save the Duchess' reputation and to assist the young women, the Beau agrees to help.  He even loses a painting at auction, having been distracted by the problem.  The winner of the auction, a representative of the King of Siam, presents him with the first Siamese cat in England.  The famous valet, Robinson, is not happy about cat hairs, but Brummell can not return him.  The cat seems to be an ancestor of Lillian Jackson Braun's KoKo, an able assistant in solving a difficult murder.<br />This was an excellent mystery.  The characters are familiar ones for those who have read regencies, and very well developed.  The mystery was engrossing and difficult to solve.  I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series.	2001-10-27

However, this novel is one of her funniest.  Mary Alice is ready to marry Sheriff Virgil Stuckey, and wants She introduces Patricia and Fred to Virgil's family, and they all go to a fundraiser for the ever present statue of Vulcan.  Virgil's son and son-in-law are Elvis impersonators and are featured in one of the acts.  As a whole line of Elvi(?) do a dance on the stage, one of their number staggers to the edge and falls into the orchestra pit.  He turns out to be a Russian ballet dancer, and an acquaintance of the daughter of one of Mouse and Sister's oldest friends.  As if all this wasn't enough turmoil, Haley and Phil are due back from Warsaw, and Sister's oldest daughter, Marilyn is contemplating using the clinic at UAB to have a baby the same way Haley did.<br />Ms. George will be sorely missed.  This is a fine example of one of her crazy mysteries.  You can't help laughing out loud many times.  The characters are pretty eccentric, but somehow they always fit in, and seem, if not ordinary, logical in view of the plot.  They are always a quick read, and enjoyable, and this one is definitely not exception.	2001-10-26

There is an odor of almonds.  Was it cyanide?  She was very unpleasant, but who hated her enough to kill her?<br />This is an excellent addition to the series.

The author did a good job with the resources available.  Most of the films and people involved in silents are gone now, so the job is doubly difficult.

Michael's mother is running the event with her usual iron fist.  Anachronisms are forbidden and fined.  Meg is forced to wear itchy linsey woolsey while she sells her ironworks.  Michael, as a member of a French regiment, gets to wear a magnificent uniform.  Various of Meg's eccentric relatives are there to add spice to the event.  Her father is a particularly gory colonial doctor.  Her weasly cousin Wesley is looking for a tabloid story to boost his career, and Cousin Horace is out of his gorilla suit and into the uniform of a Virginia regiment.  Meg does her best to hide Mrs. Fennimore's recent commission, a dozen glow in the dark pink wrought iron flamingos, to replace the plastic flock outlawed by the town.  A shady businessman is found dead in her booth, and a good friend is accused.  Meg and Michael must solve the crime themselves or Faulk will be charged with murder.<br />I found myself enjoying this book more and more as the story progressed.  Meg and Michael's families are always the most entertaining parts of these books and this one was no exception.  The background story of the reenactment was pretty interesting also, and blended well with the mystery.  I am looking forward to the next book in the series.	2001-10-19

I found it very interesting, but at times, very difficult to follow.  Until it resolved itself around the middle to be organized along a sort of time line, I couldn't figure out if it was sorted by country, family, or time.  The author doesn't go into a great deal of detail in regards to each crime, so if you want an interesting overview of royals as murderers or victims, this book will suit your purposes well.	2001-10-17

I picked up this book out of curiosity, noting that most of the shots were taken on Long Island in the 30's.  I have been to many of the shows listed.  The pictures are a wonderful history of dogs and dog showing mostly in the New York area.  The photographer does not limit himself to just the breed ring.  There are also shots of dogs at obedience and field trials.  The pictures of the rich and famous with their dogs are very interesting.  The photos also show how much some breeds of dogs have changed over the years.  Notably, the German Shepherd.  Nowadays, only the dogs from Germany look like the ones in this book, and they would never win at Westminster.  I really enjoyed the beautiful pictures, many many breeds are represented.  A great find for a dog lover and/or exhibitor.	2001-10-16

Kate is pressured into investigating by her friend in the administration, Edna, who tells Kate that she is the only one who can solve the matter discreetly.  <br />I found myself unable to put this book down.

At least, that is what he said he was there for.  Jake believes that he is there to search for a Stradivarius allegedly hidden in the house by a former owner.  Jake believes that this is merely a local legend and is incensed when her guest disappears, allegedly drowned, leaving a huge hole in her dining room wall just days before the local reading circle is due to meet in her home.<br />The visitor's exgirlfriend Charmian arrives to bring home the body(there is none given the currents surrounding Eastport) and dives into the mystery herself.  Jon Raines wasn't a graduate student, he was an adventurer who looked for lost treasures.  Charmian's uncle wouldn't let them get married(sounds a little like a gothic romance doesn't it?), so he went off to find a real treasure to make his reputation.  The uncle also makes a trip to Eastport, but thankfully, doesn't stay with Jake.<br />This was a very good addition to the series,  Jake and Ellie solve the mystery with the usual help of the local characters and their families.

The vicar's mysterious nephew and Lori are intrigued by the mystery, and the fact that the police have no clues and no witnesses, although many people were out and about that morning.  Pruneface was very unpopular with the local populace, being a vicious gossip and possibly a blackmailer.

Strangely enough all of these mysteries are connected as well as being connected with several rich and powerful Washington bigwigs.  With the help of the ghosts and Dennis Kim, Jake, Gypsy Rose and Maura solve the 34 year old mystery.<br />This is the best of the Jake O'Hara mysteries so far.  The author skillfully blends the mysteries of the past and present.  The supernatural angle is entertaining but not too overdone.  Gypsy Rose Liebowitz's character really stands out, and the Ben Rubin character is strangely absent.  Very fast read.	2001-10-04

Her father is dying and speaking to his dead friends and relatives.  The doctor suggests that the housekeeper call Nora Bonesteel, a local woman with &quot;the Sight&quot;, to talk to him.

Lark reluctantly agrees, and decides to look for a song that has been in the family for centuries while she is there.  Her plane crashes into a mountain on it's way to Hamelin and the search for the song is the only thing keeping her going while they search for her.  Nora is visited by ghosts, as usual.  There are also a few subplots involving the local residents, mostly the sheriff's office.<br />The ballad series is the McCrumb's best.  Her stories revolving around folk songs are always interesting and the characters of Nora Bonesteel and Spencer Arrowood are her best.  These characters and the ones from her own family make these novels a joy to read.	2001-09-25

The wedding is to be at the small hotel where the happy couple met.  Unfortunately, the manager's husband died there the year before, in questionable circumstances, and the proposed bride, Connor, was supposedly the reason.  The children dislike Connor, and her side of the family also seems less that pleased with the arrangements.  A &quot;ghost&quot; is seen hovering around the tower and Connor's sanity seems to be crumbling.  Soon, Connor is murdered and the proposed groom Lloyd is the suspect.  Henrie O has to find out who really killed her for her grandchildren's sakes.<br />The mystery was really very good in this novel.  I had a very hard time figuring it out.  I love Bermuda, and I enjoyed the little descriptions of the Island.  I went there in May however, and the residents thought that we were crazy to swim in 75 degree water, I can't imagine sunbathing in January.  It seemed especially wierd for people from Texas and Georgia to go to a colder place for a vacation.  Henrie O's recovery from pneumonia was the only reason that I could figure that she changed from a very active older woman to Miss Marple.  All criticisms aside, this is a very good mystery and I look forward to the old (that is, not OLD) Henrie O in the next novel.	2001-09-22

Quite honestly, there isn't one story in this collection that isn't worth reading. I love short story collections. It's like a buffet of different author's offerings, you get a little taste of each author's works. This collection left me wanting more of all of them.	2001-09-20

The author was kind enough to autograph it for me.  That alone was enough to make me want to read this book, but once I started, I couldn't put the book down.  Ms. Brennan tells the story of Irish Dance with an obvious love of the subject and a gift for storytelling.  She introduces us to famous dancers of the recent past and tells the story of dance in different areas of the country.  I found myself enjoying this book more than I ever expected, and learned a great deal in the process.	2001-09-20

This is an up close look at the Williams sisters, Jennifer Capriati, Lindsay Davenport, Martina Hingis and many others.  The author tells you much that you already know and a few things you don't.  His style is very good and the book was a really easy read.	2001-09-19

She meets the octogenerian man of her dreams, who flies her off on exotic trips.  Mouse gets stuck with the strange relative of the groom, left over from the wedding.  She is a geneologist named Meg Bryan.  The local geneologists, some of them at the wedding seem to hate her.  A local judge, really hates her.  She goes to visit him anyway only to take a skydive out his window.  The judge and everyone else seem to want Meg's laptop.  Did she commit suicide or was she murdered?  Why?<br />This was a very entertaining mystery.  I love the characters and the descriptions.  The mystery is very good.  I only have two very minor criticisms.  If her dog Woofer is so old, why is he outside in every weather.  Give him a bath and flea dip and bring him inside.  There is entirely too much talk about Vulcan's behind.  It might be big, but it's getting boring.	2001-09-14

Her husband, the egocentric Bob has been dead for two years, a half day after running the NY marathon in just over 4 hrs.  She is teaching history at a small catholic college and seems depressed bored and lonely.  Then, just like twenty years ago, a headline catches her eye.  A woman in her community of Shorehaven has disappeared without a trace. She finds it interesting, but does nothing until a body is found in the woman's swimming pool months later.  Presumably, the body is that of Courtney Logan.  Judith rather impulsively offers her services as a researcher to the grieving husband, and is rebuffed at the door.  Shortly thereafter, his father, organized crime figure, Fancy Phil Lowenstein, shows up in her garage and asks for her help in solving the crime.  This brings Nelson Sharpe, now in Special Investigations, back into her life and her investigation.<br />All of the old characters from Compromising Positions are back, twenty years older.  I was interested to find out how they all changed.  The mystery in this book was much better than the last, and that one was very good.  It was an excellent Long Island suburban mystery.	2001-09-11

It is better than I remembered.  Judith Singer is a frustrated mommy/wife.  She has gone from a promising academic future to housecleaning and nosewiping.  Her husband is a workaholic at a PR firm, and seems to care little about anyone other than himself.  Judith reads about the murder of a dentist.  She knew him, having seen him once for a gum problem, and is intrigued by the mystery.  She starts to investigate on her own and eventually hooks up with Lt. Sharpe the lead investigator.  They solve the murder and have a brief affair.<br />This is an interesting look at suburbia in the late 70's.  Most of the characters are upper middle class housewives with feminist leanings.  Their struggles with their lot in life add alot to the story.  The mystery was good also.  This book was much better than I remembered.	2001-09-10

Mr. Massie manages to bring Nicholas, Alexandra, their family, and court back to life.  The book reads almost like a novel at times and is very hard to put down.  The author tells a very vivid story of a very tragic couple and their family, and the time in which they lived.  The author is able to help the reader understand the series of events that lead to the fall of the monarchy and the murder of the royal family.	2001-09-08

Her job as school psychologist is challenging, but just when she makes some progress, a parent, school board member, or administrator messes it up.  Her love life is confusing.  The one bright spot is her afternoons with her grandmother, who is helping her write the family history.  Then, one afternoon, she finds her grandmother dead and the housekeeper missing.  Foul play is suspected.  Her relatives are the suspects.  Then, her tires are slashed, her windows are broken, she is threatened by both her own relatives and the parents of the students she sees.  Who really killed Grandmother Leofanti and why?<br />This is an engrossing mystery.  Once I picked it up, I read it until I reached the last page.  The characters are so real you feel that you know them.  Although there are definite clues, the mystery wasn't easy to figure out.  I can't wait for the sequel.	2001-09-06

There are alot of anecdotes about various silent and talking film stars.  I always wanted to know more about Haines.  Many bios of stars like Joan Crawford and Carole Lombard mention him, but say little about his career.  The gay angle held little interest for me, but there was enough else to keep me interested in the book.  William Haines' biography is definitely worth a look for anyone interested in silent film history.	2001-09-06

Susan is getting prepared for the usual Christmas fesitivies when her mother in law cuts a vacation short, arrives a week early, and is on a new diet.  She criticizes everything they eat and seems to survive on microvaved meals found in a plastic bag.  She seems to be in love with the inventor of her meals, an abrasive podiatrist who considers himself a nutrition expert.  A neighbor seems to be going off the deep end.  She is recently divorced and he and his new wife have built a house directly behind hers.  The husband turns up dead during a Christmas party at the new house, only he is dead in his old house.  The police are called, but the body disappears.<br />This is an exceptionally good holiday mystery.  The suburban wives and former wives are pretty strange in Hancock as usual.  Kathleen and Susan have a more difficult time than usual solving the crime and entertaining relatives at the same time.	2001-09-03

Leila Mae, the tramp who caused the end of Kelly's marriage, blew into town with her new husband, Baron Thorsen at about the same time.  She is trying to sell shares in a treasure hunt.  A homeless woman called the spitter rewards Kel's generosity in buying her a meal with a very old coin.  Soon the woman turns up dead and not as a victim of Hurricane Gilda.<br />This mystery is much better than Death Dances to a Reggae Beat.  I liked the characters in the first novel and still do in the second, although the author hasn't figured out what to do with Angie and Peter yet.  Kel's relationship with Michael is progressing well, but no mention is made of him at the end.  What really happened to Leila Mae?  The endings weren't neat by any means.  But other than the sloppy ending the mystery was really enjoyable and the characterizations are still great.  This is a really good beach book.	2001-09-02

He didn't inherit any of his famous beauty and bad temper, but he definitely inherited his speed. He wasn't a pretty horse, in fact people apparently often mistook him for a cowpony, but under the care of trainer Tom Smith, ownership of Mr. Howard, and ridden by Red Pollard, the homely little horse became a legend.<BR>Ms. Hillenbrand brings you to the racetracks of the twenties and thirties. You see racing through the eyes of the trainers and jockeys of the time. You can almost smell the horses! Her descriptions of the conditions that the jockeys and horses had to deal with were vivid, and at times horrific. But most of all, this is the story of Seabiscuit, and his love of racing. All of his quirks, and he had quite a few, are described lovingly. I now understand why he was so popular that he was mentioned in the press more times than the president. This is a must read.	2001-08-31

Lily Bart is a socialite on the lookout for a rich husband.  She is beautiful and feels that that is all she has or needs to offer.  Her ending is predictably sad, but nonetheless you wish otherwise.  Wharton is a master at describing the society of her time.  The characters are very vivid, you can almost feel that you know them.  Great book.	2001-08-31

They are improbable but entertaining. This one is beyond the pale. Judith intrudes on a police investigation without reason or invitation. She invites the woman who stole her fiance, leaving her pregnant and with no alternative than the awful Dan, and that's just the beginning. I lost all sympathy for the doormat, and her investigations annoyed me. I ended up giving the book away.	2001-08-28

Between ferrying her three year old to preschool and playdates and a newborn who wants to party all night, she hasn't had a decent night's sleep in four months. Her screenwriter husband is no help either. He is working on a new series with a nearly perfect Mindy as a partner. By a stroke of luck, Juliet finds a babysitter at the local kosher grocery, a young Hassidic girl named Fraydle. She does a wonderful job but doesn't show up the next day.  Her family doesn't know where she is and Juliet is determined to find out the truth. I enjoyed this book. It combined three worlds I know little about, motherhood, Hollywood, and Hassidim. The mystery is very good and the characters very real. Enjoy.	2001-08-28

In the latest Melanie Travis mystery, her fiance Sam has gone off to find himself after the death of this exwife and former friend, leaving Melanie in the lurch. On the bright side, her brother Frank is about the marry Bertie, dog handler and friend of Melanie. Faith finally gets her second and final major, finishing her championship(her daughter Eve looks like a winner also). In the midst of all this, Bertie wants Mel to help with her wedding plans. She's hired a flakey dog groomer/handler/rich kid to do all the arrangements, so Mel wonders why. Then, ex husband Bob shows up six weeks before the wedding, newly divorced from his very young bride, looking to get back together with Mel. Then the wedding planner disappears and her cottage on her mother's estate burns down. A young woman's body is found in the ruins. Is it Sara the wedding planner? Who burned the cottage? Mel is determined to find out. This is the best of all her mysteries. Ms. Berenson has a gift for giving the reader a good mystery and not losing the dog show background. This book will appeal to readers who have no idea what is involved in the dog world, the characters and mystery are that good. I learn a little more with each book. Hopefully, Mel's trip to the obedience ring as a spectator will lead her in that direction also.	2001-08-26

An obnoxious guest falls down the stairs and is found dead shortly after Renie hits him in the head with a dinner plate when he tries to steal her dinner. It turns out that he really died from a blow to the head, just not Renies. This contains the usual wierd group of characters and improbable mystery, but is very enjoyable none the less.	2001-08-26

I have been reading the Sharon McCone series so long that I didn't think that Ms. Muller could write anyone as well. I was wrong. I picked up this book yesterday and couldn't put it down until I read the last word. Rho and Guy are two very sympathetic but human characters with terrible past experiences that they have managed to overcome-mostly. The novel is set in a little coastal town in Northern California. Almost thirteen years ago, horrible massacre occurred in Cascade Canyon. Six adults and two children were brutally murdered. Only one child survived. The tragedy pretty much killed the spirit of the town, and almost destroyed Deputy Rho Swift. Guy Newberry, a writer who specializes in stories about towns in trouble, is researching a book about the murders and their effect on the community. Together, they work to solve the murders and get past their pasts.	2001-08-24

She is the pastor of St. Bede's Church in Fisherville, NJ.  The Church Hierarchy is not too fond of female clerics it seems and she had to constantly fight to keep her little church open.  She goes on a retreat to a monastery in an effort to get some rest and contemplate her future.  She sees immediately that she is going to get little rest.  Her two parishoners the Smartts think that they are on a second honeymoon.  Martine is in a foul mood about something, and the rest of the monastery has been booked by her nemesis and the politician who once tried t kill her with a polo mallet.  Vinnie vows to make the best of it.  Then, one of the monks is killed and Vinnie has to find out who did it in a very short period of time.<br />This novel takes place in a fairly unique setting, a non-catholic monastery.  The characters are pretty interesting and the mystery very good.  I am definitely going to read more of this series.	2001-08-23

Later that day, well known anchorman Jason Armstrong is found dead on his front porch by trick or treaters.  Susan ends up with his partner/wife and her entourage trashing her house and turning her life upside down, while she, Kathleen and new police chief and old friend Brett Fortesque investigate the murder.<br />This is a pretty good cosy with well developed characters, both new and old.  It is however improbable that anyone would put up with Rebecca West and Company or the horrible Amy Ellsworth.  I am surprised that the author didn't take the opportunity to kill her off and be done with her.	2001-08-23

A former resident is visiting obscure civic groups and promising them huge donations it they recognize him with a plaque or statue.  He calls all the civic leaders together at the Hancock Inn to announce the winner of his largesse,  but is found dead in the wine cellar.  Guess who solves the mystery?<br />This is another wonderful cozy by Ms. Wolzien.  The characters are both new and old and the mystery is well crafted.  I certainly wouldn't want to live in Hancock.	2001-08-22

In this book he takes on the much overlooked wives, sisters, and daughters of the Georges. He brings these nebulous princesses to life changing them from background shadows to real people.  The women are every bit as interesting as their royal brothers.  I had always heard about the much pitied Royal Nunnery as the daughters of George the III were called.  Those that married, did so fairly late in life, and those that didn't certainly seemed to do quite alot of living as soon as they were out of their parents' sight.  There were many other brave, eccentric and/or scandalous women in the family and Van der Kiste does his best to describe them all.	2001-08-22

Later on, the body of a well known TV anchorman is found stabbed the same way on his front porch.  Susan naturally starts to investigate and is joined by her old friend and now the new police chief, Brett Fortescue.<br />As usual, I enjoyed this mystery.  Ms Wolzien always tells a good story.  I was annoyed by two things.  What sane woman lets a stranger and a rude entourage invade her home, and why wasn't the rude, insensitive and nosy neighbor Amy Ellsworth thrown in as a murder victim?  I certainly wanted to dispose of her by the end of the book.	2001-08-22

Susan is spending time trying to be the perfect political wife amid vicious items planted in the local media about Jed, and the total disintigration of the candidate for mayor's wife.  The big issue is the Landmark Commission's mission to control every building in town built before 1939.  The third party candidate for mayor, Ivan Deakin, announces that he has a solution for everything and will announce it at a press conference.  Unfortunately, he drops dead at the podium before he can make his speech.  All the candidates, their families, and the police chief's new girlfriend seem to be suspects.<br />Wolzien seems to have captured the life of a candidate and his family very accurately in this novel.  One is surprised that there aren't more murders during the election season.  In any case, they wouldn't be as amusing as this one.	2001-08-08

At the same time Simon Fairweather, the local building inspector is murdered in his office.  Naturally, Susan has to hire the biggest suspect to take on her construction job.<br />I enjoyed this mystery, not much more than the others, except for the introduction of Josie Pigeon.  It is a typical Susan Henshaw mystery with all of the characters that an upper middle class New England town produces, which makes an enjoyable read.	2001-08-05

She breaks a leg while leaving her pastor's burning house.  The pastor claims that she saved his life.  Then he is found dead in mysterious circumstances.  Various parishoners are receiving messages from the beyond encouraging them to give money to the dead pastor's pet charity. They all thought Humphrey was a con man, but a con ghost?<br />I enjoyed this mystery.  The characters were quirky enough to be entertaining and the subplots and mystery were excellent.	2001-07-30

He convinces her to go with him to Maine to check out the literary files of a recently deceased author.  Apparently, burglars have been seen in the area and Max is worried about the valuable papers.  While there Kate finds the body of one of her students on the rocks.<br />This is a really good Cross novel.  There are two main interwoven plots with a few sidelines.  The mystery is difficult to solve and keeps your interest all the way through.	2001-07-25

Unfortunately the local tramp is found dead in the front seat.  Everyone who had an affair with her in the town of Hancock is a suspect including Jed.  Susan and Kathleen have to do their best to clear him.<br />Ms. Wolzien has alot to live up to in her novels and this is not up to her usual standards.  Her attempted red herrings just turn out to be loose ends.  Susan and Jed never once discuss the affair--why--it almost gets him arrested and everyone else in town has told the police and Kathleen about it.  This novel seems just sort of tossed together.  It is however enjoyable for all that and I am slowly working my way through all her novels.	2001-07-24

In addition to the usual stress, her daughter's dress has not arrived from Italy and her future son in law's parents have invited all of their former commune buddies to a rehearsal dinner intended only for the family.  The usual stresses of family only add to the fun.  When the dress finally arrives, Susan goes to pick it up only to find the body of a strange woman with a wedding invitation inside the otherwise empty box.  How can she give the perfect wedding in a crime scene?<br />This is one of Ms. Wolzien's better efforts.  Her grasp of the details of a large wedding and descriptions of the crazy commune members are wonderful.  I really enjoyed the many intertwined plotlines, and the crazy characters really kept me laughing.	2001-07-23

I've read alot of books on this subject and this is far and away the most interesting.  It seems carefully researched for the most part(you can't gossip and get it all right) but far more importantly, it was really entertaining and easy to follow, not an easy task when describing his particular subject.

Billie is trying to find evidence that a wealthy but mentally challenged young man did not kill his best friend.  Emma tries to find the biological parents of an adopted child.  Both of the plot lines would make excellent short stories, but they do not merge well into the same novel.  Overall, I enjoyed it, but Ms. Roberts' work is generally better.	2001-07-18

They meet another couple with children the same ages as Chrissy and Chad.  The other couple is meeting the rest of their family for a reunion.  The patriarch of the family is murdered and Susan and Kathleen have to find out why.<br />This was an okay mystery, but not up to Wolzien's usual standards.

I now know more than I ever wanted to know about turn of the century kitchens and the abused psyches of chefs,but very little about Mary Mallon.

Just before their valuable collection is divided, the husband is brutally murdered.  In addition to untangling the marital woes of the area, she now has to solve a murder.<br />This is another excellent novel by Maron.  She takes us to yet another area of North Carolina, and her descriptions are very vivid.  She gives you many clues to solve the mystery, yet I still didn't figure it out until nearly the end.  Great book!!	2001-07-10

Kate is asked to teach a senior seminar on the Antigone(appropriate for a murder mystery) at her old school, the Theban.  A young man is found unconscious and bleeding, having been frightened by the school's guard dogs, and shortly thereafter his mother is found dead under similar circumstances.   This is very much like the other Fansler mysteries, although the setting is different.  The mystery is difficult to figure out and this is faster reading than the usual Cross mystery.  I enjoyed it even more than usual.	2001-07-04

On Jennifer's first night in the spooky (and some say haunted) house, she hears screams and is locked in her room. When she frees herself, she finds the old lady's bloodsoaked and empty bed.  Who killed Mary?<br />This was a very fast moving and interesting mystery.  It has romance, ghosts both historical and recent, family drama, and a great murder mystery.   This is Fitzwater's best book so far.	2001-07-04

Otherwise, it seems to cover his life from the cradle to the grave adequately, but without brilliance.	2001-07-04

His Uncle Daniel, a candidate for local office is missing, and his opponent is found beaten to death with Daniel's shilleleagh next to him.  Hilda is hired by his friends and family to find Daniel and to find out who really killed Mr. Bishop.<br />This is a very unusual series.  The story is told from the point of view of a maid in the famous Studebaker household.  Usually, only the wealthy or educated are the main characters in mysteries.  The author combines an accurate portrayal of immigrant life with a really good mystery.  I look forward the the rest of the series.	2001-06-24

Susan Henshaw is a suburban housewife heavily involved in the local PTA.  At the annual PTA luncheon, one of the committee members dies after eating a sandwich laced with cyanide.  Several weeks later, another committee member is also killed with cyanide, this time in a beverage.  Susan is nearby in both instances.  The CT State Police are called in to assist the locals and they enlist her help in solving the murder.  You never know what lurks beneath the surface of the upscale suburban community.<br />This is a wonderful start to the series.  No one is what they seem, and everyone appears to have a secret.  Athough in retrospect, the author gives clues, the murderer came as a surprise to me.  Great Book!!!!	2001-05-26

The aquaintance ends up dead of cyanide poisoning, her former husband, who is also a former lover of Kate's is accused, and Kate is asked to solve the mystery. <br />The setting is Harvard University, where Kate's former friend is appointed as the first full professor in the English Department over the objections of the all-male faculty.  Someone spikes her drink a department party and she ends up passed out in a bathtub with a local &quot;sister&quot; from a commune trying to revive her.  Gossip flies about the campus.  Another sister from the coffeehouse commune is sent to get Kate.  Kate is more entranced by the dog than the sister, but still goes to Harvard to help.<br />I had only one question during the whole story--WHY?<br />Why does Kate go to a place she hates, to teach a class she doesn't want or need to, takes a leave from a job she loves, in a place where she is respected, to help a person from her past who she really doesn't give a damn about?<br />As usual, the book is well written, the characters are not as well developed or sympathetic as I would have liked, but I suppose in a temporary position Kate wouldn't have gotten to know everyone all that well either.  Not bad, but not her best work.	2001-05-25

She is just about broke, still stuck with her sister-in-law's dog, and the only thing keeping her solvent is her two boarders.  One of them is killed in the charity corn maze behind the tavern, and her brother is the main suspect.  Annie and Claudius do not have much faith in the detective in charge, and it's up to them to solve the crime.<br />I enjoyed the mystery and the story.  The author has gotten more of a grip on the dog angle of the story.  It won't outrage the dog lovers among us.  I assumed that the mistakes made in the last book were due to the main character's inexperience with dogs, but am happy to see the errors mostly remedied.  Claudius isn't left in hot cars or left to run loose in this story.	2001-05-22

I was very disappointed in the mystery however.  It all seemed too convoluted and confusing.  The protagonist McCleary didn't impress me all that much.  Everyone and their brother seems to be able to fool him.  Not a great trait in a detective. However, the author is excellent in bringing back the atmosphere of the 1870's.	2001-05-11

She enlists the help of a newcomer to the island.  He owns the liquor store, but was formerly a prosecuting attorney.  Every one is a suspect, including the construction crew.

After being dragged to a St. Pats day party thrown by an Irish Police Fraternal organization by her ex partner Bucky, she becomes a witness to his shooting, and is determined to find out who done it.  She is convinced that the shooting has some connection to the Shamrock Society he so recently joined.  Callahan begins to wonder how well she really knows Bucky, but is no less determined to find his assailant.<br />The author writes a very taut, suspenseful mystery.  The plot is full of twists and turns, and the employees of the House Mouse help out as usual.  I just wish that the author would find someone other that one of Callahan's friends or relatives to use as a target, she's going to start to run out soon.	2001-05-09

The novel reminded me of the best of the Barbara Michaels novels, suspense with a little of the supernatural thrown in.  Her second book is just as good.  The story of Pat, Miss Maggie and Bell Run continues, when another ghost makes his presence known to Pat.  Shortly thereafter, a skull is found in Pat's proposed tomato patch.  The anthropology department of the local university is called, and a team is sent up to Bell Run.  A contemporary death seems to connect the two eras, and Pat and Miss Maggie try to find two murderers in two different centuries.	2001-04-20

The suspects are many, and once again, the success of Have Faith depends on the chef's ability to solve a murder.  In addition to saving her business, Faith has to rescue the career of a beloved principal from an unprincipaled and overprotective parent.

All of my favorite characters are there, and the setting of the racecourse at Newmarket is different than most of the Victorian and Edwardian mysteries.  The description of Lillie Langtry and her life seems pretty accurate from all that I have read, and so does the decription of the racing world at the time.  I really enjoyed the mystery, although I was a bit disappointed if not surprised by the resolution.  I enjoyed it very much on the whole.  The authors have a knack for bringing historical figures to life and writing a good mystery along with it.	2001-04-16

Pitt once again angers the Inner Circle by gathering evidence against one of their members in a murder case.  The member is found guilty and hanged.  Soon after, he is stripped of his command and sent to the East End to work undercover with a unit charged with exposing anarchists.  It would be giving the story away to tell any more, but let it suffice to say that Pitt uncovers much more than he ever expected.<br />The characters are as well drawn as ever, giving more emphasis to Gracie and Tellman.  Charlotte's family and Vespasia are not as important.  I didn't enjoy Vespasia as much, Perry seems to be letting her spirit grow old, I liked her much better in the past.  Read and enjoy!	2001-04-10

I was so glad to find this book. Ms. Haslip describes the empress as a real person, beautiful but spoiled and unwilling to do her job.  The evil stepmother-like mother in law is much more believable as described in this book.  If she was so awful why was she so close to Elisabeth's mother?  Elisabeth is a woman full of contradictions and is described well.  The only thing that still aggravates me is that no author will name the mysterious illness that caused the rift from her husband. I wish that they would stop dancing around the issue and just name it!<br />Overall, this is a very fair assessment of the empress and her family, and describes her better than any I have read.  I wish there were more pictures.	2001-04-10

I've always wanted to know a little more about Caroline Astor, and this book is a very good reference source.  It gives a vivid view of the time and brings much of it to life.  I only have one problem with the book, and it is a large and glaring error.  The author states that Alva Vanderbilt's house in Newport was nondescript.  Her house(next door to Mrs. Astor's)is Marble House, one of the most opulent houses in all of Newport, closely followed by her other house, Belcourt Castle.  This woman was often described as being &quot;knee deep in mortar&quot;.  It makes me doubt the rest of the authors research, although I did enjoy the book.	2001-04-02

The basis of the story is a very dry autumn just before &quot;the snow flies&quot; or the &quot;Big One&quot;, as they refer to the first big snow of the season.  The historic shafthouses above the defunct mines are in danger of fire both deliberate and accidental, as are most of the wooden buildings of Pickax.  Disaster strikes in the form of an explosion in Eddington Smith's used book store.  Qwill and Koko are determined to find out who done it.  A great read.	2001-03-06

She follows him upstairs to the second floor of an historic apartment complex and finds the featured entertainment, an exorcist, dead of a gunshot wound.  <br />This is a fast moving and entertaining mystery, the characters are very quirky, and there are red herrings aplenty.

Not surprisingly, someone kills him, appropriately stabbing him in the back.  Jake has a difficult job, she has to write his column, finish his book, and find his killer.  It seems that everyone who ever met this guy, has a motive to kill him.  The usual cast of ghosts and neighborhood characters, plus Rubin father and son, help Jake solve this crime.  With so many suspects and victims, it's hard to pick out the murderer, and I confess that I couldn't guess.  The best yet of this series.	2001-02-21

If I had to state a negative, it would be with Cross's obsession with dairy cows.  She overdescribes them in The James Joyce Murders also.  Other than that, it was a fast moving suspense filled story.  The author really pulled together the wide spread elements of the mystery, from England to Houston to the Berkshires to New York and California, Kate Fansler doggedly pursues any and all clues to finding the missing Winifred Ashby.  This mystery was very entertaining, and the ending was suprising. I recommend it highly.	2001-02-14

The characters are entertaining and there are a few good plot twists.  The main character's motivation for coming back to Illinois is never really explained.  It doesn't make sense that a small town girl who spent four years in the Peace Corps would apire to high society in New Orleans while working as a school psychologist.  That's a mouthful that needs more explanation.  I'd like to know more about her and less about color coordinating your shoes to your outfit.

It is supposed to be the first Fansler novel, yet none of the characters are properly introduced.  Kate's final analysis of the murder is tenuous and based on nothing.

It is definitely engrossing, but none of the characters are very sympathetic.  I didn't like any of them.  There are alot of strange and useless plot twists that add nothing to the story.  The plot line involving the missing person's uncle is entirely gratuitous.  On the other hand, I was engrossed in trying to find out what happened to Jenny, so I read it to the end.  I admit that I was surprised by the conclusion.	2000-12-20

A mystery from a famous author's past seems to be the cause of his death and Sarah Booth is hired to find out who killed him.  The resident ghost Jitty is not as essential to the story as in the previous novel, but she is just as funny.  This is a definite must read.	2000-11-24

One of Miss Marple's childhood friends is worried about her unworldly sister and sends her good friend Jane to find out what's wrong.  The sister, Carrie, is very wealthy and has turned her estate into a type of reformatory school.  It is suspected that Carrie is being poisoned, and alot of strange things are happening at the school.  This is a great mystery and I recommend it highly.	2000-11-17

She is working on a story of the diappearance of a young boy from the old Palisades Amusement Park, not knowing that both she and her superiors at work have ties to the incident.

In this one, Tempe tries to unravel a series of murders by outlaw biker gangs.

It is a lot more light-hearted than the other mystery series she writes.  Elizabeth spends most of this novel in a sanitarium, while her brother buys a Tara-like mansion as a home for himself and his partner as well as their law office.  AP Hill has her own problems.  A former college aquaintance is terrorizing the male chauvinists of the South with a woman she broke out of prison.

The author does not go into any great depth for any of these women, but she gives a good overview of the lives of each.  Well worth reading.	2000-10-06

The master of the house returns from a lecture tour with a new wife, much to the consternation of his grown up children.  Many twists and turns follow to a very satisfactory conclusion.  Although the story may seem run of the mill, the characters are marvelous and there is alot of action.  The only problem seems to be Babson's difficulty in portraying Americans in her early novels.  It is almost as if she never met one.  That problem is resolved now, but in her early works she seems to think of us all as characters in Hee Haw.	2000-09-21

I found this one very hard to put down.  The story involves 4  generations of the Chambliss family's summers at Liberty, their house at  the Retreat summer colony in Maine.  The author understands the  relationships between summer residents and locals more than most novelists,  and uses this knowledge to enhance an already gripping tale.  I loved the  Chambliss women and their story.	2000-09-14

I just wasn't aware that Williams  was the center of the universe.  Her anecdotes are for the most part very  interesting, but she was a star and the only stories that reflect badly on  her show her as the victim.  I also wish that she had started the book with  something other than her LSD trip. The details about her family are very  sketchy.  Why is she supporting her parents when her mother was a  psychologist in Hollywood.  Her sister June took care of her kids quite  often, but other than in this context, she barely mentions her--enjoyable  but buy it in paperback.	2000-08-21

In this novel a very dense new bishop with his own agenda is kidnapped while riding an L train.  The  train, the driver, and the bishop disappear.  The bishop has no shortage of  people who hate him, so Bishop Blackie has a difficult time finding the  kidnappers.  The author has a real feel for bringing his characters to  life.  I don't know how college students in Chicago talk, but they don't  sound like that in NY and haven't since the 80's.  Other than that, I  really enjoyed this novel.	2000-07-21

It's a story of three sisters in a wildly disfunctional family.  They communicate pretty much exclusively by phone, mostly over the condition of their increasingly senile father.  It was very  entertaining at times, but for the most part the oldest and youngest  sisters are too self involved, and the middle one is a complete doormat for  her father, sisters, and son.  There is a bitter tone throughout the novel,  yet I still had a hard time putting it down.	2000-07-19

The story moves well and the antics of the two elderly Hunnsemeier sisters are as amusing as usual.  Brown harps a little too much  about Nickel's alleged lesbianism(the only affair she has in this book is  with a man)and the storyline is often inconsistent with either of the  sequels, but it is a worthwhile read.	2000-07-05

East of Peculiar has every thing you need for a perfect beach book, mystery, romance, and humor.  I loved the characters, residents of an upscale senior community, and the story was riveting.  I only had one  problem.  The author uses police 10 codes much too frequently.  Most people  are unfamiliar with them, and those that are probably use an entirely  different set.  Either insert a glossary or leave them out!	2000-06-28

It is set in the Greenwich Village of the 20's.  It has wonderful atmosphere and characters.  She really captures the sprit of the prohibition era.  The murder mystery is engrossing, and it  seems that the Village never really changes.  The main character, Olivia  Brown is a poet, part-time investigator, and self professed bohemian.  She  is a little too obsessed with the choice of her next lover.  It almost  seems like job interviews.  If the author would place less emphasis on that  and more on the story it would flow much better.	2000-06-28

In the latest Dorothy Cannell mystery, Ellie Haskell is summoned by 3 of her grandmother's old friends to solve another family mystery.  Another trio of bizarre characters join the cast, as each of the bridesmaids is  just a little bit off.  Cannell's mysteries are always alot of fun in  addition to the mystery,and this one is no exception.  Hopefully, the next  novel will bring back the Flowers Detection Agency.  I miss them.	2000-06-28

I wanted to know more about the people who built the enormous summer &quot;cottages&quot; by the sea.  This book told me all I wanted to know and more.  There are bits  about most of the &quot;Dollar Princesses&quot; who travelled to England  and married into the nobility.  The decriptions are vivid and entertaining.   Afterward, read The Vanderbilt Women and some of Edith Wharton's novels.   Better yet, go to Newport and see where they spent the summer.	2000-06-23

The Vanderbilts were a huge part of it, and the women of the family are as dynamic as the men, in spite of the Commodore's opinion of them.  Included  in the book are little known figures, such as the Commodore's much put-upon  wife and daughters.

Her characters aren't totally sympathetic, or good, or evil for that matter.  You never know who to root for or who to hate, in the next plot twist a  good guy becomes bad or vice versa.  There is alot of suspense and action  in these novels, and Ms. Walters really makes the reader think.  These are  not mindless quick mysteries, although I read them quickly.

This is the first book that I have read by Jane Heller.  The characters are real even if they are a little off the wall.  I found myself laughing at the fights between sisters.  Although they were an extreme example,  anyone with a sister can identify with them.  The plot is fast moving, and  although you can sort of figure out who killed the doctor, you still don't  put the book down until the last page.  The offer of a free copy to your  sister is a very good gimmick by the way.	2000-05-30

Susan Conant has gone back to her original theme, murder mysteries with dogs and dog people.  I still miss the dog shows and obedience trials of the earlier mysteries, but this book was much better than the last one and  will appeal to non-dog people also.
