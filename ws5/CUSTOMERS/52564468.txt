The only David Baldacci which I had read before reading Split Second was Saving Faith. I disliked Saving Faith. I found it long on flash and short on substance. In fact, I only picked up Split Second because I was travelling in Spain and literally had no other choice of reading matter.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the book. Compared to Saving Faith I found it restrained and well plotted. It was more of a traditional mystery than I had expected and I enjoyed the time that the characters spent going back to basics and unraveling the mystery. I also liked the way that Baldacci handled the two female characters in relation to the plot. It was genuinely suspenseful and kept me wanting to read despite the competition from my vacation.<br /><br />The ending was goofy, but by that point I had enjoyed reading it enough that it only annoyed me a little bit.<br /><br />Reading the reviews, it seems clear that this book was not appreciated by the more traditional Baldacci fans. It may be that because I am more of a mystery reader than a thriller reader I liked this compared to his other work. Depending on your tastes, you may have the same reaction. In any case, I thought it was an excellent book for travelling or to read on vacation.	2005-09-27

Dear Patricia Cornwell,<br /><br />I have been reading your Kay Scarpetta books since the beginning of the series. It is saying something about your strength as a writer that I am *still* reading them, given how impossibly silly and repetitive the plot lines are becoming.<br /><br />Trace was actually an improvement compared to the last few books. The writing style is more engaged and the villain himself is interesting and rather clever. You have returned to a number of the basics in this that made your earlier books so great. Thanks for that, and keep up the trend.<br /><br />But please, please can you stop with the claustrophobic conspiracies against Scarpetta? I realize that a woman rising to power is going to face that kind of obstacle, but enough already. In the beginning, it was a good device to make Scarpetta seem vulnerable, but we are way past that point. Now the politics do not serve to make her seem vulnerable-- instead she seems a bit like Prometheus. Every day, that eagle tears her liver but every night she heals and grows whole again.<br /><br />Also, can you do something about Lucy? She used to be one of the best and most engaging elements of the book. Unfortunately, now she is starting to remind me of Kathy Mallory on a bad hair day. The Henri plot line and the way it was used to artificially split the plot into seemingly separate plot lines really did not work for me as a reader.<br /><br />Ever since the revelation that Benton was really alive, I have been waiting for you to deal with the emotional issues between the two of them. One of the best things about your books is the way that you have let your characters grow over the years. I admire that. So why not use the place that you have brought them instead of layering on what now feel like artifacts of an idea that you have about the series?<br /><br />In any case, I was glad to see some of the things that I like so much about your books back again, and I hope to see more with the next series entry.<br /><br />your fan, frumiousb<br /><br />p.s. For readers who have not read a Scarpetta novel before, you will be lost in backstory if you start here because there are so many dependencies on past events.

Kudos to Caldwell and Thomason for completing a fresh and well-written adventure at such a young age. The passion for history shines through, and the reading of the Hypnerotomachia works well both in itself and as a device for advancing the plot. If the Dan Brown link is what brought you to this book, the writing quality is well above the Da Vinci Code, and its goals are much higher.<br /><br />This said, I am afraid that it is probably a good deal less satisfying as a reading experience than a lot of books that are more outright hacks. Like other reviewers, I tend to cut this book quite a bit of slack because of the quality of writing and the bigger project. It is not as successful as a book as the four stars rating would imply.<br /><br />My major thought when I had finished the book was that obsession is really the province of the young. The two scholars are obsessed with their mystery, obsessed with their girlfriend and honestly that is as it should be for the age. What fails to work in the larger book is that they assume that the motivation of obsession extends to the adult characters in exactly the same way and to the same level. It is not a good bet to make and the assumption is the biggest flaw in the book. A more nuanced approach to character would have made it more believable and more finished. Obsession is interesting because of how it changes and hardens over time. It is uninteresting and predictable in the form that it appears here.<br /><br />Also-- although this is a minor quibble-- not everyone is fascinated with Princeton tradition. There were points where it provided nice backstory, but there were points where it gave the book an unfortunate pretentious tone.<br /><br />Still, The Rule of Four is a strong first effort with a lot of heart and inspiration. I will certainly pick up their next book (separately or together) to see where they go as writers.<br /><br />The Rule of Four should appeal to readers who like a bit of mystery, but would like writing quality one step above the supermarket pot boiler. Fans of Katherine Neville and Umberto Eco will probably find this a good use of a few hours.uld like writing quality one step above the supermarket pot boiler.

So, before I begin let me stress that we chose this as a book club selection and with the exception of one member everyone enjoyed reading the book. If you came here looking for something with a global conspiracy plot and sharp research a la the Da Vinci Code, then you will find what you are looking for with The Eight. The prose is at least not much worse than that of Dan Brown.<br /><br />The frustrating thing with the novel is that Neville has presented a complex and clearly well-researched book. As a reader, I was rooting for her on that basis alone. This book has been compared to The Name of the Rose, but that comparison is not just. Eco is a master wordsmith with a degree of control and quality that Neville comes nowhere close to exhibiting. However, the quality of her plotting is such that if she does resolve some of her writing issues, then she could justly be placed above airplane literature.<br /><br />The first and largest quality problem with the Eight is the freshman feel of the prose. There are places in the book where it is so badly written that it distracts from the reading experience. For example, she has a habit of using heavy-handed foreshadowing (\\"little did I know that in two days I would...\\") that is particularly irritating.<br /><br />The second largest issue is the incomplete character development and strange plot cul-de-sacs. I actually do not believe that this is a quality issue. I have read in interviews with Neville that the original manuscript was more than 1200 pages long. I suspect that we are missing a number of plot points that would have made some of these characters much more complete and some of the transitions much less abrupt. It would be interesting to read if she would ever publish a complete version now that we are in an era where it is more common to publish books above the standard 390 pages.<br /><br />There is a lot to like about The Eight. The setting in 1973 with the rise of OPEC is fascinating and well-researched. The chess elements are well done, and are most likely what earn the book its large cult following. It is at its strongest when it sticks to the territory that Neville obviously knows best-- the consulting world, Algeria, the early days of computer science. The research that she put into the 18th century portion of the book is also obvious and impressive, and only a little bit lessened by her habit of making every single person her characters meet a famous person.<br /><br />In short, The Eight is a good book for wasting some time. If you hear frustration in a number of reviews, it is because it has the feeling of a novel that could have been more. I will probably give at least one of her subsequent books a try to see if more experience with writing addressed my largest sources of concern. There is some violence and some very mild sexual situations, but this book should be suitable for teenagers as neither are described graphically. In fact, this book might well make a nice bridge for the teen who you would like to lead from Dan Brown into books like Godel, Escher, Bach or Umberto Eco.cinating and well-researched.

Reading Ordeal is an uneasy experience, and I do not give it four stars because it of its quality as a book. Linda Boreman/Linda Lovelace remains opaque in its pages, as she does in nearly every other evidence of her life that still remains in view. In the 70s, she was the ultimate me-girl-- sex-crazy and enjoying it. In the eighties the hangover had begun. With Ordeal she decided to tell the truth about what had happened to her, at least the truth from an older and presumably wiser perspective.<br /><br />As a woman, I really want to believe Ordeal. I do not want to think that someone would lie or exaggerate about matters so serious or so damaging to other people or women in general. If pushed, I would have to say that I do not believe that she was lying. The trouble is that this book is taken so literally, and has had such a galvanizing effect on the anti-porn movement that people lose sight of the fact that there is a difference between not lying and telling the objective truth.<br /><br />Have you ever had a professional victim as a friend? At first, you feel sorry for them. Later, their stories start to make you uneasy because even though they seem to be basically true, they are completely devoid of any awareness of their own responsibility. It is as though they think that you are going to like them more, the more of a victim that they have been. Ordeal has a little bit of that same tone.<br /><br />On the one hand, it rings true that Taylor dominated her, hit her, and used her low self-esteem to push her into a career that she did not want. On the other hand, she seems to be a victim wherever she goes. She never encounters kindness and is forced to do every bad thing that she does. It does not ring true with how life works, and in the end makes her whole story more open to doubt and gives as much ammunition to the people who want to believe that all porn is voluntary as it does to the people who want to believe that all porn is exploitative.<br /><br />In the end, you can use Linda Boreman as a lens for the world that she was caught up in during all the phases of her life. I give Ordeal four stars because it is an important book historically, and a sad one-- Linda herself is not in these pages either.<br /><br />Probably obviously, this is not a book for young readers. It is very explicit, despite the anti-porn tone./>In the end, you can use Linda Boreman as a lens for the world that she was caught up in during all the phases of her life.

Margery Allingham once described a mystery novel as if it were a four-sided box: \\"a Killing, a Mystery, an Enquiry and a Conclusion with an element of satisfaction in it.\\" The first three elements provided her as an author with the discipline that let her imagination have play with the last.<br /><br />In this book (6th in the series and written in 1934), the book only partly follows the whodunit form as the identity of the killer becomes clear very early on in the book. Instead of being an exercise in detection, it is a meditation on the relationship between detective and killer. Campion meets his nemesis, and the trick becomes how to stop him before he kills again.<br /><br />As usual, Allingham is a brilliant lens on the issues and problems of Europe between the wars. Artists and their models swirl through society life and the shocked countryside. The girls are entirely modern-- all sharp angles and violent emotions. Campion attends a cocktail party where \\"a dirty little thought concerning Hitler and the great Duke of Marlborough wafted across the smoke-laden air\\". These moments are Allingham at her best, and what lifts her books so far above the genre limitations.<br /><br />Ultimately, it is not the best or most successful Campion novel, in part because of the chances she takes with the relationship between Campion and his \\"dearest enemy\\". All the same, it is more than worth reading, and I recommend it highly.<br /><br />If you are not familiar with Allingham, I suggest that you find a copy of her work if you can. She deserves to be set next to Ngaio Marsh and Agatha Christie as one of the great pioneers of detective fiction.	2005-09-04

If you can, imagine a slice of time and space from The Structures of Everyday Life set in the world of An Embarassment of Riches. If you keep that idea in your head, and spice it with the tone of an occasionally ironic French medievalist then you have a fairly good idea what it is like to read Daily Life in Rembrandt's Holland.<br /><br />Daily Life looks at what living would have been like in the Netherlands from the years 1606 to 1669. These years were not only the demarcation of the life of Rembrandt, but also corresponded with the Dutch golden age. Instead of focusing on the great political and military movements that happened during that period (the end of hostilities with Spain and participation in the Thirty Years War), Zumthor chooses to write about the commonplace.<br /><br />The book is structured in eight chapters, with the first seven chapters addressing major subject groupings. The chapters include: The Background of Daily Life, The Dutch Interior, The Course of Life, Recreations, Arts and Letters, Dutch Society, and Holland At Work. The final chapter is a brief summing up in which Zumthor makes a number of points about Dutch life during that period that I believe would still be interesting and relevant when related to the Dutch society of today.<br /><br />Living in the Netherlands as an expatriate, I have read quite a few books about the history of the country in both English and Dutch. Daily Life is a fine addition to my collection, and a very enjoyable reading experience. The translation by Simon Watson Taylor is clean and smooth and managed to capture the obvious quirks of the tone of the author. It is a good complement to Schama's book An Embarrassment of Riches. If it is less of a book than the Schama it is because the more encyclopedic nature of the project lacked a bit of depth and narrative flow.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to other expatriates living in the Netherlands who would like to know a bit more about the history of the country. I can imagine that it would also be invaluable to someone who wanted to get a feel for the background of life at that time. Please note that Rembrandt is not the subject of the book, and his life is only used as a ruler to mark the relevant time period.try.

The author(s) of Monkeewrench ride again with another Minneapolis mystery. In this episode, Detective Magozzi is puzzled when it turns out that senior citizens are being horribly killed for no apparent reason. It is only when Grace McBride and her hacking skills are called into play that it becomes apparent that the murders they know about are only the tip of the iceberg...<br /><br />P.J. Tracy is known to most by now as actually being a mother-daughter writing team. The two of them are clearly doing something right because Live Bait is a taut fast read. I actually liked that it focused on Magozzi and the police rather than the all-too-colorful Monkeewrenchers. They do a good job of capturing the setting and the people with a minimum of waste and fuss.<br /><br />I would have given it more than three stars if it were not for the entirely contrived ending-- it was not necessary and it did not heighten the dramatic tension. I was actually pretty entertained by the book, and it is too bad that it ended with a dull clunk instead of a high note.<br /><br />If you are trying to figure out whether you will enjoy Live Bait, compare P.J. Tracy to Karen Slaughter or Val McDermid in terms of style and tone. Tracy likes her violence, so this is definitely not a cozy detective novel. I would recommend beginning with Monkeewrench, if you have not read it already, as I think that it is the better book. If you already read and enjoyed Monkeewrench, you should be aware that Grace is a very marginal character in this book and that it is much closer to a typical police procedural.	2005-09-03

Neither she or her cat, Divine Endurance, are what they seem and this is not your typical science fiction/fantasy novel.<br /><br />This is my second book by Gwyneth Jones. I decided to pick up Divine Endurance after being extremely impressed with Bold As Love. Sadly little known in the US, Jones is an award-winning British science fiction and fantasy author. She is justly famed for her inventiveness and the quality of her prose. Divine Endurance was her first novel.<br /><br />This post-apocalyptic Indonesia is an amazing and real place-- full of myths and shattered shards of society. Cho, her brother Worthy to Be Beloved, and the mysterious Divine Endurance are relics from the disasterous past-- angel dolls which act as a catalyst for change in the struggling world.<br /><br />If Divine Endurance has a flaw as a novel, it is largely that the world and the characters are better developed than the plot. It reminded me in many ways of The Etched City, by K.J. Bishop, although I think that the Jones book is ultimately more successful.<br /><br />If you are looking for something unusual and are a fan of dystopic or post-apocalypse science fiction (China Mieville, Sean McMullen) then I suggest that you give Divine Endurance a try. Certainly if you are a fan of any kind of intelligent science fiction or fantasy, then you should become familiar with Gwyneth Jones.	2005-08-27

The reaction was unusual for us in that quite a few people gave up reading without finishing. There were general complaints that the book was overly complicated, difficult to read, and that you needed an encyclopedia to follow all the historical references.<br /><br />I personally had the impression that reading the book was like having a mystery genre dream. You know that it is a mystery because there is a corpse and detective. But, on the other hand, it never becomes clear who the bad guys actually are. People come and go with odd items (musical instruments, for instance) and nobody really seems very interested in solving the mystery itself.<br /><br />I also had the feeling that I was missing quite a bit because the point of the book seems to be as much investigating the state of post-Franco Communist politics as it is a genre read. This is not  bad, but since my knowledge is rather limited in that area, a great deal of the book went winging over my head. I am curious as to whether someone more familiar with the ins and outs of Spanish politics would have found it a more engaging reading experience.<br /><br />Part of what made the book so difficult to read was very likely the translation. I do not know if it was intended to faithfully capture the original in this sense, but it seemed as though Patrick Camiller went out of his way to find the most obscure words possible for use in the edition. The book was also sadly full of typing and editorial errors that should have been caught before publication.<br /><br />There were enough moments in Murder in the Central Committee for me to get a feeling why Montalban has such an excellent reputation as a writer. I particularly admired the way that he drew characters. I liked Pepe and his quirks, and got more than a few chuckles out of his food obsessions and his habit of burning books instead of logs. I will probably give another one of his books a try to see if I am able to get more out of it as a reader.am able to get more out of it as a reader.	2005-08-27

I was looking for a decent overview of the history of Islam as a religion-- something that could set the stage for me without being too complex. A friend of mine in a religious studies program recommended Unfolding Islam to me as a suitable book for the purpose.<br /><br />Using simple writing and helpful diagrams, Stewart does a good job of presenting the history of Islam. He also highlights the different splits in belief and politics, trying to walk through a minefield in order to be objective. He only dips into obvious editorialization in the last chapter. I did not mind his opinion. However, because the thinking in the chapter is based in events current to the writing of the book and because the world situation as it relates to religion is very different now, it had the effect of dating the material.<br /><br />This book is clearly written for a western audience, and might well be too basic for someone who already had the background I was lacking. I would, however, recommend it for the purpose that I originally had in mind. Stewart and/or his editors also get extra points for the well-organised pointers to futher reading at the back of the book.	2005-08-18

I am curious as to whether this will be the last book in the series. At the very least, it is clearly the end of their high school years and Brashares provides more than enough resolution of conflict to go around. By the end of the book, ghosts are laid to rest, romances are started and futures appear to be bright.<br /><br />While still a great book, Girls in Pants was for me the weakest of the three books. One of the things that I liked about the first two was the more \\"warts and all\\" character of the series, and it was a little disappointing that Brashares felt the need to work everything out before the girls go off to college. Bear in mind that I am not a teenager, and therefore not the target reader. Readers who are the more appropriate target for YA books may not mind the resolution as much.<br /><br />My minor quarrels aside, Girls in Pants is still a worthy heir to the first two books. I may have given this one four stars, but I would still give five stars to the series as a whole. I liked them enough to sit down and read all three in one week!	2005-08-18

Lately, I have been reading a lot of books based on the recommendation of my sister. I will confess that when she handed me this to read my eyebrows went up and I made her a vague promise about trying to get to it. I am currently in my mid-thirties and feeling every year of it. I really was not sure that I wanted to invest any time and energy in a book about the trials and tribulations of teenage girls.<br /><br />Wow. Am I glad that I changed my mind and read it. I liked it so much that I stole the other two from my sister as well and devoured them both in the space of a week. Think of this series as the literary equivalent of a chick flick for the thinking woman.<br /><br />Brashares has written a smart, funny and kind look at those confusing teenage years. She gets credit for (generally) not pulling punches and for clearly articulating a lot of the home truths of the lifetime. Using the lens of four very different girls whose bonding tie is that they were all born in the same month, the author created a cross-section of a very particular world.<br /><br />I liked it a lot, and I suspect that it will fast become a great guilty pleasure for a lot of adult women like myself. It probably goes without saying that it seems to me as though it would also make a good gift for teenage girls. The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants does treat with some fairly serious topics, so parents of pre-teens might want to give it a read themselves before buying it for their kids.	2005-08-18

I was late on board the Harry Potter train, but have read each book with increasing enthusiasm.<br /><br />Nearing the end of their school years, it becomes clear to Harry Potter and friends that they are increasingly forced to act as adults in their own right. A theme about the inability to rely on grown-up authority figures has been building through the last few books, and reaches its climax in the Half-Blood Prince. I expect that Rowling will move us through this cycle soon, but it has been interesting and daring. The claustrophobia and inability to trust (while still desiring mentoring) are areas of being a teenager that most YA authors do not dare touch.<br /><br />I am starting to need more resolution from each installment, I prefer series entries that are more stand alone novels in their own right-- this ends with too much of a cliffhanger for that. Cliffhangers will work in a shorter series, but I somehow have the feeling that we have several more books to go before we are done with Harry Potter.	2005-08-18

If you have not read the first book in the series, then go no further with this book until you have! If you have already read the sparkling The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants then look no further. The Second Summer of the Sisterhood picks up the thread in the same lively spirit and is an excellent sequel to the first book.<br /><br />In The Second Summer, Brashares offers the reader girls facing the deepening conflict of growing up. Instead of the glowing perfect summer of love that they had planned to have, they instead seem to spend their time wrestling with their history and the events triggered during the summer before. While this book is less light and less funny, the loss is compensated for by being more moving. As in the first book, Brashares deserves a lot of credit for using the YA genre to create a portrait of teenagers that is both entertaining and emotionally spot-on.<br /><br />Although potentially more disturbing, The Second Summer actually has less adult material than the first book. It should be fine for pre-teens and teenagers alike.	2005-08-18

On a recent vacation together to the North Shore, my sister gave me her copy of The Time Traveler's Wife and told me that she thought I would enjoy reading it.<br /><br />It seems that there are a number of reasons to be skeptical about the novel. Time travel sounds like science fiction, which I am sure put off a number of people. To me, the book looked suspiciously like a romance novel-- definitely not my cup of tea. In fact, the mixture of time travel (*very* light on the science fiction) and romance is one that goes together surprisingly well and should appeal to many readers.<br /><br />Niffenegger has not written a perfect book. It pushes several of the sentimental buttons a little bit too hard. While much of it is genuinely moving, there are several occasions (his feet!) where she crosses the line from moving to manipulative. As a consequence, it is a very nice book instead of a really great book.<br /><br />Still, I enjoyed the Time Traveler's Wife very much. If my sister had not given it to me to read, she would be getting it for Christmas as a gift. Its bittersweet tone will appeal to readers who enjoyed a book like The Lovely Bones by Alice Seybold. If you want a book that will make you laugh, think, and cry a little then this is a good bet, either for yourself or as a gift. Although there are adult aspects to the novel, it should be suitable for older teenagers.	2005-08-17

(Believe it or not, the French *can* laugh at themselves!) I picked it up to read on a recent long airplane trip based on Antoine's good review.<br /><br />I am going to condemn the book with faint praise by saying that it was entertaining enough. It kept the pages turning, and I chuckled out loud several times-- particularly in the first few chapters of the book. Clarke is a smooth writer, if sometimes a little too slick.<br /><br />Strong things about the book: The eye for French foibles is very good-- particularly the points relating to food, corruption, and French country houses. You can also derive some genuinely useful pointers about how to order in Paris bars from reading the advice that the main character receives.<br /><br />Weak things about the book: The plot, particularly in the second half of the book. Jean-Marie is too much-- even if he is based on real life. The humor in the little details is much less funny because the large strokes of the plot are too slapstick for them to contrast well. The women are also annoying. I would expect that French women as exotic sexual other has been done to death as a plot point-- but being neither male nor British perhaps I am just the wrong audience for the sexcapades?<br /><br />All told, not a bad book for an airplane ride or as a preparation for a stay in Paris. I might, though, look for it second-hand.	2005-08-17

This is a book which is getting a ton of publicity because it was written by a 15 year old. I wish that I had known that before I bought it, because I would have read it very differently and perhaps not bought it at all.<br /><br />Eragon is a heck of an achievement for any young person-- let's start with that remark. Literary judgement aside, Paolini created a 497 page novel that hangs together reasonably well at an age when many kids have trouble turning out a ten page book report. So, well done! There are many really nice moments in the book, and it kept me reading despite the flaws. He shows a real flare for writing about politics and he has very smooth and mature diction when he writes.<br /><br />However, as a fantasy read it leaves a great deal to be desired. It is clearly very derivative-- the sources from which it draws are barely disguised at all. The hero is unreasonably good at everything he does, and the dragon is very conveniently wise. Perhaps if you have not read the books from which this is drawn it will not grate quite as much, but in a writer of any other age the direct lending of moments from other writers would not have been tolerated.<br /><br />I am not sure that Random House has done Paolini a service by publishing this book. He is clearly potentially a very talented writer, and I look forward to reading his adult work when he is more able to incorporate his influences into his own vision. A book should be able to stand on its own without the corresponding footnote excusing the quality based on the age of the author. I hope that he is realizes that different standards will be required, once he no longer qualifies as a prodigy.	2005-08-15

I wasn't the right reader.	Dawnthief is likely to appeal to the reader who wants a military fantasy with an emphasis on the bonds of teaming. There is a great deal of action, reasonably complex military thinking, and a focus on brotherhood.<br /><br />The basic idea behind the notion of the books of the Raven is that there is a mercenary group  which has become the best in the land by virtue of the fact that it puts the group above (almost) all other things. In this introductory book, the surviving members of the Raven give up the notion of retirement in order to fight a desperate battle for the higher good of the entire nation.<br /><br />I am a fantasy reader who enjoys complex politics, detailed descriptions and a great deal of individual character development. (Think George R.R. Martin or Tad Williams as writers). If you are a reader like myself, there is a reasonably good chance that Dawnthief is not going to be your cup of tea. If you are a more Marion Zimmer Bradley or Sheri S. Tepper kind of fantasy reader (priestesses, universal bonds of understanding, etc.) then this is *definitely* not going to be the book for you.<br /><br />I suspect that the ideal reader of this book is someone who gets bored with all the talkative bits of some of the more drawn out fantasies, and would like more action and military bonding.<br /><br />The system of magic is well-created and as noted before, Barclay is a skilled writer of action scenes. I found some of the character development truly awful (most notably Erienne, the only significant female character), but then the individual character is not really the point of the reading experience. If you are the right reader for this book, then the minor quarrels should not bother you. If you are the wrong reader, best to give it a miss.	2005-08-15

In this stand-alone novel, Lee explores an earth which has been decimated by invading aliens. The surviving humans are forced underground to live their lives the best that they can.<br /><br />Generations after they went to earth, a young girl named Esther defies what seem to her like useless laws forbidding them to go to the surface. When her tell-tale tan gives her away, she is taken to the leader of their community and her real adventure begins...<br /><br />The apocalypse is a convenient vehicle for one of the favorite Lee themes-- the value of the strong and contrary individual will. Esther is able to overcome all obstacles simply by believing in herself and refusing to accept false goals as an end state. While Esther herself is a very well-drawn character, the plotting suffers from its nearly exclusive focus on her stubborness. The aliens are sketchily plotted, nearly to the point of total invisibility. The ending is very poor and reads as though Lee ran out of steam.<br /><br />The book will probably appeal to the teenage reader (particularly the teenage girl?). However, parents should note that there are several reasonably graphic sex scenes, including some non-consensual sex. It should be fine for the older teenager, but should not be confused with a book suitable for a YA audience. If you have not read Lee before, I would recommend beginning with the Flat Earth series in place of this novel.	2005-08-15

Ian Rankin deserves more credit than he ever gets for consistently writing book after book while maintaining a high level of quality. The first Rebus novel was published in 1987, and each series entry has been, if not as good as the last, then pretty darned close to it.<br /><br />In Fleshmarket Close, Rankin takes on the topic of immigration and policing and manages to do a much better job of tackling the issue than many detective writers who make social problems their favorite subject matter. The treatment is balanced, the character development is strong, and the plotting intriguing. There is also development in the characters of Rebus and Clarke that keeps the series fresh.<br /><br />One minor quarrel-- why did the US publisher change the title from Fleshmarket Close to Fleshmarket Alley? The book is set in Scotland, and surely US audiences are more tolerant than that.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of intelligent procedurals. Rankin fans will not be disappointed.	2005-08-15

This was my first Sheriff Brady mystery, and I would be willing to pick up another if the circumstances are right. Paradise Lost is a decently written page-turner which kept my interest much more than I expected it to do.<br /><br />There are lots and lots of stones that you could throw at the book. The resolution at the end is annoyingly complete for everybody, with even the annoying mother being rehabilitated. Butch Dixon does not seem to have a flaw. Her daughter is amazingly understanding and contrite. I guess that kind of happy ending goes with the cozy territory, so I will not complain too much.<br /><br />Jance seems to work less in traditional cozy whodunnit territory, and is more interested in incorporating the mystery aspects of the sheriff job with the personal ups and downs of her life. Think of it as a kind of cozy procedural and you will get the picture.<br /><br />The writing is not elegant, but good enough to keep the plot moving. This would be a good book to waste a few hours or as a gift for the younger teenager who is just starting to explore the mystery genre.	2005-08-04

I do not think that it is a success, although it has some spectacular sections and the quality of the writing is very high. Still, I am not sure that I would recommend this book to anyone who was not either a fan of Sayles as a director or someone interested in literature dealing with the Bay of Pigs.<br /><br />Like many Sayles films, Los Gusanos is an ensemble piece. Reading the plot synopsis may give you the impression that the book is about Marta and her mission. Nothing could be further from the truth. Much like Joan of Arc (who she idolizes) Marta is nearly perfectly opaque-- her thoughts and motivations unclear. We are granted a look into the deepest thoughts and memories of many of the characters, making nearly everyone else more transparent than she. Even the stroke-disabled inarticulate father has his stream-of-consciousness fits of rage. Marta is cool, unapproachable, and we only really see her thinking when she mixes her voice with that of the diary of her dead brother.<br /><br />It is an interesting thing that despite the resistance that Sayles clearly has to traditional narrative form, his films succeed the most (Lone Star, Passion Fish, Matewan) when we still have a central character or characters where the audience can fix their focus. One of the main problems with Los Gusanos is that this focus is lost, making the reading experience difficult and even occasionally broken despite the device of the new invasion. I found that I resented getting so close to so many characters who made only brief appearances. Villas is a good example of that-- I wanted so much more of his story than Los Gusanos gave me. A stronger central thread would have made this objection less serious, or even removed it altogether.<br /><br />I also found the the device of switching between Spanish and English was at least a little bit irritating, particularly in passages where we know that the entire conversation was held in Spanish. It had the unfortunate effect of being the literary equivalent of giving the Spanish film characters a strong Spanish accent when they talk amongst themselves in English.<br /><br />There are an awful lot of good things in this book, and if you are interested in reading it then please do not let this review dissuade you. Sayles has his usual glittering and objective eye for the politics of the situation-- seeing all sides clearly and seemingly without judgement. Like I said earlier, if you are already a fan of his cinematic work you should find a lot of the best elements back in this novel.ween Spanish and English was at least a little bit irritating, particularly in passages where we know that the entire conversation was held in Spanish.

True.<br /><br />\\"Extremely sentimental & Incredibly true\\"? Contradictory, but also true.<br /><br />I am sure that you can think of your own mix of metaphors and adjectives once you have read this book.<br /><br />And read it you should. Make no mistake, despite my three star rating, I would encourage most readers to give the book a go. Unlike many of his muchly-hyped age contemporaries, Foer is a *very* good writer. If he can survive being as famous and as charming as he is than he might eventually be a great writer. Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close is a big talented mess of a book, and one that is worth the time to read.<br /><br />I am sorry to report that the gimcrackery of the typographic stuff is not a success. As a result, the thread most affected by the tricks is drowned. I personally got so annoyed by trying to wade through the one line text/mushed together text/ circled text that I wanted to abandon nearly all of the material about Dresden. The use of the images was not bad, although the famous reverse flip book at the end had the unfortunate feel of an idea that was very useful in the writing process but that probably should have been cut before printing. He could have still gotten away with it had it been the only self-indulgence, but sadly that was not the case.<br /><br />What makes the book still such a very good read are the very clean and pure lines involving Oskar and the way that he looks for resolution to his grief. The moment of loss in which you become a detective of the life of the departed is an important one and generally very poorly treated. Oskar has the luck or misfortune to have lost his father in such a way that the whole world would like to help him resolve the mystery. It is the saving grace of the novel that even though so much of the rest is so self-indulgent and sentimental, the very heart of the thing is written with truth and clarity of vision.<br /><br />Everything is Illuminated is a better book, but it takes less chances. Depending on what you are in the mood for, I would recommend either one if you have not read Foer before. He is a writer to watch, and one who I hope is not completely overwhelmed by the hype surrounding him.is Illuminated is a better book, but it takes less chances.

I read historical mysteries very reluctantly, I have to admit. Generally either the history or the mystery gets lost in the mix, and it is a rare writer who can do the two things well at the same time. I am happy to report that with the second novel in the Matthew Shardlake series, C.J. Sansom has confirmed that he is one of those rare writers.<br /><br />As in Dissolution, Sansom combines politics with detection-- providing a nice motivation for further discovery of evidence. There are two main threads in this book. One story is the murder of a young boy, supposed to have been murdered by his cousin. The second story centers on the rediscovery of the of Greek Fire. Both cases converge on the same deadline, and rely on the ability of Shardlake to resolve.<br /><br />In some respects, this is a better book than Dissolution. The work is more polished and the plot points nearly flawlessly constructed. The only thing that concerns me is that I missed a little bit of the tension around the character of Shardlake that Sansom created so effortlessly in Dissolution. One of the nicest things about the first book was the way that Shardlake lost his belief in reform. In Dark Fire, that fall from innocence is substituted by generally writing Shardlake as naive. While that worked for this book, I hope that Samson will write a  deeper emotional impact from the politics into the upcoming third book in the series (Sovereign).<br /><br />If you are a fan of historical mysteries, or even if you are not, Dark Fire is a wonderful book. If you have not read Sansom before, you could begin with Dark Fire without losing very much. However, I would still suggest that you begin with Dissolution as it provides more backstory into Shardlake and his relationship with Cromwell. Readers who enjoyed Dissolution already should be reassured that Dark Fire lives up to its illustrious predecessor.	2005-07-31

It is as though what he found in Australia startled him into crystalizing a lifetime worth of disparate thoughts. More than classic travel writing or essay form, The Songlines captures the struggle to put this overarching thesis into words.<br /><br />The struggle of the Aborigines to preserve their traditional form of worship against disinterest, hostility and monied patronization is one of the central contemporary aspects of the book. Additionally, Chatwin draws from sources as disparate as Konrad Lorenz, religious myth, and Herman Melville to construct his arguments.<br /><br />I found Songlines largely successful. As someone who once walked from Holland to Spain I have a soft spot for discourse about the philosophy of walking. I also greatly admire Chatwin as a writer, so did not have any expectations that this would be a \\"normal\\" travel book. I strongly suspect that the method he uses (journal fragments and quotations interspersed throughout) may not work for many readers and it ultimately might have been stronger had he found a more integrated narrative form.<br /><br />In short, this should be a very strong read if you are interested in the ideas at the center of the work. If you have read this far in the review it probably goes without saying that this is not the book for a typical travel essay about life in the Australian bush. Look elsewhere if that is what you are trying to find. I find it an excellent addition to the Chatwin body of work-- a body of work that is far too small as a result of his untimely death in 1989.	2005-07-30

I am honestly a little bit dubious about the flood of vampire series currently in the market following the success of Buffy and co. A friend of mine recommended Dhampir, but I must confess that I was not expecting a lot from it.<br /><br />I was very pleasantly surprised. I found the writing clean and fresh. The characters of Magiere and Leesil are engaging and there seems to be enough backstory to keep the reader busy for several books, at least.<br /><br />Compare this book to the writing of Kristen Britain or Mercedes Lackey. If you are more demanding of your fantasy, you should realize that this is a more typical genre entry than something by a more boundary-stretching author (Tim Powers or Neil Gaiman). If this kind of thing is your cuppa tea, then Dhampir is a good use of a few hours.	2005-07-21

Have I mentioned lately that Peter Hamilton is one of the best currently working science fiction authors? If you have not heard that, take it from me-- his work is simply spectacular.<br /><br />Pandora's Star may not be for everyone, regardless how good of a writer Hamilton is.  Clocking in at 1144 pages, it is a daunting book. It gets even worse when you open it up and see the itsy bitsy typefont that was used in the print run.  And, yes, the point that several other reviews have made is true. This book has several significant cliff-hangers at the end. The readers are going to have to pick up Judas Unchained to see what happens.<br /><br />But even with all that, the pages literally flew by. The various disparate characters and settings were extremely well-written. The background of his future world is rich and fully developed. I actually laughed out loud in the first 20 pages of the book, not very usual in High Space Opera. I was particularly enthralled by the threads involving Ozzie and the High Angel.<br /><br />If you have not read Hamilton before, and you know that you do not have the patience for really long stories, you may want to consider checking out the Greg Mandel series first. Beginning with Mindstar Rising, the Mandel books are much shorter and more classic genre entries. However, if you like intelligent science fiction, you should not let the size of the book put you off. It is a compulsively good read. It went by much faster than I either wanted or expected. I cannot wait to read Judas Unchained. I may even spring for the hard cover edition.	2005-07-20

It may sound as though I am damning this book with faint praise, but I believe that with a subject as complicated as anti-western feeling there are few better places to begin than with a good conversation opener.<br /><br />Written in clear non-academic language, Buruma and Margalit have written a book-length essay which further elaborates on the article which they published several years ago in the New York Review of Books. The point of the project is to posit a hypothesis on the roots of anti-western feeling and use that to draw open the discussion as to how the gap can be repaired.<br /><br />I notice that the original article sparked much less disappointment than the book. There is something about the translation to book form which implies a level of completion or comprehensiveness that an essay by itself cannot achieve. You will find that most reviewers (myself included) had a list of things that we missed in their overview. These omissions felt serious to me, but I notice that the lists have very little in common. It is truly not possible to please everyone or include everything, so perhaps it is just as well that they did not try.<br /><br />If you already have an adament point of view in this discussion, then this book may well irritate you. Buruma and Margalit clearly do their best to be as objective as possible, given their own cultural bias. If, however, you are like me and mostly have a clear view about your own lack of answers then you will probably find this a valuable reading experience. Since reading it, I lent the book to a good friend (sorry, publishers!) and we have not been able to stop discussing the points that it raised. Quite an accomplishment, in my opinion, for a self-described short history.	2005-07-20

Pretty much the only thing that you can count on in her works is that the descriptions will be lush and that there will be a thread of darkness that runs throughout.<br /><br />The Storm King is an early Lee novel (1976) that opens up a three book series called the Novels of Vis. It tells the story of a war between two human races that is fought through the agency of two half-brothers and their respective Gods.<br /><br />If you are familiar with Lee as a writer, you might think of this book as a combination between the Flat Earth books and the stand alone novel A Heroine of the World. Lee combines much of the mythology and magic of Flat Earth with a strong focus on politics and characters.<br /><br />This combination is not always hugely successful. While the first half of the novel is compelling, and moves swiftly, the second half is bogged down by a multitude of place names and characters. Unfortunately, a number of the characters have similar sounding names so that when they reappear, the reader is really forced back into the pages to check who it was again.<br /><br />Fans of Lee should enjoy the book. It seems a promising start to the series and a nice variation on a theme. I would direct readers new to Lee toward the Flat Earth books as I still find them to be her strongest novels.	2005-07-10

Be prepared to enjoy the book, but hold your nose through chapters 34 to 36.<br /><br />This said, I still think that Reichs continues to improve as an author. I like her later work much better than her earlier work. Her basic formula is still the same. She takes a current social issue and explores it through the use of forensic detective work. However, the first few outings lacked any real character focus in the villains which really limited the tension that Reichs was able to achieve. She has progressed a lot from pitting Tempe against anonymous biker gangs. The bad guys in this book have some character and motivation and are more than just a social problem in aggregate come to life.<br /><br />I think that Reichs fans will be pleased with this one. She continues to impressively work forensic science into the mystery form. I found it a reasonably pleasurable use of a few hours.	2005-07-09

McDermid is an excellent writer. Very few writers could deal with the ultra-violent spectrum of crime without descending into sensationalism. McDermid manages to straddle that line beautifully. I never get the feeling that she is intending to titillate with the suffering of the victims.<br /><br />While it is nice to see Hill and Jordan together again, the book unfortunately lacks a bit of the spark that made a book like The Wire in the Blood so great. I would truthfully give this book three or three-and-a-half stars, but have rounded it up out of deference to the very high quality of the prose. I am not really sure what is missing, but it somehow felt like we were back again at the same point that we were at the beginning of the series, only with everyone a little bit more battered. Carol Jordan, in particular, needs to have some progression that is not rooted in emotional damage.<br /><br />One unfortunate note was that I guessed the identity of the villain very early on. I am not sure if that is a fault in the plotting or just a lucky guess on my part. Whichever was the case, it took a lot of tension out of the reading experience for me.<br /><br />If you have never read a Hill-Jordan McDermid before, then I would recommend that you consider starting with The Wire in the Blood or The Mermaids Singing. Established fans will probably get what they came for, but should be aware that The Torment of Others is far from the best in the series.	2005-07-09

I am a long time fan of Feist, having read most of his work prior to this series. I was honestly initially fairly dubious about this new direction. I found Talon of the Silver Hawk (the first book in the Conclave of Shadows) to be entertaining enough and a nice coming of age story, but a far cry from the politically and emotionally complex stories that make Feist such an exceptional fantasy writer.<br /><br />While I still think that Magician and its followers are the superior series, King of Foxes has changed my mind about the Conclave of Shadows. I found it entertaining and satisfying and I am pretty sure that I am not going to wait as long to buy the third book as I did to buy the second.<br /><br />I think that the main difference is that it no longer feels like a straight-up fantasy coming of age series which is grafted into Midkemia, with special guest appearances by Pug and company. This book feels much better integrated into the series landscape and is much less a standard fantasy outing. I still have points to quibble about (the jailbreak and miraculous healing strained the bounds of credulity, I'm afraid) but these issues were easy to forgive given the value of the whole package.<br /><br />Feist fans should heave a sigh of relief with this series entry. If you have not read Feist before, I would recommend that you start with the Magician series. I think that it helps to have some background in Midkemia to get the most out of the Conclave of Shadows.	2005-07-08

Lythande is a series of stories written by Bradley both for and under the inspiration of the Thieves World series. The mysterious magician Lythande was created as one of the sorcerers in the original Thieves World cast of characters. She is a mysterious entity, committed to the cause of order and doomed to never reveal her identity as a woman.<br /><br />Essentially, Bradley only contributed to the first volume of Thieves World, but the Lythande character lived on after that introduction. This volume contains not only the story from Volume 1 but also contains stories pubished elsewhere as stand alone fantasy stories. The last short story in the collection, \\"Satan\\", is actually written by Vonda N. Mcintyre for Thieves World and uses the Lythande character.<br /><br />For established MZB fans, the forewords she wrote for each story are almost as good to read as the stories themselves. These are almost little essays that explain the evolution of Lythande and summarize Bradley's thinking on issues as diverse as feminism, mediocrity and humor.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Thieves World, but are not familiar with Bradley, these stories should serve as a good introduction to her work. If you have read neither Thieves World nor any other Bradley, then I would begin elsewhere-- either with Volume 1 or with the Darkover series, respectively. These are enjoyable stories, but they do not really compare to the major body of work associated with either source.	2005-07-05

Readers unfamiliar with Richard Yates can do much worse than to begin with this wonderful collection of stories. I believe that the Collected Stories will stand next to Revolutionary Road as the two best examples of his work.<br /><br />Yates is absolutely unflinching in his examination of the average life. There is self-deception everywhere he turns his gaze, even in the smallest most unassuming dreams. The moments of grace and humor are there as well, but they are small, often accidental, and generally not able to be seen or accepted by the characters to whom they are offered. In \\"Builders\\", the narrator bursts out in frustration at the seeming lack of hope:<br /><br />\\"And where are the windows? Where does the light come in?<br /><br />Bernie, old friend, forgive me, but I haven't got the answer to that one. I'm not even sure if there are any windows in this particular house. Maybe the light is just going to have to come in as best it can, through whatever chinks and cracks have been left in the builder's faulty craftsmanship, and if that's the case you can be sure that nobody feels worse about it than I do. God knows, Bernie; God knows there certainly ought to be a window around here somewhere, for all of us.\\"<br /><br />Read this remarkable book. It would make a great gift for anyone who appreciates writers such as Flannery O'Connor, Richard Russo, JM Coetzee or Richard Ford.	2005-07-05

Davita's Harp blends historical fiction, politics, religion and issues of immigration & identity together with the story of a young girl coming of age. The result is an agreeable and very readable novel.<br /><br />Davita is surrounded by people who are unable in one way or another to negotiate compromise. The communist beliefs of her parents, the extremely divergent religious views of her extended family, her environment at school-- none of her potential role models offer her a strong basis for building her own identity. Eventually, however, Davita does begin to choose a road for her life and she does it with her own unique flavor and on her own terms. Her story is lovely, and very inspiring.<br /><br />I would recommend this book highly as a gift for high school students, particularly girls. Davita makes a wonderful role model and it should be meaningful to young people struggling with issues of religion and identity-- any religion. One of the key messages of Davita's Harp is that it is possible to choose for a religion and community without sacrificing your other beliefs. It is unique in that it shows religion both as a steadying force and as an evolving imperfect system. I can certainly think back to a time in my life when it would have been very helpful to see a way forward that was more than the choice between inside and out.<br /><br />Additionally, the period prior to World War II is a largely forgotten moment in time. The view on post-depression labor relations, the Spanish Civil War, and the treatment of the so-called premature antifascists makes for fascinating reading.	2005-07-02

It was the first Woolf that I ever attempted to read. I have a very clear memory of literally wrestling with the text one night while I was babysitting. I made notes in the margins and kept lists and tried all kinds of ways to figure out what Woolf was doing and what she was saying. It was frustrating, because she is such a beautiful writer that I really wanted to understand it more than I did.<br /><br />Over the years since that time, I have read a number of other Woolf novels, and loved them. I have always been a little bit nervous about going back to Mrs. Dalloway. I had some time recently, so I finally decided to give it a go.<br /><br />I am not sure if the difference is age, or familiarity with her prose, but I had no trace of the same difficulty that I had experienced 20 years ago. If you let go and simply enjoy the writing, then the book is just lovely and stunningly clear.<br /><br />Some people kill themselves. Other people survive and give parties. Both choices carry with them their own moral consequences. The world is beautiful, and full of flowers, but also and impossibly full of separation and isolation. I think that part of the difference in understanding is truly age. At 16 I could (dimly) understand Septimus and the young Sally. But I had no perspective to understand Clarissa Dalloway herself. It had not occurred to me yet that living to give parties is also a choice, and one as awful in its own way as the option Septimus takes.<br /><br />It has been suggested that this book makes a good companion to reading or screening The Hours. I second that notion. I actually think that it particularly illuminates the film, but it goes well with both if you have not read it. I suppose that it goes without saying that this is not the place that I would recommend beginning with Virginia Woolf. But then again, you never know. It is such a lovely work and there are bound to be people who are more successful than I was reading it the first time around.d.	2005-07-02

Dan Brown books are so formulaic that it is not even worth the time to complain about it. If you cannot swallow genre chestnuts, look elsewhere, this is not the book for you.  If you like your formula backed up with cool bits of semi-legitimate historical puzzles and religious research, then it may be exactly what you you hoped to find.<br /><br />Angels and Demons is a lot like a roller coaster-- even though you know the big hill is coming, it still is a lot of fun to stick your hands up in the air and scream. There are no surprises here, but who cares? Buckle in, and enjoy the ride.	2005-07-02

Airy, smart and sweet are the three best words that I can use to describe this memoir. It suffers a little bit from its specificity (I do not think that it would appeal to all readers) and then a little bit more from its girly magazine-article tone. As a travel book, it is incomplete-- the relationship issues detracting from the scenery. As a relationship book, the travel episodes add a nice touch. They provide the reader with the exotic along with the comfortable.<br /><br />The use Fraser makes of the second person narration has been mentioned elsewhere, and I do not wish to belabor the point. However, it seriously detracts from the charms of the book and tends to make the really very nice prose sound like a poor Duras imitation. I would be interested to read something else by Fraser, but in the next outing I hope that she leaves this particular affectation at home.<br /><br />I would recommend this book as a nice beach read this summer. It has a lot of the comfort value of a romance novel, but a lot more sense and charm. For the right reader, this is exactly the right book.	2005-06-28

After a promising beginning with Nemesis, the Indigo series falls into a dip in Inferno. Indigo is led by her quest of reparation to a mining town on the edge of a desert. As they arrive in the town, it is clear that something is very wrong and Indigo does not have to look much farther to find one of her demons...<br /><br />The character of Indigo is a lot of what made Nemesis such an interesting book. She is a little bit faded here, and much more predictable than she was initially. The plot is very flat, and many of the plot points feel like retreads of the first book. Worst of all, Indigo becomes tiresome and petulant instead of convincingly enraged. Her challenge could have been handled with much more depth than it really was.<br /><br />Cooper remains a talented writer, and I realize that this book is not a good indication of her skills. This is really a two and a half star review, but I am giving it a little bounce for the promising start in the first book. I will give the third a try, and see if it improves.	2005-06-28

Sometimes I think that the Thieves' World editions that work the best are the books with the least number of contributors. Whatever the formula, Aftermath functions beautifully as a book and has a lot of the good stuff that makes the series so addictive. There are a handful of really interesting new characters put into play (Star, Samlor, Cade). Additionally, a number of the more established dramatis personae makes some significant steps forward (Illyra, Kama and Hans).<br /><br />Writers in this volume include: Asprin & Abbey, David Drake, Mark C.  Perry, Janet Morris, John Brunner and Andrew Offutt.<br /><br />After the minor disappointment of Book 8 and the more hopeful turn in Book 9, Thieves' World readers should really enjoy Aftermath. As usual, begin this series at the beginning. It will be too much work to catch up with the backstory if you try to jump in so late in the series.	2005-06-27

Honestly, I bought this book for the photographs. Having suffered through any number of star autobiographies I was expecting the book itself to be nothing more than at best a guilty pleasure. It was a pleasant surprise to find The Times We Had refreshing, engaging and moving.<br /><br />In the summer of 1951, Davies began recording her memories of life with Hearst on tape. The book was not published during her lifetime and is a fairly literal transcription of the tapes (with some-- occasionally very odd-- editorial comments). The diction of the book is particularly striking. I suppose this is because it is really captured Davies spoken words. So often in ghost-written celebrity autobiography you have a strange blandness that makes it sound like a poor magazine article. By contrast, even though the book is not written in the most professional way, it has a strong feeling of immediacy and authenticity.<br /><br />Davies can be astonishingly blunt, and makes no attempt to make herself look better or to filter the events of her life. For example, there is one eyebrow-raising moment where she discusses how disappointed she had been that she did not get to meet Hitler. She had met Mussolini and clearly thought that it would be really cool to meet Hitler as well. This is not the book to read if you are looking for political reflection or self-examination in the context of world events.<br /><br />That said, it is really hard not to like the Marion Davies of the book. There is a very nice practical energy to her voice that is both refreshing and interesting to read. Anne Lindbergh once said that of all the people surrounding Hearst, she found Davies the most stable. After reading this, I get a sense of what she meant.<br /><br />As noted, the editorial presence is a little strange. Pfau and Marx are enthusiastic about Davies, but slightly random. The book is published with a foreword by Orson Welles in which he sets out to prove that Marion Davies is not Susan Alexander Kane.<br /><br />The Times We Had would be great summer reading for a film fan, or for someone looking for something a cut above the typical airplane book.

Cherryh writes about the experience of writing for the Thieves' World series:<br /><br />\\"The honest truth is that we have very little idea what will happen. Unplanned war breaks out in the streets. It lurches and falters in settlements, just the way it does in real life, my friends, because certain people in it have to get certain things or believe there is a way out, or they go on fighting. Feuds break out between characters and resolve themselves they way they do in live-- with some change in both characters. Characters mutate and grow and turn out to have aspects that surprise even their creator.\\"<br /><br />As a reader, it is that very quality of evolving chaos and unpredictability that makes the series so much fun to read. At its best, there is a measure of barely controlled chaos that keeps the twists and turns interesting. At its worst, the different voices can mix badly and turn characters into a kind of confused mush.<br /><br />This edition contains both the best and the worst of what the volumes can be. Blood Ties has a number of really impressive writers associated with the stories: Cherryh, Diana L. Paxson, Janet & Chris Morris, the two editors, Diane Duane, Robert Wayne Bailey, and Andrew & Jodie Offutt. The combined talents are less effective when they deal with the complicated alliances and tensions in Sanctuary (\\"Sanctuary is for Lovers\\", \\"Lovers who Slay Together\\") but there are also some truly inspired and even very moving sections-- the fate of Siveni Grey-Eyes in \\"The Tie that Binds\\" and the brilliant introduction of Strick in \\"Spellmaster.\\"<br /><br />As always, you cannot pick up volume 9 of Thieves' World without having read 1-8. Begin at the beginning, if you have not had any introduction to the characters before. If you are a veteran of Sanctuary and were wondering whether this is worth the effort (Volume 8 was a little bit disappointing, IMO) then you should rest assured that it is moving in the right direction. Blood Ties is worth the time to read, and reopens a number of interesting new directions for the poor beleaguered city.is moving in the right direction.

You sometimes hear said about a book or an event that it has \\"something for everybody\\". I think that with Snow, we finally have an example of a book where that really does seem to be the case.<br /><br />Reading the reviews and commentary, one of the things that strikes me is how various are the remarks and points of view about the book. For one reviewer, it is clearly a political novel. For another, it is first and foremost a love story. The back of my paperback edition describes it as a political thriller. In her New York Times review, Margaret Atwood pauses to comment that Pamuk has finally given us strong female characters who resist the gaze of the male narrators. A friend of mine was avidly interested in what insight the book could provide into the European debate about the French law forbidding the headscarf in French public schools. Last but not least, an online poetry community that I read has been comparing this book to the work of Borges and positioning it as a novel which explores the role of poetry as a medium in a world that is political, brutal, and beautiful all at the same time.<br /><br />It is a measure of how great an accomplishment Pamuk has achieved that in truth Snow is able to function on all of these levels and still be a readable and coherent whole.<br /><br />Snow is, inevitably, a political novel. Written before 9-11, it asks questions that feel as prescient as a crystal ball about which pressures have created violent political Islam. It is also a love story. The interconnected relationships between Ka, Ipek, Kadife and Blue are true and real and very moving.  It is also a political thriller, as a most unlikely coup happens in the town of Kars. Kadife can never be confused with an idealized muse or love interest, despite the best efforts of the male characters who want her to stand for the perfect woman. And as for the debate about the conflict between the secular and the religious in public life-- in my opinion, Snow should be required reading for anyone with an interest in the topic. Finally, it is also a book with some very smart things to say about poetry. It is not praising Pamuk too highly to compare him to Borges. He deserves to stand in that company.<br /><br />This is a novel for anyone with an interest in intelligent writing. If you are a fan of Don Delillo, Kafka, Borges or Paul Auster, this should be a book for you. Even in translation, the quality of the writing is simply breathtaking.an interest in the topic.

Queen Zixi of Ix is far and away my favorite non-Oz Baum book, and actually is high on the list for my favorite Baum books in general. In the interesting and informative introduction to the Dover edition, Martin Gardner cites Baum himself  (from a letter to his son) about the book.<br /><br />Baum wrote: \\"In some ways Queen Zixi is my best effort, and nearer to the 'old-fashioned' fairy tale than anything I have yet accomplished.\\"<br /><br />In fact, one of the reasons that this book has stayed with me so strongly over the years (I have been re-reading it on and off since I was eight) is that pure fairy tale quality. The issues between Ix and Noland have less of the sly contemporary humor that Baum used in the Oz books. He instead revisits the classical fairy tale characters of the ruling innocents (Bud and Fluff), the tragic \\"evil\\" queen (Zixi), and the wicked step-parent (Aunt Rivette). What makes Queen Zixi so wonderful is that while the archetypes are recognizable in the characters, they are also  vibrant and real people in their own right. The tension and the flow of the story relies on the fact that these characters are much more than their fairy tale ancestors.<br /><br />I find that the Richardson illustrations work well with the book (it was the only Baum book that he illustrated). His style is memorable and works well with the text.<br /><br />Expect the always reliable Baum humor and wordplay. Expect to be engaged and amused and moved.<br /><br />Recommended for readers of any age.	2005-06-16

Sinclair himself was chosen in 1983 as one of Britain's best 20 young novelists. He has several novels to his credit, as well as short story and essay collections. This is the first of his work that I have read.<br /><br />It is hard to hang a label on the short story style in this collection. Sinclair is (literally) all over the map, with characters roaming the globe from Mexico to Sweden and finally ending the collection with a story set in the (semi) imaginary land of Ashkenazia. The tone is quirky, often ironic and there is a thematic focus on issues of conception and mixed heritage. His style brings the Kate Atkinson short stories to mind just a little bit-- something about the combination of surrealism and the use of character voice.<br /><br />I received this collection as a gift, and if I had to choose for myself I think that I would have started with a Sinclair novel first. There was a lot to like about the collection, but I found myself frustrated at times with the stories themselves. The idea often seemed to skip away before the story was really done with itself. I had trouble finding a sustained beat and I have the feeling that I would get more of what I liked about the writing in a longer piece.<br /><br />The Lady with the Laptop should appeal to readers of intelligent fiction with a taste for playfulness. Do not let my hesitation about the form persuade you against the book, particularly not if you are specifically a short story reader.	2005-06-15

I kind of gave up on Douglas Coupland sometime after Shampoo Planet. He is a talented writer, one whose wit and prose I admire even when I admire the book much less. However, it felt to me as though he often took the easy way out with his work. If his wit had been less ready, his books would have been much stronger.<br /><br />My partner recommended that I read Hey Nostradamus. He has stayed more hopeful than I about Coupland as a writer and thought that this book was a real change in direction for him-- the first in a very long time.<br /><br />I agree. While as readable as Coupland generally is, it is much harder-hitting than a book like Girlfriend in a Coma. He (largely) resists the temptation to tell us too much in his trademark monologues and letters. He used a number of sidesteps in the past to elide the hard stuff that comes up in his books, and none of them are evident here. This is a sweet book in the way that all his books are sweet, but he also lets the real sadness through.<br /><br />I recommend this novel for either Coupland fans or readers new to his work. Although there is some violence and adult situations, it should still be a good book for teenagers.	2005-06-13

I immediately went back and bought A Quantum Murder and the Nano Flower on the strength of the first book.<br /><br />Unfortunately, each subsequent book has disappointed me just a little bit more in comparison to the first. In Nano Flower, Hamilton is still working with a series of fascinating ideas, but the story and the ending feel far from complete. It almost felt as though Hamilton had lost interest in his own creation and just  wanted the series to end.<br /><br />In fairness I should say that even a bad book by Peter Hamilton is still a pretty darn good book by most standards (hence the 4 stars rating). I still recommend the series for its originality and the sheer strength of the writing.<br /><br />As a side note, the TOR edition (1999) surely gets points for being the ugliest science fiction book cover in recent memory. It looks for all the world like a Ken doll in a purple satin jump suit holding a water pistol.	2005-06-12

Hastings chooses an aspect of WWII that feels like it should be familiar, and manages to show a larger picture that makes it strange and fascinating again.<br /><br />Living in Holland, I have heard the story of the \\"bridge too far\\" countless times. Hastings made me see it as though for the first time. I read this book while on vacation in Spain and my Dutch partner was constantly reading over my shoulder. He remarked that given the continual Dutch examination and re-examination of the war years, he was surprised how much that he learned from Hastings treatment of both the battle for Arnhem and the Hunger Years.<br /><br />Armageddon would make an excellent companion piece to readers who have already enjoyed The Fall of Berlin 1945 by Anthony Beevor. The books complement each other and are similar in authority and scope. Recommended for history fans, particularly those with an interest in World War II.	2005-06-12

Many threads regarding Roxane and Jihan are closed (or are they?). Tempus returns to Sanctuary and is reunited with Niko as his partner.<br /><br />The Thieves World books are always at their best when they are slowly building to a climax using the small stories of the Maze and palace that the various writers do so well. The relay format does not work as well at crafting a single climax point. The result is not bad, exactly, but it reads like a more typical fantasy series installment. One of the nice thing about Thieves World at its best is that it does not read like that at all. There were also some very nice plot points opened up in Book 7 that are completely ignored here-- a little bit of continuity with some of those elements would have been nice.<br /><br />Lynn Abbey, Janet Morris and C.J. Cherryh were the writers in book 8. As you can imagine, begin at the beginning and not here if you have not read any of the books before.	2005-06-10

Using adultery as a filter, he examines the range of everyday sins that accompany lives unrealized and disconnected. Adultery is the frozen tip, making the movement under the water visible.<br /><br />This is not the book to look to for big events. The drama largely happens off stage. The moments of violence are dulled-- killing time more than killing each other. It makes for the kind of sinning that you may not expect, but is probably more real to the real lives of people than the more Hollywood variety.<br /><br />I can understand the criticism of the book, both here and elsewhere. Ford is so interested in the problem that he explores it from every angle and there is a sameness to many of these stories as they seem to conceptually pick up where the others left off. I was fascinated, bored, impatient and finally fascinated again by the project.<br /><br />I can think of very few writers who are more skilled than Ford. I would recommend this book to virtually anyone who enjoys good prose. Honestly, the novels (Independence Day is my favorite) are probably easier to read, and may serve as a good introduction to the way that the author handles his subject matter.	2005-06-09

After all the hype, I finally got around to reading Time Bind this year. I thought that it was interesting, and not too terribly written, but I have to confess that I do not see the point. Her central thesis about work being too much like home has largely been exploded during the economic downturn-- lots of the perks and benefits cited in Time Bind are no longer features in the new cost-conscious companies.<br /><br />I think the book would have been much more satisfying to readers if it had been presented as what it is-- the study of a single company. In my opinion, Hochschild does not earn the wider conclusions that she attempts to draw from the study and there is not sufficient underpinning to make broad generalizations about either family-friendly policies or increased working hours.<br /><br />Truthfully, I probably would have rated this book as less than three stars if I were only judging the reading experience. However, I think that Hochschild deserves credit for the work that she did studying her one company sample and for asking some tough questions which we really do need to be asking.	2005-06-05

Worse, as a junior member of my new sales team, I was asked to organize a group \\"away day\\" with a purpose of discussing the book and applying it to our accounts.<br /><br />I have to confess that I was initially not impressed with being assigned this task. Like many people in the current market, I have been subjected to a wide variety of sales training and solution selling methods. I have been spun by SPIN sales training. I received Solution Selling as a gift from my sales mentor. I have followed the internal mandatory selling skills method training that my company uses to structure accounts. My first thought when I was handed this book was \\"Oh, no. Not *another* one.\\"<br /><br />At first read, I have to say that my opinion did not significantly improve.

The structure  of the book is a little bit odd and did not encourage me to read further.<br /><br />I am happy to report that this is a book that gets better and more useful with closer examination. The consensus of my team eventually was that the keys are really a great tool for opportunity and relationship assessment and that it fit nicely into ground not covered enough through other sources. The partners said ruefully that the thing they liked best about it was how many of their own bloopers they recognized back in the examples.<br /><br />In short, this is a book that only does itself justice when you start working with the keys for success as tools to evaluate your opportunities.  It is well worth the time to do this-- at least our group of partners and consultants thought so!<br /><br />Note to publishers:<br /><br />One of the things that we discussed is that while this resource and others are excellent for evaluating opportunities, most of the opportunity problems seem to stem from poor account management. The little tiny chapter at the back of Hope is Not a Strategy is not enough to really address this problem. We find that many resources similarly say \\"account management is important\\" without really developing how to translate good opportunity management into account management.

We are really founded on an argument about what that proposition means.\\"<br /><br />Ellis sees the split as embedded in competing notions of good government and as a force which expresses itself in the debates which have run through the fabric of the US (for instance, slavery or state/federal rights balance). What is nice about Founding Brothers is the way that it uses anecdote and personal stories to both illustrate and explain this dual vision on which Ellis argues that the country was founded.<br /><br />The book is structured as six slim chapters which center on a range of characters from Burr to Adams. These are names nearly as familiar as our own, but Founding Brothers does a wonderful job of recontextualizing and revisiting in a way that taught me things that I never knew. I left the book anxious to find out more about Burr, for example. I had an entirely different image of the Burr/Hamilton events after reading \\"The Duel\\" than the one that I thought I had before I read it. It is the hallmark of a very good history writer that the old is made new again with seemingly so little effort.<br /><br />Founding Brothers should be excellent reading for the armchair historian. I suspect that even people well-read in Revolutionary history will find something new in these stories to enjoy. It should also appeal to people interested in US politics of today, as Ellis does a good job of showing that the seeds of many current struggles were sown long ago. The language is mercifully simple and the prose clearly written, so age or academic background should not be a barrier to enjoying the book.	2005-06-04

I had a general idea what picaresque means, but to be on the safe side, I decided to look the word up.<br /><br />According to the Google definition service, \\"Picaresque\\" means 1) \\"Of or involving clever rogues or adventurers\\". or 2)\\"Of or relating to a genre of usually satiric prose fiction originating in Spain and depicting in realistic, often humorous detail the adventures of a roguish hero of low social degree living by his or her wits in a corrupt society.\\"<br /><br />I think that the definition indeed sums the book up nicely, although I think that you could argue that Vatanen is not really of low social degree-- although he does become that for the sake of his hare.<br /><br />In places, the Year of the Hare can become a little bit difficult to read. The Finnish politics went straight over my head as did (I suspect) much of the subtlety relating to Finnish life. Particularly at the beginning it is difficult to see where the book is going.<br /><br />It is a measure of how-written the book is that despite the missing pieces I really enjoyed the read. Some absurdities are not at all cultural-specific and Paasilinna hits them quite nicely with his man and the hare.<br /><br />Fans of the aforementioned Picaresque novels should like this little adventure. It has flavors of early Vonnegut and a little bit of Ionesco. Recommended for anyone with a taste for the gently absurd.	2005-06-02

It became one of my favorites and I read my way through the rest of the series. At the time that the book came out I was still in college and I identified very much with the character of Anghara. I understood that she had brought her problems on herself, but I still really sympathized with her anger and her passion and her sense of unfairness.<br /><br />I recently ran across the book again and decided to give it another read. I still enjoyed it, but it is interesting as an older reader how my perception of the book has changed. I now find Anghara exasperating rather than sympathetic. I am amazed that she seems to get off as easily as she does after bringing doom on her lover and her family. I kept reading, but I was looking for some real repentence on her part and getting frustrated because I did not find it.<br /><br />Cooper is and was a talented writer. The Indigo series was her third fantasy series outing (the first two were Blood Summer and the more famous Time-Master books). Nemesis is set in a semi-Celtic landscape and draws heavily on a variety of myth-based sources for its plot. Cooper does a good job of synthesizing myth in an original way so that it does not feel stale or like a retread of old ideas.<br /><br />More modern readers will probably be frustrated by the relatively short book length-- I know that I felt like several episodes could have safely been packed into one book, even at the time that I first read them. This series should be a big hit with teenage readers (particularly teenage girls) and are recommended for any reader who enjoys this particular flavor of fantasy.	2005-06-02

Harding has written a concise and useful reference to the different aspects of marketing yourself in the professional services field. I think that even experienced readers will find something that they had not thought of or where they could further focus to build their career.<br /><br />I particularly found the chapters on cold calling and what to do when you lose a sale to be useful.<br /><br />If the potential reader is looking for material more specifically focused on professional services sales then I would recommend Solution Selling by Bosworth or SPIN training rather than Rain Making. The chapter on the sale is good enough as an overview, but is not explored in any real depth.<br /><br />I would recommend Rain Making to anyone who needs to market their services as a professional. I suspect that it would also be a good read for managers who need to build a professional services practices. There are some lessons to be learned here about how professionals need to spend their time.	2005-06-01

I had high hopes for Sorcery Rising when I saw that it came with a recommendation from Robin Hobb. One of the things that I like so much about Hobb as a writer is that she works within epic fantasy tropes to create something really unique. Unfortunately, Fisher is pretty heavy on the stock fantasy elements and fairly light on the unique. This said, she is clearly a good craftsman and the writing flows smoothly all the same.<br /><br />The main \\"real\\" story seems to be centered in the competing God myths that the different cultures have-- Falla and Sur. There is something in it about magic coming back to the world and the consequences of getting what you pray for that has the potential to be really interesting. I wish that the book had focused itself a little bit more here and a little bit less on the competing romantic and sexual issues of the various characters.<br /><br />Katla is one of a long tradition of strong tomboy fantasy characters and she does not disappoint as being part of that tradition. Her relationship with her brothers adds a new and interesting complexity to the character type as does her weapon-making ability. I would have preferred it if Fisher had taken a page from Modesitt and focused on Katla's love of the craft. It would have made the subsequent actions of her father that much more compelling.<br /><br />I was not bothered by Fisher mining the Viking tradition. She does it well, and it is nice to see nordic races treated as more than blond barbarian counterparts to complicated English/Irish/French-based nobility types. However, I was annoyed to have the typical gypsies and the now nearly-standard middle eastern characters in the book. They did feel like retreads in a way that the Eryans did not.<br /><br />In short, it was a decent use of a few hours and I liked it enough that I will probably pick up the next book in the series. The book should appeal to fans of swords & sorcery fantasy epics.  It has a number of sexual plot elements and is not suitable for younger readers..	2005-06-01

Delusion's Master is the third book in the Flat Earth books by Tanith Lee. While the first two (Night's Master and Death's Master) stand very much on their own, Delusion's Master is the beginning of a story that will take the Flat Earth stories through two more volumes.<br /><br />In Delusion's Master, Lee introduces us to Chuz, the eternal master of insanity. He stage manages the fall of a great nation which indirectly leads to the strange love affair between the Master of Night and the Daughter of the Comet.<br /><br />The Flat Earth books are structured more as a series of linked stories than as traditional character-oriented narratives. They are short and pleasant to read. Lee herself is a master of dark fairy tales and uses the structure admirably.<br /><br />While you can begin with Delusion's Master, it probably makes the most sense to go back and read Death and Night first. Although the sexual content seems rather tame by the standards of today (this was written in 1981) these are still adult-themed books and probably not suitable for very young readers.	2005-06-01
241701:US	52564468	R1ESXH0BCURHTQ	0345457714	203262778	Broken Angels (Takeshi Kovacs)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Splendid time waster.	I had no time to waste when I picked up Broken Angels. That was a mistake. I found that I just had to make time to keep the pages turning in this book. I stayed up too late, snuck off to read between appointments, sat in the car in front of the house so that I could just get in a few more pages...<br /><br />Takeshi is back in another ultraviolent look at what happens to society when human life is made even cheaper through a system of stacks and sleeves.  In this book, he returns to his military roots serving as a merc in a particularly nasty and pointless planetary brawl.  When he has a chance to get out of the conflict to chase the opportunity of a lifetime he grabs it with both hands.<br /><br />Altered Carbon was much more of a standard noir novel, albeit one set in the 26th century. Broken Angels retains noir elements, but is a lot closer to a space opera or epic than to the classic noir narrative. How you are going to feel about that will depend, at least in part, on why you liked Altered Carbon.<br /><br />This is a very fast and clean read. I had some moments of \\"oh, come on\\" with the ending, but not too many of them. Morgan knows how to keep the pace and energy high better than most writers out there. I found that I did not even notice the length of the book. No mean feat for a book weighing in at 490 pages with very small type.<br /><br />You should be able to read this one without reading Altered Carbon, so start where you like. If space epic is more your cup of tea, then you will probably prefer Broken Angels. People looking for a more Raymond Chandler jolt should pick up Altered Carbon instead. There is a lot of very explicit violence and sexual situations-- not a book for younger readers.	2005-05-13

Swords of Mars is one of my favorites of the Martian Tales. Although late in the series, it has all the elements that made Burroughs a classic in the field:<br /><br />1.<br />It is a John Carter novel. He is still the best character in the series.<br /><br />2.<br />It does not suffer from the same artifacts of serialization that you see in some of the other Mars books. The chapters flow together very nicely without too many inconsistencies or abrupt breaks.<br /><br />3.<br />It manages to deal with the political aspect of life on Barsoom while staying smaller. I enjoy the more intimate focus on John Carter more than I do the more epic sweeps of some of the other books.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of the series. People new to the series should really at least read A Princess of Mars series. However, if you have read that one and are skipping around, this would be a good one to skip around to.	2005-05-13

It hardly seemed fair to the book to try and read it when I liked the film so very much.<br /><br />It was a mistake to have waited.<br /><br />Shoot the Piano Player is a subtle and hard-hitting novel that goes beyond many of the expectations of a Noir thriller. The writing is subtle and moody, with moments of aggression and connection that flash like heat lightning.<br /><br />Eddie does not need any trouble in his life. By the time trouble catches up to him at Harriet's Hut he is already a beaten man. Disengaged and detached, a single act of involvement carries him over the line and back into life. This is a dark and poor Philadelphia where the past catches up to a person and where nothing and nobody are what they seem.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of Noir fiction and films. Truffaut fans should not worry about being disappointed. Even if you aren't yet a noir fan, this is an excellent book for anybody with a taste for smart and well-written literature.	2005-05-13

Dee Brown is a novelist and historian best known for his masterpiece Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee. Although Gentle Tamers is an entertaining read, the difference in tone and style between 1958 and 1970 is remarkable. People who came to this book expecting something similar to Bury My Heart will be probably be disappointed. This is a much lighter work, and dated in a way that Bury My Heart is not. It is still a remarkably researched and well-written work, so the fact that it is different should not dissuade you from reading it.<br /><br />Brown looks at the different categories of women western pioneers and works out his thesis that while the men settled the western US states, it was the women who civilized it. His different chapters include: hardships of the journey; women captured by Native Americans; women of easy virtue; performers; rebels; schoolteachers; and homesteading housewives.  He provides ample stories and pictures to accompany the different categories.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading Gentle Tamers although I did not find what I was looking for (more information about Narcissa Whitman). The stories are lively and entertaining. It reads quickly, and Brown is a very smooth and skilled writer.<br /><br />There are several wince-worthy moments in the very 1950s language around Native Americans and women (very surprising given that the vocabulary was totally gone by the time he published Bury My Heart). For a serious treatment of issues of women in the West, I would look elsewhere. This book is clearly more focused on well-researched and light anecdote.<br /><br />Would be a terrific gift for someone interested in stories of the West-- a nice halfway point between a historical treatment and a novel.	2005-05-12

This was one of the earliest fantasy books that I read as a child, and it made a vivid impression on me.<br /><br />Jay and Jess are very different boys who just cannot seem to get along. When they find themselves in another world after a fistfight in the hall, they need to find a way to become friends. The land of Gwyliath is a mixture of familiar mythology landscapes with just a dash of Oz thrown in. There is a very nice sense of surrealism to the characters which keeps it from being a stock exercise.<br /><br />While not as enduring as other YA fantasy books, Hero From Otherwhere has some nice messages and interesting passages. I would still recommend the Lloyd Alexander and Susan Cooper books over this one, but it might be just the ticket for a slightly younger reader.	2005-05-05

If you read the Amazon reviews and conclude that when people say \\"no plot\\" they mean a slow-moving plot, think again. It is not that the plot is slow that is the issue, but that the expectations you may have about the plot are never realized. The back cover implies a specific story, and that may be part of the problem. Every few pages I would get very excited because I thought that the promised \\"ghosts of the past\\" would finally emerge. I thought that the connection between Raule and Gwynn would be extended and change. Neither of those things happened.<br /><br />Bishop has created a work that is very strong in terms of the atmosphere and the character description, but the characters themselves resist our understanding. Much of how we judge plot is its effect on the characters and their state of mind. If a book denies us that insight, then we are left with the feeling that the plot is lacking. This is the case, I believe, in The Etched City.<br /><br />I wonder if I would accepted the way the book was structured if it had not been marketed to me as science fiction/fantasy. I read literary novels without a plot fairly frequently and am not bothered. The plotless world is, after all, a lot like life. One of the things that I admire about Bishop is that The Etched City very likely unfolds much the way it would if you were describing the real lives of interesting people. There are some intersections. There are some connections. There is even some unintentional mirroring and irony. Life does not consist of plots which neatly align with character change.<br /><br />Unfortunately, even if I admire the project, I found the book very difficult to read. This despite the fact that Bishop is one of the best (quality of the prose) new writers that I have run across in recent days. She can hold her own with any writer of fantasy dystopia out there. She is quite correctly compared to China Mieville, Jeff Vandermeer, and Jeffrey Ford.<br /><br />Fans of any of those writers (or of fantasy in general) should give this book a go, never mind my criticisms about the plot. Copper Country and Ashamoil are wonderful and rich places. It was a measure of how involved I became with the characters that I was so frustrated that I did not have enough access to their stories.<br /><br />Bishop is clearly a writer to watch. I am certainly curious to see where she goes next.ve this book a go, never mind my criticisms about the plot. Copper Country and Ashamoil are wonderful and rich places.

I will offer a view contrary to several of the other Amazon reviewers who seemed to like this book less than the first two in the Nightrunner Series. I thought that it was at least on par, and in some respects I actually liked it much better.<br /><br />I enjoyed Luck In the Shadows and Stalking Darkness. At least, I enjoyed them enough to go ahead and pick up the third. My issue with them was that they were a little too focused on the individual characters. There was a whole lot of Destiny and Magical Quests going on. While Flewelling is a fresh writer, parts of the plots felt like stale retreads of similar books in the genre.<br /><br />Traitor's Moon goes a lot farther down the road of politics. The Aurenfaie became a lot more interesting to me as parties quarreling about trade routes than they were as mystic Tolkeinish semi-elves. The plot line with Korathan and Poria was much more interesting and complex this time around. I was genuinely surprised by some of the character shifts, and that takes some doing.<br /><br />I was a little bit disappointed to see that Flewelling has not written with these characters since Traitor's Moon. I think that I will wander back over and take another look at the Bone Doll's Twin. I had read it before I read these three books, and I believe that I am now inclined to give it another chance.<br /><br />The Nightrunner series is recommended for Swords & Sorcery fantasy fans. While it has some adult situations, it should be fine for teenage readers. Begin at the beginning with Luck in the Shadows, and not here with Traitor's Moon.	2005-05-01

The Spellsinger series is not my favorite, but to give Foster credit, the quality of his writing is fairly consistent. If this had been an Anthony or a Chalker series, by the sixth book the story would have broken down completely.<br /><br />In this, the sixth book about the rock-n-roll singing wizard from another world, Foster maintains the level he set in the earlier books and creates an enjoyable read. Jon-Tom faces the biggest villain of all-- his own desire to go home.<br /><br />The plot is not perfect in the Time Of The Transferance. It meanders a bit more than it should. Foster really seems to forget the mission in some places and get caught up in cannibals and bad puns. Still, fans of Spellsinger should not be disappointed. As usual, people new to the series should begin at the beginning with Spellsinger and not here.	2005-04-26

Ritchie does an extremely able job of refocusing the story of Captain Kidd away from being a personal drama. Instead, he builds an image of the world where Kidd was one of many trying their luck at this (then) semi-legal trade. Piracy was the only place left for a sailor who loved the sea but not the navy.<br /><br />As a reader, it was interesting to see Kidd transformed from the pirate figure of legend into a semi-competent adventurer who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time in British history. Ritchie also provides a fascinating look at the 17th-18th century justice systems.<br /><br />Ritchie is less of a writer than a historian, unfortunately. There were a number of places at the beginning of the book where I felt lost as to where he was trying to go. However, as another reader notes, this improves later on in the book.<br /><br />Recommended for readers with a particular interest in pirates.	2005-04-26

I would tend to agree with the reviewer who gave The Book of Salt a strong 3-star rating. I think in the end I liked it a little bit more than that, so came down on the side of a weak 4-star review.<br /><br />The Book of Salt is the first novel-length work by Truong. It has a fascinating concept. We know from history that Stein and Toklas had at different points two chefs from \\"Indochine\\". Nothing more is known. Truong picks up that point of unknown and spins it into a novel about love, identity, home and food.<br /><br />The most successful thing about the book is its meditation on the relationship between the subject of the story and the teller of a story. Binh is at his most interesting when it is clear that he is as unreliable as Stein at telling his own past. The layers of narration that Truong creates are fascinating and finely drawn. Whatever the flaws that the book might have, I found it delightful to read for this alone.<br /><br />The Book of Salt is less successful at investing Binh with enough of a character to really give the book depth. He is more a collection of traits than a person in his own right. It is not just his audience in Paris and his family back home who are projecting their issues and needs onto Binh, in the end it is the author herself. This strange shallowness is made more obvious by all of the well-written but self-indulgent prosody exploring the images of food and love.<br /><br />In all, a fine first novel, and one that makes me want to read the second. The Book of Salt should appeal to readers with a taste for smart historical fiction or foodies with an eye for good description.	2005-04-24

It has all the wonderful Simak classical elements-- folksy heros, visitors from the stars, lost knowledge, and gentle good nature. Additionally, Goblin Reservation has some of the wittiest Simak moments that I have read. The pages are full of little touches that bring an unforced smile.<br /><br />Peter Maxwell returns to Earth bearing a mission entrusted to him by a dying race. Once home, he discovers that another version of himself had already returned and died in a strange accident. The mystery of what really happened is linked with the mystery of an object known only as The Artifact. Peter must cope with unsympathetic aliens, academic politics, unfriendly banshees and his own strange mission before a resolution can be reached.<br /><br />Recommended for any fans of intelligent science fiction or fantasy. Simak should also appeal to general readers who are not classic genre fans. Simak never confuses explicit scenes with maturity, and his books are safe for readers of any age.	2005-04-24

The ending of the play is one of many moments scattered throughout the pages that had an almost physical impact on me as a reader.<br /><br />It a testimony to the sheer strength of Tagore as a writer that the reader is able to have those moments while reading this anthology. It unfortunately suffered from many of the typical problems of this kind of collection. The selections often felt too shallow and abbreviated. The quality of the translations varied wildly from chapter to chapter.<br /><br />As a reader, I would have appreciated it if Dutta and Robinson had refrained from excerpting the longer prose works and instead had concentrated on deepening the selection of letters, short stories and essays. Reading an excerpt of a longer work is bound to be a frustrating exercise, and the space was used at the expense of material more natural for this kind of collection.<br /><br />I picked this up to give me an overview of Tagore as a writer. It served that purpose admirably. Recommended for someone with the same task in mind.	2005-04-24

The Structures of Everyday Life is a fascinating read which explores a side of history often left out of the books focusing on kings and battles. In 8 major chapters he reviews the history of commonplace items such as grains, fashion, technology, money and innovation. His central thesis is that the history of material life is composed of the history of these basic items, and that an economic view of the past cannot be established without pausing here.<br /><br />Braudel is a wonderful writer. His clarity and sharp analysis is aided by the extremely clean translation assistance provided by Sian Reynolds. He makes a clear distinction between fact and interpretation, and is very successful at developing his thesis and not losing the reader in the minutae of the fascinating detail he exposes.<br /><br />Although the book is long, the pacing in the chapters is nearly perfect. Each subject is explored at a length that left me wanting to read more instead of feeling over-saturated. I did not have the experience of reading an encyclopedia or reference book, but found there to be a definite flow and build in the disparate subjects.<br /><br />The book is well-illustrated, and the notes are clear. The only additional thing that I could have wished for would have been a bibliography if I wished further information about a particular chapter.<br /><br />In short, an entertaining and informative read recommended for a wide range of readers. I would not hesitate to give this book as a gift to the armchair historian. I will be reading the second volume shortly.	2005-04-13

River of the Dancing Gods is a quirky intelligent fantasy novel that manages to be a compelling read while holding up the entire genre for gentle parody.<br /><br />Marge and Joe are not your typical fantasy heroes, but are probably all the better for not being typical. Marge is a down-at-the-heels 30-something waitress/housewife. Joe is a trucker who somehow lost the plot along the way. Together they meet a strange character called Ruddigore, and the adventure begins.<br /><br />This was a re-read for me, and as I recall the rest of the series does not live up to the promise of this one. Still, a decent place to begin with Chalker. There is significantly less of the sniggering 12-year-old boy humor that can make Chalker so irritating at times. Should appeal to readers who like fantasy of the Xanth and Spellsinger variety.	2005-04-10

My father died recently, and in clearing out his things I found his copy of this book. As a child, I remembered him showing this book to me. It  had been one of his favorites ever since he had read it in high school. I never got around to reading it until now.<br /><br />Giants In the Earth is the story of Norwegian immigrants trying to make their home in the great prairies of the new territories. They choose a spot marked by the huge sky, a duck swamp, a lonely Native grave, and nothing else. The immigrants face birth, insanity, religion, locusts and sickness-- all the time wondering if they did the right thing to have left their villages and boats.<br /><br />The book was enough to move me by itself. Rolvaag is a skilled writer, and Per Hansa is a charming character. Hansa is real and human, and Rolvaag accomplishes that in a seemingly effortless way. I liked him, and liked Beret and it was hard not to like the book-- as hard as was the world that it portrays.<br /><br />I have some quarrels with the translation. The punctuation and sentence structure felt off at times. It almost seemed as though in trying to capture the authenticity of the original language it sacrificed a little bit of the clarity. The notes are well done-- just enough, and with the right amount of information to explain background to the reader.<br /><br />The book should appeal to readers who like either the history or the literature of the early American experience. Even if you question the authenticity of the settler moments, it should provide a good look at the experience of the Norwegian immigration.<br /><br />I only wish that my father was still alive to discuss it with me.	2005-04-10

The Tarot books can be looked at as the little detour  Piers Anthony took into the traditional territory of Zelazny and Philip K. Dick. More concerned with religion and symbolism than with swords and sorcery, God of Tarot is an odd digression in the overall Anthony body of work.<br /><br />God of Tarot opens like the set-up for a Clifford D. Simak book: almost all of Earth has fled for the stars, fueled by the technology of matter transmission. Earth is left depopulated and stripped of all energy sources, with only the remnants left to keep the light burning.<br /><br />Brother Paul is a monk of the Holy Order of Vision. His life is going as planned, until suddenly he is given a mission. God, or something like it, is apparently manifesting on a planet called Tarot. Paul is tasked with getting to the bottom of the animations and potentially making the decision as to whose God is the revealed God...<br /><br />Anthony should be applauded for following a road that took him so far away from Xanth. The Tarot books show him to be a talented and creative writer, when he chooses to be. The ideas are crisp in God of Tarot, and generally very well written.<br /><br />This said, it is a book with many flaws. It is very complicated to read and follow, and requires quite a bit of background understanding about Golden Dawn and Crowley to really get all of the references. There are moments where I felt like Anthony was more interested in displaying his knowledge than I felt like he was interested in the reader. Also, having discarded the bad puns and witty asides of Xanth, the fact that his plotting skills are very weak is more than evident in this book.<br /><br />Anthony fans should read it for themselves and see if they find what they like about his other work. This series may well appeal to readers who never liked Xanth much, but do like Anthony as a writer. Parents should beware-- other Anthony books are very suitable for pre-teens and teenagers. This series is much different. There is a fair amount of very explicit sex and very adult situations which would be difficult for a younger reader to understand.t sex and very adult situations which would be difficult for a younger reader to understand.	2005-04-10

There are so many reasons why you should read this book, that I hardly know where to begin in listing them.<br /><br />Histoire de Ma Vie is the book that justly made Casanova famous, and it did so for far more than its prurient nature. Casanova is a marvellous writer. The quality of his memoirs shines through both the translation and the years since writing.<br /><br />Volumes I & II give us the young Casanova growing up Venice. A child of the theater, he lives in the grey space between rich and poor. When he sets out to make his way in the world he is armed with his wit, his charm, and his flexible sense of ethics. His adventures and misadventures take him from Venice to Rome to Greece to Turkey. He starts a career within the church, makes money as an alchemist, and delights in the life of a gambler. There is probably a lot to criticise in the behaviour of Casanova, but his charm even wins over the reader. It is difficult to sit in judgement when he so cheerfully judges himself.<br /><br />There is something for nearly everyone in these two volumes. History readers will get an intimate look at manners of the 18th century. Fans of autobiography and memoir will find this one of the most interesting and extensive examples that they have read. Teenagers will relate to some very familiar scenes of youthful rebellion (moments that have apparently changed very little in the past several hundred years). Even the novel reader who does not normally read memoir should find that there is enough adventure and derring-do to keep the pages turning.<br /><br />The translation by Trask is clean and does not get in the way. This is worth reading in its entirety and I would personally skip the abridged version for the unabridged. My only complaint about the Johns Hopkins University Press Edition was that the notes for Volume I were in the middle of the book, and it would have been easier as the reader to have the notes for both volumes at the end.<br /><br />I will be picking up Volumes III & IV as quickly as I can find them!cking up Volumes III & IV as quickly as I can find them!	2005-04-09
284838:US	52564468	RIPOYBBQUQA1W	0345347676	931027453	Camber of Culdi, Volume 1: In the Legends of Camber of Culdi	Books	4	9	10	N	N	Classic historical fantasy book that almost hides its age.	This was a re-read for me. I had been a fan of the Deryni books many years ago and had read most of the series. When I saw Camber of Culdi on the shelf, I picked it up out of curiosity to see if it would inspire me to circle back around and pick up the books that I hadn't yet read.<br /><br />I am pleased to report that this first book in the series holds up well under time. Kurtz is a master at creating a sense of foreboding. Unlike many writers in the fantasy genre, you always have the feeling in her world that you might not be getting a happy ending. This is a rare talent, and gives her work its own kind of attractive tension.<br /><br />For the modern reader the largest drawback of Camber of Culdi is its length. The books were released at a time when the average book length was significantly shorter than now, and the result was often multi-book series. The titles in these series often have the feeling of being either a little bit overstuffed or a little bit thin. I really enjoyed Camber of Culdi. However, as a modern reader used to being served my fantasy in larger chunks, I felt frustrated that it was forced very quickly to a kind of resolution. Had Kurtz been working in a longer form, I think we would have seen some much more interesting development of the political and religious threads which are among the major strength of the book.<br /><br />If you have not read any of the Deryni books, be sure to begin here. The necessary background is laid for the rest of the series and you will miss it if you do not have it. This book should appeal to fans of historical fantasy or people interested in the link between religion and magic. Although adult situations are implied, it should be both suitable and enjoyable for teenagers.	2005-04-08

Pig Notes is a collection of short prose pieces with subjects that range from poetry to diamond cutting. Heyen uses the form to work out some of his favorite concerns-- poetic necessity, unity, the modern poem, environmental issues, and life in Brockport, NY.<br /><br />My favorite essay was \\"Poverty\\". I liked the notion of words being used to order intuition. It seemed particularly appropriate to the book as a whole. I was less interested in the environmental writings-- while powerful, they seemed at odds with the unity of the rest of the book.<br /><br />Recommended for readers familiar with the poetry of Heyen or interested in this style of writing. Think Robert Bly and Wendell Berry if you are trying to get a sense of where to place his work.<br /><br />Disclaimer: Bill was a teacher of mine a long time ago, so I am not a completely unbiased reader. It was lovely to hear his diction again in these little pieces.	2005-03-20

I received a review copy, and was grateful for the opportunity to read it. It seemed like an interesting topic to me, and the authors have impressive credentials.<br /><br />As others have adquately noted, the book contains a lot of valid and wise lessons which people looking for success in business and life can employ. It uses parable form to convey those lessons.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the authors chose to write in a faux archaic form that almost completely spoiled the book for me. Just because a book is a parable, does not mean that you need to burden it with a plethora of Thees, Thous and Thys. I finished the book, but I have to say that I really did not want to-- this despite finding the points that it was making perfectly valid.<br /><br />You may be a reader who can overlook the style. I could not. I had such a strong reaction that I literally wanted to call the authors and beg them to write it again in readable and straightforward language.<br /><br />Five stars for the message, but one star for the execution.	2005-03-19

From this point out, the series decays into a mudge of eeping nymphs with luscious flesh and awful puns.<br /><br />I remember as a pre-teenager being captivated by a Spell for Chameleon and becoming an addicted Xanth reader. It was interesting to pick this book up again as an adult and realize that while my opinion of Anthony eventually declined, the first three books in the series are still pretty readable.<br /><br />Xanth in the first three books is a really edgy place. People are often quite cold and their motivations obscure. Dor feels very real as a character, bearing his burdens of expectations and confusion as he struggles his way into the adult world.<br /><br />The silly puns themselves are at a minimum in this book, with the exception of a couple of real groaners. (Gerrymander, oy!) The nice thing is that since the puns are not omnipresent they are almost funny when they do appear and do not spoil the read as a whole.<br /><br />The first three books are still recommended for pre-teenagers. I am sure that they will enjoy them-- be a little aware that Anthony indulges in some fairly dubious gender stereotyping, so if you are very sensitive to that sort of thing you might want to read them first before you give these books as a present.	2005-03-17

Kendrick uses Vietnam to focus a look at the US during the period leading up to and during the Vietnam years. He traces the effect that the engagement had on the country as a whole. At the same time, he looks at how what was happening in the country affected the decision to get and stay involved. He does a nice job of managing these parallel tracks without confusion or obvious bias. I particularly liked the way that he established the links and connections between the civil rights movement and Vietnam resistance. We see those two subjects treated separately so often that it is easy to forget that they were happening at the same time.<br /><br />The Wound Within includes a helpful bibliography (although not annotated) and index.<br /><br />Particularly in the treatment of Nixon, the book may feel a little bit dated-- so much has changed in our perception of him since the release date of 1974. At the same time, this difference may be useful to see. The book addresses Watergate and Vietnam from a time when the wound was still fresh and the country still very raw from the consequences.	2005-03-17

I had a definite idea of what sales meant, and I was not at all sure that I liked it. One of my colleagues recommended Solution Selling as a good book to help build some perspective on my new position.<br /><br />Many people talk about solution sales, but when you come right down to it they do little more than attempt to move hardware. I was delighted to see the same techniques and skills that I use in consulting coming back as the sales skills in the Bosworth book.

Weighing in at 115 pages, it is a novella rather than a novel.<br /><br />Like in many Simak books, the hero is not a King or Prince. Simak is uninterested in any game of thrones. Jackson is a small town boy on the moon, sent there by a syndicate of the businessmen from his home town and trying to make it rich. While on his normal business, he runs into Amelia in a broken down lunar vehicle. Amelia is on the moon trying to finish something that her brother started, and not getting very far in the process. Together they see a chance to finally make it big by venturing into the forbidden moon area known as Tycho.<br /><br />The novella is faster-paced than many Simak books. Ultimately, however, it has the same preoccupations and focus. I wish that I could have known Simak as a person. He wrote so many novels in his long career and in each and every one he ultimately reaffirms the choice to be human and to live.<br /><br />Simak fans will not be disappointed, although it is probably not the place to begin with Simak. Unfortunately, the Ace edition is full of editing errors.	2005-03-16

In the world of Distant Star, poetry is powerless and power is used to write lines in both blood and the clouds. It holds a faceted lens to the atrocities of the Pinochet years. At the same time, it muses on a world where the people need ever-increasing atrocities to make art that can have any meaning at all. It asks important questions (makes important statements?) about collaboration, poetic form, reception and artistic impact.<br /><br />The Andrews translation felt smooth and pleasant to read. I wish very much that my Spanish were up to reading the original to compare, but it is not. In any case, I did not feel the translation as a barrier or as too much of an artifact.<br /><br />Recommended for Borges fans, people with a taste for Chilean history or literature, or general readers with a taste for finely written novels. I will be reading more Bola&ntilde;o in the near future.	2005-03-14

I had not realized that I had found a re-release of his second book, nor that it was intended for a YA audience.<br /><br />For serious De Lint fans (me!) it is interesting to see how his themes have developed over the years. This is much more representative of his later work than something like Wolf Moon. Unfortunately it is nowhere near as polished as something like Forests of the Heart or Moonlight and Vines and the age is visible from the state of the craft. The plot is overly complicated for the length of the book, and the character of Minda is a shadow of the female characters who appear in later novels.<br /><br />First time readers of De Lint probably want to begin elsewhere. De Lint fans should expect an enjoyable read, but one not quite up to the level that his work normally achieves.	2005-03-14

Chosen Poems selects poems published by Lorde in the period from 1968-1982.<br /><br />As a selection, it is interesting. Reading the transition of 20 years in her work gave me a very concrete sense of what I liked so much about her early work and why I was less interested by the time that her (then) new poems were starting to come out. This selection provides a good picture of Lorde evolving her sense of poetry and its mission. It may be a little irritating to some that the order of the selection is not chronological.<br /><br />Potential readers should note that this collection does not contain any of the work from either the Black Unicorn or the Cancer Journals-- both of which were published during the period represented by the book.	2005-03-13

Hobb is one of the most engaging fantasy writers to have emerged in the last ten years. I have been addicted to the story of FitzChivalry since he appeared in Assassin's Apprentice and have bought and devoured these books literally as quickly as they have appeared. It was certainly with mixed emotions that I picked up this last book. Mixed, because while I wanted to read it, I also did not really want the story of FitzChivalry to end.<br /><br />Let me first say that Fool's Fate is a worthy entry in the series. It kept me reading and absorbed all the way through. There were times when the pages literally could not turn fast enough to satisfy my need to see what would happen next. Do not be afraid of being disappointed.<br /><br />That said, I (like many reviewers here, I see) felt that the book finally failed at closing the story of the life of FitzChivalry in a manner that kept it in sync with the history of the Six Duchies. The book, to me, far too easily closed down aspects like Fitz and his Wit, the fate of the Fool, and the future of Nettle.<br /><br />I think that I understand how Hobb wanted to end this book. I wanted that ending as a reader also. However, I felt that in order to get to that ending she sacrificed too many things that were both good and real in the life of Fitz.<br /><br />For potential readers: Do not begin with the Tawny Man trilogy-- begin with the Farseer Trilogy. You will miss too much if you start with these three books.<br /><br />For Robin Hobb: Please write more as quickly as possible!	2005-03-13

He makes an explicit link between the regions and the writers, with chapter headings such as \\"Melville in the Berkshires\\" and \\"The South: Constance Fenimore Woolson\\".<br /><br />As a reader I found myself out of sympathy with the tone of the book. It may simply be the age of the prose that made it hard for me to read. The book was published in 1949 and there has been considerable change in the style of literary criticism since that time. I liked the anecdotes about the writers and the quality of the prose itself. However, I missed a sense of unity and clarity. I frequently found myself getting impatient and out of sorts while reading.<br /><br />The book may well be of interest for someone looking for background color for the time period, but seems limited for more focused research purposes.	2005-03-11

Like many fine novel writers before him, Card has written a book that is more absorbed with the political complexity that functions as backdrop than he is with his own characters.<br /><br />He is still a gripping writer, and I found the political landscape interesting. While by no means as addictive as the original trilogy, I still found myself coming back to the story with pleasure.<br /><br />Sadly, the pleasure was often marred by disbelief about the characters and their actions. As brilliant as these children are, their arcs are not well developed past that point of brilliance. Petra and Bean seem stuck in a permanent first act, even when events wrapped in personal loss should propel them further.<br /><br />It is worth noting that Card originally conceived of this book and its sequel as one book. It may well be that many of my issues are coming from the pacing of a unity split in two.  It will certainly be interesting to read the next book in the series to see if I can get a feeling for how the completed book might have been.<br /><br />This book is not recommended for readers who have not read the earlier books-- too many of the nuances would be lost if you tried to begin here, rather than with Ender's Game. Card fans should like it, if not love it. There is still enough raw skill in his writing to keep me hopeful about the next series entry.	2005-03-11

Without a doubt, King Rat is suffering as much by comparison to the other more mature works as it is suffering from its own flaws.<br /><br />In many respects, King Rat falls neatly into the urban fantasy/urban fae genre populated by writers such as Emma Bull and Charles de Lint. The common elements of music, mixed heritage, updated fairy tale, and a world hidden under the familiar are all present. King Rat is much darker than the typical entry in this genre, but the outlines should still be familiar to long-time fantasy readers.<br /><br />The fact that it fits within more traditional genre lines than other Mieville novels is not (in itself) bad. The weakness of the book comes from what feel like pretty typical first novel flaws-- uneven plotting and some occasionally strange pacing.<br /><br />Despite these flaws, it was a gripping and often impressive read. If I had read King Rat first, I probably would still have considered him a writer to watch. He fulfils the promise in this book amply, as fans of his later books can attest.<br /><br />King Rat is probably not the place to begin with Mieville unless you are more interested in the urban fairy tale genre than you are in the alternative realities of New Crobuzon. Mieville fans may be a wee bit disappointed, but will probably want to give it a go anyhow. It is worth the time to read.	2005-03-10

The Visitors has many of the trusted Simak elements-- otherworldly intelligence, a focus on small characters and places, and a folksy kind of diction and tone. Unfortunately, it lacks the focus and clarity that makes books like Way Station and Project Pope such striking books to read.<br /><br />Still, there are many interesting elements that make The Visitors worth the time to read. Despite the lack of unity, it contains some of Simak's most interesting observations about religion and economics.<br /><br />If you have not read Simak before, begin with Way Station or Enchanted Pilgrimage. If you are a Simak fan, it is most certainly worth the time to read despite not being his best work.	2005-02-20

Generally, the progress works the other way around. It says a lot about Atkinson as a writer how powerfully the book manages to keep a hold on my mind.<br /><br />Atkinson creates a layered confection of characters both real and mythic. They live in a time just bordering the apocalypse. The world in which they live is often shallow and full of troubles, but is beautiful in contrast to the great pit of nothing waiting past the implied boundary. It is not an uplifting book, and when I finished it I was left with a feeling of bleakness. This is time out of time, and it is more frightening than hopeful.<br /><br />While I do not expect a book to give up its secrets too easily, it did sometimes feel as though Atkinson were being deliberately obscure. Several of the stories had the feel of letters that you find in the street, or a conversation half heard around the corner. She was not generous with the doors into to the developing project of the book. As a reader, there were times when I would have appreciated just a wee bit more transparency.<br /><br />This is the first Atkinson that I have read. It will not be the last.	2005-02-20

I first encountered her writing with the books of the True Game and have been reading her work with varying degrees of enthusiasm ever since.<br /><br />To a large extent, one of the reasons that I like to read Tepper is that she provices a certain amount of wish fulfillment for the reader (like myself) who agrees with most of her political views. All of her books have an element of ignorance punished, women vindicated, and wrongs righted. The Fresco, in that sense, is only continuing in a theme that she has continued to evolve over the course of her writing career.<br /><br />The problem that I had with the Fresco is that as much as I might support some of the solutions discussed (as noted elsewhere, the punishment visited on hypocritical pro-lifers is particularly funny) I could only experience the book as a guilty pleasure. The Fresco simply is not as nuanced or as layered as the best examples of Tepper prose. It is as though she had gotten tired of being oblique and wanted to make sure once and for all that her readers had gotten the message.<br /><br />I am sure that long-time Tepper fans will enjoy this book. Benita and her family are really fabulous characters. Tepper is nearly peerless in her command of craft, and that skill is not diminished here. Similarly, if you know and agree with her world view, the heavy-handed nature of the politics will probably not bother you terribly much.<br /><br />However, one of the things that I have liked about her work in the past is that you did not need to agree with all of her views to appreciate her writing. I do not think that this is the case here. People who have never read Sheri S. Tepper probably want to begin somewhere else to find a better example. I would recommend the Grass/Raising the Stones/Sideshow trilogy or even point people a number of years backwards to the Maven Manyshaped books of True Game.	2005-02-20

"	Having read the Analects, I wanted to read further in Chinese philosophy. It was recommended that I pick up the Lau translation of Mencius, as it was widely considered the best.<br /><br />Even as a reader approaching his thinking for the first time, I was able to get quite a bit from reading the seven books. They were thought-provoking and crisp. I was interested in the notions of morality and good as treated in his analogies. This point is the famous difference between Confucius and Mencius and alone makes this book valuable reading.<br /><br />The Penguin edition may well be the best available translation and I am sure that the essays at the beginning and end are useful for more knowledgeable scholars. Unfortunately, as a reader largely unfamiliar with his life and work (beyond knowing his role as a student of Confucius) these essays assumed a level of knowledge beyond that which I actually possessed. It would have been helpful for me if the introduction had been more concerned with basic context setting.<br /><br />The appendices bound with the book contain essays on dating events in the life of Mencius, early traditions about Mencius, textual notes, history as depicted in the text, and the use of analogy as argument.	2005-02-19

Whether it is the tapes which all turn into The Greatest Hits of Queen if you leave them in the car for too long or whether it is the continuing discussion about the nature of the word \\"nice\\", the book is full of sharp moments that make you laugh. Gaiman and Pratchett clearly have a great deal of fun with this book. The fun is infectous and the reader cannot help but share in the joke.<br /><br />Good Omens is laced with a thoroughly unobjectionable moral about tolerance and balance. I would recommend it as a great gift for a teenage reader (paired with the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, perhaps?). Any readers interested in satire or fantasy should find it an engaging use of time.<br /><br />Be aware, Good Omens is significantly different from the other works of either author (particularly Gaiman). Pick up either the Sandman graphic novels or Discworld if you want something in a style more representative of the authors.	2005-02-06

In this book, Greg Mandel is called back to the service of Julia Evans to solve the mystery of a murder that it appears nobody has committed. It is not long into the investigation before the political involvement and strange case features make it clear that this is no ordinary case...<br /><br />Although the writing is very smooth in A Quantum Murder (smoother than in Mindstar Rising, actually) I still found it a little bit of a letdown after the first book. In Mindstar Rising Hamilton played with mystery genre characteristics-- in A Quantum Murder the book is driven by them. Despite the futuristic technology, this book had significantly less scifi elements than the first. The plot was also quite a bit simpler and significantly more hackneyed in several places.<br /><br />I liked the first book in the series precisely because it combined the two genres (mystery and science fiction) very effectively. I suspect that A Quantum Murder will generally appeal more to mystery fans who are more tolerant of the genre's standard flaws than it will to science fiction readers. Still, I found it an absorbing read which kept the pages turning very quickly.	2005-01-31

The book is surely an influential one-- spawning countless imitations, derivations, and (in our era) reality-based television shows.<br /><br />It is billed, quite fairly, as an adventure story. However, it is a very different kind of adventure than the modern action-sequence laden book which readers today may expect. It is an adventure story, but one which centers primarily on mastery and morality.<br /><br />The morality is placed centrally in the book when Crusoe rejects the advice of his father to accept the happiness of the middle class life to which he was born. Against the wishes of his family, he runs off to sea to find adventure. It is not until Crusoe literally recreates a primitive approximation of that middle class life for himself on his island that he is freed.<br /><br />Crusoe is also a story about the ability of mankind to master his surroundings through hard work, patience, and Christianity. The combination of these three supports are what allow him to escape captivity in Africa, overcome the deadly obstacles on the island, and finally leave the island itself. His physical prowess and combat skills are significantly less important to his journey than the message of trust and persistance that the decades he spends on the island convey. While this message might need tempering for the modern reader, it is also inspirational and important to read.<br /><br />If the potential reader is not used to the diction of the time, the book itself may take some patience and persistance. It pays off, in the end, and should be an excellent book for the young teenager (or the not-so-young grown-up) interested in stories of adventure. The child who reads and enjoys My Side of the Mountain by Jean Craighead George would probably be a good potential audience for Robinson Crusoe. For a good life-at-sea duo, you might consider pairing it with Two Years Before the Mast by Richard Henry Dana.airing it with Two Years Before the Mast by Richard Henry Dana.	2005-01-31

(Tender Is the Night and To the Finland Station being among my favorite books.) I have to confess that I was expecting more from this collection of Fitzgerald essays, letters and journals. The selection is thin, and there is no clear line for why some pieces were chosen and others were not. It seems to me that there would be room on the market for a more comprehensive collection of the non-fiction prose and letters.<br /><br />The Crack-Up was originally published in book form while Fitzgerald was still alive, which may explain the somewhat odd selection. The obituaries collected at the end were added after his death for the 1945 edition.<br /><br />Even with the flaws, The Crack-Up is still worth taking the time to read. Particularly if you are a fan of Fitzgerald, the bitter thought-provoking autobiographical essays provide a nice counterpoint to the exuberance of the novels. Aside from the title essay, \\"My Lost City\\" is particularly nice.<br /><br />Fitzgerald arranged fragments of his writing notebooks into a series of conceptual categories for publication in this volume. These fragments serve as a very nice reminder just how good of a writer he really was. The combination of skilled turn of phrase and careful eye for detail is a powerful one. The journal section could serve as a very good lesson in observation for would-be writers of today.<br /><br />Wilson himself notes that the letters included represent \\"merely a handful that happened to be easily obtainable\\". The most interesting letters are those written to his daughter and some of the letters that he received after the publication of the Great Gatsby. It is fascinating to read the reactions of Stein, Wharton and Eliot.<br /><br />Time for a new edition of (at least) the collected letters?	2005-01-23

This is my first Anna Pigeon novel and am not surprised to read from her fans here that it is considered one of the best. Barr does a good job of combining the mystery genre elements with realistic characters and well-crafted writing. She delivers a book with rare entertainment value. I had trouble putting Deep South down to go to sleep.<br /><br />One of the best things about Deep South is the way in which it delivers the comfort points of a cozy while still bringing home the realities of the death and pain involved. Too much of the time the victims in a mystery novel are nothing more than excuses to explore the world of the detective. Barr makes us feel the death of Danni Posey, and gives us the feeling that the (emotional and physical) stakes are truly high for Anna. I also like that Barr does not shrink from tackling some of the tough non-murder related elements of Anna and her new life in Mississippi.<br /><br />Recommended for all mystery fans. I will be reading further in this series.	2005-01-18

This is the first of the new M&aacute;rai translations that I have had the occasion to read. His writing is a discovery that I am happy to have made, and I will be looking read more of his work in the future. His style is lovely. Mann (as the editorial reviews note) comes to mind, as does the more modern Thomas Bernhard.<br /><br />The subject matter of Embers is very specific and may limit its ultimate audience. It is very concerned with ideas about male friendship, power imbalance, and the insider/exile relationship. While I found the book lovely in its writing and occasionally very moving, I also found it overly heavy and sonorous. The writer was a great find for me; the book itself was somewhat less so.<br /><br />Embers is a deceptively quick read. The straightforward plot can carry the reader right past the point where they may need to stop and think about what M&aacute;rai is saying. Recommended.	2005-01-09

After reading Cyteen, my biggest question is why she does not have *more* of a reputation.<br /><br />Cyteen (a repackaging of three shorter novels set in the Merchanter universe) is a sprawling intergenerational book which is entertaining to read even as it raises important questions about morality and identity. At its center, it features three main characters who are all genetic replicas of other older characters. These three struggle to accept their heritage while at the same time they try to own their own lives in a way that hardly seems possible, given the controlling and invasive atmosphere on Cyteen.<br /><br />This is my first exposure to any of the books in the Merchanter Universe, and I did not feel as though I were missing any backstory. Cyteen is well able to stand on its own as a novel. Readers should be advised to not waste too much time trying to grasp all the concepts introduced in the first 50 pages at the time that they are introduced. Cherryh dumps an awful lot of ideas into the first few chapters, but they are all explained gradually as the book unfolds.<br /><br />I would recommend Cyteen for almost any science fiction fan, particularly those who are interested in biotechnology issues. Cyteen should generally safe for teenage readers-- sexual situations (including a rape) are implied, but not made explicit.	2005-01-09

Darrow takes the reader through some of his most famous cases and explains the philosophy with which he approached his career and the law in general. Any reader interested in the history of the period should find his accounts fascinating: Eugene Debs, John P. Altgeld, the MacNamara Case, the Loeb-Leopold murders, and the famous Scopes  \\"monkey trial\\" case are just some of the points touched upon in the Darrow autobiography.<br /><br />Darrow is a clean and competent writer, if not an artistic one. The prose is easy to read and understand. In places, the book can get frustrating because he leaves a topic well before the reader has lost interest. Future publishers would do well to publish this book together with some pointers for further reading.<br /><br />The Da Capo Press edition is published with a very strange little introductory essay by Alan Dershowitz. In it, he seems more interested in rehabilitating the memory of Bryan than he does in introducing the book. The reader may want to skip it until after finishing the main book itself.<br /><br />Beyond the obvious lawyer/law student audience, I would also recommend this book to readers interested in labor politics, the early history of the 20th century in the US, and social justice.	2005-01-09

This classic Tolstoy novel about love, loss and the nature of good is one of those books that should be re-read to fully appreciate their scope. As a teenager, you focus on the doomed love affair between Anna and Vronsky. As a thirtysomething reader, I read it as a book about compromises and trust. I can only expect that if I read it at midlife, I am going to find something else again.<br /><br />It is too big to be perfect, and you can pick nits with much of what Tolstoy has done here. But why would you? It is a masterwork accomplishment by virtually any standard. The Rosemary Edmonds translation is smooth and well done. It flows smoothly and does justice to the original.<br /><br />A good book to get teenagers reading, approachable and accessible for most readers. Highly recommended.	2005-01-09

I was given this book as a gift by a friend who knew that I was a large fan of Carroll. I read it with some trepidation, as I generally dislike Carroll scholarship. I am interested in his writing, and not his supposed or real relationships with little girls.<br /><br />I was both reassured and interested when I discovered that Leach had set out precisely to debunk the notion of Carroll as either an eunuch or a pedophile. Her thesis is that the image of Carroll as obsessed with little girls was a Victorian attempt to whitewash his image gone sadly wrong with the rise of Freudian psychology. She draws a sexually mature Carroll, primarily involved with adult women. Most specifically, she theorizes a relationship between Carroll and Lorina Liddell, the mother of Alice.<br /><br />While the book raises reasonable doubts about the theory of Alice Liddell as the Dreamchild, her evidence is as circumstantial as the opinions that she is attempting to debunk. It is and remains an interesting thesis, but she offers no real proof. Perhaps the main flaw of the book is that it is both too long and too short. It is too long to make just the point debunking the \\"Carroll as pedophile\\" myth; she presents her evidence quickly, and then repeats it for the rest of the book. It is too short to be a full or real biography of Carroll; she settles for criticizing the more mainstream biographers. I think that the readers would rather have seen either more or less material.<br /><br />Potential buyers should be aware that if you are not already familiar with the Dodgson/Carroll biographical material then this book will not be clear or meaningful. Recommended for Alice/Carroll fans and scholars.	2005-01-04

The Shy Tulip Murders are part of the subgenre of mystery where the reader learns about the profession of the amateur detective at the same time that the detective is learning about the case. The hook of these kinds of books lies in the discovery of how the particular  career lends itself to solving the mystery.<br /><br />So far, I have seen books that feature book shop owners, actors, security guards, caterers, hoteliers and many many other professions. I have to admit that a plant pathologist would have never occurred to me as a possible protagonist. However, it works reasonably well-- Round Up and rare flowers are built into the story nearly seamlessly and the effect is a well-written and cozy read.<br /><br />The plot is stretched a little thin in some places, and the tension between the environmentalists and loggers felt too large and complicated to be squashed into the limitations of the cozy detective novel. The protagonist herself is suitably spunky, and Rothenberg does a good job of making me curious about her-- almost curious enough to invest in another installment even though this definitely is not my kind of mystery novel.<br /><br />This book should appeal to cozy detective fans. Extra points for you if you also happen to be or know a botanist!	2005-01-04

With Stalker, Kellerman introduced Cindy as the next generation of detective in the Decker family. While that book did not reach its full potential, Street Dreams does a lot better. This is the first book in a while from this once fascinating series which does justice to both the characters and the writer.<br /><br />Cindy is a lot less contrived and more interesting than she was in Stalker. Kellerman has let her be less driven and somehow more human. Koby is a really nice character addition and he gives the book a little extra sparkle. The story is interesting and the relationship between the character generations is well written.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the story of the German murder which Rina investigates is a bit of an off note in an otherwise sharp book. While it had the potential to be interesting, it is never really developed and in the end serves only to distract from the main event.<br /><br />Long time fans of the series should take heart and enjoy. Newcomers probably should not begin here-- the backstory is a little dense if you haven't met the characters already.	2004-12-29

Lost Boy, Lost Girl is one of the best horror/supernatural books that I have read in a long time. While not perfect, it rises above its flaws to make for an engrossing and evocative reading experience.<br /><br />The characters of Mark and Timothy are well-drawn, and the plot commands attention even as it winds through elements as diverse as suicide, serial killers, skateboards, and the life of a writer. It has its genuinely creepy moments, and is refreshingly unpredictable.<br /><br />On the minus side, the pace of the book is strange. It almost seems as though it should have been a much longer novel. By the time you finish the introduction, the book is a third gone. The ending feels in many ways like a non sequitur. Straub almost gets away with his left-field conclusion, but ultimately it detracts from the novel rather than adding to it.<br /><br />Recommended for horror fans who appreciate good writing more than they do the gore. Straub fans will not be disappointed, and it is not a bad place to begin with his work in general.	2004-12-29

In this case, his mentor is also his kidnapper-- Charles Hobuhet, a disturbed young Native American who becomes Katsuk (the avenger) after his sister is brutally raped by loggers.<br /><br />While written with Herbert's usual sensitive feel for character and motivation, Soul Catcher lacks much of the complexity found in other Herbert titles. While in some places the simplicity feels intentional and fable-like, in other places it seems as though the novel were essentially unfinished. Certain aspects of Katsuk and the Marshall family are hinted at and never developed. Herbert's typical trope of scattering external viewpoints (newspaper clippings, past writings of the characters) throughout the book is present, but erratically employed and nearly fades out completely by the end.<br /><br />The very simplicity of the book may make it as appealing for some readers as it may disappoint fans of Herbert's more political offerings (Dune or The White Plague). I would not recommend it as an introduction to his novels. However, it is an interesting digression in his career and contains many of the elements that make his overall body of work so impressive.	2004-12-29

Darknesses continues the solid work begun in Legacies. The character of Alucius deepens his understanding of his Talent and capabilities. The reader gains more knowledge of Corus and the different powers within Corus.<br /><br />The interesting thing about Modesitt is that he always seems to like the ideas that he is working out more than he likes the reader. His books are not really that different from one another; they always seem like parts of the same larger project. When he gets it wrong (Spellsong cycle), then the novels become repetitive and tedious. When he gets it right, then there is a real reassuring quality that makes his work a pleasure to read.<br /><br />In the world of Modesitt, hard work and solid values are always rewarded. As a reader, it is often nice to have a little literary corner where this is true.	2004-12-29

Klasky has clearly given the city a lot of thought, and has a flair for working out its design. She also gets a lot of credit for not weighing down the book with an unwieldy amount of magic. The characters are significantly less well-developed, and their motivations and ideas are clearly secondary to the plot and the ideas with which Klasky began the book. Unlike other readers, I  found no real problem with the character of Rani as such. I think that she becomes unsympathetic largely because we see what happens to her rather than what she makes happen. <br /> <br />Glasswright is still a quick and entertaining read. There is enough promise here to pick up the second.	2004-12-04

I liked the book least as a novel of the Holocaust-- he bends history too much to really buy it. I liked the book best as an exercise in creating myth. Trachimbrod comes alive through the stories, the various books (I like the Book of Recurrant Dreams best), and the characters.<br /><br />A sweet read, and a promising first novel.	2004-12-04

Well-written, compelling and often surprising-- it deserves better than to be as forgotten as it seems to be today.<br /><br />Maire ni Donnall and Tadgh MacNiall are husband and wife in ancient Ireland. They carry out their respective trades of healer and bard against a setting of battle, and a curious new religion called Christianity has just started to walk the land. When Maire is cursed by a woman she tries to help, they are pulled into the land of fairy and sleep away the passing of time in the fairy kingdom. When finally they emerge into the modern world, they find themselves separated and active on opposing sides of the Troubles that currently split Ireland. They must not only find each other, they must also find a way to heal the rift between the great powers and aid the troubled land.<br /><br />I have held onto this book since the early 80s when I bought it, and on each re-reading I am glad that I did. Suitable for fans of romantic fantasy, fairy-based fantasy, and people interested in Irish myth. Good for young readers, although some adult situations and violence are implied.

Somehow I never managed to find it. I had nearly forgotten about it when I ran across the new edition-- an impressive-looking trade paperback with  glowing Neil Gaimon blurb on the cover. I picked it up with a great deal of enthusiasm.<br /><br />War for the Oaks belongs to the Urban Fey fantasy subgenre. Think Tom Deitz or Charles de Lint. The not-conventionally-pretty heroine is recognized for her true talent by the Seelie Court, and along the way finds magic, true love, and extreme danger.<br /><br />Sound familiar? It should. The War for the Oaks suffers at least a  bit from its status as a forerunner. Since publication the theme has been picked up, copied, made more complex and generally just evolved. What must have seemed revolutionary in 1987 loses a lot of its gloss and charm for a first-time reader in 2004.<br /><br />This is not to say that War For the Oaks is without its own merits. Bull is a skilled writer. Eddi is an endearing character. The ups and downs of band dynamics and bad boyfriends are extremely well done. The problem with the book is largely that the Fairy part lacks depth-- the plot feels too simple and too easily resolved. Many of the resolution plot points were predictable more or less from the beginning.<br /><br />The strong ugly duckling wish fulfilment element of the novel will most likely make it a satisfying read for younger fantasy readers or readers who like their Fairy Tales unmixed with heavy politics. Readers with a taste for darker or more complex fantasy world may well find this book just a little bit lacking.	2004-11-26

Perhaps the larger point that she is making is that the relationship between Islam/Christianity/Judaism today needs to be seen in the context of the past (including the more distant past) rather than being seen ahistorically.<br /><br />Armstrong structures the book to support her thesis-- interspersing chapters relating to the current history of Jerusalem and Palestine with chapters about the major waves of crusades. It is not clear when you buy the book that you are going to get so much modern Middle Eastern history, and potential buyers should be aware of this as it may cause some frustration if you are expecting a book more like The Crusades Through Arab Eyes or a straight up crusading history.<br /><br />In the reviews here at Amazon and in other forums there have been broad accusations of pro-Islamic bias levelled at Armstrong. I believe these accusations to be largely in error. If you read more than one of her books, Armstrong has dedicated herself to her notion of triple vision. Her stated project is to foster understanding between the three religions by talking directly to the misconceptions that we hold about each other. The writing in Holy War makes very clear that she intends the book for a western audience. Accordingly, she spends a great deal of time explaining the Islamic perspective under the assumption that it will be the point of view most lacking from the potential audience. I assume that were her presumed audience to be primarily Islamic she would probably irritate them by constantly defending the Christians.<br /><br />However, it does seems that in this book Armstrong lends herself more readily to accusations of bias through a number of significant elisions. For instance, she doesn't mention the aggressive pre-crusades contact between Christians and Muslims. Nor does she detail in any length the period that she refers to as the Islamic dark ages. It may be a serious miscalculation on her part to fail to understand that an audience wears its hair shirt more readily if it believes that its neighbor has to wear one as well.<br /><br />Readers should also not be fooled by the misleading introduction to the new edition-- the book itself has not been updated past its 1991 US release. Recent events in the middle east (or elsewhere) have not been addressed.<br /><br />Overall, Holy War should be interesting to a wide variety of audiences. It is not as smooth as some of her later books (Battle for God is my personal favorite). Nor is it always comfortable to read. Armstrong has taken on a large project in her writing, and chosen an arena where to attempt objectivity is difficult at best, and thankless at worst.

Mindstar Rising is a pleasant and addictive read which combines the best of the noir detective genre with the best of science fiction. Greg, Eleanor, and Julia are characters that John D. MacDonald would have introduced in some of his better works. At the same time, the future world introduced here is credible, with exciting new technologies and political complications. The combination between the two genres is skillfully done. It allows Hamilton to play with reader expectations in a manner that raises the suspense and keeps the pages turning.<br /><br />Readers of the Night's Dawn trilogy may find this book a mixed blessing. Mindstar Rising is much more self-contained as a book, much lighter and less epic. I found that a pleasant surprise, but that reaction will obviously depend on the taste of the reader.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of combined science fiction/detective novels such as Altered Carbon by Richard Morgan. This may also be a good book for someone who is just starting to read science fiction but  who does not want to stray too far from more traditional comfort zones.	2004-11-21

The characters are among her most developed and she does her usual good job of demonstrating the impact of the changing post-war society on their personalities. Their motivations are murky, and none of them are particularly innocent. The moral ambiguity that marks this book adds a dose of depth that some of the lesser Christie novels lack.<br /><br />Also titled as Murder After Hours in some editions. Recommended for Christie fans, or mystery fans new to her work.	2004-11-21

A reader looking for basic biographical data on a deeper-than-encylopedia level will find what they are looking for with this book.<br /><br />Donati, unfortunately, writes with a noticeable lack of flair and manages to nearly make Lupino boring. This is no mean feat, given how colorful and important she was. He does not place her films into a critical or historical context. Nor does he really explore her character on anything more than a surface psychological level. Furthermore, in his focus on her romantic life, he overlooks or skips over other important relationships that she had with other women. The most obvious omission is her adult relationship with her daughter.<br /><br />Useful for class assignments, but other readers may want to wait for a better treatment.	2004-11-21

Sumption does the reader a service by bounding the topic in a way that still provides an excellent overall view. The Age of Pilgrimage focuses primarily on the years between 1100 and 1500. It concentrates its attention during this period on the French cultural center (England, Northern Spain and Southern Italy).<br /><br />The book is intuitively structured and flows very naturally for the reader. Sumption begins with the relevant background: relics and the cult of relics, saints, traditions of pilgrimage and retreat. He then moves to the periods relevant to pilgrimage before looking specifically at the pilgrimages to Jerusalem and Rome. The chapter on the Crusades as a pilgrimage movement is particulary interesting.<br /><br />I actually bought the book looking for more historical background regarding the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. Unfortunately, Sumption chooses not to address Santiago in the same detail as he addresses Rome and Jerusalem. However, the Way of St. James is such an important part of the medieval pilgrimage experience that I still got quite a bit of relevant history and background.<br /><br />The book is full of wonderful anecdotes and quotations. It should appeal to virtually any historian (armchair or otherwise) but will have particular value to people with interest in Saints, the history of the Catholic church, medieval history and (obviously) historical background to the pilgrimage experience. The 2003 edition is an update of the 1975 book by Sumption which was simply titled Pilgrimage.	2004-11-16

I read nearly all night to finish it, even though it was at a time when I could ill afford the exhaustion.<br /><br />Sebold very cleverly combines a coming of age story with a ghost story and a murder-mystery and throws in some really smart insight about families for good measure. The result sounds like it could be too much, but is in fact just right. The Lovely Bones is moving and sweet and somehow quite inspiring.<br /><br />There were some little awkward moments towards the end-- a few details that rang untrue, but these are minor points. Overall, the premise is convincing. Sebold creates a vision of the afterlife which works well in the context of the book and is compelling in its own right.<br /><br />The rape and murder at the center of the book could be upsetting for young readers. However, with that small caveat, I would recommend the book to virtually everybody.	2004-11-05

It tried to be a kind of military biography and I found the result sketchy. It provided neither the background for the Napoleonic wars that I was looking for nor a personal biography of Napoleon himself.<br /><br />Markham does offer interpretations of the rise and fall of Napoleon that were interesting and probably are what distinguish this work from other books about the subject. My problem was that I did not have enough context in my own knowledge to place those interpretations appropriately. This book might well have been useful to someone with a more extensive background in either Napoleon or his age, but it was not useful to me.	2004-11-05

If you are searching for a book or two to take to the beach or on a plane and do not like genre fiction, then Longitude would be a book that I would heartily recommend.<br /><br />Sobel succinctly recounts the history of John Harrison, a rogue clockmaker who came up with an unconventional approach to the problem of determining longitudinal position at sea. The navigational challenge is an interesting one and Harrison is an attractively unlikely hero.<br /><br />The writing is crisp, clean and smooth. Note that this is a popular treatment, not a scholarly one. Readers should look elsewhere for extensive notes and bibliography. The book does not require any scientific knowledge to appreciate it and is suitable for virtually every audience.	2004-11-05

Fans of Pern should be interested to read this early McCaffrey, published in 1967.<br /><br />This book features the strong-minded heroine Sara, who finds herself suddenly on another planet with a new body and a big problem. Sara becomes involved in the politics and intrigues of her new environment. Her better nature and her fear for her new love overcome the risk that she faces as an illegal and dreaded Restoree.<br /><br />The book stands up well after all this time. McCaffrey is a talented writer and the book does not read as either dated or stilted. It may not be for everyone (I preferred Pern myself) but if you like the genre, it could well turn into a McCaffrey favorite. It should appeal to McCaffrey fans, fans of Science Fiction romance, and romance readers in general. Although there are some mild sexual situations, it is safe and probably very enjoyable reading for younger readers.	2004-11-03

War Within and Without is not an easy book to read. It must have been an even more difficult book to publish. Lindbergh gets points for exposing herself and this period in her life to public scrutiny.<br /><br />This book contains her journals and letters from the period 1939-1944. Although many things happen during this time, the focus of the book is on her husband and his involvement with the isolationist America First Committee. It is by turns painful and almost offensive to read the young Lindbergh as she attempts to defend her husband for his opposition to US war participation. She points out correctly in the introduction that they did not then have the benefit of historical hindsight. Still, it is difficult not to cringe as you read about Charles and his decision to criticize the Jews for pushing the US to enter the war. Anne herself during that period is tarnished by the charge of fascism as she publishes her book The Wave which tries to make sense of the changes in Europe.<br /><br />These journals are an invaluable historical window into those conflicted pre-war years in the US. The national reluctance to act has now been almost forgotten, and it is a rare person who is willing to admit that they had taken a stance against US participation. I doubt that there are many texts like this one.<br /><br />Although Lindbergh wrote many books which were not journals, her style of writing is ideally suited to the journal form. Her prose is as lovely here as it is in anything that she ever published. The descriptions of her love for Charles or the death of a beloved family dog ground the political aspect of the book and are powerful enough to bring tears to the eyes. The fact that I so often disagreed with her politically only made her more human-- and ultimately made the book more moving to read.<br /><br />Highly recommended for virtually any reader interested in history, essays, or journal writing.	2004-11-03

While not her best work, it may well appeal to people who are in the mood for this particular mix.<br /><br />Morris has several themes to which she commonly returns. Her novels often feature a female protagonist who is strongly talented and experiences radical class displacement. In this case, we have Shebat as an abused young girl raised on a primitive planet. She is elevated to become part of the most powerful family in the galaxy. Morris explores the life of Shebat as, despite her talent, she becomes an unintentional pawn in the games of ruthless men. She must reject conventional paths to reason and victory to find her own solution to the challenge.<br /><br />Dream Dancer suffers from some weak plotting. Shebat makes some fairly unbelievable emotional leaps in her saga. The story also gets tangled up occasionally in its own complexity. There are a fantastic number of elements introduced in this relatively slim novel and it becomes very difficult to keep track of which parts are important for the reader.<br /><br />If you are more tolerant of confusing complexity than I am, you may see more of the positive elements (of which there are many) in the series. Particularly nice is the way that Morris blends low-tech magic and high-tech science.<br /><br />Be aware that Morris often includes very adult material and scenes in her books. It does not detract from the readability, but may make Dream Dancer unsuitable for younger readers.	2004-11-02

Happily for me, Baum has filled the book with a sea of these charming little details that are a large part of what still make the Oz novels so wonderful to read for kids and bigger kids.<br /><br />Magic of Oz focuses on the darker side of Oz. The trouble this time comes from a discontented Munchkin teenager who steals the power of transformation. He is able to brew this trouble because of the alienated beasts in the Forest of Gugu. Fortunately, the wicked plans are foiled by the Wizard and Dorothy in time for everyone to celebrate the birthday of Ozma. Additionally, the Nome King loose end is finally tied up for good.<br /><br />Magic of Oz is the thirteenth and pentultimate book in the series. As in Glinda of Oz, the book suffers from some recycling of older themes and evident author fatigue. Still, definitely worth the time for fans of Oz. Particular points for the Neill illustrations of the Li-Mon-Eags-- creepy!	2004-11-02

While Jack and Jill might not rate as one of the best Alcott novels, it is not worth dismissing out of hand for that reason. As usual, she crafted a thought provoking and enlightened book that teaches as it entertains and comforts.<br /><br />Jack and Jill are fast childhood friends who find their lives interrupted by a terrible sledding accident which leaves both of them invalids. As they recover and heal, they and their friends learn important lessons about responsibility, giving and friendship. Jack and Jill should be an immensely satisfying read for pre-teenagers. The sure Alcott hand with character keeps even the most obvious moral lessons from feeling overly preachy.<br /><br />While the book is ideally suited for younger readers, grown ups will be interested in the larger issues raised here. Alcott firmly asserts the need for individual growth, gender equality, and personal responsbility. Historical discussions about temperance and higher education for women should additionally make this book a good read for history fans.	2004-11-02

James and Colin Dexter. This praise overcame my natural allergy to historical mysteries and led me to buy the book. I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Dissolution is a surprisingly quick read for such a long book. It flows smoothly. The combination of skilled plotting and historical detail is a winning one. The length of the book is tricky to pull off. However, I believe that the complex nature of the subject would have been difficult to tackle in less time.<br /><br />Dissolution is as much an investigation of personal faith as it is an investigation of a murder. Matthew Shardlake is not only uncovering who killed Robin Singleton, he is also finding some deep pools of unease within himself at the methods and motivations of his beloved Reformation. While a whodunnit could have been covered in half the time, the themes of history and faith would have been short-changed had Sansom skimped on the background.<br /><br />Mystery writing at its best is often an exploration of cynicism and loss of innocence. Like any good Noir detective, Shardlake begins his career as an idealist. This book is his fall from belief into a bitter awareness of corruption. If Sansom picks up this thread and continues with it, then the readers should benefit from a very interesting series indeed.<br /><br />Dissolution suffers from a few first novel flaws. For instance, Cromwell is awfully forthcoming about his scheming. It was not necessary for Shardlake to get a confession from him to believe that Shardlake could have his faith badly shaken. This and a few other minor missteps seem like artifacts of a writer who does not yet trust his own material. None of these things are flaws that should dissuade you from reading the book.<br /><br />This book should appeal to fans of more literary mystery writers such as James, historical fiction fans, and armchair historians. Highly recommended.	2004-10-28

I should start this review by saying that I am not sure that Zelazny could write a bad book. Non-Zelazny fans may disagree.<br /><br />Merlin is very clearly the son of Corwin. He is irreverent about the holy ghosts of Amber and Chaos. He hits his head against the rules (and sometimes even wins). Despite an overly-long sequence in a strange testing ground between shadows, Zelzany still infuses this book with the manic strangeness and humor that are part of what make him such a wonderful writer. As noted, virtually none of the Amber novels can be read stand-alone or out of sequence. You are going to have to read the books before this one to get the background. And you are going to have to read the ones after this to get an explanation. An enjoyable task, luckily.	2004-10-26

I picked this up as a result of the glowing reviews, and was not disappointed. Water Clock is a simple, straight-up mystery and a well-written one at that. It will appeal to readers (like myself) who have less patience with the trend of producing ever more shocking serial killers instead of well-plotted characters. There are some minor uneven points (the pace is a little bit wrong), but they are more than made up for by the positive aspects. Give it a try!	2004-10-26

His return brings an end to the peace of mind of Fleur and Michael. Jon may have moved on and fallen in love again with Ann, but Fleur has never loved everyone but Jon.<br /><br />Swan Song has many of the usual Forsyte book tropes-- commentary on modern life offered through the observations of old men; June introducing us to the latest artistic schools; Forsyte paralysis when faced with the unblinking desire to do the wrong thing. As with the five books preceding this, it is all wonderfully well written. Michael and Fleur encountering people doing the Charleston is a particularly charming moment.<br /><br />Swan Song is so powerful partly because of the mixed emotions it has about Fleur. While Galsworthy gamely soldiers on to complete the cycle of doom begun by Soames and Irene, it is evident that he has a great deal of sympathy for Fleur. This installment shows her at her best as well as showing her at her worst. She is the swan of the book, singing her loveliest song.  A worthy ending to the second Forsyte trilogy and a very readable instalment in this underappreciated series.	2004-10-25

In his apt introduction, Martin Seymour-Smith opines that Nostromo is the best Latin American novel written in the English language. While these sorts of contentions are always difficult to evaluate in terms of accuracy, it would be safe to say that if one were to make such a ranking then Nostromo would have to be considered.<br /><br />For a reader who has followed the history of European commerce and presence in Latin America, it will be surprising to hear that Nostromo was written in 1904. The complexity of the situation in Costaguana will be all too familiar-- as will the loveliness and resources of that troubled region. The characters in Nostromo cling to the hope of rescue from the more developed countries. At the same time, it is increasingly apparent that the values from the old world have no real place in the new. The frustration and hopelessness of ever sucessfully affecting change put paid to even the best motivations. There is a bitterness here that feels very modern, denying any golden age of European contact.<br /><br />Nostromo is moving and complex. The mix of personal and global stories blend mostly seamlessly. It realizes the promise in less-developed Conrad novels (Victory, for example) and is the fullest of all Conrad reading experiences. It is not, however, a hopeful book and any optimism it exhibits is well-guarded. Readers are advised to spend some patience allowing Conrad to build the picture of Costaguana in the intial part of the book. The patience will pay off later on, and there will be more than enough character driven action later to compensate for the history lesson.<br /><br />In addition to the introduction by Seymour-Smith, the Penguin edition comes with explanatory notes and a handy glossary of terms.	2004-10-24

It was with great pleasure that I saw the Murder Room on the bookstore shelf. Other mystery authors release one good book and then quickly seem to lose the spark. This is not true of James, who has been writing intelligent and solid mystery novels nearly as long as I have been reading them. A new book from her is always an occasion for a small celebration of reading pleasure.<br /><br />The Murder Room returns to two of her favorite themes-- history and obsession. The Dupayne Museum as a setting for crime provides a bit of both. Its focus on an the years between the two great wars makes it a little pocket of nearly forgotten history. By contrast, the collecting ways of its founder and the decision to found a murder room from the period lend this quiet dusty place more than a hint of obsession. These two elements play out as well in all the characters: the obsession of a man who is determined to get back family mementos; the obsessive friendships that can develop between women; a son trying to leave his history behind; an unknown mother who holds her private and public histories tight to her chest. Even Dalgliesh himself is not immune, as a new love makes him think back to his own history and attempt to define which things are really important to him.<br /><br />James is never a small writer. Her books tend to have a wide range of characters with complex personal histories. This said, Murder Room had an unfortunate disjointed feel, resulting from too much of this same complexity. There were a few too many interesting elements. It felt as though had she focused more, there would have been a deepening of the book and its themes. As it was, there were so many plot elements associated with the characters that at times it felt like a great big basket of red herrings. A few red herrings are not bad, but a tangle is never good.<br /><br />Still, the flaws should not detract too much from the reading experience-- particularly not for long-term fans of James. If you have not read any of her novels before then I might pick up Cover Her Face or The Skull Beneath the Skin before starting with this one.ve not read any of her novels before then I might pick up Cover Her Face or The Skull Beneath the Skin before starting with this one.	2004-10-24

It is a companion piece to Illuminations, a siimilar volume prepared and introduced by Arendt in the late sixties. Unlike Illuminations, which focuses on the literary essays Benjamin wrote, Reflections is intended to present a wide variety of subject and style.<br /><br />In his introduction, Demetz urges the reader to listen to Benjamin in a musical rather than a literary way. Indeed, this book works very well if you approach it as an impressionistic meander through the style and range of thought present in the essays. I would be hard-pressed to describe how to rationally link the autobiographic travel writing of \\"A Berlin Chronicle\\" with the aphorisms of \\"One Way Street\\" or the Marxist thought in the essays on Brecht. All the same, they feel linked as a reading experience. That linkage may be more on the sound than the subject-- the sound of a very smart man thinking very hard and with great elegance.<br /><br />Benjamin is never a dry writer. Some other reviewers have remarked on his humor, which definitely exists. It is also worth highlighting his keen eye for detail, his openness to self-examination, his practical advice about writing, and his distinctive turn of phrase which somehow survives through the translation process.<br /><br />It would be difficult to find a book that I would recommend more highly.	2004-10-22

It was recommended to me, and I picked it up in a half-hearted way. I thought it was something that I would breeze through and forget about. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised. I found it a book that I both enjoyed reading and would recommend. At least, I would recommend it with some reservations.<br /><br />The good sides of the book appear in her instructive stories about the advertising business. Lawrence brings the message across very clearly that advertising is relationship driven. A successful agency must focus on relationships both with the client and with the intended audience. Lawrence gives an example of success achieved by taking that focus to its limits.<br /><br />Perhaps the most fascinating aspect (and one that should appeal to students of business history) is advertising reception at a time that was much less marketing saturated than we are today. She had an opportunity to be a giant with emerging technology and in an emerging field. It makes for terrific reading.<br /><br />My reservation about the book has to do with the writing quality. Her tone is extremely chatty. At the beginning, I tripped over the awkwardness of the prose. The organisational principle of the book was vague. Timeframes shift without warning or explanation. Finally, while the mix of personal and business anecdotes was entertaining, there were times that it moved far too swiftly from one to another. Still, she gets points for writing this book on her own and not with a ghost writer. I have the feeling that the reader was better off with its flaws than with a more inauthentic voice.<br /><br />I am not in the advertising field, and I really enjoyed the book.  People interested in one of the following areas should find something here: media, advertising, entrepeneurship, women in industry, business history, or pop culture. It also has a great can-do view of the world, inspiring to anyone who needs a push towards success.	2004-10-22

In The Miocene Arrow, McMullen shifts focus from Australia to North America. The political situation on this continent is significantly different and with a few exceptions the characters and issues are also different. As a result, Souls and Arrow read like related books rather than a sequence. While you may get a richer experience from reading them in order, it would be safe to read this on its own and go back to Souls later.<br /><br />I missed the librarians and the calculator and the other great stuff from the first book-- some of the grand inventiveness is missing here. But at the same time, I thought that the character development was a lot stronger and deeper. Serjon, Alion and Bronlar are complex and fascinating characters who offer a personal level that should appeal to most readers. This book may well have a wider potential audience than the first specifically because of the personal and political fulness.<br /><br />The Aviads stayed opaque enough in this book that there's a lot of room left over for further development in a subsequent book. I can only hope, and run out and buy Eyes of the Calculator to see what he does.	2004-10-21

She tackles some of the grand old chestnuts of fantasy and folklore (Atlantis, witches, mermaids) and wraps them around a coming of age story. This could be disasterous, but in the end it largely works.<br /><br />Fernanda is a very proper young teenager who has been taking care of her family since the untimely death of her mother. When her father inherits a house in Yorkshire from a distant relative, her family travels there to visit. A secret locked in the house calls mysterious trouble to them all and begins a sequence of events that will make Fernanda doubt everything that she thought she knew-- both about the world and about herself.<br /><br />The first half of the novel is enchanting. It has a very prim and arch voice. But that primness of tone works well to build the characters of Fern and Will. The initial encounters with Alison and the Watcher are very well done, and the search for the mysterious key is entertaining and believable.<br /><br />The second half of the novel is unfortunately quite a bit less effective. Fern capitulates too easily to these new experiences, and the character arc of a girl becoming a woman is handled like a dip on a roller coaster. She goes from utterly realistic and practical to wholeheartedly embracing her role as the dramatic fantasy heroine without so much as a backward glance. Many of the flaws in the second half would have been resolved if Fern had been struggling more with the world in which she found herself. Once that element was lost, the archness of the book loses its freshness and gives an overly precious feel with far too many grand fantasy stock attributes.<br /><br />Still, this is a commendable first book. It should appeal to fans of folklore and fairy tale based fantasy. Although it has its flaws, these are tempered by its creativity and shine.	2004-10-21

A very nice science fiction novel which explores first contact between two very different alien races and does it from the point of view of both species. The novel is compact and efficient, managing to capture the major political reactions without needing to make them overly byzantine or complex. Conspicuous villains are not on offer. Rather, Foster tackles the origins of prejudice and offers a possible model of moving forward. The book points out that contact between unlike peoples can also offer important opportunities for change within both affected cultures.<br /><br />The resolution, like the rest of the book, is very gentle. At this point in science fiction and world history it may feel slightly dated or overly hopeful. On the other hand, perhaps a healthy dose of resolvable conflict is a welcome and necessary thing. You decide.	2004-10-21

I had a very lucky backdrop for reading this book. I brought it to read on a long hiking trip that took me from the Netherlands, across Belgium and into the north of France. Through a trick of synchronicity, I was entering Liege at the moment that I was beginning the chapter \\"Liege and Alsace\\"-- whose subject is the assault on Liege and the German Army of the Meuse.<br /><br />While such a reading experience greatly enhanced my understanding of the book, I do not think that the potential reader would need to be in Belgium to appreciate it. The complexity of the European political situation at the time and the tangle of alliances make World War I one of the most difficult modern events to really grasp. Tuchman builds a framework which assesses the probable root causes of the war. She also uses diagrams and clear writing to make the movement of the armies visible at an overview level.<br /><br />I found Guns of August to be very fair-handed and believable in its assessment of political origins of the conflict and its assignment of responsibility. Even if you do not accept all of her ideas, I believe that you will still find that the framework works well to contextualize and elucidate the events of the outbreak.<br /><br />The bibliography is annotated, which is very useful for choosing further reading. Additionally, this edition is bound with a foreword by Robert Massie which introduces the reader to Tuchman as a writer.	2004-10-19

This volume is a special singly bound edition of the first three Spellsinger novels: Spellsinger, The Hour of the Gate, and The Day of Dissonance.<br /><br />Three Spellsinger novels in a row might be a little bit much for a lot of people. But, given that the series degenerates rapidly after the first three, a potential new reader could pick up the three most worth reading in one volume.<br /><br />For those of you not familiar with the Spellsinger concept the story goes like this: A bumbling student, Jon-Tom, from \\"our\\" world is pulled by a magic working turtle into an alternate world where animals talk and are self-conscious. Jon-Tom discovers that  he can work magic in this world by playing and singing. Under the mentorship of the wizard who brought him there, he becomes a powerful source of good in the new world.<br /><br />These three books are at their best when they do not take themselves too seriously. Jon-Tom and his abilities provide a launching spot for some truly awful music-based puns. I am old enough to *get* most of these puns, by the way, but I imagine that for a younger reader much of the music may be pretty dated.	2004-10-19

Bullion tells the story of the 1983 robbery at the Brinks-Mat warehouse near Heathrow, in which 26 million pounds of gold bullion was stolen. Three investigative journalists (Andrew Hogg, Jim McDougall and Robin Morgan) examine not only the crime itself, but the roots that the crime and its aftermath had in both British and American organized crime.<br /><br />I picked this book up when I had literally nothing else to read. I was not expecting very much. In the past, I have found True Crime books that I have read to be shoddily researched, overly shocking, or heavily biased and I have not enjoyed them. Bullion is a pleasant surprise in that it seems more concerned with facts than either sensationalist aspects or pushing a particular agenda. The research that the three have done feels complete, and they do a good job of detangling the connections so that the story is understandable to the average reader.	2004-10-18

Fortunately or unfortunately, that is not the case.<br /><br />Barrier Island provides some of the richest characterizations and most complicated plot points to be found in one of his books. I really admire what he did here and had he not died soon after publication, it would have been interesting to see where this new direction had taken him.<br /><br />I think that how much you like this book will come down to a question of taste. I enjoy the simplicity and the hard-boiled mystery elements of a book like Bright Orange for the Shroud more than I enjoyed Barrier Island. The reader is required to work a lot harder in this book than in some of the others and the plot is occasionally so complicated that I had to go back to remind myself what I had just read.<br /><br />In short: Do read if you are a MacDonald fan already. Even if you are not, if this is your cup of tea then it would be a perfect cup of tea. Someone looking for more standard hard-boiled detective material should pick up a Travis McGee instead.	2004-10-18

The first time that I encountered Christian and his pilgrimage was as a preface and a family favorite in the book Little Women by Louisa May Alcott. Unfortunately, it was not until twenty-something years later that I actually got around to reading the book itself. If I were you, I would not wait that long.<br /><br />The first part of the current combined book appeared in 1678. Bunyan, a nonconformist Protestant minister who was imprisoned for preaching without a license, wrote at least the first part of the book in jail. The second part was first published in 1684. It is likely the most popular allegory ever written, and is still one of the best selling books of all time.<br /><br />What makes it so popular? The obvious key to its popularity is its simple, crisp style. Even accounting for the language changes between the seventeenth century and now, it is not a struggle to read Progress and it flows well for the modern reader. Although the book is allegory, the characters are full of little realistic details that make them feel quite human. Incidentally, I was reading this book as I was walking some of the old pilgrimage trails of Europe and it was interesting to me how vivid and applicable his version of the pilgrimage experience is. The Slow of Despair rang remarkably true, as did characters such as Talkative and Mr. Worldly Wisdom.<br /><br />The Oxford University Press edition is bound with a scholarly introduction which is, for a change, worth reading. It also came with explanatory notes and a glossary which were helpful for the modern reader who is not familiar with the everyday language of the period.	2004-10-18

He arrives at the Mont house with a letter of introduction for Fleur. Fleur herself is occupied with her son Kit and her life as a leading social figure.<br /><br />It is that social life which is endangered in this book as an impoverished and slightly disreputable socialite (Marjorie Ferrar) makes a disparaging remark about Fleur as collector in a gossip column and sets off a storm. The fierce and public reaction of Soames leads to a libel suit being filed against Fleur and the issue of private morals is tried on the public stage. Fleur proves herself as stubborn as her father when a matter of principle is involved, and burns her own hands on changing public opinion.<br /><br />The character of Marjorie is an interesting one. In the first Forsythe trilogy, the agents of moral change are drawn very kindly and are actually the heros and heroines of the books. By contrast, Marjorie as the typical flapper is as repellant as she is energetic. She clearly represents the new world, but the approval that the book has for her is just as clearly mixed. Her honesty speaks in her favor, but she is also visibly shallow and capable of great careless cruelty. She seems to represent the accelerating decay of standards and values and as such offers as bad an option as the inflexibility of the earlier generation of Forsythes. At one point in the book, her kindly grandfather asks, \\"If your idea of life is simply to have a good time, how can you promise anything?\\" It is a question that the book seems to be posing of itself.<br /><br />The book is bound with \\"Passers By\\", an interlude in Washington in which Soames realizes that he, Fleur and Michael are in the same hotel as Irene, Jon and Anne.	2004-10-16

As the daughter of a rural doctor, Cora had the experience of travelling with her father on medical calls and assisting with his practice as she got older. This book is a memoir of those times with her father. It opens with a blizzard that he went out in just before she was born, and closes with his death more than forty years later. It is a slim volume and a quick, smooth read. The chapters are loosely grouped around subject areas such as the life of the wife of a doctor, the buggy and horses that the doctor used, and her period as an office assistant.<br /><br />I am delighted to see that the book has been reprinted. It is well-written enough to be of interest to general readers of all ages. In addition, it should be of specific interest to anyone interested in the history of women, pioneer medicine, or that particular time in US history. Cora herself inspired at least one book for younger readers, so if you are familiar with the book Cora Frear, this might be worth reading as well.	2004-10-16

This trilogy (A Modern Comedy) opens with the focus on Fleur, the daughter of the man of property, Soames. When we last saw Fleur in To Let, she was marrying the wealthy and feckless Michael Mont after having been disappointed in love.<br /><br />As this book opens, Fleur is just shy of her two year wedding anniversary and she has recently discovered that Wilfred Desert, a good friend of Michael, has become too fond of her. She hates to lose Wilfred as a friend and social acquaintance, and she thinks that since she does not feel real love for either of them, she might as well see what Wilfred has to offer. Meanwhile, Michael develops into a Don Quixote character, getting dragged into helping everyone who asks him for help and becoming involved in oddball politics. The book spends the rest of its time resolving the triangle, and moves Fleur through this transition period into the next phase of her life.<br /><br />The White Monkey of the title is a valuable Chinese painting given to the couple by Soames. The painting repels and fascinates whoever sees it, and represents the juncture of the collecting efforts of both Soames and Fleur.<br /><br />The second trilogy has often been criticized for being less realistic in its characters than the first. Wilford in particular has been said to be exaggerated and inaccurate. I tend to think that these criticisms miss the point. Galsworthy is not so much interested in realistic characters as he is again examining changing morals, this time with the new elements that the postwar generation introduces. Fleur and her oddly passionless nature make her an ideal foil for the examination of relationships from the female point of view. The loyal Mrs. Bicket is a wonderful contrast for somehow managing moral correctness in her marriage despite behaviour that is externally much worse. One of the delightful things for me is that Soames himself is partially rehabilitated in this book, as the character traits that made him  so awful in his relationship with Irene here lead him to do the correct thing in business. In contrast to the more critical views, I found the characters well drawn and fascinating in their intricate moral dance.<br /><br />The book is bound with \\"A Silent Wooing\\", a coda that fills us in on what is happening with Jon in the new world, providing a hint for what The Silver Spoon will bring us in the next trilogy entry.relationship with Irene here lead him to do the correct thing in business.

Murder follows murder as Jemima begins to have her own ideas about who is to blame.<br /><br />It is really a mark of how good Fraser is as a detective writer that I really enjoyed this book despite the unbelievable ending. While not as good as some of the other Fraser novels, the characters still have depth and the writing has a fine and subtle quality well above that of most detective fiction novels. If you have not read Fraser before, I would begin with Quiet as a Nun, not Cool Repentance. If already a Fraser fan,  it is still enjoyable, even when it does not deserve to be.	2004-10-15

I had first read Nylund when I picked up his book Dry Water, which I found to be promising, but not really fulfilling.<br /><br />A Signal Shattered, to my mind, gets a lot closer to a mature work by a talented author. This is true despite some problems that I had with the book while reading it.<br /><br />My biggest problem was that I was one of the unlucky few who did not realize that this was a sequel, and so I read this book without having read Signal To Noise. As a result, it took me a *long* time to figure out what was going on and probably longer than most people to get into the plot. I would agree that this was probably the wrong way to go about the book. For me, it is a pretty strong statement about the quality of the book that not only did I eventually get into the plot, I enjoyed reading the book quite a bit.<br /><br />While Nylund has cyberpunk elements to his writing, I think he would be more reasonably compared to a writer like Tim Powers than to more traditional cyberpunk writers. His predominant strengths as a writer lie in his mix of concept and science with a strong lean towards the mystical in places. I would agree that perhaps more attention could have been paid to developing the character reactions to the situation they find themselves in, but I also should say that I was only a little bit bothered by the absence.	2004-10-14

He has no motivation beyond finding things to make his life there bearable. He is permanently inside, but by virtue of his money, permanently outside.<br /><br />The murder that occurs gives Bill an at least temporary reason to get up in the morning, and provides the reader with an excuse to examine the details of small town life with clues that do not fit together and a crime which is, after all, a crime just like any other.<br /><br />The qualities that earned this book a Booker nomination were obvious yoon reading. Collins is a skilled writer who manages to provide a smart, outsider look at small town life in the US. The tone and the plot work well together in the a palette of claustrophobia and surreality that never indulges in self-conscious tricks or far-fetched coincidences.<br /><br />A fine book-- a read that made me want to find more by Collins.	2004-10-10

In order to explore this thesis, Pollan looks at some anecdotes from the histories of Apples, Tulips, Marijuana, and Potatoes. It is a clever idea, and Pollan has enough knowledge and style to make it an interesting read.<br /><br />Unfornately, it never goes beyond an interesting read. If you think about the experience of reading a fairly long and well-written magazine article then you are probably going to get the idea about what this book is like for the reader. Pollan lacks the expertise as a writer to draw together the different threads of the chapters to lead to any real point about his central thesis. While several of the sections are nice to read in their own right (I particularly liked the chapter about apples) they do not really hang together well and often have the feel of a superficial collection of anecdotes. The writing style may also irritate some; he has clearly been heavily influenced by the Wendell Berry/NPR school of writing and while not in itself a bad thing, he lacks the substance to pull it off well and occasionally ends up sounding mannered in a fake folksy kind of way.<br /><br />The sad thing about the failures of the book is that Pollan clearly knows his material. In the section on the potato, he makes a clear and balanced assessment of the issues that lay behind genetically engineered crop production. He goes far beyond the normal superficial treatment of the subject and speaks with an authority which is lacking for most of the rest of the book. It would have been nice if that confidence had extended to the rest of the work.<br /><br />In summary, Botany of Desire is a mildly interesting time waster which should tell you some things that you did not know about plants. Do not read it expecting something larger than that. Pollan himself may well be a talented writer, and I would not be averse to reading something else that he had written.mething else that he had written.	2004-10-09

However, I realize that my reception of this book is suffering because I'm comparing it to his later work which is probably not fair-- apples and oranges.<br /><br />De Lint largely writes complex fairy-tale based urban fantasy with a strong dose of dreaming and different levels of reality. Wolf Moon, on the other hand, is a fairly straight up fantasy novel which deals with the idea of shapeshifters in a fairly static fantasy universe. Had it been a book by anyone other than De Lint, I think that I would have found it okay-- standardly entertaining, some moments of spark and promise, pleasingly dark.<br /><br />So. If you are a de Lint fan because of the later work, there is a good chance that you are not going to be very happy with this book. If you are picking up this book because you want to read something by de Lint, bear in mind that this is not representative and that it probably is not the place to begin with his writing. If you are a fantasy reader who reads across the genre, you are probably going to find it enjoyable enough-- maybe  even enjoyable enough to pick up some of the later de Lint books that everyone keeps talking about in these reviews.	2004-10-09

I am glad I did, because it looks as though it will be another series that will keep me entertained and engaged-- even when it means reading a book *way* past my bedtime.<br /><br />Ship of Magic draws from a wealth of other maritime writing to provide enough realistic details to make the conceit (a town that depends on a kind of living ship for their livelihood) work very well. I was willing to buy the details of life on board the ships and I was not able to easily poke holes in the fantasy world that the book creates.<br /><br />Her characters are both strongly drawn and appropriately flawed. One of the best things about her work in general has been the fine and realistic characters with whom she populates her fantasy world. I liked the way that Althea and Wintrow (the two main characters in this book) are introduced and contrasted and I see enough in both of them to keep the reader hooked throughout the rest of the trilogy.<br /><br />A great beginning, and an overall great read for fans of literate and readable fantasy novels.	2004-10-09

While it talks about the development of her spiritual history as a historical event, it is not a book that focuses on Teresa as mystic visionary. On the other hand, while it contains much historical background and fact, it also elides and skips over much that would have been interesting-- presumably in the interest of making it a quicker read appealing to a broader audience. While I was fine with the direction Medwick chose (there has been enough said about Teresa as mystic) I felt like some sections were frustratingly incomplete and occasionally the treatment of the background was too superficial.<br /><br />For instance, while a lot was said about her struggles with the church hierarchy, I found that Medwick gave surprisingly few details about the tangle Teresa had with the Inquisition. We know that the threat was hanging over her. We know that she was reported to the Inquisision. We even know the name of her enemy. However, she elides quite a bit of what surely must have been a historically interesting time in the life of Teresa as she actually faced Inquisition scrutiny. In her (successful) effort to make Teresa approachable as person, Medwick at times nearly lifts her out of history. It takes more than interpersonal relationships and anecdote to make a historical biography.<br /><br />I am sorry to begin the review with criticism. I am sorry because, while I see the flaws with the book, I still feel like Teresa of Avila is a loving and obviously well-researched treatment of a subject which is very difficult to approach in a neutral way. Medwick is to be commended for the effort that she put into it, and the way in which she managed to make readable very alien customs from a very different age. The book is very interesting indeed when she places Teresa in the context of Spain and the Spanish culture. She does a very good job of communicating why Teresa is one of the two patron Saints of Spain.<br /><br />Medwick talks in her introduction about how long she has been researching this book and her notion of Teresa as a soul in progress. Both points are interesting. If I had to guess, I would think that many of the gaps were unintentional and that Medwick had so much material that it was edited down at a certain point to try to make it more readable for a popular audience. Too bad, whatever happened.<br /><br />Truthfully, this book is more a three star book, but I am rating it for four stars both because of the fascinating subject matter and because I truly believe that the flaws should not dissuade you from reading the book if you have interest in the Saint.

What is possibly a surprise is how much can be learned about the current relationship between the two sides by looking at the differences in these stories about the past.<br /><br />Maalouf uses the texts of historians writing at the same time as the Crusades were occuring to create a story of how the conflict was seen in the Near East. At the same time, he describes the complex political structure that existed and examines what happened when groups with such different religious and civil backgrounds came into close contact with each other.<br /><br />I am amazed how much Maalouf was able to do with so few words. The situation was obviously very confused and potentially confusing, but he is masterful in that he manages to simplify the issues for the readers of the book without reducing them past the point of meaning. After reading this book, I was not surprised to find out that Maalouf is primarily a novelist and I am anxious to read some of his other work.<br /><br />If I have any complaint it is that there were so many subjects that could have been expanded on, but were not. I cannot fairly fault Maalouf for this as the book was a complete reading experience in an of itself. The book simply does what a good history book should do: It provides new information to the reader while at the same time stimulating him or her to read further.	2004-10-09

Dorothy, driven by financial disaster, brings Aunty Em and Uncle Henry to Oz to live out the rest of their lives in peace with Ozma in the palace. At the same time, Roquat the Red (the old foe of the girls) decides to lay waste to Oz once and for all to retrieve his magic belt.<br /><br />The middle of the book meanders a bit, as Dorothy takes Aunt Em and Uncle Henry on a tour of some of the stranger parts of Oz. The various towns (Cuttenclips, Fuddles, Utensia, etc.) are half puns, half morality plays, but still clever for all of that. Dorothy is a well-written enough character that she can raise a smile even in a ridiculous scene like the one in Bunbury where she is offered a stale wheelbarrow to eat instead of the lunch she was looking for.<br /><br />The Neill illustrations in this Oz book are particularly magical. For example, the big paste heads of the Whimsies have stuck in my head all the years since I have read it for the first time.<br /><br />I have read all the Oz books multiple times, and this is one of the three which have proven the most memorable. (The other two are The Road to Oz and Ozma of Oz) It gets a high recommendation despite any minor flaws.	2004-10-07

I read it for the first time years and years ago as required reading in middle school and this is the first time that I have come back to it since that time. I found myself unsurprisingly better equipped to read and appreciate this story now and was exceptionally pleased to have read it again.<br /><br />This edition contains three short stories that were written after Tolstoy made his conversion to intense Christian beliefs. They are interesting to read together, particularly given the common theme about characters with mistaken ideas about what will bring them contentment.<br /><br />\\"How Much Land Does a Man Need?\\" is a parable which examines greed and contentment through the story of a peasant who believes that he would be satisfied with his life if only he had a little bit more land.<br /><br />\\"The Death of Ivan Ilych\\" tells the history of an outwardly prosperous but spiritually empty man who dies at the age of 45 after a fall in his home.<br /><br />In \\"The Kreutzer Sonata\\" a man on a train relates to a fellow passenger what the circumstances were that led to the murder of his wife.<br /><br />It is, at the very least, important to read these stories. The Kreutzer Sonata is particularly important in the history of literature. At its release, it was banned throughout much of Europe for indecency and has been inspiring debate about feminist issues and women characters in literature ever since that time.<br /><br />The translation used in the Dover Thrift edition is competent, but has its awkward moments and is occasionally clunky and obtuse. I might personally recommend buying a different edition if you are planning a purchase.	2004-10-07

The Moving Target, with its introduction of the wonderful Lew Archer character, is a good place to begin with his writing and one of the best in the series.<br /><br />The Moving Target explores a wide variety of relationships that turn poisonous-- husband and wife, brother and sister, lovers both requited and unrequited, employer and servant, and lawyers and the law. Originally said to have been titled \\"The Snatch\\" (vetoed for obvious reasons), it tells the story of the kidnapping of an eccentric oil millionaire named Ralph Sampson. Lew Archer is hired to help get him back, but he quickly begins to wonder if anyone wants Sampson to return.<br /><br />While all the characters are interesting, the addicted jazz pianist Betty Fraley is particularly complex and well-drawn. A very good read.	2004-10-07

I almost did not want to read the sequel because I was afraid that it was going to be a disappointment.<br /><br />While perhaps Children of God is not as original as The Sparrow, it is not (I am relieved to say) a disappointment. It picks up the themes that were explored so well in the first book and develops them in a number of new and satisfying ways. Rakhat is considerably more developed, as is the interspecies conflict between the Runa and the Jana'ata. As in the first book, Russell uses a sure and blessedly light hand to link the events on the two planets to the long-standing moral issues that have concerned humanity.<br /><br />There are weaknesses in the Children of God that are largely tied to the Earth side of the story. A few of the less necessary characters have the unfortunate feel that they exist simply to move the plot along. Since Russell uses so few cliches in her writing, it unfortunately hits a very sour note on the few occasions where her talent for writing character fails. It did not need stock bad guys or good guys to make it a success. The book also did not need the dramatic 'reward' offered at the end by Isaac and his discovery. The hand of God would have been clear enough in the unfolding events on Rakhat, and additional proof felt unnecessary. Not bad, but unnecessary.<br /><br />Properly speaking, this book would probably be rated four stars rather than five. However, there are so few writers working with this level of inventiveness. For that reason, and for the strength of the two books taken together, I am rating it as five stars.	2004-10-06

In Less Than Angels, a group of anthropologists find that competition on different levels leads them into new combinations of relationships and ideas. Whether it comes down to affairs of the heart or academic achievement, things are not as they seem and people have unexpected depths. Less Than Angels is particularly nice as it seems in large part to be about the ability of characters to change, even given the constrained and mannered world in which they live.<br /><br />While reading, I enjoyed this book as much as I have enjoyed any Pym that I have read. However, I noticed when I sat down to write this review that it didn't stay with me as clearly or for as long as some of the others. If you haven't read Pym before, I would begin with The Sweet Dove Died or Excellent Women. These to are, to my mind, her best works. However, if you are already a fan of Pym, you will find nothing to disappoint you in Less Than Angels.	2004-10-04

People either seem to really like it, or really consider it to be nothing more than a flawed version of Lolita.<br /><br />I am one of the people who really like it.<br /><br />I thought that the work he was doing with genre and character in this novel made it one of the most interesting to read. I liked the simplicity of the story-telling and its stripped-down nature made it extremely powerful.

Red Harvest is less well-known than its more famous Hammett brothers, The Maltese Falcon and the Thin Man. It may well be my favorite, but it would be really hard to choose. Hammett is one of the greats of detective fiction and his work has both defined and exceeded the typical genre boundaries.<br /><br />Red Harvest (1929), like many Hammett novels, is as much about the corruption of place as it is about a particular murder mystery. The mining town of Personville/Poisonville comes into the life of the Continental Op when he gets stood up by a potential client, and becomes the focus of his efforts to clean up corruption in the town when that client is killed.  The book is actually structured as a series of linked smaller stories about the town, but instead of providing obvious divisions, this structure lends the book a complexity which compliments (rather than undermines) the unity of the whole.<br /><br />Red Harvest is as tough and dark as a reader could want without falling into self-parody. Hammett has a distinctive crisp and clean writing style which makes the pages fly by faster than the reader would want them to. A must-read for fans of Noir and hard-boiled detectives, a should-read for pretty much everyone else.	2004-10-03

Michael K is a simple gardner from a class and a situation where to be simple is not to be protected, but to be unnecessary and even guilty. Guilty of what? Guilty of being expendable, of being bewildered, of being unable to cope or understand the different categories of change around him. Coetzee has created a character who has been judged and found wanting long before he understands that this is even a possibility.<br /><br />What is interesting about Michael and what is also one of the organising aspects of the book is that Michael does not stay in passive opposition to his situation but gradually moves to a kind of active opposition-- at least as active as such a limited character with limited power is capable of carrying out. A lot of the criticism of this book talks about post-colonial literature and racial relations and all of those things are certainly backdrop to the story, but it is mostly about power imbalance and the effect of power imbalance on the people least equipped to do anything except express confusion. Michael K is a disenfranchised everyman, someone who is only as useful as society is kind.<br /><br />This is only the second of two Coetzee books that I have read. I unintentionally picked the two books with which he won Booker prizes (this one and Disgrace). If this had been the first Coetzee that I picked up, as good as it is, it may well be that I would not have rushed to read another one. It is a relentlessly unhappy book, and its vision of freedom that Michael is able to achieve is not a glorious one. Michael apparently has only the freedom to be misunderstood and protected, misunderstood and persecuted, or alone and dead. As much as the world around him is creating Michael, it is hard to imagine a world in which he ever had the possibility of happiness. That kind of bleakness is hard to read and there is not even Beckett-style bitter humor to lighten the pages or encourage the reader. Disgrace was not exactly a happy book, but there was a complexity in it that I somehow miss in Life & Times.<br /><br />It is not where I would start if I had not read any other Coetzee first, but it is difficult to argue with the brilliance of the writing (or the writer).tter humor to lighten the pages or encourage the reader.

Her husband discovered its remains among Olsen's papers in 1972 and she herself pieced the current book together and published the still unfinished results in 1974. This newest version of the book includes new material discovered by Olsen that was not included in the 1974 version.<br /><br />Yonnondio (the title taken from a Walt Whitman poem) is a moving lament for the impoverishment and despair of young families and young women during the depression. Despite the uneveness and jumpiness of the narrative (an artifact of its unfinished status), the small and detailed moments leap out through the pages to capture the reader. It is occasionally a very sad book, and always very beautiful.<br /><br />It's unusual to be so impressed by an unfinished novel published when the author was still living. Unfortunately, Olsen has published so few works that even something rough and unfinished is a welcome treat. While I understand her insistence that she would not write any new material for the book, it is hard not to read it and wish it were possible to read the finished book. If the fragments are so magnificent, what would the final work have been?	2004-10-03

He is at his best in many of these-- ascerbic, crisp and correct. I am constantly amazed  by the number of people who have opinions about the ideas and theories of Eliot, but who have never read his essays themselves. I suggest that before taking umbrage at what he is supposed to have said, a student of the modernists should at least read a bit of what he did say.<br /><br />This selection is broken into two categories: Literary Criticism and Social and Religious Criticism. Essays such as \\"Tradition and the Individual Talent\\" and \\"What is a Classic?\\" (compare and contrast with G. Stein in \\"What are Masterpieces?\\") are particularly worth the time to read.<br /><br />I wish that Kermode had included more of the social and religious essays and that he had not excerpted as heavily as he did throughout the book. I would personally rather read a longer book consisting of complete essays than having such a high percentage of the selection consisting of excerpts. Of the meagre three essays in the social and religious section, two were excerpted rather than being published in their entirety. Too bad.	2004-10-03

It fascinates because it takes a hard look at a history that has been so purposefully unwritten. It irritates because it jumps from subject to subject in a way that often feels incoherent and incomplete and fails to give an orderly and concrete view of the Roma.<br /><br />My feeling is that the book is marketed incorrectly as being about the Gypsies and their journey. I think that most correctly it is about Fonseca and her experience of learning about the Rom. I picked up this book looking for a better historical and cultural understanding of who they are, and this book provides this information in only an incomplete way.<br /><br />The subjects in the book range from the social conditions of Rom in various eastern European countries, to some discussion of historical origins, to the Gypsy experience of the Holocaust. Through all these chapters, the organising force of the book is not historical or even political but is rather the thesis that Fonseca is building regarding the place (or lack of place) that the Rom have experienced both currently and historically.<br /><br />There is a lot to learn here, and I suspect that I would have been less frustrated had I first read a decent straighforward historical book. It was only as an introduction to the subject that I found Bury Me Standing confusing and lacking.<br /><br />I liked the use of the first person and the way that Fonseca makes clear the prejudices and issues which she brought to the study. After living in Europe for eight years, I gave Fonseca big points for saying things out loud about the question of asylum seekers and Eastern European immigration that very few in the EU are prepared to admit. There is material here that I am going to be thinking about for a long time to come.<br /><br />In short: this is not the one-book overview which is going to answer your questions about the Rom, but it is a decently written and fascinating book in its own right. I would have preferred to see more annotation, but the bibliography is extensive and organized by subject, which is helpful for choosing further reading.<br /><br />Three-and-a-half stars, really, with a half star round up for the interesting subject matter.book in its own right.

A 15th century man was found buried under the tower, dressed for a pilgrim journey. This unusual find inspired Lack, a scholar in church history, to become a historical detective and make some guesses about his identity and about the trip which defined his life so much that he wanted to be buried in its symbolic costume.<br /><br />Lack tentatively identifies the pilgrim as Robert Sutton, an educated urban tradesman from the early 15th century who had apparently made the long arduous trek from Worcester to Compostela in Spain. She then reconstructs what his probable journey would have been, going so far as to include possible timeframes and the corresponding physical and political conditions that would have been part of the trip.<br /><br />The book is structured so that it largely focuses on the trip itself. In the first three chapters, she covers the identity of the pilgrim and his potential motivations.  From that point in the book forward, the book is structured as steps in the pilgrimage-- going from England, to Brittany, to Armagnac France, to Navarre and finally arriving at the Camino in Castile.<br /><br />As a historical reconstruction, the book is fascinating. She brings an obvious wealth of research to the reader and weaves a convincing and concrete narrative about what the Compostela could have been like for Sutton. I enjoyed and applauded her use of small details which did not distract from the text and added enough verasimilitude to keep the read smooth and fast. Lack makes an effort to capture the emotional side of pilgrimage as well, in a way that resonated as realistic and helped provide a character arc to the depicted journey.<br /><br />Unfortunately, if you are looking for facts about the medieval pilgrimage, the book can sometimes be a little bit frustrating. Although Lack throws out tantalizing anecdotes and details, its structure around the pilgrim narrative keeps her from any larger and potentially interesting digressions about the factual aspects. I would have appreciated more background about topics such as the history/politics of the region, the coquillards, etc. Many of these items are addressed in the footnotes, but I would have appreciated pointers to further reading by subject area instead of just a general bibliography at the back.<br /><br />A well-written and interesting book, which should appeal to readers interested in the pilgrimage to Compostela, medieval history, or religious history.m narrative keeps her from any larger and potentially interesting digressions about the factual aspects.

There are a *lot* of main characters, and I kept being lazy and wanting to put the book down because I felt lost and did not want to bother finding the thread again. My experience, at least, was that once I persevered through the first quarter of the book all the different voices fell together rather neatly and I was no longer bothered by the multitude of characters.<br /><br />While it may be a flaw that it took me time to reconcile the different people, it is most certainly one of the major strengths of Robin Hobb that she manages to handle so many well-developed characters in a novel/series. I was delighted with the way these characters grew and matured. I found it both realistic and well-written. For example, it would be very tempting to leave Althea and Malta difficult and immature for the sake of the plot, and it was very nice that Hobb did not take the easy way out and do this. The two women matured as much as two stubborn natures would be expected to, given their respective backgrounds and the situations in which they found themselves. I had the feeling that the plot unfolded naturally from the nature of the characters and the conditions of the fantasy world, and that is exactly as it should be in fantasy fiction.<br /><br />The end of this book had just enough resolution to make it more than the middle piece in a trilogy. It stood well in its own right as a novel, which is something most writers consistently fail to do with Book 2.  Mad Ship also introduced enough new elements (Dragons!) to provide promise that the final book will deliver a number of surprises.<br /><br />Hobb is one of the best fantasy writers currently working and this book stands well as an example of her work. She is a literate and mature writer with demonstrable mastery of her craft. I look forward to reading book 3.	2004-10-02

These major points include: the effect that concentration of ownership has had on food production, the role of the fast food giants in shaping the food supply industry, labor practices across the chain that leads to the fast food burger, health effects of fast food and the political activities of both the fast food industry and its suppliers.<br /><br />In this era of books which take an airy approach to social metaphor, it was refreshing to read a book which was constructed using a great deal of fact-based research.  Like any good muckraker, Schlosser stretches some facts (the number of deaths attributable to e coli, for example) and interprets others. However, the facts are there, and even given his interpretive bias, he makes a compelling case.<br /><br />Occasionally I found that he sacrificed logic to make his emotional points. For instance, I thought the manner in which he brought together the different threads was a bit jumbled and poorly structured. These structural flaws did not bother me when I was reading, but I really noticed it when I was trying to recreate the logic for this review.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I doubt that this book will make its way to the people who need it the most-- the children who are the major consumers of fast food. However, it would make a good and thought-provoking gift for the literate junk food junkie in your life.<br /><br />Fast Food Nation is currently published with a new afterword about Mad Cow Disease and comes complete with some very detailed notes and a thorough bibliography.	2004-10-02

I enjoyed Green Rider quite a bit, and I have to admit to being a little disappointed that it took First Rider's Call so long to come out. I hope that the third in the series will not keep us waiting for so long.<br /><br />I thought that Green Rider was a remarkably smooth and well-written book, which drew maybe a little too heavily on the fantasy traditions of other people. The good news about First Rider's Call is that it has much less fantasy cliche and Britain seems to be finding her own voice to work out her own ideas.<br /><br />The bad news is that the writing is much less smooth, and the structure occasionally feels jumbled and jumpy as though it had been reworked and re-edited a few too many times. I also found myself getting a little irritated with the Karigan in this book-- much more was made of the reluctance and I thought that Britain leaned too heavily on Lil Ambriodhe to provide Karigan with motivation.<br /><br />Still, given how long the book took to appear and given that this is a sophomore effort, I was happy with the book and find it a good second series entry. I hope that Britain has since hit her stride and that we will be able to keep the originality in the third book and go back to some of the smooth writing of Green Rider.	2004-09-23

Borthwick writes a great cozy, and her Sarah Deane mysteries are some of the best when I'm in the mood for this kind of book. I gave it three stars instead of four since this is not my favorite Sarah Deane (those would be Coup de Grace and Dolly Is Dead) and since it seemed like there were a number of small avoidable flaws in the book.<br /><br />The biggest problem I had was with the large number of characters and the ridiculously high body count. I'm part of the school of thought that believes a good cozy should limit the corpses. The golf course in this book seems to have more dead people than live ones. It strained the imagination and I eventually found it irritating.<br /><br />However, the book still gets you where it needs to go and it has its moments of laugh-out-loud funny. A good book by a good writer.	2004-09-23

Three-and-a-half stars rating, really.<br /><br />I think that it is unreasonable to expect a travel book to be anything except the author's perpective on the places visited. French clearly brings her own (British) agenda to Argentina, but she also just as clearly makes an effort to move beyond that to present a balanced look at the city she was living in. I found it a good read (almost too quick) and a well-formulated one. It was worth the time that I took to read it.<br /><br />Good points:<br /><br />France owns her own prejudices. She is very careful to note when she was being cranky and British about something so that the reader is clear that it is her persective and not the voice of authority.<br /><br />I also like that she did not try to take a sweeping 20,000 foot view of the culture, but limited her commentary to those aspects to which she had access.<br /><br />Less Good Points:<br /><br />She treated some subjects (the Faulkland Islands, for example) more quickly than they seemed to deserve and at times that left me with the frustrating feeling that there was more to say about a subject but she had already moved on to the next point. I do not think that it needed to be much longer, but a little more filling in areas that got short shrift would have been good.<br /><br />At times her writing was a little too precious and tried a little too hard to make all her moments meaningful. One of the things that makes a writer like Chatwin so great is that he does not try to connect the dots for the reader and is very sparse in the way that he handles detail.<br /><br />The final very best point is that I enjoyed reading it and it inspired a desire to know more about the subject-- which is, I suppose, the ultimate point. Recommended if you like travel books.	2004-09-22

I found the character of Maura Isles to be a tired rehash of other ME characters and I found the rest of the people/plot elements to be both wooden and predictable.<br /><br />Maura has a series of very strained love interests which do nothing at all for the book and only function to irritate the reader.<br /><br />Gerritsen must be feeling the pressure to release work quickly, because I know from her other work that she can do better than this.	2004-09-21

This, for me, was mostly true at the beginning. It was obvious straight away that it drew heavily from a tradition of mythology to which I had no access. It is not so much that this was a barrier to my being able to read it; it is more that I kept expecting it to be a barrier and initially fought the flow of the book, trying to make sense of things that were not important to understand precisely.<br /><br />To my mind, there are several ways to read magic realism. One way is to understand all the mythology and all the references that are included and use that understanding to directly enrich the \\"real\\" level of the book. The other way is to let the real and the mythic flow together and hope that the author is skilled enough to knit the two elements such that you do not need an academic understanding to follow the story. I think that Okri is a terrifically talented writer, and I found that once I got over my initial discomfort I was more than able to follow the narrative. The plot, to me, did not seem particularly hidden or unclear and I did not have the feeling that it was written for academics.<br /><br />_The Famished Road_ tells the story of Lazarus/Azaro, a spirit child who chooses to stay in the impoverished world of reality, rather than return to the ideal world of the spirits. His family struggles with the impotence of their situation, baffled by politics and poverty and conditions beyond their control. The world of the compound is full of magic both real and imagined as the characters search for a way to influence their lives in the face of forces which seem to make things inalterable. Myth becomes a kind of resistance against the politicians who fight in the street and hand out poisoned milk.<br /><br />I found it beautiful to read, and only slightly less rich because I did not know the surrounding mythological setting. If you are interested in the book, do not be put off by the more frightening reviews. It is not as dense as it initially appears and once I got used to the prose, I found that it read quickly and very smoothly.ing.

If I were to tell the protagonist from The Tunnel that I had issues with his book, he'd probably just wave me sideways towards the Party for Disappointed People. Get in line, he'd sigh. Life is disappointing.<br /><br />I liked the conceit of the Party for Disappointed People. I liked many of the one liners. I admired Gass' writing ability. Mostly I admired the project even if I confess that I couldn't like the book.<br /><br />652 pages of dense (often unreadable) prose with a grotty poorly-endowed main character who has affairs with his students, kills his wife's cat and generally feels sorry for himself. Whoosh. It took me weeks to read, and *nothing* takes me weeks to read. I genuinely tried to follow everything in the book, but I have to confess that my grasp of his German experiences is spotty and I never really got Susu. The clearest and most readable bit was the bitchy backbiting about his colleagues in the department where he teaches. That was at least funny.<br /><br />Generally, I felt like it tried way too hard to be a huge sprawling classic. I agreed with much of what it said about history and how you approach it-- again, the project is what I admired. Maybe I just couldn't feel too much for a book that seems to reject any ability to feel joy or to be anything except disappointed. I mean I *love* Beckett, but Gass isn't Beckett and I never got the feeling that he earned all that bitterness. Kohler isn't sympathetic either as a hero or as an anti-hero and while I guess that's part of the point, I didn't find that I admired the point.<br /><br />Maybe I'm just not literary enough. Maybe I'm just getting old and cranky. Anything is possible. Read it yourself and see.	2004-04-30

Her Garda Sergeant Recaldo is fresh character, and a likable one.<br />Small flaws: the details felt a little bit ragged in some of the places the plot was spun around Mrs. Walters and it was not always clear with which of the three policemen we were dealing.<br />Minor quarrels, these.

On the one hand, &iacute;t's very clearly about why the age must pass but on the other it is kind to those who mourn the going. Even the Man of Property himself is sympathetic at the last. Time judges people like him harshly enough, Galsworthy seems to say.<br /><br />Irene has been the animating spirit of these books-- an agent of change to the Forsytes in a way that one of their own (June) can never be. When she at last raises her hand in forgiveness to Soames before her final departure, it's a kind of triumphant benediction-- a kindness come too late. The Forsytes are all but dead and she's departing with her own to a new land.<br /><br />I suppose that the next generation of Forsyte books will be aobut people with the will and temperment of the family, but without the supporting time. I wonder if it will follow Fleur or Jon, Imogene or Val.<br /><br />Galworthy does a superb job of capturing the restlessness of love-- the smell of warm grass that you look for-- as though the harmony of the weather is proof of love's constancy. And that wonderful moment in _To Let_ when Fleur puts her face out the window into the night and smells only petrol. A real moment.<br /><br />These are beautiful and under-rated books.	2004-04-30

I was actually pretty seriously disappointed that the final book in the trilogy won't be released in paperback for another six months.<br />People have pointed out that this is a character development book, and that's clearly true.

If you're considering buying a Dorothy Sayers/Peter Wimsey mystery and haven't read any of her books before, please don't start with this one. Begin with _Busman's Honeymoon_ or _Clouds of Witness_ or _Gaudy Night_. This is a very particular little byway in the Wimsey books and doesn't give a good idea of the series as a whole.<br />If you're a Peter Wimsey fan already _The Five Red Herrings_ is an interesting digression, albeit an overly-complicated one. There's such a maze of accents and motives and characters and train schedules that you really have to work to follow the plot. I was frustrated enough in the beginning to want to put the book down, but once I'd persevered half way through the book I found that it started fall more comfortably in place. I have to admit that I gave up trying to follow all the nonsense with the bicycles and such, but you didn't really need to understand it to finish the book.<br />In summary: Not my favorite Wimsey (it pains me to give any of them three stars), nice Scottish accents, funny artist characters, and *way* too many train schedules.	2004-04-11

Bosch is back and this time he's an official outsider instead of just the department lone wolf.

Some of the schtick feels a little too much like schtick. It (like Harry) feels like it's getting a little bit old and tired.<br />The ending of this book implies a change in the weather for Harry, and I hope that Connelly follows through. Bosch has done his time and deserves to have a little bit of comfort in the world.<br />If you haven't read Harry Bosch before, start with _Black Echo_ or _Black Ice_, but if you're already a fan this should deliver the fix that you need.	2004-04-11

This book looks dauntingly thick when you pick it up, but some brief exploration will show that including the interviews only 311 pages are the Jack Welch story-- the rest of the book is Afterword, GE Timeline, GE Shareholder Reports, Bibliography and finally a section meant to be applied to your own business. I suppose that there are readers out there who wanted that level of completeness in their history of GE. I did not. I stopped reading after the afterword.<br /><br />The book covers GE during the period of Jack Welch's reign. Specifically, it charts his efforts in five major initiatives: Services, Six Sigma, Digitization, Succession, and the Honeywell acquisition.<br /><br />I found it interesting and readable, although I was left with the feeling (despite the author's best efforts) that these were very difficult achievements to duplicate if you did not happen to be Jack Welch. Although ostensibly a business biography, I still had much more of a feel of personality than facts when I was done. I would have been pleased to have a less broad-ranging treatment which delved a little bit more deeply into some specific numbers and consequences. Although this information might have been contained in the investor reports, I had no patience to page through it and find the information.	2004-04-03

I got a lot more out of the book this time. I think it profits both with re-reading and age. The first time I read it I identified so strongly with Maggie that I practically skipped over everything dealing with the other characters. I found Tom loathesome and the ending of the book appalling.<br /><br />As a slightly more adult human, I was able to read it for more than just Maggie's story and enjoy it even more. I was surprised by how compulsively I read it. I had every intention of stretching it out over several days, but I literally found that I could not stop reading it and carried it with me from room to room in the house. I laughed at Eliot's sly humor and this time around saw people like the Gleggs as people and not simply stock appendages of the story.<br /><br />I think what makes Mill On the Floss such a powerful book (aside from the writing style, which is excellent) is this notion of the divided self which is being worked out both through Tom and Maggie. Tom has a firm clear sense of right and wrong and is always being forced to question or do injury to that sense because of his very difficult sister. On the other hand, Maggie cannot seem to find the right balance between self-indulgence and renunciation. She never manages a way to negotiate between the sharp emotions that she feels and her desire not to inflict the consequences of those emotions on her family and friends. It is a tragedy that neither of them ever really manage to understand each other and are constantly hurting and being hurt in their drive to do the right thing and be who they really are.<br /><br />Interesting how Eliot plays with the tropes from all the popular weepy sentimental novels of the time. A young unattractive girl (unattractive because she has dark hair) overcomes poverty and goes on to attract the eye of the most fastidious and eligible man in town... However, in the world of St. Ogg's (unlike the novels of the sentimental sisters like Mary Jane Holmes) Maggie is unable to overcome her obstacles to happiness and is as trapped by her beauty and popularity as she was her unattractive hoyden girlhood. Given the position of women at the time and the strength of the social norms, it is unfortunately a much more believable view of the outcomes of things.<br /><br />If you have not read Eliot, I would agree that it is not her best book (still Middlemarch, for me, and I would begin there first) but it is hugely thought-provoking and honest. It should make many a young woman of today count their blessings and thank the stars that the world has changed since the time Maggie Tulliver was a girl.Interesting how Eliot plays with the tropes from all the popular weepy sentimental novels of the time.

In Murakami's _Sputnik Sweetheart_, people are in love as an exercise in connection (or the lack of it). Sumire (Violet) slouches into the novel as the unattainable object of desire for the narrator, but falls in love with Miu-- a woman 17 years her senior. Miu is endlessly loveable, but utterly unable to love, with her ability to connect lost to her years before in an incident that split her personality. Meanwhile the narrator desires the mother of one of his students, but keeps his heart set on Sumire, who is unable to see him as anything except a friend.<br /><br />All the characters are split into their desire to love and their lack of ability to love. Murakami plays with that split and makes it literal through a skilful rendering of the realistic and surreal, and even the resolution of the novel is divided-- what connection is there between people besides at least looking at the same moon?<br /><br />This is my second Murakami (_Norwegian Wood_ was the first) and it confirmed by view of him as an interesting writer whose work I will continue to read. I found that I liked NW better, in that I was less convinced with how the surrealism was applied here-- seemed like it was already too much one way to change into another by the time that it was introduced. I was less than convinced by the ending, and perhaps even a little disappointed. Still, better than much that is out there and well worth the time to read.

She positioned it as a counterweight to her book A Journal of a Solitude which was clearly, well, *not* about happiness.<br /><br />I can see why some people find it irritating to read, although I never do. She contradicts herself frequently-- complains of how she never gets time to herself and then runs around the Eastern seaboard like a bandersnatch. She can be prey to muddled thinking and faulty logic and sounds as though she'd be a real pain to be around much of the time.<br /><br />But still, it's inspirational to read as someone who wants to keep a journal. It's not a constantly ecstatic experience in the way that Annie Dillard can be or an idea journal in the vein of Walden, it's more like reading somebody fumbling through towards bigger ideas and willing to expose the joints and creaky bits in the process. There are moments of vision and transcendence, but also a lot of the petty crap that gets people down from day to day.<br /><br />I like reading Sarton because she is so human. I feel like I miss her even though I never knew her, and reading her is like getting to know her-- in all her fulness as a flawed and talented human being.<br /><br />I'd probably begin with A Journal of a Solitude, as I think it's the more complete work, but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this as a follow-up.	2004-03-24

Someone said elsewhere that this felt like an exercise for Wolfe, and I know what they mean-- using a Memento-like plot (a main character who loses his memory at the end of every day) Wolfe sketches the world of ancient Greece through the eyes of a soldier named Latro.<br /><br />The details are compelling-- I was uninterested in the real historical value (people should not be trying to derive history lessons from fantasy novels) but Wolfe does a good job, as usual, of creating a realistic and detailed world for Latro to inhabit.<br /><br />The plot is somewhat less compelling. It is nearly a necessity of the trope that he chose that the plot becomes confusing (particularly in times when Latro couldn't write his journal) and I'm sad to say that I often didn't feel any kind of guiding line that was coherent enough to motivate me through the confusion.<br /><br />Interesting for Wolfe completists or real fans of historical fiction, not a place to begin with his work otherwise.	2004-03-24

It is a disturbing realistic look that plays on the notion of what we reap when we create survivors. Someone said here that the book features a world where criminals are sent to the bottom of the sea to work-- but the criminality of the people is incidental. The conceit of the book is that all of these people are survivors of horrific abuse, and as such have developed the ability to live in environments that are less than nurturing. In the end, that ability to survive is exactly what works against the government that can no longer control its project.<br /><br />What works best about the book?<br />The diction is crisp and the writing style is clean and biting. The characters and politics underwater are well-formed and believable. It avoids unnecessary drama while still keeping the reader's interest.<br /><br />Why not five stars, then?<br />The plotting (particularly around Behemoth) feels a little bit like a first novel. I was much less interested in the Great Threat To Humanity than I was in the lesser issues. I would also argue that it is hard to keep unrelenting bleakness from feeling a bit flat at times-- a little bit of sweetness by way of contrast now and again would have gone a long way.<br /><br />Despite any reservations, I will definitely read the next book in the series & will look forward to doing so.	2004-03-24

Wells is one of the freshest and most talented fantasy writers working today, and I enjoyed _Wheel of the Infinite_ immensely. The City is loosely based on Angor Wat and the reader will catch whispers of Asian and Southeast Asian mythology throughout the book.<br /><br />Maskelle is a refreshing character in the fantasy genre-- an assertive older woman who has come into power and knows her own mind. The other characters are equally well-fleshed out with many deft and light touches that keep the tone from getting too dark.<br /><br />I was not completely willing to buy the ending-- a little bit too much Deus ex Machina, and that weakened the book for me. But still, it was a very good read and a commendable stand-alone fantasy novel.	2004-03-24

I wanted to write that it was my *first* Simak novel, but on reflection I do not think that is true. I believe that _Project Pope_ was my first. However, this has been unarguably my favorite over the years, and that is saying a lot from one of my favorite authors.<br /><br />Simak writes gentle and philosophical books, which are perhaps a little bit dated by today's lights. If someone today were writing about an intergalactic union, they'd probably delve into the politics more deeply and bring complex shadings to bear on the characters and explain much more about how things got to be the way that they are in the book.<br /><br />Simak does none of that-- I find it a virtue of his that while he acknowledges that shadings exist (particularly when it comes to evil, which he portrays as misguided bumbling) he at the same time asserts that the simplest thing in the world is good. The themes of simplicity, harmony, and goodness run strongly through all of his work.<br /><br />Enoch Wallace, the keeper of the Way Station, is a plain man. The politics of his situation are largely beyond him. He tries to grasp all the intricacies of alien culture, but is stopped by the gaps in his own learning. He wonders at all the strangeness in the world and makes basic mistakes. Like most Simak characters, he is a marvel of basic humanity, a tribute to the strength of the everyman. His simplicity in the end allows him to do what nobody else is capable of achieving.<br /><br />This was one of the books which showed me that science fiction can be more than the genre stereotypes. I can still remember the vivid mental images I had when I first read his descriptions of the alien gadgets and worlds. I am delighted to report that on re-reading it holds up very well indeed.	2004-03-23

I was unsure what to expect before I picked up the book. In any case, I didn't expect it to be what it was-- so contemplative and so concerned with notions of isolation and the ability to act.<br /><br />Despite the abstract themes, the book is neither slow nor unreadable. An adventure story wraps the whole thing up:<br /><br />A recluse on a deserted island breaks his solitude and rescues a girl from a life with a semi-shady gang. This act of kindness starts a chain of events that brings violence and change to his small world.<br /><br />The story moves along nicely, and you can read for the plot even if you are uninterested in the bigger issues the book raises. I found that I was interested in them. Heyst (the main character) has been infected by his father's skepticism and analytical viewpoint and never manages to find a way after that to engage with the world or other people in it. His few attempts at engagement are awkward and almost unwilling.<br /><br />Everybody in the book is to some degree isolated. Wang removes himself from Chinese society to go native. Mrs. Schomberg is locked behind her mask of fear. Mr. Jones and Ricardo are set apart because of the obsessive fear the Gentleman has of women. Alma/Magdalena/Lena is set apart by her past. Everybody is trying to connect, but (with the exception of Lena) always on their own terms and always within limits.<br /><br />It's tempting to read Conrad's own background and separations into the mix, but I'll leave that to the Conrad scholars.<br /><br />Worth reading.	2004-03-23

Like Freeling or Simenon, the Sjowall/Wahloo novels are excellent more for the excuse the mystery provides for an examination of everyday life, than they are for the excitement or horror of the crime itself.  In the case of Martin Beck, he explores the frustrations and pleasures of Swedish life while solving his mysteries.<br /><br />This is not my favorite in the series (so far, that would be _The Man Who Went Up in Smoke_), but it's not a bad place to begin. It is hurt a bit by being a little dated by some of the concerns about Roseanna herself-- she is a great view of how many saw the hippies at the time. However, the book itself is not dated and this is not an issue that should dissuade someone from reading it.	2004-03-23

An enjoyable book-- well-written and apparently well-researched, if occasionally a little snarky in tone.<br /><br />Robb has a rare talent (Mitford-esque, if I dare say so) for injecting his point of view in a way that is visible but not overly intrusive. I was glad to have him as a narrative presence throughout the book.<br /><br />I haven't thought about Rimbaud in years. I read _A Season in Hell_ as a high school student, as you do, but wasn't converted. I never really made a serious effort to engage his poetry or his life. I was motivated to pick this book up after reading a review, and was not disappointed. If you would like to read beyond the tortured artist and into the life of a fascinating and important literary figure, then this is the book for you.<br /><br />What interested me in reading the biography is how much Rimbaud myth I had unintentionally absorbed over the years. Robb tells the reader a lot about the Rimbaud myth, and I think that many readers are going to find that much of what they thought they knew was not true. He spends a lot of time on the and unwraps the layers for the reader. In that sense, the book also becomes a look at how narrative fictions develop about literary figures. In any case, the facts about Rimbaud are happily much more interesting than the fiction.<br /><br />The book has inspired me to go back to A Season in Hell and maybe pick up the collected letters. Rimbaud becomes a great deal more interesting if you look at his entire career and not just the period before he turned 19.<br /><br />Generally: A good read & worth the time.	2004-03-19

I lost that a little bit in the latter parts of the book.<br /><br />Although this is a story of a holy pilgrimage, eo not expect a either a traditional travel book or any kind of treatise on religious enlightenment. Using an Auctor/Lector conversation, Belloc's constant witty asides about the purpose of the book solidly ground the reading in the mundane. The thing is, that it is a beautiful vision of the mundane--worldly in the best sense of the word.<br /><br />Reading The Path to Rome made me jealous of the journey.	2004-03-05

Retired upwards to the quiet town of Lisse, Van Der Valk is almost delighted when he can abandon cases of petty thievery for the mysterious death of a local restaurateur. It seems as though the unliked man was killed by a spooked horse, but when a local doctor sounds a note of unease Van Der Valk becomes convinced that there is something more behind the death.<br /><br />Freeling's Van Der Valk novels are marvelous not only for their mysteries (always interesting) but also for their examination of the small details of Dutch life. Particularly striking in this book are the bicycle champion and his wife Janine. The poor unaccepted Janine speaks French rather than letting the toffs of the village hear her peasant Brabants accent. She and her husband are guilty of making money at something visible, rather than quietly accumulating it behind solid middle class doors.<br /><br />Van Der Valk is not a typical detective, and one of the things that makes the Freeling mysteries so nice is the healthy twist of cynicism that run through all his novels. Van Der Valk hates to see crime (and criminals) reduced to the mechanisms of the middle class, but in the end he acquiesces, order must be restored and sometimes the best answer is not the truth, but the one which satisfies everyone the most...<br /><br />Strike Out Where Not Applicable is not a bad place to begin with Freeling, but if you like this one be sure to read _The King of the Rainy Country_ and _Gun Before Butter_.	2004-02-28

I'd like to start off this review talking about the things that are really nice about this book-- mainly because there's a lot of them, and I actually think that nothing negative that I say should detract the potential reader.<br />_Middlesex_ is a multigenerational history of a Greek-American family which begins with a silkworm farm in Asia Minor and ends somewhere in Berlin. Along the way it takes you through the burning of Smyrna, the 1967 Detroit race riots, the depression and the rise of the Nation of Islam. It treats subjects as wide ranging as hermaphrodism, family secrets, the nature of marriage and the occasion to trust.<br />What's amazing is that Eugenides writes all this with an eye for detail that's really astonishing. You could read this book for its richness of detail and the fine nuances alone and come out a happy and satisfied reader. He pulls off the family story through all its generational turns and creates characters who are very human and very real.<br />I suppose that simply because I enjoyed it so much I wondered to myself if this was a book that was going to stick with me, or one that would molder on my shelf unread in 20 years.<br />While I'm probably not going to argue for unread, I also didn't find it a masterpiece. The character arc of the adult Cal felt contrived and unsatisfying-- I couldn't anchor his fear of intimacy in the history that the book reveals and I didn't believe (or didn't care) about its ultimate conclusion. Even given that the history was clearly the focal point, I still wanted to care about the present. At the very least, I didn't want to find the moments in the present aggravating-- which is unfortunately how I did find them.<br />So. A near miss. I will however, go back and read _The Virgin Suicides_ and whatever else he may write in the future. A near miss is after all better than not even being in the running...<br />Like I said, don't let this review dissuade you from reading. The book is the Book of the Hour for good reason, so you'll waste no time deciding for yourself.good reason, so you'll waste no time deciding for yourself.	2004-02-28

This book is bound to appeal to readers like myself who are interested in novels of manners, but should also be an interesting read for the more general reader The Forsyte clan will be recognizable to virtually everybody as members of the splendid and self-satisfied middle class and in a sense the story is about what happens when other people notable for something besides their position (beauty or talent) come into contact with them.<br /><br />One of the things that I like about Galsworthy is that while he spares nothing in his treatment of the Forsytes, he is also not unfair or unkind. The good aspects of the Forsytes (June and Jolyon) are treated as well as the bad and in the end I even felt as sorry for Soames (almost) as much as I did for Irene or Bosinney.<br /><br />The Man of Property is bound together with a short interlude called \\"Indian Summer of a Forsyte\\" which takes you through generational change and into (presumably) the next novel.<br /><br />I look forward to reading the entire saga.	2004-02-27

The preoccupations of the time are visible in the book-- changing social mores, counseling for failing marriages, disillusioned young artists, and experimental psychological treament. The Steen clinic makes an excellent backdrop to both explore these issues and to set the scene for murder.<br /><br />When the correct and absolute Enid Bolam is found stabbed in the basement of the Steen outpatient clinic, Dalgliesh needs to find who killed her-- was it someone looking to the future or to the past?<br /><br />_A Mind To Murder_ is not as smooth or as perfect as some of James' later work, but is still an excellent mystery and well worth the time to read.	2004-02-25

The Book of the Courtier is one of those books that you hear frequently cited, but rarely actually read. It seems a shame to me if it remains unread. I expected it to take me a while to wade through it. I expected it to be dense and difficult to penetrate. Instead, it read very quickly and easy. The prose was modern, lucid, and nearly compulsively readable.<br /><br />The book is structured as a conversational game carried out the court of the Duke of Urbino in the rooms of his wife Elisabetta Gonzaga. In four books, different members of the court sketch out the ideal Courtier and the ideal Lady. The books treat various subjects, including the nature of grace, love, humor, gender equality, and necessary skills. The unfamiliar details of the time are mixed with the quite familiar and recognizable human foibles that are still relevant today.<br /><br />Castiglione is perceptive and witty and quite loving in the way he draws the people in the book. Both the \\"real\\" people having the conversation, and the imaginary ideal people being described are well developed.<br /><br />I enjoyed it, and I recommend it. You don't need to be a scholar to enjoy it as well.	2004-02-25

He had fallen in love with someone else in that room, and is not sure that her charms will live up to the comparison.<br /><br />He says: \\"I had a dream here once, a year and a half ago.

Many people today can and do quarrel with these notions. It also is not always clear in his notes which bits are really well accepted by other scholars and which bits are his own interpretations.<br /><br />However, The Greek Myths is remarkable for its comprehensive scope and clearly useful as a source guide.

This is the second Castaneda book that I have picked up. I honestly probably would not have picked up a second except that I have been doing some research on dreaming and it was recommended to me.<br /><br />He certainly has created an interesting world and world-view around dreaming. I give him a lot of credit for that. I have no basis at all to base the truth of what he is writing, and I guess that truth is not really the point as much as that he is trying to make you think or relate his own experiences.<br /><br />I did not find it useful as a research source, and I unfortunately did not find it particularly well-written either.

I've long been a huge fan of the Oz books and (to a lesser degree) of the film. I have to admit that despite all the enthusiastic reviews, I was a little bit dubious about reading Wicked. There have been other attempts to retell the Oz books in the past, and none of them have been terribly successful.<br />I have to say that I liked Wicked far more than I had ever expected. I found it rich and full smart, sharp moments. I liked the way that the Baum details shone through and were reworked into this new, more realistic world. It managed to be satirical without hitting the reader over the head and moving without being cheap, at least most of the time.<br />My only real quarrel was that I felt like it started to drag after Nessarose and Elpheba are reunited. I never really bought Elpheba's character changes towards the end, although I understood (I think) why they were necessary. This said, these were pretty minor flaws and should not dissuade the prospective reader.	2004-01-18

When I picked up this book to begin reading it, I was quite frankly nervous. I'd heard it recommended in so many places that I wanted to read it, but I am not an economist and so was not sure that I was going to be able to follow the arguments that it laid out.<br /><br />While I'm certainly not going to claim that I understood everything, I think that I did manage to follow the majority of Olson's points. Furthermore, I believe that this owes more to the lucid and well-structured nature of the book than it does to me being blessed with any unusual intelligence.<br /><br />_The Rise and Decline of Nations_ begins with an explanation of the questions that the book will explore and sets the standards for the consideration of a satisfactory answer. It then works out the logic of the offered argument and breaks that argument down into 9 well-described implications. It then goes on to test and explain that logic and those implications. Olson does a wonderful job of providing adequate support the concepts that he introduces, even to the point of pointing out areas where non-economists might have special trouble or require further information. As a result of all his hard work, the book has the feeling of being exactly as long as it needs to be, and no longer.<br /><br />I was certainly convinced by his arguments about how special interest groups affect economic growth. I understood why he was unwilling to take it farther into the area of policy, but couldn't help but wonder what the eventual policy implications would be, assuming that his theory is further tested and developed.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed reading it, and recommend it wholeheartedly.	2004-01-18

On this thought, I turned out to have been very wrong.<br /><br />I am usually the first person to argue that a book cannot be redeemed in its ending. I dislike it very much when an author pulls some kind of spectacular deus ex machina out at the conclusion and expects the reader to extend that resolution backwards. The funny thing is that this is what Huddle does, and for a change I found that it really worked.<br /><br />The book begins as a beautifully written little story about a dry and isolated art history professor in a failing marriage who daydreams a story about George La Tour (a 17th century writer) instead of interacting with her painful life. The narrative weaves between her perspective, the perspective of her husband, and the perspective of a La Tour in his last years.<br /><br />It is really kind of wonderful how without me noticing it, Huddle brings all the threads together to be about something much bigger and more important than self-involvement. The book ends up being about loss and acceptance and the way we understand other people and the way it treats the subject is even stronger because of the understated way it plays its hand.<br /><br />La Tour is not perfect. I could not really accept the 17th century narrative, even given the context of it being Suzanne's fantasy. Suzanne is also difficult to like, at least for much of the book. A friend of mine who read it found it very difficult to get past the nature of her character to enjoy the book.<br /><br />Still, a good way to start off the New Year's reading. Recommended for fans of strong literary criticism. Bonus for armchair art critics.	2004-01-15

I bought this book because I was looking for background information about the religious condition of Malaysian Hindus in the context of Malaysia today. This book, while interesting reading, does not provide that information.<br /><br />Actually, I found that to be a strange lack-- I would think that looking at how Malaysian Hinduism had developed would be hard to completely disconnect from the nature of Malaysian religious life in the larger context, but Fuller doesn't really mention that element at all.<br /><br />I also, I have to say, found the book to be disjointed reading. I wasn't sure where she was going or what her central points really were. But this may well be because I brought the wrong questions to the table-- I wasn't looking for High Anthropology and High Anthropology is absolutely what this book is all about. And I think that it is fair to say that for all that the book felt disjointed, it also felt interesting. I liked the way she thought through the issues of possession, her descriptions of the festival, and her efforts to place the experience in the larger Tamil religious experience.<br /><br />I did find some useful pointers to reading that will probably answer the questions that I brought to it. The book comes with a very impressive set of notes and bibliography.	2004-01-12

I've been increasingly disenchanted with the Alex Delaware novels. The plots felt like they were really reaching to keep up the interest of the writer and reader and mostly they felt as though we were walking over the same old tired ground.<br />_A Cold Heart_ won't take any prizes for being the best Delaware novel, or even one of the best, but I was heartened to see Delaware try another direction for the character and a new emotional thread with which to tie everything together. I found myself genuinely interested in his struggle to let go of Robin, and I liked the way Kellerman portrays people trying to discover new love while burdened with so much baggage.<br />Unfortunately, the plot is not up to the new direction. The killings are far-fetched and the villain was very easy to guess. Also, the way Delaware's love life is written into the plot is very hard to believe and ultimately unnecessary.<br />Kellerman should choose an absolutely pedestrian murder for the next novel-- go back to basics and not try to connect it to anything spectacular. Then perhaps he can really refind his groove and do what he used to do so well.<br />Book in and of itself is really three stars or less, but I gave it four since it shows the first signs of life in a long time.	2004-01-03

I had wanted to read something else of his and decided to read MoHC largely because of its infamous reputation.<br /><br />(For those who don't know, MoHC was the subject of one of the pivotal battles over obscenity in literature. Although tame by today's standards, it was too frank about sexuality to get past the censors of the time. The Supreme Court upheld Doubleday's conviction for publishing the book.)<br /><br />I really really liked Memoirs. It should be viewed as more of a collection of six loosely linked short stories than truly as a novel. (\\"The Man Who Shot Snapping Turtles\\", \\"Ellen Terhune\\", \\"Glimpses of Wilbur Flick\\", \\"The Princess with the Golden Hair\\", \\"The Milhollands and Their Damned Soul\\", and \\"Mr. and Mrs. Blackburn at Home\\"). The narrator, a kind of educated everyman, uses his participation in the stories to paint portraits of the other characters he encounters.<br /><br />True to the name of the book, a kind of magic realism swirls through the stories. Ellen Terhune may or may not be a ghost, and publishers may make a pact with the devil. But this is not an uplifting or gentle magic realism. The magic in this book is more of a feeling that people can step off the edge of the map more easily than they realize.<br /><br />The book reminds me, in a way, of Fitzgerald. Some of the concerns and situations are largely the same. What strikes me the most, however, are how acerbic Wilson makes some of these portraits. I found myself actually wincing at times at how accurately he targeted common human weaknesses and behaviours. There is something rigorous and unforgiving about the narrator's look at life. It is very well-written. I particularly liked the view on relationships exposed in \\"The Princess With Golden Hair\\".<br /><br />As noted, the digression into pages and pages written in French (although it only happens once) is really annoying. For me particularly it was frustrating because my French simply is not up to more than just getting the basic ideas. Still, it is worth putting up with the annoyance to read the book.particularly it was frustrating because my French simply is not up to more than just getting the basic ideas.

I really enjoy the way that Van De Wetering handles the police procedural from the Dutch POV. Like Freeling and Simenon, his characters tend to live more in the lives of the commonplace than exploring sensational serial murders.<br />In this novel, a virtual hermit is killed by a single shot-- very un-Dutch in a country where firearms are so controlled. It takes you through the underbelly of Amsterdam into houses of prostitution, the world of grey market electronics, and into the house of a flamboyant possible villain named Cat.<br />Not my favorite Grijpstra and de Gier (that honor still goes to _Death of a Hawker_) but still a great example of the series.	2004-01-03

Think Le Guin meets Goblin Market meets Tolkein and you get a little bit of the effect of Cloud's End.<br /><br />In the world of the book, the Mist hangs at the edge of all things and calls to people who live in the more solid world. The spirits of things can take human form, and while occasionally helpful are always dangerous. There are oracles and seeings and journeys and predictions and heroes who fight with living fire. One of the best things about this book is its emotional complexity. The characters may have the feel of myth, but they do not think like myths. I appreciated the psychological realism quite a bit. Real toads in imaginary gardens, and all that.<br /><br />So why not five stars? This is the second Stewart novel that I have read, and while I enjoyed both of them I have also felt like they were missing something. In fact, despite liking it so much while reading it I find myself wondering if I even want to keep the book. The lightness of it is one of its main virtues, but it also keeps it from having real emotional weight. I also was not crazy about the ending, but that is more of a taste issue.<br /><br />Do not let my minor quibbles dissuade you from reading the book-- it is still better than most of the fantasy out there. I will certainly keep reading Stewart and looking for his perfect book.	2004-01-03

I haven't read any of Barthelme's novels, but have read some of his essays in the past. After reading this collection of stories, I keep thinking about a line of his (which I'm sure I'm misremembering)-- something about the best part of writing fiction being the collaboration with the reader.  That's a line that can seem like a throwaway until you read Barthelme's stories. These are stories that are only robust when I as reader give them my own history to put into context and revisit.<br />Unfortunately, the collection was uneven to my eye. There are books of short stories which when grouped together still read like a book. This one doesn't-- it reads like an anthology. Several of the stories are so close in mood and characters that they read like versions of each other and several characters literally reappear in what clearly aren't linked stories-- a distraction when you encounter them a second time.<br />Barthelme is often described as an unapologetic minimalist, and it was great to read his beautifully chiselled and stripped-down prose.<br />You see the risk of this minimalism in some of the stories that don't quite work. All we have of the characters are their surfaces and sometimes it seems like the story leaves them at 'quirky', without giving it any depth. But when the stories work well (for instance, in the amazing story &quot;Driver&quot;) then they work very powerfully indeed.	2003-12-21

Ungrateful Daughters treats the last days of the house of Stuart as seen through the perspectives of the major characters: James II, Mary of Modena, Mary II, William of Orange, and Queen Anne. It begins essentially with the restoration and ends with the handover of power to the Hanovers.<br /><br />The material is absorbing and the book was seemingly quite well-researched. However, for me, much of the pleasure was spoiled by Waller's organisation and tone. The narrative is not linear, but shifts with the perspectives of the different players. I found the effect jarring and occasionally confusing. I also heard more than I wanted of Waller's opinions about the people involved (particularly Queen Anne).<br /><br />I am often willing to forgive a history writer some harsh asides, but I was not willing to forgive Waller. I found her judgements heavy-handed and they made me suspicious of how (and from what perspective) she was telling the story. Too bad-- because it is a really great story.<br /><br />This should not discourage others from reading the book-- it is still a reasonable use of time for the story itself. I am planning to keep it in my collection-- at least until a better author writes a new approach to the material.	2003-12-13

I think that this is my first Samantha Adams mystery, and I should say right off the bat that it is not a bad read. If you like a quick-read mystery with snappy dialogue and a few laughs thrown in, then this is a good book for you.<br /><br />Personally, while I enjoyed it, I found it at least a little bit too slick and too glib. I felt like the con man element could have been developed out a little bit more (I liked it-- I felt frustrated when it didn't pan out). And unfortunatly the ending felt a little bit too easy.<br /><br />I will probably read others in the series if I see them available as used books.

As much as I found it very strong, I also felt like it leaned too much on some particularly shocking and sensational elements of the crimes to provide its bite.<br /><br />Unfortunately, instead of making me feel better about Slaughter, Kisscut seems to me a step in the wrong direction.<br /><br />Be aware before you read this book-- it deals in an explicit way with incest, child pornography, genital mutilation, and violence towards children. It is not for the faint of heart, nor for young readers.<br /><br />I found the plot points stretched rather thin here, and again I felt like the book strayed rather too close to exploitation of its subjects rather than exploration.<br /><br />This said, Slaughter is a really strong writer. The characters are very well written, the details of their emotional responses are well-conceived and usually felt to me right on. Lena may be a bit tiresome as a character, but she also makes real sense, particularly coming off the events in Blindsighted.<br /><br />I would like to see what happens if Slaughter takes her obvious talents and applies them to less sensationalist material.	2003-12-07

But I will argue that it is worth reading-- perhaps would go so far as to say that it should be read, despite the unpleasant subject matter.<br /><br />And I suppose that it is worth warning that the subject matter *is* unpleasant. It has fairly explicit descriptions of violence, incest, and poverty. People who are very reactive to these issues, probably want to find a different book.<br /><br />So often when a writer tackles issues like these, they lose all objective perspective. Somehow Sharma takes some of the most loaded topics imaginable and still places them in a landscape of moral ambiguity. While Mr. Karan (the father)commits acts that seem to put him beyond the pale, it is hard not to feel yourself sliding into sympathy for him. And while you want to like Anita because of what happens to her, it is awfully hard to do. Meanwhile, the landscape of Indian politics around them (which is a bit hard on the reader, since it assumes that you know something about it) also seems to imply a decided lack of ethical clarity.<br /><br />I think that it is a very strong book, extremely well written. Recommended for people who like books that are thought provoking, if not necessarily uplifting.	2003-12-05

From the Kafka parrot, to the narrator's stint as a television producer, to the storyteller's stories themselves, this is a book which struggles with identity and with the real. The character of Saul is notable for his lack of place and his struggle as both a monster and an angel to exist in the world of Peru.<br />The translation felt smooth, although it was rough enough in places that I was sorry for my inability to read Spanish.

The build-up was nice. I liked the characters. I thought racing and a stud farm was going to be good material for Grimes. But the trouble was, after 90 pages the plot completely fell apart. I've actually gone back and re-read sections and I still don't get everything that happened with Maurice's father. I certainly found the stuff around Nell and the farm stretched until you could hear the fabric of the book screaming. And I'm angry about the fact that I knew what was going to happen at the end of the book. The world doesn't really need any more too-good-to-live characters, does it?<br />I'm honestly surprised that her publishers let her go to market with the book in this state. From any other author, it would get less than one star. For Grimes, and because I still enjoyed elements of it, I gave it one star extra.	2003-11-30

For all that they were working from different cultures and probably entirely different world views, I think that Akiko shared with them that kind of glittering precision that makes her work very pure to read-- particularly the Tanka.<br />I was a little bit less impressed with the selection of &quot;Modern Poetry&quot; that came after the Tanka. I'm not sure whether it would have been true of all her non-traditional form poetry, but the poems chosen for this section were not nearly as strong as some of the others, and honestly seemed as though they'd been chosen to illustrate her political thinking rather than the body of her aesthetic work.<br />Also, compliments to Shambhala Publications for the lucid translation and for the non-irritating introduction.

For me this created the sense that while I instinctively agreed with him I wasn't sure if I had all the information or if I fully understood what he was saying.<br />The idea that sequencing is at least as important in ideology in leading change has a clear resonance for me (coming from my own experience in corporate organizational change). And certainly, I found his arguments about how the IMF role has mutated from its original intentions believable and compelling. Still, the IMF had so many aspersions cast against it in this book that I felt compelled to go online afterwards to try to find their response to Stiglitz's criticisms. I don't know if it's interesting or not that I didn't find any such response.<br />It gets four stars rather than five because I would have preferred more supportive material to help me understand his arguments. It also has the unfortunate tendency to repeat itself (seemingly) unnecessarily-- I suppose a result of what is clearly the writer's deep passion about the subject.	2003-11-29

One of the things that I liked so much about this book is that you always see the affection and admiration, and it's so clear that it would be easy not to see that.<br />In the histories that I have read to date that touch Versailles, many of the actual details of the period have been elided. It has come to be such shorthand for artificial elegance and extravagence that hardly any writers bother to explain what it was really about. The manners, the customs, the position of the nobility in France-- all these things were much clearer to me after reading Mitford's sparkling account than they were from any of the other history that I have read. For all that she chooses a seemingly frivolous main subject, Mitford never fails to point out how her subject applied or related to the key political questions of the time and the contrast is both entertaining and smart.<br />Recommended for almost all kinds of readers-- I think this would be excellent if one would just like some relaxing entertainment and from my point of view it also helped give me a more real look at the historical period in France.	2003-11-29

I really enjoyed reading Crime School, but this is the last Mallory novel I think I'm going to be able to read without her showing some signs of personal growth. I understand O'Connell's desire not to compromise this winning character. However, there is only so far you can go with the sociopath riff without showing movement or changing the focus character.<br /><br />The last few books have displayed more and more of Mallory, exploring her limited nature in various ways. At best, the character is by turns magical and frightening. The things that made her that way are gradually being exposed. I don't want her to turn into a character from a cozy, but some change would be good. I either want her to go darker or I want her to start to come to terms with herself.<br /><br />O'Connell has a significant challenge now. Until this point, it has been enough for the reader to be the real detectives, exploring the story of Mallory.  We have seen enough of that. Where to go now?	2003-11-24

While he clearly has talent as a writer, I often find the execution in his books sloppy, with plots that lose steam halfway through. I didn't realize when I bought Whispers that it was an early effort, but I will say that there's a freshness and consistency to it that I find missing in his later books.<br />This said, I didn't find Whispers to be particularly frightening. I guessed the conclusion long before I had gotten to it and I never really had the sense that anything bad could happen to its protagonists. It may be that its plot has been stolen over time by lesser writers, but I never felt like there was very much at stake.<br />Koontz does do a good job with his characters in this novel, rounding them out with a decent level of motivation and backstory. Unfortunately the dialogue itself can't keep pace, and still lends itself too easily to exposition about that motivation.<br />This isn't enough of a book to convert a non-Koontz fan into a Koontz-fan, but if you already like his stuff, you may well find it appealing.	2003-11-24

I hope that I will be forgiven for saying that as much as I enjoyed this volume of Bishop's prose, I still don't find it as robust as her poetry.  While lovely, some of these entries were so slight I was afraid to breathe and break them.<br /><br />The book is divided into two halves-- a series of memories and a series of stories. I liked the memories section the best: particularly \\"The Country Mouse\\" and her memoir of Marianne Moore. Of the stories, I liked \\"Gwendolyn\\" the best-- a story about a dying little girl (which is not nearly as saccharine as it sounds from that description.)<br /><br />I enjoyed this book, I *think* I enjoyed it in its own right. But if I'm honest, I'm not sure how I would have felt about it had I not already loved Bishop's poems so much.	2003-11-24

Gerritson is a talented writer, but you wouldn't necessarily know it from this book.

It's probably not as good as the Magician series, but then that would be hard to beat. However, I like Feist doing what he does best-- coming of age stories featuring talented young men in difficult situations. In the books that I've enjoyed the most in Midkemia, there's been a character like Talon.<br />It's a little bit thin, and I'll reserve final judgement until I've seen where the larger series goes (I didn't really like the plot turn at the end of the book), but it was surely satisfying to read on a cold autumn day.	2003-11-24

The way Willis takes on subjects as disparate as corporate policy, the politics of research, fads and trends, and (of course) sheep should be recognizable for many folks out there.<br />It's possibly a little bit slight, and I didn't think it was as complete as a book like _To Say Nothing of the Dog_, but it's still well worth the time to read. Particularly recommended for people who have read Willis before or people who have a career interest in research.	2003-11-17

I approached this book with both anticipation and trepidation. I've read a lot of the later Hardy novels, and while I love them, their view on the world can be very dark and almost hard to read.<br /><br />While I'm not sure that someone would call this work light-hearted, it is still has a less embittered world view. The characters have to endure pain in order to find happiness. Yet there is no sense that all possibility of happiness has been closed off, as there is in a book like Jude the Obscure.<br /><br />This was the first Wessex novel and the book that brought him fame and recognition.<br /><br />It is a great read and satisfying on the most basic plot level. This is where Hardy proves so much of his great talent-- you can read a book like Far From the Madding Crowd for the pure pleasure of the plot, but there is also much more underneath if you choose to look for it.<br /><br />I recommend reading the Bathsheba/King David story before (or at least just after) you read FFTMC. While there's no direct connection (besides character names) it created some interesting resonance on the idea of human mistakes and divine forgiveness.	2003-11-17

Kushiel's Chosen seemed to me a worthy follow-up to Kushiel's Dart. I wasn't disappointed in it (unlike many of the other reviewers) largely because I wasn't that impressed with the first book. I think the series is a reliably well-written historical fantasy-- no more and no less.<br />For people who haven't read the first-- this isn't a swords and sorcery fantasy, really. There's very little magic as such and what there is is fairly constrained to priestly magic. Many fantasy books set magic as the foregrounded element where here it can be best compared to the spice in the food.<br />Also worth noting is that the sex in Kushiel's Chosen is at least a little bit more explicit than in Kushiel's Dart. It's still not disruptive to the story, but this probably isn't for your pre-teen (or even teenage) reader. And (if you haven't figured it out from the back of the book already) Phedre isn't a vanilla kind of girl, so if power games in sex disturb you pick up another book.<br />So why isn't this five stars? Lots of bad things happen to Phedre, but in the end you never really believe (even for a moment) that she's going to fail. She's too beautiful, speaks too many languages, and is too good at political intrigue. I tend to prefer my heroines (even in escapist fiction) with more flaws to overcome.	2003-11-14

I haven't played Scrabble in years (&amp; then only as a hobbyist) but you don't have to play Scrabble to like this book. It's a terrific read for anyone who's ever been competitive and an interesting meditation on the roles that both discipline and talent play in becoming really great at something.<br />Fatsis starts off wanting to document people who are obsessive about Scrabble and ends up obsessive himself. An interesting and seemingly honest look at his own journey while at the same time a good portrait of the Scrabble-playing world.<br />Suitable for many people on your gift list, I should think.	2003-11-14

I have finally gotten around now to reading it, and am only sorry that I hadn't read it sooner.<br /><br />Mak is very good at choosing periods from the life of the city to highlight and also choosing the anecdotes that make them real. Whether his focus is on the portrait of Gerrit Janszoon Peggedochter, or the reaction of modern Amsterdammers to the marriage of (then Princess, now Queen) Beatrix, the stories are always fascinating. I liked how he made an effort to tie the Amsterdam of the past to its current incarnation.<br /><br />Mercifully, he doesn't overly focus on tulipmania-- that's been covered more than well enough elsewhere.<br /><br />I have not read the Dutch version, only the English, and I found the translation smooth and sufficient.	2003-11-08

I would advise you to try it yourself, particularly if you liked the first two books.<br />In this final book, FitzChivalry has to learn to master the Wit and the skill both in order to find his destiny and assist Verity with the salvation of the Six Duchies.	2003-11-07

This is a Lydia.	The first time I read a Rozan book, it was a Lydia Chin narrated book. I didn't like it at all. The second time, I read a Bill Smith narrated book and I couldn't believe that it was the same author. Now I've read another Lydia Chin and I'm kind of back to finding it only so-so.<br />The Hong Kong part of the book is interesting, and the plot isn't bad as such, but so much of the book depends on Chin's inner life and I just don't find it that interesting. Accordingly, I never really managed to engage the book or really care about what happened.<br />Back to Bill Smith for me.	2003-11-07

She deftly weaves together the experiences of the hero and the murdered in a way that makes a tapestry of shared experience.<br /><br />Crombie writes with solid skill and admirably crafted characters. If AJTIN has a flaw, it's in the predictability of the ending and the feeling that the plot is twisted to make a point. But this is really a minor flaw-- recommended for fans of British procedurals and of mystery novels in general.	2003-11-05

It's tough to keep the interest up for as many books as she has done and I think that she really deserves credit for doing as well as she has done.<br />If it sounds as though I'm darning this book with faint praise, then I guess that I am.<br />I like Kinsey Millhone, I like Grafton's writing, but this book made me (for all its strengths) a little bit tired. The Millhone can't collaborate vibe is getting a little old, as is the dancing around about her family. I appreciated the change of scenery and the story was mostly interesting, but it felt a little bit like treading water to me.<br />If you like the rest of the series, this one is worth reading. If you aren't familiar with Kinsey already, while this isn't the worst place to start it also isn't the best.	2003-11-05

After how much I loved the first few books, it's hard to believe I'd give this one three stars (and find that I'm actually being really generous).<br />If you've read any of the reviews, then you've probably figured out that nothing much happens in this book. In the last book, the male half of the One Power gets cleaned. In this book, it stays clean. And that's about it.<br />Well, it isn't *really* it, but it feels like it. Actually some kind of interesting things happen to Mat. His thread with Tuon was about the only thing that I cared about in CoT.<br />I think that the major problem with the book is that Jordan has become obsessed with the details of all his characters. The party as we knew it was split up and the book tries to provide us with updates on all of their whereabouts. This is admirable, and I'm inclined to give Jordan some credit because he seems to really be trying to live up to the political landscape that he created in the earlier books. It's understandable because that richness was one of the best things about the Wheel of Time.<br />However, as a reader, it's getting really hard for me to care about these people. There are *way* too many side characters featured and I'm getting sick of trying to remember every Aes Sedai from the last book to think how they fit in the bigger picture. I understand that he needs to do this since the main characters can't be everywhere, but as a reader it's confusing and annoying, in that order.<br />I'm probably going to see this ride through to the end. I've been on it since the beginning, after all. I hope that book 11 will manage to come out before I've completely forgotten book 10.	2003-10-28

This second book in the Farseer Trilogy has the same impressive strength of the first. The book is full of realistic characters, plausible politics, excitement and sympathy.<br />One minor quarrel-- nothing about these books has been predictable with the exception of the subplot revolving around the use of the Wit. Unfortunately, this one has been telegraphed from the beginning of the series and it was a little bit disappointing that so much of this book hinged on its use.<br />Still, one hackneyed element in two books is not bad at all-- certainly not by modern fantasy standards.	2003-10-19

I ordered this book specifically because there were so many glowing reviews and because it was so well-compared to so many books that I like (i.e., The Stand). Simmons is also a writer about whom I've heard good things.<br />I'm inclined to give Simmons the benefit of the doubt and try another one of his books, but if this were my only basis for judgement, I'd be extremely dubious.<br />First of all, I didn't care about the characters. And this despite Simmons using every emotional trick in the book to get me to care about them. We had a holocaust survivor, a determined young victim of racism who lost her father, a poor but honest local cop. It was almost ridiculous how many hackneyed tricks he pulled out the hat to try to get the readers to care about these people.<br />Second, the sense of timing in the book is very poor. Deaths occur at times that you can't care about them, there are long meandering plot sequences that are absolutely irrelevant. This might have been improved with some judicious cutting (this book certainly did not need to be 900 pages).<br />There *are* certainly some good elements in the book. I like how he played with your expectations about the villains. It's impressive that he managed to finish it at all given how sprawling the plot is.<br />Anyhow, like I said, I'll give Simmons another chance. But if I had to do it over again, I'd give this book a miss.	2003-10-19

This is a thin book with six stories. If these stories can be said to have a common thread, it is the people who fail to ever make a real connection. The characters in the stories are aimless, seized by momentary ideas which fill the need for purpose and troubled by other people.<br /><br />All of the stories were well written, but two for me really stood out. The first was \\"Leaving the Yellow House\\". This tells the story of a woman who has never succeeded at anything except that she managed to come to own this house. Faced with increasing infirmity, she can no longer care for herself but cannot bring herself to turn her back on her one success.<br /><br />The second stand-out was \\"The Gonzaga Manuscripts\\", a story about a feckless young man (Feiler) who tries to recover a set of lost poems from 1950s Spain. He wants to find purpose in poetry, but his researches keep bringing him back to politics.<br /><br />These stories are truthfully not among the best work of Bellow. However, you need to bear in mind that given how wonderful his writing generally is, they are still more than worth the time to read.	2003-10-18

Their stories are told through third parties, diaries, and photographs and say more about where they went than where they came from.<br />What's interesting about it? That it's called &quot;The Emigrants&quot; and not &quot;The Immigrants&quot;. What links these people together is where they came from, and how they experienced that act of leaving. Further interesting is that Sebald resists the temptation to spend too much time on what they fled-- he sketches the pain in their past by telling what they did and how they lived after they got to safety. It's oblique, and delicately done.<br />Of course, as literal-minded as I am I got hung up on whether the stories are True. Even the book avoids the issue by categorizing the book as fiction/history.<br />It's better to be in the right mood for this book. It's not very active, and it's easy for it to get lost in the whirl of a busy life. Recommended reading for a contemplative mood.	2003-10-18

Slogging a little bit, because it's difficult to read even interesting prose descriptions of paintings and also painfully aware that I lacked a lot of the technical understanding of what he was discussing-- my history of art knowledge has huge holes in it.  I turned frequently to the Internet to find the paintings Vasari was discussing and that helped a great deal.<br />I read the George Bull translation and it felt really clunky, although it's a plus that the footnotes are at the bottom of the pages rather than at the rear of the book. If I'm going to go on to read Volume 2 then I have to say that I'd choose another translator.<br />I knew in an intellectual way that a lot of the Renaissance was about reclaiming lost arts and sciences, but reading Vasari gave me a much better gut level feel about that really meant about the development of the arts. Connects real people to the history lesson, albeit in a gossipy and occasionally too-flowery way.	2003-10-12

Treason shows evidence of many of the concerns that Card would come to have in his later novels-- self-determination, actualization of innate ability, the morality of violent self-defense versus the morality of pacifism, and the destiny of brilliant youths.<br /><br />Set on a planet where the best radical minds of a generation were exiled without iron, Treason uses science fiction as a background for a thoughtful look at some serious issues.<br /><br />Treason is clearly an early novel, and has aspects that are too obviously allegorical. In later works, the same allegorical bent will be expanded and the context of the world around the story will become fuller.<br /><br />Recommended for Card fans. There is nothing to be disappointed in here, and should provide an interesting look at the roots of his later writing.

The stories are interesting and the writing is fluid and compelling. It gives a good slice of life from several perspectives.<br />It *might* be of interest to a historian as anecdotal material, but it's good to note that this is a small sample of interviews carried out by a writer who obviously had her own agenda with the subject matter.<br />I bought it second-hand and don't regret the time to read it.	2003-10-10

The Seattle underground was actually really cool-- I was interested in the victims, it wasn't too bloody and it was really pretty well written.<br />Unfortunately, it never came together well as a novel for me. Partly this was due to Daphne as a lead detective. It got irritating that every man she ran across became irrationally obsessed with her, and I just plain old wasn't interested in the progression of her relationship with John.<br />Too bad, but I'll probably pick up another Pearson to see if it gets better.	2003-10-10

I had decided to read TTFS because so many other books that I have read cited it as a good book to read. I have to admit with some shame that I had very little sense what it was about when I picked it up and began. Wilson starts in on Michelet and the history of the historians of the French revolution, and without really being clear what he's doing he drags the reader into the mindset of revolution and reaction that was current at Michelet's time.  The great thing is that I didn't need to know what the book was about, I was hooked and willing to follow it wherever it was going to lead after just reading one chapter.<br />He explains just what he found so great about Michelet as a historian and then happily goes on to write his own history in the same style.  As a reading experience, TTFS is by turns sly, informative, moving and funny.  Wilson incorporates anecdotes from the lives of his history's characters, but I never had the feeling that he was distracting me with funny stories. I felt like I learned an enormous amount from reading the book, but I never felt lectured to. Best of all was the feeling of Wilson himself leaning over your shoulder commenting on the history-- I liked the tone of the man (critic) that came through as commentary on the people he was discussing. He was definitely present, though not intrusive.<br />The only thing I missed was footnotes-- the version that I was reading was old (1960) and there wasn't anything in the way of footnotes or bibliography provided. I hope that the newer versions are annotated, because it cost me some time tracking down books which Wilson was referring to.<br />A must-read.	2003-10-01

Rendell does a masterful job of spinning together the twin threads of crime and family in this novel.

It has compelling characters. It is realistic enough to make you believe the world setting while still being imaginitive enough to provide effective escapism.

I read it because so many of the books I was reading referred to it. Despite the negative reviews, I have to say that I found it neither dusty nor boring.

Just an interested business bystander.<br /><br />If you get confused as to which financial crisis Kindleberger refers, use the appendix at the back. One flaw that the book really does have is to assume that you know all about the various events upon which it draws for its evidence. Perhaps for future editions it would be smart of the publisher to include a brief introductory chapter on the subject. While real economists would have no need for that introduction, the other readers of the book (and it does seem to be marketed at a wider audience) would benefit.<br /><br />Lots of great references to further reading included as well.	2003-09-02

I instantly liked the first book of her other series, and I did not have the same experience with this one. I was not surprised to read that this was her first book, because it had the feeling of having the same issues as the Seyonne novels being worked through-- long imprisonment, the effect of torture on the psyche, hidden talents. While interesting in places, it felt unformed in others.<br /><br />This said, Berg is still a formidable writer who managed to hold my interest throughout the book.

I have been a fan of the film for a very long time. To be honest, I was not really ure what I expected from the book. It is a very thin book, and the film is rather breezy, so I think the adjective that best describes what I expected is \\"slight\\".<br /><br />In the end, I think the word that I would choose to most describe the book would be \\"sad\\". The film has elements of sad in it, but generally feels good to watch. The book almost hurts to read-- particularly in the ways where the ending is different. I had not really expected this kind of brilliance from Capote, to be honest. I have never been a huge fan of In Cold Blood, the only other book of his that I have read.<br /><br />While the three other stories collected with BAT are also very well-written, special notice should go to \\"A Christmas Memory\\".

Definitely more readable than the rest of the horror scribes.<br />What's my beef with the book? Too slight-- the story should either be more dislocated (a la Tim Powers) or more epic (a la King).

I really have always enjoyed the Recluce novels, but got bogged down by the social theory in Spellsong. I am therefore relieved to announce that this seems a return to the slightly more plot-enabled land of Recluce. I liked the idea of the herders and their families and I am genuinely interested in the post-apocolyptic hints buried between the lines. It makes a reader much more inclined to buy the next book when there is some genuine curiosity about where the plot is taking you.<br /><br />There will not be many surprises for the die-hard Modesitt fan. For all the improvements over Spellsong, there are never that many differences in the Modesitt canon. Power is still balanced or imbalanced. The military history depicted is still believable. The details are still lovingly rendered.<br /><br />But, I guess if you have made it through the entire series of  Modesitt books, then you are not reading for the variety anyways, are you?<br /><br />If you have not read Modesitt before, this is not a bad place to begin. If you like your fantasy well-grounded and political, then chances are that you will enjoy this book.	2003-08-20

The world that Ford creates in The Physiognomy is compelling, detail-rich, and difficult to forget. I think even the most suspicious readers will be charmed by his depiction of the Well-Built City and the details like the miners who have inhaled so much dust that they turn to stone.<br /><br />Unfortunately, his grip on characters is not quite as good. While Cley is engaging on a certain level, as a reader I was ultimately unable to care about either his goodness or his badness. If Ford could have made him matter just a little bit more, then it would not have felt so empty at the end.<br /><br />Despite the flaws, one of the most original fantasy reads I have had in a long time.

But I have to say that I really liked this book.<br /><br />I found all the characters interesting because they had not only the trappings of the period, they also had the appropriate flaws. I liked that Monk did not really appreciate Hester as he should, and I liked his indecision about who to support in the slander trial.<br /><br />The centerpiece notion of forgotten European history worked very well.<br /><br />If you too have enjoyed Perry's books, but never really loved them, then you might enjoy Weighed in the Balance.

The conspiracy theory gets so confused that by the end I had completely lost track of who was doing what-- unfortunatly I no longer cared enough to go back and figure it out more carefully. What was interestingly complex became tortured and convoluted and in the end it was dragged down by its own weight.<br />This said, I did find it an interesting new direction for Bear and there are aspects of it I hope to see picked up and followed through on in a later book.	2003-08-17

It is the world as we know it, only in this world a person's dark side can exist as a separate entity.<br /><br />The tip o' the hat to Mr. Hyde in the Shadow is well done. The novel is gritty enough to have a nice hard-boiled feel without being unbearably grotty.<br /><br />Why not five stars? Too disjointed.

Flanagan uses a penal colony and fish paintings to create a book that looks vividly at the edge between the joy and helplessness.<br /><br />William Buelow Gould does not understand all the history happening around him, is not much of a hero, is surrounded by people who are not who they say they are, and is manipulated by times as well as tides. He paints, and falls in love with his subject. He reads and tries to understand the difference between truth and fiction. His world is full of grotty mysteries and inadequate explanations and occasionally a genuine miracle.<br /><br />I lack the critical vocabulary to explain why I liked it as much as I did. Think Borges mixed with Faulkner with illustrations by Blake. And a little bit of Pynchon thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />\\"I just wanted to tell a story of love & it was about fish & it was about me & it was about everything.\\"<br /><br />If you want to read it and can find it, then pick up the hardcover. The illustrations are much better and the chapters are printed in different colors-- making the \\"12 Fish\\" aspect much clearer.	2003-08-17

Although _The Tar-Aiym Krang_ remains my favorite in the series, FLOMN is a nice portrait of the hero as a young boy. Particularly well-done is the way that he bonds with Pip and Mother Mastiff. More character than adventure, but that is not such a bad thing.<br /><br />I will be holding on to this one.	2003-08-17

It is a little funny, because I am often so critical of Ian Irvine, but I keep buying and reading his books.  There is a compliment there in its own right. Is that the kind of critic that a writer wants to have? One that keeps on complaining, but also keeps on buying.<br /><br />To be clear, I like a whole lot about what he does-- both here and in the View from the Mirror series.<br /><br />This said, I have a sinking feeling that we are going to have yet another weak central character who I don't really like as a person. I understand that is part of what Irvine does-- work with characters who are talented, but not terribly heroic. Unfortunately, I really found it difficult to like Tiaan. She gives in and she whines. And once again that character is given a foil of a weak man to play against-- in this series it is the fickle Minis with whom Tiaan is paired. I sincerely hope that this develops somewhere in the continuing books, because this character element is the thing that gives me the strong \\"here we go again\\" feeling in the review title. In his last series, nothing annoyed me more than this character dynamic.<br /><br />I am in any case curious to see what happens in this post-Charon Santhenar. I will buy the next installment, even if I grumble while I do.	2003-08-15

Even given that they were unedited, this was intended to be the record of a Reich that won the war.  This is not a private journal in the sense that he was always intending to rewrite it for history-- and presumably he was smart enough to realize that if he was still around to rewrite it for history then the Hitler regime had in some measure made it successfully through the war.<br /><br />What is interesting for the armchair historian are the places where his real feelings break through the propaganda. Presumably these are the moments that would have been edited out for publication. At times he whines about other nazi officials, at another point he sarcastically remarks that a plan of Hitler's would have been brilliant had it had any chance at all of succeeding.<br /><br />He was clearly a bright man (if an evil one), and it is interesting to watch his mind work in what were obviously (even to him) the final days.	2003-08-15

Sawyer has a really plausible hand with the paintbrush when it comes to depicting characters. I liked very much how he handled Molly's telepathy and Pierre as a French-Canadian. I also liked the respect for science that the book seems to have. 4 or even 5 stars taken altogether.<br /><br />In the end, I gave it 4 stars because there are an awful lot of good elements, but if I really had to go with my gut, it would be more like a 3.<br /><br />Anyhow, still a good read if you like scientific thrillers.	2003-08-03

I liked the different human races and I liked the way that nobody really seemed to cross sides into being saintly or really villainous (with a few minor exceptions). Irvine clearly has a lot of imagination and the ability to handle multiple threads of a really complex plot-- both of which are things to be applauded.<br /><br />Probably the best indication is that I would be willing to take a try at his *next* series, despite my doubts.	2003-08-03

I figured that a book those two liked could not be too far off from my own taste. And that was true, I have to say.<br /><br />Nylund is a strong writer with a powerful imagination. His story is about a reluctant prophet who is suddenly plagued by a host of accomplished magicians wanting to either help him or hinder him from attaining a goal he never knew he had. The characters are handled well and the plot fits neatly together. It is about as clean of a writing job as you can expect in fantasy.<br /><br />A few points--<br /><br />the one way in which the book is not handled well is the female love interests of the hero. Both Linda and Paloma end up as stereotypes, and not terribly well-developed stereotypes, at that. Too bad, because that would have deepened Larry's motivations and our understanding of his character.<br /><br />Much was clear to me when I read here that the book was intended as a tribute to Zelazny. Explained some weirdnesses around the writer character. I would have rather known it *before* I had read the book.<br /><br />If you like works in the vein of Swanwick or Powers, you too will probably find this a good read.

His novels often do not cross over into being more popular successes, largely (I believe) due to the complexity of his plots and characters.<br /><br />I agree with the reviewer who said that Bones of the Earth is the most accessible Swanwick novel to date. However, it still requires some attention and careful reading to get the full rewards of the book, particularly as it relates to the time travel aspects. This is not a bad thing, however, as Swanwick's ability to handle complexity allows him to create one of the best imaginings of time travel available to date in speculative fiction.<br /><br />Well worth reading.	2003-06-15

I found the first book lukewarm, while reading the second book interested me enough to run out immediately and buy the third. However, now that I have read the third I have to confess to feeling a little bit let down.<br /><br />The two main characters, Llian and Karan, spend most of the book stressing out about whether they trust each other. Somehow, this point is more important than the lives of their friends or the fate of the world. I have to say that I still find Karan one of the more remarkably unlikeable female leads in recent fantasy. I sincerely hope that in the 4th book, they get a therapist offline and the rest of the book can continue without further whining.<br /><br />That said, the adventure *does* continue and other of the characters become more interesting. I like very much the direction Rulke is taking and I am curious to hear more about him.<br /><br />Not a terrible read, just not a great one.	2003-05-18

Her expected peace is disturbed when an unpopular professor is murdered during an earthquake. She assists the bemused police department in solving the crime and meanwhile helps a confused young police officer sort out the moral issues of her personal life.<br />The book is gentle and prim almost to the point of doddering, despite the fact that Sister Mary Helen is a Very Modern Nun. The violence happens neatly offscreen and mysteries are solved without much fuss. Well-written for what it is and could be just the right thing if you're in the mood.	2003-05-13

I wasn't bored, and I finished the book. I don't think that anything can make Connelly less than a strong writer.<br />That said, the plot Connelly uses in Chasing the Dime really stretches credibility. He chose to anchor the book in an idea about human predictability and planning that seems as convoluted as a game of Mousetrap.  My enjoyment of the book was hurt because I just didn't buy it. Didn't buy the main character's actions at the beginning of the book and didn't buy it when the truth was revealed at the end.<br />While I enjoyed the tip o the hat to the Bosch novels, it could have used more of the Bosch quality.<br />Connelly novices shouldn't start here (try Black Ice). For Connelly initiates, you'll still find it above average as an airplane book, but that's about it.	2003-05-10

While passably written, it lacked freshness and I felt too bogged down in the details of the differences between the different human races.<br /><br />Things improved noticably in this second book for me. There was less exposition and more focus on the characters. Particularly intriguing is the Yggur/Maigraith relationship-- I am genuinely curious to see where that goes.<br /><br />I still did not like Karan (the main character), which makes it more challenging to like the book. Still, I am in more of a hurry to buy the third book then I was to buy the second.	2003-05-10

It is by turns beautiful and ugly. It is military history. It is a subjective view provided by a man very much of his time. It is an apology and an excuse for the necessities of war. It is a portrait of a tribe that Lawrence came to respect and even love. It is a travel book about life in the desert at the time of writing. It is inevitably a mix of fact and history and fiction and probably at least a little bit of wishful thinking.<br /><br />It is, ultimately, a pretty amazing book to read.<br /><br />A few notes:<br /><br />Before you read the book, do some quick background reading on the history that's involved. This will help avoid confusion.<br /><br />Be prepared for a long read! It's not only a long book, it's an extremely dense book. The choppiness and frequent changes in tone make it hard to put on the reading cruise control.<br /><br />Read it as a product of its time. Lawrence was a fascinating man, but not without his prejudices or faults.	2003-04-17

It looked like the best of the offerings they had, but I frankly wasn't expecting very much. I was pleasantly suprised, and found myself very quickly drawn into the book and its main character.<br />I liked Elizabeth Kennedy and I liked the way her character developed. The tension between her and her sister were a good way to open the situation and the way that it developed further was impressive. Small points off for some coincidences that strained credulity, but in general it was believable, and well worth the time that it took to read.	2003-04-13

What interested me in the earlier books was the connection between mental health and crime and the insight that Alex Delaware was able to bring to complicated cases. In the last few books that element has been perfunctory, more like a check on a checklist than really central to the plot. _The Murder Book_ is more about police conspiracy than about psychology, and is more in the world of Milo than of Alex.<br />This wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing, but the trouble is that Alex is still very much present as a character. And without a psychological case to profile, he's not a terribly interesting character. In this installment he's almost grating, and his ineptness is difficult to believe. After how many years as a police consultant he still \\"improvises\\" in the way portrayed here? Even given his grief about the failed relationship with Robin? Despite a lot of really gifted web searching, Alex doesn't have a whole lot to add to this book, and by the end I've forgotten why the murder book was ever sent to him in the first place.<br />Don't misunderstand, nothing will make Kellerman a less than gifted writer, but this series needs a real kick in the pants to make it worth reading again.	2003-04-13

I was afraid when I picked up _The Biz_ that it was going to be a dry read-- legal aspects of any business are not known for being a scintillating read. However, I am happy to report that it was not only a quick and interesting read, it was a genuinely funny one. Moore had me laughing out loud on several occasions.<br /><br />Even granted that this is not a book you read for the humor, it is refreshing to see a reference book so well written. My only quarrel was that I would have liked to see a bibliography included with the book in case I wanted to go in depth into any of the areas covered.	2003-04-13

The bad news is that compared to some of the other Connelly books, _A Darkness More Than Night_ is a bit of a disappointment. The good news is that a disappointing mystery by Connelly is much better than the best of most other writers.<br />While combining McCaleb and Bosch was an intriguing idea, it never quite worked out in terms of plot. The contrast between the two men and their different philosophies is striking (probably what captured Connelly's interest about the idea) as is the difference in approach that they take to the demons they both specialize in hunting. McCaleb has chosen for a new life, a baby daughter, a different way. Bosch walks the same dark roads he's always walked-- his marriage in ruins, his actions often heavily limned in shadow.<br />Unfortunately, it seems as though Connelly gets so caught up in his characters that he takes his eye off the ball-- the ending was predictable to the point where I think most readers figure the angle way too early to be able to effectively maintain interest. It's also straining credibility to add McEvoy to the mix-- a reunion of former characters is just a little too precious.<br />So, while Connelly fans may enjoy despite the flaws (I did!) this review should serve as a note of warning to first time Connelly readers-- don't begin with this book. There are better books to start with if you're going to start with either Harry Bosch or Terry McCaleb as characters.  For Harry Bosch (bitter avenging cop), pick up _The Black Ice_. For Terry McCaleb (retired ex-profiler, pick _Blood Work_.	2003-04-13

I read a lot of science fiction and fantasy every year, and it is rare that a book strikes me as much as did _The Ill-Made Mute_, the first book of the Bitterbynde. I have been waiting with impatience for the second book to hit paperback and have to say devoured it with the same eagerness as the first.<br /><br />Dart-Thornton combines familiar folklore and myth with a fantasy world to stunning effect. Her writing employs quite a bit of detailed description without ever becoming precious or straining too hard for the poetry. Where the first book focused on the journey of Imrhien through the wilds of Erith, this second book treats the elevation to Rohain, a grand court lady. What is wonderful is how Dart-Thornton manages to convey the same mystery about court customs that she does about the wilderness, and of course, to her heroine, both are mysteries.<br /><br />If I have any quarrel at all with the book, I thought that the folklore was rather less well-integrated than in the first. I was not as always quite as at ease with some of the folklore-based explanations in the latter part of the book. However, given the strength of the first two novels, I trust that the third will clarify the points that I was missing in a more than adequate way.<br /><br />Should amply satisfy anyone who liked the first book.	2003-04-13

Unfortunately, that is where the similarity ends. The tales are linked through the convention of setting them as material available in a library to researchers of the human race.<br /><br />While elements of the stories were interesting, there was a layer of sentimentality I (happily) missed in Tiptree's other work. I dislike obvious tear-jerkers, and particularly \\"The Only Neat Thing To Do\\" is clearly designed to get the hankies out.<br /><br />There are better Tiptree stories and collections out there-- this one is for the real fan.	2003-04-13

It suffers a bit from the recent trend of making every book more bloody, more twisted, and more violent than the last. Pretty much every shocking aspect you could hope to see is seen, and the reader should beware that the violence (including sexual violence) is quite graphic.<br />Given all that, it's a commendation that I was as interested in the book as I was. It doesn't get bogged down by all the shockadelic plot points, and Sara Linton emerges from all the blood as a robust and well-drawn character.<br />I'll be interested to read the next book in the series-- I have some hope that Slaughter may still follow a more psychologically thrilling path.	2003-04-12

Particularly in the early chapters of the book, these authors give it a good try.<br />Unfortunately, the biggest problem with the book is that they try to treat the technology standards and products available on the market, and the market is just changing too quickly for that to be for more than just a superficial look. Too much of what they discuss is already outdated, out-of-business, merged with other offerings or otherwise defunct. Not the fault of the authors, just the nature of the DRM market.<br />This book is:<br />Not a good read if you already understand the basic issues and hope to get more insight into the technology-- go to the web for that.<br />Absolutely a good read if you want to become familiar in a basic way in the underlying issues. Part 1 of the book is really useful reading even to help people who are pretty familiar with the topic structure their thinking.	2003-04-12

Morgan does one of the most effective jobs I have yet seen mixing the hard-boiled detective genre with sci-fi/cyberpunk.  Kovacs is one mean ex-Corpsman who only gets out of the prison stacks if someone finds a job for him-- and there are precious few jobs for violent, brilliant borderline-psychotics out there...<br /><br />Morgan combines enough technology details to satisfy most cyberpunk fans, but miraculously enough keeps his eye on the ball for the mystery. The plot would be just as suitable in a Chandler novel or a Travis McGee book if the 26th century detailing was removed. The book unfortunately gets points off for not knowing how to end; the conclusion is not as satisfying as it should be given everything that comes before.<br /><br />A great read, and I will look forward to the next Kovacs installment. Should appeal to hard-boiled mystery and cyberpunk fans.	2003-04-12

There were a few too many moments in the book that I could see coming-- does every heroine need to fall in love with the guy she initially thinks is a handsome jerk?

Jazz Cleopatra is a slim volume (269 pages of text, plus notes and bibliography) but clearly a well-researched and well-written one. Rose's extensive notes and bibliography give a small idea of how much thinking went into the writing of the book, and indeed it has the feel of something which has been carefully considered.<br /><br />It is worth emphasizing that the subtitle of the book is \\"Josephine Baker in Her Time\\". I stress the point because I think that the reader should expect that this is not so much a biography (although biography is an important element) as it is a contextual portrait. Rose spends a lot of time on Baker not just as a person, but as an icon and the book is often closer to cultural criticism than \\"true\\" biography.<br /><br />This is not a bad thing, necessarily. It is just that I was looking more for biography and probably more for personality and that is not what this book is about.	2003-03-18

I did not find that Damned to Fame suffered from particular whitewashing, but then I was not reading it with a particular need to see SB picked apart in a personally critical way.<br /><br />Knowlson was a close personal friend of Beckett's-- a fact which he does not try to hide in his treatment. And as such he has access to letters and papers of which other would-be Beckett biographers could only dream. And as a friend, I found that he left the focus in the place that Beckett would have wanted it-- on the work itself, on the vision, on the *writing*.<br /><br />Which is not to say that he neglects Beckett as a person. But  Beckett was a deeply private person and I found that Knowlson did an excellent job of balancing the privacy so dear to the subject with discussing what the reader needs to know to understand the artist.<br /><br />For a casual reader, Damned to Fame might even be *too* exhaustive. I appreciated it, however. Particularly appreciated all the references to what Beckett was reading at various points in his life and I as well appreciated the copious notes and bibliography provided at the end of the book.	2003-03-17

I was glad to see a return to the Bas Lag world. _The Scar_ is not a sequel to _Perdido Street Station_ but picks up tangentially where the first book left off.<br /><br />Instead of setting the action again in New Crobuzon, Mieville instead turns his attention to the great oceans that surround the city. When linguist Bellis Coldwine decides that pressure from the authorities necessitates an extended trip to the colonies, she doesn't expect exactly how extended it's going to be.<br /><br />I was not expecting to love _The Scar_ as much as I did. I had problem with the first novel in that while I found the imagination to be masterful I found the plotting less satisfying. This book corrects any deficiencies that the first book might have had and then some. I was fascinated by the details of Armada, found the characters more than clever gimmicks, and simply could not stop reading to find out what was going to happen.<br /><br />Great book.

It is well-written, well-paced, reasonably well-plotted. The inherent quality is the main reason that I am giving it three stars instead of two or even one.<br /><br />Ultimately, I just did not find the book interesting. Many of the character elements were predictable, and I did not appreciate Billingham's attempt to make it interesting by making his killer even weirder and more cruel.<br /><br />It is unfortunately lately how many mystery writers seem to be relying on ever more shocking plotting instead of good characters to drive their novels. I may be being too hard on Billingham simply because I am annoyed by how much indifferent writing I have been reading lately. I think I would have forgiven Sleepy Head more readily had it been less obvious that Billingham is underneath it all a good writer.	2003-03-11

In order to get the explanation he needs to end the book it felt as though he really had to torture the plot.

I had some minor quarrels with the craft in the earlier books, and those are almost entirely gone after reading this.<br /><br />Unlike some other Kay fans, I found that I preferred this book to Sailing to Sarantium. The first book felt too much like a preface to me-- Lord of Emperors feels more complete. I liked the introduction of the new characters and I did not mind that the focus was a little bit less on Crispin.<br /><br />Some things possibly worth knowing before you buy this book:<br /><br />1.<br />This is historical fantasy much more than a typical fantasy novel. Don't expect the magic to be central as it was in the Fionavar novels. Do not expect to see much magic at all, in fact. The book has more in common with Prince of Foxes than it does with Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />2.<br />The first book in the Mosaic was more about the characters. Lord of Emperors is more about the game of thrones. If Crispin was the major reason you loved the first book, you may have some trouble with the second.<br /><br />I read an interview with Kay where he discusses the importance of research and talks about the details he employs subliminally reaching out to his audience. It is a good description of the effect that his writing has in this work. The most superb thing about the Sarantine Mosaic is the level of detail-- there are scenes that are still brightly sketched in my mind even a week after finishing reading.<br /><br />My one real quarrel is that I felt as though there were too many characters that I started to care about and lost track of during this second book. Even granted that this was more about the politics than the people, it still felt to me as though it could have been (should have been?) longer in order to accomodate a little bit more in the way of character arc.<br /><br />Recommended.	2003-03-08

She uses detail in a way that many writers in the genre are too lazy or unable to carry off-- just the little touches, like the description of the basil in Angharad's garden, really made the book stand out.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the book had two major strikes against it:<br /><br />1. Too high of a body count-- it started to feel gratuitous at a certain moment.<br /><br />2. The plot falls apart almost completely at the end-- I had figured out who the killer had to be, but had no idea of the motivation. After reading the ending, I *still* had no idea about the motivation. The conclusion of the book was so unclear that I was actually annoyed that I had stayed up so late to finish it.<br /><br />Lark, the owner of a bookshop in Northern California is invited, together with her policeman boyfriend, to a party at the house of noted poet Dai Llewellyn. When he unexpectedly dies and it becomes clear that it was not his heart, Lark is pulled into a mystery from the past that would eventually threaten the people she loves.<br /><br />Simonson deserves another chance as a writer for the finer qualities of the book, but I hope that there is an improvement in her plotting (or at least her ending) skills between this book and the next.	2003-02-28

I checked it out repeatedly from the library (I can even picture in my mind's eye exactly where it was on the shelves). It was unique among fantasies written for young people in that it really was frightening.<br /><br />Many children's books make the mistake of talking down to kids-- they make things saccharine and elide the scary bits.

Gordon is to be highly commended for not dumbing down his writing.<br /><br />Jonquil is in a bad mood and wilfully deserts the rest of her class on a field trip to the backlands.  The ground itself seems to approve of her going AWOL and she finds a piece of metal tucked among some ridges in the soil. This discovery pulls her into a dangerous adventure filled with vicious dogs, grey men, leather men, and the charming Elizabeth Goodenough. _The Giant Under the Snow_ is comparable to _The Dark is Rising_ books in that it draws from traditions of British folklore and mythology.<br /><br />Difficult to find these days, but worth the effort.	2003-02-27

In the introduction to the book, John Freeman tells the story of how Jung came to get involved with the project. Apparently, the managing director of Aldus books had seen Jung on the BBC and was so struck by his warmth and personableness that he tried to persuade Jung to apply those same qualities to a book written for the general masses, rather than for psychologists themselves. While at first refusing, Jung was swayed by one of his own dreams into changing his mind and agreeing to take on the project. Given that the book to a large degree dwells on dreams and what can be learned from them, it is an appropriate anecdote.<br /><br />The publisher does not get any praise for designing the cover in such a way that it implies Jung was the author of the entire book. He was the editor and wrote one of the chapters. Neither is the book an integral whole-- the chapters treat different aspects of symbolism and the unconscious, each with their own viewpoint and flavor.<br /><br />The essays in the book are as follows:<br /><br />\\"Approaching the Unconscious\\" (Carl Jung)-- for those who don't know his work, this is a very nice introduction to most of the basic points.<br /><br />\\"Ancient Myths and Modern Man\\" (Joseph L. Henderson)-- examines symbols as they appear in both myth and modern day culture.<br /><br />\\"The Process of Individuation\\" (M.-L. von Franz)-- treats patterns of dreams over the lifetime of the individual. A good look at the concept of Animus and Anima.<br /><br />\\"Symbolism in the Visual Arts\\" (Aniele Jaffe)-- IMO the weakest chapter, looks at the progression of sacred symbol to art.<br /><br />\\"Symbols in an Individual Analysis\\" (Jolande Jacobi)-- Describes the treatment through dream analysis of a young Swiss man.<br /><br />While the book felt uneven in places (and even contradictory), it serves well in the purpose for which it was intended. Someone reading the book will get the basic concepts of symbols and the unconscious, and some decent pointers to further readings in the notes if they wanted to find out more.	2003-02-26

Martin to spark my interest.<br />While I have to say I don't think that Carey's written a book that can equal one of Lee or Martin's creations, I did find it readable and well-crafted. Moreover, while there are sexual elements, Carey does a marvelous job of keeping a book about a masochistic prostitute from descending into soft-core.<br />_Kushiel's Dart_ is best compared with _Maia_ by Richard Adams in which a prostitute can have a priveledged role as a witness to power. Through the lens of Phedre no Delaunay we get a rich look at the game of houses played in this fantasy land of Terre d'Ange.<br />Interesting mythology with enough fantasy elements to make it an alternative world but resists using stock magic elements to carry the plot. The only fault is in the seeming lack of flaws in the main characters-- and I also get tired of races where everyone is unnaturally beautiful, but I guess that goes with the genre.<br />I suppose it's worth repeating the obvious-- not designed for the younger fantasy reader.	2003-02-21

To read a collection of letters by an artist whose work you know very well is to invite yourself to take a look at him as a person. As a person, I found that I liked him best in these letters when he was struggling with his religion, his art, and his purpose. I'm glad that Roskill didn't make a selection that focused solely on the more famous and theatrical depressions.<br />I don't agree that this work reveals Van Gogh as a writer. For me, they definitely confirmed his status as a painter. At his best in these letters, he's painting with words.<br />Which doesn't make it a less interesting read. I found this a good adjunct to taking a look at the work again, it added an extra dimension to experiencing him as a painter.<br />Well worth the time it takes.	2003-02-20

I find myself tending to agree with the reviewers who had the feeling that _The Blue Last_ was two books melded together. The best bit about the Richard Jury novels has always been the combination of charming and affecting. Jury himself (in the best of the books) stands apart from the other zany folks, but not *so* far above. In _The Blue Last_, while Jury is actually getting more interesting (not a mean feat in his 17th novel) the Long Piddlingtons are dangerously close to self-parody.<br /><br />Suggest that Grimes may take the feeling that she is getting with Jury and the plot in this novel and create a whole new character/series.	2003-02-20

I always love the ideas of Charles de Lint's novels, but this is really the first one where I was as satisfied with the execution as I was with the story setup.<br /><br />Often with De Lint, it almost feels like he spent all his time building the world that his characters are moving in and almost forgets about the plot. I suppose what I like best about Forests of the Heart is that the plot is very strong. I cared enormously what happened to the characters, and kept reading because I wanted to see what would happen further, but I was also terribly sorry to see the pages decreasing because I was just enjoying reading it so much.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2003-02-19

In the author's introduction to \\"A Dream Play\\", Strindberg focuses on what he sees as the real nature of dreams-- disconnected and painful, with their own strange logic. I think he captures something of that feeling in all of the five plays in this collection, even given that some of his plays come more explicitly from his symbolic works.<br /><br />In this collection, the reader is presented with the classic Strindberg themes-- the emancipated woman, rebellion, religious symbolism, and always in every way the search for meaning.<br /><br />\\"The Father\\" pits a man and woman against each other in a destructive effort to control their daughter's destiny.<br /><br />\\"Miss Julie\\" depicts the seduction and discard of a silly young girl who is harshly confronted with the basic coldness of life.<br /><br />\\"Dance of Death\\" is a grim look at a marriage based on hatred, as an ex-actress and an army captain are stuck together on an isolated island.<br /><br />In \\"A Dream Play\\" Indra's daughter is sent to earth to live as best as she can among mortals.<br /><br />\\"The Ghost Sonata\\" explores dream logic in three movements. A meditation on the difference between just and proper.<br /><br />A decent translation, at least I did not trip over it as awkward. A sad and dislocating book to read. There is a debate to be had about whether plays in general are worth reading as literature, or whether they need to be seen as performance. I would argue that these plays are both a joy to read and a joy to see.	2003-02-19

Early in the novel, a miniaturist named Olive says \\"Through our colors, paints, art and love, we remember that Allah  had commanded us to \\"See\\"!\\". I found myself thinking about that line repeatedly later throughout this wonderful book.<br /><br />First, be warned, this is not a quick read by any means. There is no omniscient narrative voice to smooth the path for the reader. Instead, the reader is presented with multiple voices and perspectives-- some from the characters themselves, some from the illustrations in the books, one memorable passage is even told from the point of view of ink itself.<br /><br />And while there is a story and the story is important (the commissioning of the religiously dubious book by the Sultan, the subsequent murderer of Elegant Effendi, Black's efforts to find the killer, save the book and win the hand of his cousin Shekure), it is not as though the story were the book and it only orders the flow of the multiple perspectives rather than really making the reading of the book easier.<br /><br />Pamuk has been much cited in the press lately, not only for his views as a novelist, but also for his views on what he calls the \\"absurd\\" conflict between east and west. Through using the medium of the narrow world of the miniaturists in the 16th century, Pamuk gently addresses the issue of heresy and pollution by stressing the continual influence of other cultures on the classical miniature form and by making clear through debates on individuality, blindness, and style where many of the differences between east and west are located. And also, of course, the similarities are revealed in the same manner.<br /><br />I found _My Name Is Red_ to be by turns funny, thought-provoking and moving. I was never bored even though it took me perhaps three times as long to read as another book of similar length.<br /><br />Some tips to the reader: read and even re-read the chronology at the back. Also, the publisher's web site for the book has some images of the paintings referred to by the characters. I found it useful to refer to them after I had finished the novel.cters.

These goals include long-term differentiation from competitors, internal quality control, profit margin protection, and facilitation of additional product introduciton.<br />To make her case, she chose three cases from the past (Wedgwood, Heinz, and Marshall Field) and three cases from the present (Estee Lauder, Starbucks, and Dell Computers). Finally, she concludes the book with a chapter which addresses the issue of historical forces and entrepreneurial agency.<br />I particularly found the cases from the past persuasive in their argumentation for a long-term differentiating factor in brand. The newer cases are obviously harder to make in that (particularly with Starbucks and Dell) how long-term the success will be remains to be seen.  One of the best features of the book is the depth with which she treats each case-- she provides enough information to build her thesis (and often entertain with the anecdotes) but not so much that the book becomes bogged down. The excellent footnotes provide whatever's necessary to someone looking for further information.<br />One minor quarrel is that I would have liked to see the further reading pulled out into a better organized bibliography. There were obviously quite a few good sources scattered amongst the footnotes and if you were interested in a particular subject matter it required some patience to pull all of the citations out.	2003-02-13

Despite being quite a ways into the series, _Cold Case_ is not lacking the inventiveness and incisiveness that has made the Alan Gregory novels a cut above the rest (no pun intended).<br />The idea of the Vidocq society is a good one, and gives Gregory a new way of getting involved with interesting crimes. I found the depiction of the motivation behind the case particularly well done. If there's any complaint to be made at all it's that the clarity White always uses perhaps shifted sideways into actually being too chilly-- there's a certain coldness in the writing that there hasn't been in some of my favorite other books in the series. But tastes shall certainly differ about whether you like that or not, so don't let that dissuade you from giving this fine mystery a go.	2003-01-30

I like what one of the other reviewers here said when he remarked that this book does not end, it just stops. What occurs to me most, as I sit down to write this review, is that I have a hard time really remembering the ending. I remember parts of it-- I remember how the romantic tension between the two leads worked out. I remember what the characters learned about themselves. Unfortunately, I have to say that I do not really remember what exactly happened once we got past the hurricane. That seems a shame, also, because I remember the opening so vividly.<br /><br />The book begains with a huge amount of promise. I loved the world and the characters, and the premise. I am not sure what made it so much less captivating as it continued.<br /><br />Still, a remarkable book all told. I was interested to read that this is the third book that Stewart set in this world. I may well go looking for one of the earlier ones.	2003-01-30

I began with Earthquake Weather, moved into Last Call, went on to The Anubis Gates and have now finished Expiration Date. I guess of all of them, I like Experation Date the least.<br /><br />Which is not to say that I did not enjoy it. I think that Powers is one of the most (if not *the* most) creative, inventive and possibly mad fantasy writers working today. It is rarely that I read a writer who really makes me say \\"How on earth did he think of *that*?\\"<br /><br />Powers creates a plot centering around the ghost of Thomas Edison, the idea that ghosts can be inhaled for their essence, and complicated ideas about magic and superstition. Somehow he makes this plot feel almost inevitable-- it never feels odd for the sake of odd.<br /><br />So why is it my least favorite? I think that it is largely an issue of comparison. For all that the premise in this book is highly believable, it's not quite as real to me as the Last Call world. There are a few too many characters and there are almost places where some of them feel as though they are driving the plot. But largely it is because I don't quite believe the motivation where deLarava is concerned-- I find her one of the weakest of the Powers characters and I have trouble buying her eventual character arc.<br /><br />Still, any Powers is more worth reading more than the best book by almost anyone else.	2003-01-30

The only thing dry about reading Galbraith is his humor. I decided to read this book because I felt as though I missed some economic background and wanted to make sure I had the major basics covered. I expected it to be informative, something like reading a textbook.<br /><br />It was nothing at all like reading a textbook (or if it had been I would have enjoyed college a whole lot more). I got the information I needed all right, but it was fascinating reading and I often found myself laughing out loud at Galbraith's asides.<br /><br />Shame that it is out of print.

The only trouble is that their treasures keep disappearing after the group has restored them.<br /><br />The Max and Sarah novels are characterized by their eccentricity and likable characters.

In one novel we get a rather dubious brother-sister relationship, sexual exploitation, homophobia, a prostitute killer, a plot leveled against a mid-level functionary who only wants to uncover the Truth, refugees from the terror, mistreated madness, nymphomania, police who don't care about prostitute killers, spies, a scientific mystery, a mysterious woman named Selene, a fallen priest, a father-daughter relationship gone Terribly Wrong, a relationship between brothers gone Terribly Wrong, sexual blackmail, battle scenes, conspiracy theory, music, and finally astronomy. I'm probably leaving some things out. I honestly stopped caring at a certain moment.<br />The answer to writing a more exciting and atmospheric mystery novel is NOT to throw every element ever employed in the genre and then some between two covers. The result is not pleasing, nor is it fun to read.<br />The shame of it all is that Redfern clearly has some talent as a writer and has seemingly done her homework on the period. I hope that with her next book some kind editor will take pity on her and encourage her to save some of her good ideas for more than one book.	2003-01-28

I am rounding up the rating because until I got to this page I had not realized that this was the second book in a series. Strauss at least gets point for writing a sequel that stands so well on its own merits. I did not realize that this was the second book in a series, and never felt as though I were missing information. This said, I may have either liked it less or more than most of the readers because I have read out of order.<br /><br />Cariad, a talented assassin who fights the tyranny of the Redenned, is waiting for the father who she has never met to return.<br /><br />The way that Strauss approaches magic in the world is interesting. I like the tension between handpower and mindpower and the balance necessary between the two. The Garden of the Stone offers us an alternative way of viewing our own history-- a nice achievement for any fantasy novel.<br /><br />Sometimes I lacked a feeling of freshness, and the pacing felt as though it could have been handled better. These are not major complaints, but kept me from experiencing the book as anything stronger than enjoyable.<br /><br />Recommended, but unlike me you should probably read the books in the good order.	2003-01-28

This is the third Connelly that I have read, and the first featuring Harry Bosch. I was really impressed, and this makes me want to pick up all the Bosch novels. It is moody and dark, with  and well-drawn  and well-developed characters. While Connelly's non-Bosch works were quite good, this genuinely approaches great.<br /><br />The story features drugs and corruption between Mexico and the LAPD. Bosch is a character who is a tough maverick in a believable kind of way. He is hard-boiled but still has some soft points-- standard requirements for the classic noir detective. The way that he makes the character interact with the plot is less standard. Too often, writers who are working in the noir side of the genre create nothing but faithful imitations of Chandler or Hammett. Connelly is brave enough to update the form, and it succeeds fantastically.<br /><br />If the rest of the Bosch books are as good as this one, then I do not think it will take me very long to work my way through the collection. Recommended.	2003-01-28

The Ayn Rand echos are noted, as are the Ender Wiggins. I will add one more. I was struck that this was a more mature version of Anne McCaffrey's To Ride Pegasus.<br /><br />I thought it was clever how the hatred for the super-talented sleepless is first seen in the fact that their competition is seen as unfair. I like very much the way that Kress developed the question of whether people who can contribute to such a high degree are obliged to help the \\"beggars\\", the sleepers who can never be as productive to the society. I even like the way that she turns the question of being a beggar on its head later with the super-sleepless (although I can imagine that people who were following along with the political thread were a little disappointed at the easy way in which art becomes the redemptive factor.)<br /><br />Smart, very readable, and makes me want to read the next book in the series.	2003-01-27

Gaskell wrote one of the most vivid descriptions of the gap between rich and poor in this novel of the Manchester 'hungry forties'.<br /><br />The romantic plot centers around the murder of the son of a factory owner. While well written, the plot romance and mystery are almost cursory in comparison to the loving detail that Gaskell lavishes on Alice Wilson, the temptation of Esther, and all the little points of life in deep poverty. Gaskell is compassionate and clear-sighted in her writing, making this a very nice read.<br /><br />Mary Barton appeals to readers of all ages, and works at the level of both plot and social history.

The trial of Kabua Miyamoto is a suitable device in this sense, as the decision about his guilt or innocence forces a community to consider its past and the role of its Japanese-American community during World War II.<br /><br />From my point of view, perhaps a little pale, but still well worth reading.	2003-01-25

However, what Senge has to say is so thorough and well-communicated that I think that it has so far stood the test of time and is still one of the best works around on organizational knowledge and organizational change.<br /><br />I do a lot of work on guiding organizational change which is necessary when new technology is being introduced into the enterprise. I find the models that Senge puts forward of enduring usefulness and it is a rare project which does not inspire me to take this book back off the shelf.<br /><br />A business must-have.	2003-01-25

I was interested in the world portrayed by this novel and that alone would probably motivate me to buy the next book. The characters are rather less compelling, and Irvine too often writes in cliche. I wanted to shake Llian more than I wanted to like him.<br /><br />I am curious to see what the next installment is going to bring.	2003-01-25

If so, who was smoking the cigarettes that they found in her house?<br />Grijpstra and de Gier are called in to figure out who was behind the murder.<br />Van De Wetering's novels are always among the best mysteries around. His characters are meditative in a way that feels authentic. He manages to put a human face on brutality while still somehow underlying the brutality. Even sensational endings feel like inevitable parts of a story rather than a novelists trick. Well worth a read for people who don't know them.	2003-01-17

One of the most common returning themes in Mary J. Holmes novels is that of two sisters--  one of whom is superficially more beautiful but is selfish and cold-hearted while the second sister is less beautiful but is warm and giving. Tempest and Sunshine makes that struggle central to its plot by pitting the sweet and guileless Fanny against her scheming sister Julia.<br /><br />Most reminiscent of Bad Hugh, Tempest and Sunshine continues the Holmes tradition of slightly skewing the expected storyline. Her bad sister is not all bad, and Holmes makes clear that the blame for her badness is not entirely hers.<br /><br />Be aware that the book was set in pre civil-war south and it engages in some possibly unpleasant apologies for slavery.	2003-01-14

Thomas J. Watson Jr.'s book is no exception to this rule. Although in many ways the book is a business biography, the relationship between the two men creeps in between the lines (almost more than you could imagine that the author had intended it to). Watson Jr. was clearly influenced by his iconic father, both for better and for worse. The book is a lot about how that influence (and the escape from that influence) shaped the company that is IBM today.<br /><br />Obviously the company has gone through many changes since this book has written-- Gerstner, downsizing, eBusiness, Business Consulting Services, etc. But still, it is remarkable how much of the culture is recognizable back to the very earliest days.<br /><br />I have a special interest in the subject matter, so it is hard for me to say how fascinating someone without an IBM attachment would find the book. If you do have that special interest in IBM history, however, it is an interesting book and well executed.	2003-01-12

I really liked the character of Repairman Jack, the main character of this book. I liked him so much, in fact, that I was willing to forgive many of the more awkward aspects of the book (predictable plot point, clumsy narrative, unlikely character actions).<br /><br />Repairman Jack is a professional fixer of situations. He puts himself in danger, often to get his clients out of danger. Unfortunately his girlfriend Gia does not think much of his profession, and her concerns seem borne out when Jack gets involved with a cursed necklace whose effects seem to be putting Gia and her daughter in deadly danger.<br /><br />I think it will make a good film, and I will probably pick up another Repairman Jack book should I see one.	2003-01-12

Well-written and well-conceived, Freeling remains one of my all-time favorite mystery writers.<br />In this book, Van der Valk uncovers the very unlikely fact of a youth gang from the rich town of Bloemendaal. These teenagers are carrying out particularly vicious robberies in Amsterdam and leave their victim with only the mysterious words &quot;the cats won't like it.&quot; To solve this particular mystery, Van Der Valk needs to get beneath the skin of a seemingly sleepy Dutch town to get at the rot that lies beneath.<br />If you're a fan of Simenon or Durrenmatt, you should consider trying Nicolas Freeling.	2003-01-12

I would really give this three or three-and-a-half stars, but I am inclined to be  generous because it is clearly well-researched and also well-written.<br /><br />Marley has written a knowledgeable and sensitive book about two musicians living 250 years apart. Eilish Eam is an orphaned street player who attracts the attentions of Benjamin Franklin while Erin Rushton is a famous glass harmonica player based in Seattle of the early 20th century. Their presence somehow comforts each other across the ages and Erin learns an important lesson about her own life and the purpose of her art.<br /><br />The problem with the novel is that there simply is not enough there there. While Eam's world is incredibly detailed, Erin's is only hinted at. It is obviously quite different from our world in 2003, but exactly how is never made clear. I realize that the focus was meant to be on Eam. However, since Marley chose to structure the plot around Erin, I felt that she should have also given Erin more focus.  The key decisions in the book rested on Erin, but I knew very little about her motivations. As a result, the ending felt a little unearned.<br /><br />That said, the book was good enough that it made me want to try other books that Marley wrote. She writes about 18th century London in a way that felt both sharp and real. I also enjoyed reading it-- it kept me going and interested. Promising signs pointing towards a writer whose other works I might enjoy more.	2003-01-11

The book walks the reader through the seven habits and provides practical concrete examples for how they can be applied in the everyday life of the reader. There were habits that I saw could be put into use immediately in my own life as well as other aspects that seemed like good ways to help think about future directions.<br />Covey roots his philosophy of change in building habits that endure and suggests grounding those habits in sustainable personal integrity. Covey writes with confidence and uses a clear, readable style. Recommend.	2003-01-10

It was such a great premise for a book-- what if the Babbage had realized his analytical engine and successfully created computer much earlier in our history? It was also encouraging that two of my favorite writers were involved. Unfortunately, _The Difference Engine_  never really delivers on its astounding amount of promise and the resulting book, while readable, does not hold together terribly well.<br /><br />Three sets of very different lives intersect when they all come in contact with a mysterious box of punch cards. Mix in an alternative history, lady Ada Babbage (with echos of Moorcock's Gloriana), and a staggering richness of detail and you have the book itself.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it often felt like a huge amount of talent in search of a plot. The detailing was perfect, the characters were great, but the story just never came together.<br /><br />Too bad.	2003-01-10

I'm afraid that had I read these novels first, I might have been too frightened to progress to the more mature novels (_Blood and Guts in High School_ is my favorite). Still, these books make thought-provoking reading.<br />For me, the least successful of the three was the _The Childlike Life of the Black Tarantula by the Black Tarantula_. Call this one three stars. In BT, Acker takes scenes from the lives of famous murderesses and from pornographic novels and inserts herself into them. Interesting idea, but too much repetition. It felt too much like a formal experiment.<br />My favorite was _I Dreamt I was a Nymphomanic: Imagining_. I found it really sweet for Acker, although the chapters were a little too  disjointed for comfort. For me, her best work tempers the anger with a kind of dreamy happiness, and this is one of her best works.<br />_The Adult Life of Toulouse Lautrec by Henri Toulouse Lautrec_ has been anthologized elsewhere. It's definitely worth a read (Lautrec as a lonely woman in a whorehouse) or a re-read if (like me) you'd read it before.<br />I got a lot more out of reading these early works having read the other novels. I could appreciate where she was going in a way that I'm not certain that I could have had I read them cold. Start with Blood and Guts or _Empire of the Senseless_ if you're an Acker newbie.	2003-01-01

I like detective novels, even serial killer detective novels, and I don't generally think of myself as faint-hearted. But I have to say that _The Treatment_ made me feel rather faint-hearted. Or faint, anyhow.<br />Jack Cafferty investigates a case which has disturbing echos to a case from his personal history. The kidnap of an entire family and the ordeal suffered by the boy taken from the house of the family lead Cafferty into the underworld of pedophiles, pornography, and killers.<br />Well-written, but the scenes with the children are really quite awful and I sometimes had the uncomfortable feeling that the book came dangerously close to exploitation-- the descriptions were quite explicit, honestly too explicit for my tastes. Still, probably a question of taste, but be aware what you're in for when you pick up the book.	2003-01-01

This thriller/horror novel begins with a stolen Mummy and ends with an archfiend serial killer. How it gets from point A to point B is unclear, and at least a little bit uninteresting.<br />_Death's Door_ seems to me as though the goal of the writer was to become known for the most gory and graphic set of serial killers on record. In this, Slade succeeds admirably-- the abominations range from particularly nasty snuff to child torture to necrophilia-- all in a mere 368 pages.<br />Unfortunately, the book is less successful in creating coherent characterization or plot. I never fully got the Special X thing, and the serial killer is so over-the-top bad he brought Boris Badinoff to mind more quickly than Hannibal Lector. And as for a good explanation of the whole Mummy thing? Forget it. It never arrives.<br />_Death's Door_ will probably succeed in keeping you awake while waiting for a delayed bus at a Greyhound station, but I would suggest that you pick it up second-hand.	2002-12-30

If this book is any indication, there's no risk that Reese is going to steal Rice's position as the ruler of gothic supernaturals. He's clearly studied her intently-- he's got the thing of everyone being magically beautiful or compelling, and he's definitely got the tone. However, he doesn't have the same gift of weaving a credible plot, nor does he resist enough the temptation to shock the reader.<br />Herculine is an orphaned girl being brought up on the charity of a school for rich girls run by nuns. Falsely accused of being a witch, Herculine is rescued by a real witch and comes face to face with the true nature of spiritual life.<br />What Reese does well is to capture the atmosphere of 19th century France. I was interested in the book, despite its rather obvious flaws. It may be that in later books we get a better explanation of witchcraft, but at this point the whole backstory feels rather jumbled and certain elements (Herculine's physical anomaly, Madeleine's bleeding) seemed included simply to make it more shocking rather than to add to the story. Other elements get breezed right over (for instance, why does Asmodei act as he does?-- Herculine is amazingly uncurious about the attack) and they're elements which, as a reader, you'd like to see explored.<br />I'll probably pick up the next book in the series (I'm assuming that there is or will be one), but I'm not going to expect too much.	2002-12-30

Meg Halloran is less than pleased when her policeman boyfriend Vince announces that he's bringing his troubled 16-year old niece Cass on their long-awaited romantic vacation. Her grumpiness turns to fear as she and Cass are kidnapped. They struggle to keep their kidnappers happy while trying to understand who is responsible. Was it an act of Cass' troubling boyfriend? Was it an enemy of Vince's from one of his cases? Was it something else altogether that sparks the kidnapping?<br />The characters in the novel are reasonably interesting and the story itself is well-written. The book suffers a bit from the two plots (that of the kidnappers and the kidnappees) and LaPierre's inability to bring the two together in a realistic way. As a reader, you can see the idea behind the book, but it doesn't work terribly well as a book.<br />Still, promising enough to keep an eye out for other books by the same author.	2002-11-29

I found the science plausible (to my admittedly limited eye), the characters real, and the problem gripping.<br />Genesis is a think tank notorious for taking on unorthodox scientific problems. Backed by one of the world's largest corporations, they decide to examine what looks terrifyingly like an epidemic of violence worldwide. The problem of the Babel Effect, as it comes to be known, turns out to be much more personal then any of the team members could have predicted.<br />The book gets minor points off for being a little bit too didactic, and the villain of the piece felt a little bit too much like a cop out, but neither of these points really detracted from the reading of the book. I started it on an airplane, read it obsessively most of the first evening at my destination, and finished it over breakfast the next day.	2002-11-29

Along the way, she learns a lot about the movement to legalize drugs and is forced to examine many of her own prejudices.<br />I actually happen to agree with a lot of the points Marsala makes in the book. It's just that I also happen to resent being force-fed political agenda when I think that I'm going to be reading a mystery. The whole story gets lost behind all the expounding that goes on. D'Amato takes the opportunity to bring out all the arguments for and against drug legalization and does so with very thinly veiled plot tricks (the different candidates for taking over Sugarman's role have to give sample speeches to explain why they are pro-legalization). Add to that a main character who while occasionally interesting is undeveloped (her reactions to the police are spurious, as is her decision to investigate) and you get a book worth skipping.<br />Hopefully with her other books, D'Amato focused more on the mystery and less on pounding the reader over the head with political debate.	2002-11-29

To be honest, I lost that interest and amazement a number of books ago. While the first book set in Oregon gave me a glimmer of new hope, this book really isn't there either.<br />A lot of the problem is that what made Burke so interesting in the first few books was the very real tension between light and dark in the character. He was constantly in balance, and the nastiness made for a really refreshing read after all the weaker characters that you find in detective novels today.  Unfortunately, Burke has been around too long, and he's just too much a defender to really believe in the Dark Knight anymore. He's taken on too many good causes and acted too much as protector of the helpless. Good thing in a person, less good if you want to keep the tension of someone strung between good and evil. I'm sure that the continuing novels serve Vachss' not-so-hidden agenda of educating his audience, but they just aren't as interesting to read at this point.<br />I'm a little troubled with myself for writing this kind of review, as I recognize that there are larger issues with these books than a good escapist read. I applaud Vacchs' determination in the work he does for children and I think he's chosen a nearly ideal vehicle for getting his messages out.<br />I just wish that I had the same compulsion to read Burke novels as I did with the first.<br />Anyways, this book (Burke tries to ignore his problematic relationship with Gem, while taking on the case of a 16-year old runaway) is well-written and will probably appeal. Still worth a read, in any case.	2002-11-29

As such, his books consistently deliver with a reasonable quality of craft exactly what the reader is looking for.<br />Don't expect any shocks from the new Alex Cross. There's a vicious serial killer (this time with a fun tip o' the hat to Anne Rice), a mysterious unmasked baddie, and yet another gorgeous woman who will probably be loved and lost. You won't stumble over the prose, and there's nothing that feels particularly ridiculous. Alex is by turns human and reassuring, a real hero for our time.<br />Another consistent effort and not bad reading during turbulence.	2002-11-29

Unhappily momentarily out of print, _Crossriggs_ is all kinds of a pleasant surprise. It reads as though you took Austen and crossed it with Louisa May Alcott and threw in a dash of Barbara Pym.<br /><br />This is the story of the Hope girls-- Alexandra, who lives as an old-maid-in-waiting with her eccentric vegetarian father and Mathilda, who moves home to England with her children after being widowed in Canada. Alex is a clever, attractive, independent woman who does what she has to do for other people, and who in the end is forced to figure out what she wants for herself.<br /><br />This was, as the book cover notes, the \\"New Woman\\" of the 1890s, somebody whose redemption can come from something besides relationships. Alex is so real, so full of humor, she would be challenging even for an audience of today.<br /><br />I really loved it, and warmly recommend it.

My copy of the paperback doesn't aim this book at the young adult market explicitly (although the glowing reviews on the back from Philip Pullman and Lloyd Alexander could have given that away) and I must say that I didn't find it particularly young... I found it a dark and powerful book.<br />_Sabriel_ contains a startling original look at magic. The idea of a kind of necromancy controlled by bells is different from anything I've seen before and realized here in a unique way. Sabriel is caught in a world where nothing and noone is as they seem and where she has to fight alone to save her father. Definitely one of the new must-reads in fantasy.	2002-11-06

It is much more a historical romance which takes place in a fantasy setting. The story is about two sisters who are raised to power with very different temperments and ultimately different destinies. One falls in love with a dying priest of the light. The other gets involved with a priest who leads the darker mysteries. They both have their own long road to walk and their own struggles with their constrained society.<br /><br />MZB displays, as usual, her adept touch with female characters. Deoris and Domaris are real, Deoris heart-breakingly real. The world she places around them is detailed and compelling, as are the politics and dynamics of power portrayed in the book.<br /><br />Unfortunately, _The Fall of Atlantis_ lacks the well-balanced plots that make the Darkover novels so wonderful. It really is not much more than a well-written historical romance and lacks the mystery and wonder that characterize the really great fantasies that Bradley has written.	2002-11-04

For all that he longed for Ezzaria in exile, he finds that he chafes under the rigid thinking and the clear distrust he faces among so many of his former people. When he encounters a demon which is not evil (something that his people hold impossible) he is exiled again. This time he is sent into a captivity of the soul rather than one of the flesh.<br /><br />Revelation is a strong follow-up to the extremely promising debut Berg made in Transformation. The world of the Rai-Kirah is vivid and heartbreaking and the ordeal of Seyonne captures the attention and the imagination. I was impressed enough to run out and buy the third book right away, something I almost never do.	2002-11-04

The voice of two people haunted by death are clear to hear in the pages, I had no quarrel with its emotional authenticity. I liked the combination of science fiction and myth and the humor exposed in many of the characters.<br /><br />If I quarreled with it, I quarreled with some of the more dream-like sections-- things went by too fast, or were explained too little. There was too thin of a line between fascination and irritation in that respect.<br /><br />Most of the time I am not a fan of posthumous completions. And I was very wary of somebody \\"finishing\\" work by Zelazny. I was pleasantly surprised. Recommended.	2002-11-01

It is not about history, not really about madness. It is more about the absence of love, or all the spaces that people call love. There is something about frustration or misdirection of desire-- the various things that can masquerade as love.<br /><br />I suppose if this book, for me, was about anything it was about a kind of layer that people have between their feelings and their essential selves. In Stanley that layer was madness. In O'Kane it a kind of avoidance and obtuseness. In Katherine it was a dedication to causes that seems to replace any real awareness of self.<br /><br />So what is well-written about this book? It is smart about people. Smart about history. It is textured and vivid and everything a book should be.<br /><br />So what not to like? It is grotty, somehow. I do not like the picture that it painted of people-- the dirt and the violence. There is no redemption here.	2002-11-01

Aleksander is removed from his throne and Seyonne must once again come to his aid.<br /><br />In the first book of the trilogy, Aleksander's great destiny was the reason Seyonne was drawn to protect him. Berg seemed to have lost the plot a bit on that aspect and the revelations about Aleksander that appear in the last book do not seem significant enough. I had wondered how Berg was going to bring that thread together with the thread about Seyonne as the potential destroyer of his race. The answer was that she did not really try. Too bad.<br /><br />I also did not quite believe in Aleksander's fall-- not the same way that I believed in Seyonne's slavery. Somehow Aleksander did not suffer enough.<br /><br />Still, with whatever flaws, it is a decent ending to what it certainly one of the best new fantasy trilogies in a while. Hope to see more of Berg in the future.	2002-11-01

At the risk of sounding stoned, life *is* rather cluttered, and if an author can manage to portray that without getting confusing, boring or annoying I say more power to him. I also found the flashbacks to Lawrence's childhood and the emotional elements compelling, rather than distracting.<br /><br />Lawrence Newton had a childhood dream of space exploration. When he feels as though he loses his home and family, this dream is the only one he has left and he does not count the moral cost of getting there. When he is sent by Z-B to Thallspring on an Asset Realization trip (Asset Realization being Corporate Piracy being taken to its logical conclusion) Lawrence realizes that perhaps he did not have to lose his soul to accomplish his dreams.<br /><br />I found in Hamilton's vision of the future (as I have before in his writing) a quiet and powerful commentary on the standards and norms of the present. I think that he is a talented writer who consistently works above the normal quality level and that he will eventually be counted as one of the greats of the genre.	2002-10-25

On the one hand, we want to experience it and we want to believe that the experience is real. On the other hand, our own experience and the experience of others around us inclines us to feel as though it is a little bit foolish past the age of 16 to believe *too* much in the idea of enduring passion.<br /><br />Does passion always fade? Do we need to choose relationships at the base of the pyramid of needs-- passionless but sustaining, predictable but safe? Can we ever sustain that passion that we feel at the beginning of a relationship?<br /><br />What Mitchell says (with quiet authority that makes me believe him) is that yes, we can, if we are brave enough to really want that to happen. What he argues is that passion, while desirable, is ultimately quite threatening and that it takes both personal mastery and courage to be willing to let it into your life. Mitchell asserts that it is not romance which is the illusion, it is safety which is the illusion. Romance is the thing which brings the reality of the world to us-- with all its danger and complexity. Safety is a veil which we throw over others potentially close to us to keep them from coming close enough to hurt.<br /><br />Mitchell created a readable book which should appeal to professionals in the field as well as ordinary folk looking for some answers to complicated problems. He builds his arguments carefully using a combination of prior work and original thinking derived from his practice and patients.<br /><br />Very impressive, thought provoking, and blessedly free from overly complicated language.	2002-10-25

Wallander has planned a vacation with the new woman in his life, but his troubles begin when a mysterious girl kills herself in front of him and they continue when notable men start turning up dead and scalped.<br /><br />You know very early on in _Sidetracked_ who did what to whom, the book is not about shocker endings as much as it is about normal police work generating results. One of the nice thing about Wallander as a detective is that his guesses are often wrong-- one of the clear points being made in the book is that the detective job is not about hunches, but about research, people skills, and hard work.<br /><br />A lot of the reviewers have made the comparison with Wahloo, but myself I was brought more to mind of Freeling's Castang mysteries. But a fine book indeed, to be compared with the work of either writer.	2002-10-25

Rider Haggard, Merritt was one of the early avatars of swords & sorcery fantasy novels. He emerged from the pulp magazines of the 50s to write novels which went on to influence a generation after him.<br /><br />_Dwellers in the Mirage_ I found to be a very nice combination of all the things that make early fantasy readable. By turns sly and frightening and full of the high-hat adventure that characterizes speculative fiction of this period.<br /><br />Leif Langdon feels as though he never really belonged in the modern world and this feeling is confirmed when he disappears into a separate society hidden by a natural phenomenon. He feels strangely at home with this lost society and discovers the role that he was meant to play in life.<br /><br />Trainspotters may be interested in noting that Merritt went on sometime after this book to co-author a story with Lovecraft. After reading about the Khalk'ru I am certainly curious who was influencing whom.	2002-10-23

Not drunken and rakishly annoying to women, but fussy and disorganized and at least a little bit thick at times. It takes courage to not give in at the last moment and not make your heros larger than life, and Booth at least has that courage. Unfortunately, the lasting enjoyment of the book may have suffered as a result.<br /><br />I know that I enjoyed the book at the time I read it. It was a quick read and kept me well occupied in a week where I was home sick. My only complaint was that the plot felt a bit overdone, an occupational hazard of the genre. What I notice now that I sit (one week later) to write a review, I found it really difficult to remember who had done what to whom and why.<br /><br />A woman's body is found in a ring of standing stones which legend has it are the remains of Virgins caught dancing on a Sunday and turned to stone. Bound up in the mystery are a woman with a disfigured face found wandering in the same location, a very angry farmer on the brink of ruin, and a missing girl with dreadlocks who nobody seems to be able to identify. Even while still being at odds, Ben Cooper and Diane Fry need to work together to solve the mystery.<br /><br />Dancing with the Virgins would be an excellent book for the beach or for an airplane ride. Just do not expect too much from it.	2002-10-07

In my other reviews of volumes in this novel (I am not going to call it a series, because it really is not-- it is really one long book) I tended to give them four stars. The problem is that when you are reading installments in a larger work, it is difficult to see a particular book as complete and satisfying in its own right. All of the Otherland books suffer a bit from being series installments. They do not really have their own arcs or their own stories to be worked out. It is only in the last book that the reader is really able to see the line of the story.<br /><br />Anyhow, it is a pretty amazing accomplishment, no matter how Williams chose to structure the work. Otherland is an impressive meditation on the virtual reality, the desire to live forever, storytelling and the nature of morality. _The Sea of Silver Light_ is particularly satisfying to read because all the open threads in earlier chapters are finally gathered together into a recognizable pattern and the mysteries are one by one revealed. IMO, the revelations are everything that they should be-- a great combination of simple humanity and technological (& spiritual) mysteries.  Definitely highly recommended.<br /><br />As one reviewer already warned, do not read them out of sequence!	2002-10-07

I was not bothered at all by any of the complaints that other readers have had. I was so sorry when the book ended that I am afraid that I was not able to see any flaws at all. Although I am sure that it must have had them, as books do.<br /><br />This was really my kind of fantasy novel, with all the elements that make me particularly happy. Dart-Thornton took a fairy world and gave a whole new meaning to it-- it will be hard to think about Seelie and unSeelie in the same way ever again after hearing her description of Redcap.<br /><br />It is hard to write any kind of plot description without involving spoilers-- but the story is something about an ugly foundling, something about some perilous journies, and something about very human emotions.<br /><br />Okay, so there were some minor flaws-- it strikes me as I write this that she was a little bit precious in the way she introduced so much of fairy lore, but that is really a tiny complaint.<br /><br />I was genuinely sorry when the book was over, and was very happy to learn that there is already a sequel.	2002-10-07

While Maier spends as much time as he can on the private side of S.I. Newhouse Jr., he in the end focus on what is most seen of this most private of media moguls-- his media properties.<br /><br />Maier uses the device of choosing figures and brands important to Newhouse history (Roy Cohn, Random House, Tina Brown, the New Yorker) and spending a chapter on each one, tracing their history in relation to both Newhouse and Advance Publications. While a good device for giving a thorough overview, be warned that it does make for a slightly disconnected read.  I found that I had to flip back through the chapters to remember how events relating to particular chapters related to each other in time.<br /><br />Nonetheless, one of the more complete media biographies you are likely to encounter and a must read if interested in magazine history.	2002-09-25

The best part of this whole book is that it really happened-- a feat that fictional mysteries can never match.<br /><br />I knew Stoll's work through the more technical article \\"Stalking the Wily Hacker\\" and was pleasantly surprised to see how well Stoll was able to translate the technical side into a book-length narrative. IMO, this is significantly better than other more recent books about computer crime and still worth a read today (both for information and entertainment). Highly recommended.	2002-09-24

It seems to me that what Modesitt has been engaged in during both the Spellsong Cycle and the Recluse Cycle are some extended meditations on different levels about the use of power. To this end, he uses fantasy settings and magic power to make his point.<br /><br />_The Shadow Sorceress_ seems to underline this mission by abruptly removing the character to whom we had become attached in the first three books and replacing her with her young student. It is as though he is pointing out that it is the tapestry and not the thread that matters. Knowing the rest of Modesitt's books, that could very well be the case.<br /><br />The character encounters similar situations with a new set of powers and responsibilities and generally has to hold a complicated kingdom together to the best of her abilities. If it sounds familiar, it should.<br /><br />Perhaps I am giving Modesitt too much credit here, but it is difficult for me to believe that such an obviously talented writer could engage in such a blatent disregard for character and character development unless it were on purpose. Don't know.<br /><br />On the other hand, there's the \\"not enough credit\\" argument. I have been complaining about the exact same points in all the books since book 1, and yet I am still reading the darned things.  As a reader, I *like* character. I was interested in Anna/Secca far more than I was in the fate of Defalk. All the same, I buy and read these as soon as they appear.<br /><br />I know of no current fantasy writer stronger than Modesitt in terms of his ability to make the details real and to make the writing compelling.<br /><br />Anyhow, I will keep reading, and probably also keep complaining.	2002-09-18

He fought there for only nine months before being invalided, but learned enough to understand how little place his vague Bohemian idealism had in such a struggle.<br /><br />Gurney wrote this book long after his experience in the war, based on his memories and diary entries. It is a moving story which looks at the sweetness of idealism and what happens to it in the context of war.

The set up is an interesting one, and the main character Tobin/Tamir is interesting and well-drawn.<br /><br />I reserve the right to up the starrage with later books. I did not give it four stars for two reasons--<br /><br />1)<br />There are elements that this book has in common with other series by other authors. If these things are handled correctly in later books it will not be a problem, but if those elements are handled poorly then they could really drag the books down into cliche.<br /><br />2)<br />I did not like where the book ended-- felt awkward. I tend to think that even as part of a series a book should stand as a book in its own right. For all of its strengths, this one would not stand on its own. It lacked a plot point or quest that defined this particular installment. It left me with the unfortunate feeling that someone decided there were too many pages and decided to cut it short.<br /><br />I am looking forward to the second book in the series, and we will see how the whole thing turns out.	2002-08-16

And so as not to keep you in suspense, let me summarize-- this is not up to the standards of the Talisman. If you're a fan of the book, you may be disappointed. If you aren't, you might want to give this one a try.<br />_Black House_ reads a little bit more like a &quot;typical&quot; King book (Although the quality of a typical King book is higher than most others in the genre) than the Talisman did. There's more horror, less magic, and a direct tie-&iacute;n to the Dark Tower books. This isn't a bad thing, per se, but what I found so striking about the Talisman were its differences.<br />Jack Sawyer is back, and more perfect than ever (one of my major arguments with this book is exactly how perfect Jack turns out to be-- every hero needs a flaw, particularly grown-up heros). He's living in Wisconsin and has forgotten his memories of the painful days in the Territories. He has to accept his past and step up to the plate when a serial killer stalking the area is clearly more (or less) than human.<br />Some points:<br />1. A great read, you can really chew the prose and the descriptions are lovely-- not too Steinbeck at all by my lights.<br />2. Character of Henry is wonderful, outshines Jack himself, which is unfortunate given that Jack is the main character.<br />3. Unconvincing love story centering around Jack. It feels unfocused and unfinished, as though they ran out of pages or creativity when it came time to deal with the Territories part of the story in general.<br />Definitely worth a read, in total.	2002-08-12

The opposite of fastidious and antisocial Wolfe, his farm is a collection of oddballs and drifters and Fox is famous for his inability to turn anybody away. While as smooth and cool in deduction as Wolfe, Fox's weakest links are his less-than-perfect lieutenants.<br /><br />In _Double For Death_ we have a corpse that may or may not be who it appears to be, a girl who keeps being revealed as a liar only to be found to be telling the truth, a detective with a disregard for the finer points of due process, and a man who has many reasons to be murdered.

The painting may or may not be genuine and was painted by an artist who may or may not be dead. Add an addicted daughter, an earnest young man, an aged beauty, a drunken father and a strange cult and you have an Archer mystery.<br /><br />One of the Archer strengths is the way he draws complex characters, rather than complex plots. One of the weaknesses of this book is that the vice is versa. This is one of the most complex Archer plots that I have read. Without the bulk of pages to fill it out, the characters are correspondingly weaker.<br /><br />This is not to say that it lacks entertainment value nor that there are not high points (the character of Fred is noteworthy).

But as I think Graham is saying in the book, everything personal in her life was somehow linked to the paper-- either through her own efforts at its helm or as the wife and daughter of the men who were leading it.<br />I've read a lot of the criticism of this book-- and I know enough about media history to know that at least some of it is fair. At least in the sense that it's accurate. Graham doesn't come out wearing a hair shirt about the real media relationship to people in power. She also has a slightly nervous tone-- the sound of someone who isn't very sure her accomplishments are going to be achieved. But in the end I found that even valid criticisms didn't really interfere with my reading of the book. In the end I was moved by it, and felt honored that Graham was so willing to put herself out there to be observed and judged.<br />In some respects it's difficult to argue that Graham had a difficult life-- she was born to such enormous privilege that she had resources to deal with tragedy that most people can never command. (You hear her refer to her family's 'summer home', but what the means remains opaque until you see the picture!). Even still, Graham is human. To be constantly in the shadow of the people in your life, to see yourself as helpmeet and not a full person, to emerge from that shadow and assert that you have a place in your own right-- that's certainly something that speaks to everyone, regardless of who they are.<br />What I find extraordinary is how revealing the book is about her insecurities. This is a very personal autobiography, and Graham lets you see her weaknesses in a way that I think most public figures would not allow.  I don't agree with many of the positions Graham takes, and certainly she and I are light years apart in almost every aspect of background and experience, but I felt lucky that I was able to read this book. And I was also glad that she wrote it.<br />A book to read, and to give away as a gift.t I was able to read this book.

As noted adequately here, this is the first book in her Children of Violence series-- held by many to be Lessings most important body of work (with the exception of _The Golden Notebook_).<br />I'm one of these Lessing fans from back in the day when _The Golden Notebook_ changed my life, and I haven't read much of her other work. I was impressed by Martha Quest-- it falls in the category of our classic coming-of-age novels, and as such stands well on its own as a novel. Lessing's Martha is at times so frustrating you want to shake her, but I think that's typical for the age of the character portrayed. Martha is all sharp edges-- she can't seem to fit with her parents, the men around her, the people with whom she tries to interact. With the blindness of her age, she's able to acutely feel how hard she has it, without really feeling the struggle of others around her who may have an even more difficult time. By turns infuriating and attractive, it can be painful to read Quest's story precisely because so it's so human as to be disturbingly familiar.<br />A should-read book.	2002-06-30

Martin from his fantasy books. I think he's one of the best fantasy writers currently active-- the series Song of Ice and Fire is one of the best going at the moment. I picked this book up because I was curious to see what his take would be on vampires, and while I don't find that it has all the strength of his fantasy novels (_Fevre Dream_ is a very early novel for Martin) it still doesn't disappoint.<br />_Fevre Dream_ is a historical novel, set in the grand days of the Mississippi steamboat captains.  The experienced but unlucky captain Marsh takes a strange business partner-- Joshua York. York is an intelligent book-reading man who has the unusual habit of sleeping by day.<br />Anticipates the better-known Rice vampire novels in the idea of a vampire at war with its own nature. _Fevre Dream_ is intelligent and well-written-- well worth reading for both established Martin fans and fans of the vampire novel in general.	2002-06-29

After reading Floating Worlds, I had a hard time believing that I had never heard of the book before. It is an intelligent and complex novel of the future which combines elements of technology, politics, and space to create a compelling story. It should rightly have a place next to the more famous works from the period, and I am pleased to see that it has been reprinted.<br /><br />Paula Mendoza is a slightly-more-than-typical inhabitant of the anarchist planet Earth. She becomes even more distinctive when she becomes Earth's representative to the Styths and along the way bears a son to the Styth Prima. She becomes the pin that links the two cultures together as much as two such separate cultures can be linked.<br /><br />Holland's writing is vividly detailed, and the world that she creates for the future is so well imagined that it is disappointing when the book ends. I found the plotting a little but weak in places, but any deficiencies are made up for by the strong characters. I particularly liked the realistic way that she sets up the variations on human stock represented by the Styth.<br /><br />Definitely worth reading.	2002-06-29

Tritten is not nearly as talented as a writer, and his sequels are a sad distortion of the characters. He cakes on religion and sentimentality and uses that as plot. He makes the characters into pious charactatures of their original incarnations.<br />Skip these, unless you're a Spyri scholar.	2002-06-28

He explains the concept, compares the US profiling to other countries, and talks about its applications in marketing. Finally, he provides a breakdown of the 62 PRIZM clusters that existed at the time that the book was written. It may not be the book to learn about the US (but I don't think it's useless in that regard) but it's definitely the book to learn how marketers see the US.	2002-06-28

When humans begin to explore an ancient archive, they accidentally let a very old scourge loose upon the galaxy and only a child marooned on a distant medieval planet close to the slow zone can save the worlds threatened by the being that is released.<br /><br />_A Fire Upon the Deep_ contains some of the best aliens that I've seen in science fiction. They have a complete and full feel and explore both possible differences and similarities in possible sentient races. If there was a flaw for me, it was that the main character-- a human information manager named Ravna, was significantly less well-developed than the fanciful races that surround her. Perhaps its a minor thing to complain about, but it felt a little strange to me how opaque she seemed, given how important she was to the rest of the book.<br /><br />Deserves the praise that it has received.	2002-06-28

Dessauer breaks his book into 7 major chapters: Publishing History, Creation of Books, Manufacture of Books, Marketing of Books, Storage and Delivery of Books, and Management Issues of Publishers.<br />He does a very good job of balancing the content, so that you feel as a reader that you get a reasonably comprehensive look at all the aspects of publishing, without going into too much depth. The book also provides an excellent glossary and well-constructed index.<br />The only trouble with the book is that some of the areas that (for me) were the most interesting (figures about the current book-buying population and habits, etc.) were also the ones that were most vulnerable to being out-of-date. While the book is in a new edition, the facts and figures still seem to date back to the late 1980s. It was a little bit frustrating when I didn't know how useful a particular interesting fact might be.<br />Recommended strongly for people who want to get a feel for the industry.	2002-06-27

I'd had this book recommended to me as a good one with which to begin to understand Feng Shui. While I will agree that aspects of it were clear and full of practical application (the examples of room layouts, etc.), in general I found the book to be poorly organized and certainly not enough in and of itself to gain a basic understanding of Feng Shui.<br />I found that I learned enough to be interested further, and got some practical advice about furniture placement. Not where I would send a beginner, however.	2002-06-27

Peekay, with a natural gift for language, uses what he learns from a Zulu wise man to go on to succeed at both academics and boxing.<br /><br />I was entranced as a reader for most of the book, so the problem is not with its readability. The way that Courtenay describes South Africa is compelling and vivid, and it's hard not be by attracted to Peekay and his world.<br /><br />I think that the problem with the book is that nothing is ever really a challenge for Peekay. He harnesses the Power of One so effectively that everything he does is graceful and accurate and ultimately successful. By the end of the book, I hardly cared about what happened because I didn't believe that there would be any surprises (and despite a gimmicky ending that ties everything together, there weren't surprises). Peekay essentially didn't have any conflict, and that made it in the end uninteresting.<br /><br />It's still a good read for people who like the standard melodrama combined with some really well-written atmosphere. I'll probably pick up something else by Courtenay if I can find it to see if I like it better. If you like a good Marty Stu character, then this is the book for you.	2002-06-15

I understand his importance to the genre, and when he's at what I think of at his best, then I can enjoy his novels. But he isn't really to my taste, so consider that a fair disclosure of bias.<br />_One Lonely Night_ tells the story of Hammer, returning angry and bitter from a trial where he is excoriated for \\"knocking off somebody who needed knocking off bad\\". Hammer is shaken and wonders if the judge's view of him is really true and accurate, whether he really is such a bad guy. While in the midst of this reverie, Hammer runs across a girl being chased by a bad man. He kills the bad man, but fails to save the girl as she jumps to her death rather than be part of whatever it was she was involved in. Naturally, Spillane gets involved, and as the plot expands to threaten his beautiful Vera, he gets very involved indeed.<br />The book seems like it's thumbing its nose at critics who accuse Hammer of being too violent. He has to be violent, it seems to say, the world is a dangerous place and violence and vigilence go hand-in-hand.<br />This book contains much of what I dislike most about Spillane's writing-- the simple black and white approach to good and evil, the obsession with the communist conspiracy, and stupid society dames who get messed up in the wrong element and don't deserve to live.<br />To be fair, many people find this one of Spillane's best works, but I really prefer the more crime-oriented Hammer books such as _Kiss Me, Deadly_.	2002-06-14

Merci lost her last partner when she filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against him and wastes no time in putting Hess in his place. Together they need to find a nasty serial killer that the news is calling \\"The Purse Snatcher\\" for his habit of leaving the purses behind.<br />There's nothing terribly new in _The Blue Hour_ but it's both well-written and entertaining. Merci Rayborn seems like a wonderful character with whom to go forward into a series.	2002-06-14

And even this last book shows the clever and realistic feel for politics that made the series so interesting.

Mannix draws from his extensive carnie experience to create a tender and even sweet look at people who were not like others around them. Mannix is clearly fueled by anger that political correctness has deprived these people of their means of earning a living and forced them into institutions. It is a way of thinking that I had not encountered before this book. He covers giants, midgets, people with parasitic twins, hermaphrodites, fat people, wild people and many others-- telling stories and anecdotes of his time on the road. Well worth the time.	2002-06-14

Towards the end, however, it became a very sad book-- more about the death of empire and the passing of an age than anything else. There was something so majestic in the final moments that I was willing to forgive its other sins and excesses, grievous though they were.<br />Ghote is summoned from Bombay to solve a murder at the Ooty Club-- the last bastion of colonial India.

Times Dynasty	Books	5	7	8	N	Y	That Rarest of Things-- a really readable business biography	_Priveleged Son_ manages to hit that sweet spot that so many biographies of business figures fail to capture-- it manages to be a very good look at a business and industry and at the same time be readable and enjoyable on the level of a novel.<br />While ostensibly a biography of Otis Chandler, it gives a fascinating look at the rise of a newspaper as local empire and the same newspaper's (largely unsuccessful) efforts to translate that into a truly national business.<br />Without any industry focus, the story of the Chandlers and their relationship to LA is the stuff of novels (pulp fiction and true romance)-- LA grows up with its paper in this book.<br />I was particularly fascinated to read what happened at the paper under the direction of Mark &quot;Cereal Killer&quot; Willes. His ill-starred management is a cautionary tale for would-be media moguls who fail to understand the core values that make up the news industry.<br />A great read for people interested in the media industry.

I've seen the film multiple times and I know a bit about the history of the novel. _Gone With the Wind_ sold more than 1,000,000 copies in the six months after it was released in 1936, and a year later Mitchell was awarded the Pulitzer prize for her effort. It's certainly one of the best-loved books of our century, with fans ranging from feminists who are trying to reclaim Scarlett to groups like the United Daughters of the Confederacy.<br />So when I picked up the book, my biggest question was whether or not it was worth so much fuss and adoration. I suppose that my answer has to be 'yes'. Mitchell's writing style is occasionally uneven and it took me 50 pages to get used to her diction, but the story is so sweeping and the characters so well-realized that all concerns about style and tone were lost in the experience of the book.<br />In many ways, I found the book a much stronger story than emerges in the film. Unhampered by censorship, the world that Scarlett moves in in the book is much uglier than the one in the film-- painful miscarriages, brothels, wounds and poverty fill Mitchell's picture of the post-war south and make Scarlett's character much stronger and much less petulant than she emerges in the film.<br />Although daunting in length, I found that the pages literally flew by, and I was sorry in the end when the story closed. Definitely a 'should read'.	2002-06-14

In the middle of New Crobuzon is a love story-- an eccentric human ex-professor named Isaac in the midst of a very transgressive affair with the Khepri artist Lin. Khepri women look like oddly colored humand, with the exception of their heads, which are the bodies of giant beetles. Khepri create art by chewing and spitting colored material to form sculpture.<br />Isaac begins an experiment to put the wings back on a creature who had been punished by having its wings removed, and in the process he unintentionally releases a horror called Slake-Moths on the world. Lin and Isaac must somehow find a way to make things right before the Slake-Moths bring New Crobuzon crashing down around them.<br />_Perdido Street Station_ is a wonderfully complex novel in its atmosphere and detail. Certainly it's one of the best efforts I've read in books that try to detail a decadent future after centuries of the kinds of changes that science can now enact on the world-- it's a book of transformations and the effort for transformed beings to live in the same space. It weaves elements of fantasy with science fiction and ends up in a genre space uniquely its own.<br />Unfortunately, the story is not up to the world around it. While the 800+ pages support this magnificent world, the plot points often seem strangely hackneyed, with pointless action scenes that go on and on and a story that always seems halfway ready to emerge. I cared about the action far less than I cared about the world around it-- not a good thing in a novel.<br />Still, a book of tremendous strength and I will carefully follow this author in the future.	2002-06-14

Hinton was all the rage to read in my high school and I was seriously attached to Ponyboy and Sodapop and the rest. Like many another teenage girl smitten by Ralph Macchio, I memorized the Robert Frost poem and cried buckets at the end of the book.<br />It's funny to me to hear recent reviewers discussing the book in terms of its relationship to gangs, because I don't see it as being about rival factions. Instead, I see it more as a meditation on the price of having an inside and an outside to any given social context. At the time the book was written, it was the socs and the greasers. At my high school it was the Jocks and the Beegs. It's about people being judged by their clothes and their family rather than their abilities and their desires.<br />Hinton's book stands up well to time-- I'm a lot more cynical than I was as a child and I couldn't summon tears anymore for the characters, but reading it I could still revisit the concerns that I had at the time and the world that this book represented.<br />A good gift for young teenagers.	2002-06-14

According to the introduction of the book, this question was found after Forster's death scribbled by him on the cover of the 1960 typescript version of the novel. I think that while the answer for the reader has to be 'yes', it is also easy to see why Forster had his doubts.<br />The book was an intensely personal one for Forster, as it addresses the issue of homosexuality in the context of the early 20th century. Because of its subject matter, it was not published after it was written (1914) and Forster went on to significantly rewrite the book at different periods throughout his life. Although by the time of the last rewrite (1959-1960) Forster could have published the book in terms of its subject matter, he was not satisfied with the work itself. According to his biographers, he found it dated and had never been satisfied with the ending.<br />_Maurice_ tells the story of a conformist young man who finds himself increasingly attracted to his own sex. He moves from a disasterous relationship with an undergraduate friend to a more adult affair which finally causes him to break from the rules that he understood all his life.<br />While the book is historically fascinating, and actually quite emotionally affecting (Maurice is perhaps one of the fullest characters in Forster's novels) it suffers from its history of revision and uncertainly. There's a hesitance in the writing and a strangely jumpy character to many of the plot points. It doesn't make it less worth reading, but perhaps less perfect than some of Forster's other efforts.	2002-06-14

Suddenly Merry's cover is blown and she's forced to deal with her loving family once again.<br />Hamilton makes this concept of faerie more believable than you have a right to expect-- she's a slick writer and you won't have any complaints about the diction or style.	2002-06-14

However, I found that the strange sex was layered on a bit too heavily in places-- and it wasn't terribly necessary to the plot, IMO.<br />The best things about this book (loss, sadness, fear of aging, imaginary worlds) could have stood on their own without the explicit nature of the orgies. It also felt as though Barker got confused with the ghost portion of the story because there seemed to be too many plot holes and inconsistencies where the ghosts were concerned.<br />Still, the best author still writing in the horror genre, I think.	2002-05-25

At its heart, it tells the story of the effect that a child's death has had on a marriage, and all the ways that people try to cope with and understand what happened. Jack and Fanny and Rosalie are sad and wise and believable, as are the landscapes they move in (both physical and emotional).<br />For me, what limited the novel was the whodunnit aspect of the disappearance of Janice Tanner. While I understand how Busch tried to build it into the emotional plot, and while I think that the effect on Jack of her disappearance was a believable way to trigger the events of the story, I was disappointed with its eventual resolution and the neat way that the questions of guilt that it raised tied into Jack's own marriage. The completeness of the story felt contrived, as Jack seemed to me the sort of character who is never really complete.<br />I picked up the book in a fairly random way, and am glad that I did. I grew up in upstate New York, and Busch captured the atmosphere in a way that made the time to read the book worth it for that alone. I'll probably read more Busch as I come across it, but I think that the next time I will go for the short stories, as the best part of this novel was the part that I thought of as a very good short story.	2002-05-07

The book centers around a kind of onion made out of games-- there are layers and layers and layers of words and rules and logical puzzles. Think of it as a kind of homage to Lewis Carroll.<br />This said, I wish the plot had been as strong. I guessed the baddie very early on, and was unhappy with the ending, which felt gimmicky and out of place for a Dalziel and Pascoe book. Not my favorite Hill, although with a little better villain, perhaps it would have been.	2002-05-07

It seems to me that science fiction often says a great deal about the collective fantasies and fears of the generation that spawned it-- I enjoyed reading _The Godwhale_ (which I read for the first time now), but found some of the more obvious political points about environmentalism, entertainment, and overpopulation to be a little bit grating.<br /><br />_The Godwhale_ tells the story of a young man named Larry Dever who is put into Temporary Suspension when he's cut in half in a youthful prank. The idea is that he will be revived when science has caught up to the need of his physical problem. He's revived once, but isn't satisfied with the level of care he will receive, and when he's revived a second time he's revived into a hellish hive world where humans have overpopulated the globe at the expense of everything else and the population has devolved into helpless nebbishes of limited physical strength and form.<br /><br />I was oddly reminded of Steven Spielberg's AI when I read the book-- perhaps because of the ultimate darkness of both stories combined with the length of time portrayed.	2002-05-07

I found _American Gods_ to be one of the best fantasy books I've read this year and I must admit that I was a little surprised to see so many negative reviews here. The book does meander, but I found the little plot cul-de-sacs really worth the effort they took to read-- it's a book about a kind of giant road trip, after all.<br />Shadow is to be released from prison after a term with model behaviour, and he has every intention of going back to his loving wife Laura. But when she's killed days before he's supposed to get out-- his trip back becomes very different than the one he'd been waiting for. Instead of finding the America he left when he went into prison, he instead finds an America where the Gods walk the earth, people pull coins from the air, and the dead fail to stay that way.<br />I love (and have always loved) mythology, so perhaps a part of why I loved every bit of the book as much as I did were all the references to the different Gods and Goddesses and their major characteristics. I had the feeling that Gaiman really loves his subject matter, and since I share that love, I was never bored.	2002-04-26

The book opens with a The Shot Heard 'Round the World from the 1951 Giants/Dodger's game. It ends with a nun finding peace and connection inside the Internet. In between it takes the reader through a flashing array of persons, places and events-- an array that defies description, I think.<br />In a way, the book focuses on Nick Shay and his relationship with Klara Sax, and what happened as a result of that relationship. In a way, it's about art, particularly art in our modern era. In a way, it's about the journey of the baseball from the 1951 to Nick through all the stops on its passage. In a way, it's about goodness, and cities, and nuns moving through the urban badlands looking for stray children.  It's also about garbage, and everything about garbage disposal.<br />_Underworld_ is a big book, one that's been sitting on my shelf for far too long because I was a little bit afraid of something that long, but the reading experience itself never felt too heavy-- none of the pages felt unnecessary. I learned things from this book-- I was moved, and I often found it sweet. It inspired a kind of sadness, but not unpleasantly.<br />A must-read, I think.	2002-04-26

Her books are always a pleasure to read, and a pleasure that I would be sincerely sorry to miss.<br /><br />At the moment of the death of her husband, Gertrude is reunited with her best friend from University-- Anne. Anne and Gertrude had been separated when Anne had joined the nunnery, and it is this occasion of great loss for both of them (Anne has lost the solace of the nunnery) that brings them together. Nuns and Soldiers questions both the notion of great love and the morality of the expression of love.<br /><br />My book club was not overly fond of Nuns and Soldiers because they found the character of Gertrude so utterly unsympathetic. I must admit that she is truly atypical for Murdoch-- her feminine passivity and self-centeredness are not normal characteristics for Murdoch characters. However, her traits make her a good fit for the novel, even if she would make a grating person to know in real life.<br /><br />Like most Murdoch novels, this is one that I would recommend.	2002-04-09

Book could *definitely* do a better job of specifying which of its sections are relevant to Digital TV in general, and which are relevant to Interactive Television in specific. You do need to understand digital tv to understand the technical issues behind Interactive Television, but that should be made clear(er) by the editor.<br />This said, Whitaker does a good job of putting together enough information so that if you have enough media/technical background, you should be able to discuss iTV issues with some facility.<br />The book is divided into chapters written by separate authors, with each chapter having its own references and bibliography appended. Chapters include:<br />-The Promise of Interactive Television<br />-Video and Audio Compression<br />-Program and System Information Protocol<br />-The DVB System<br />-Standardization Issues<br />-Metadata Management<br />-Internet and TV Convergence<br />-Content Distribution<br />-PC-Based Receivers<br />-Interactive Videoconferencing<br />Honestly, for me the book was a little bit heavy on the digital television technical stuff and a little bit light on the possible business models and applications.

A strange group of characters gather on a forbidden world to watch and experience the effects of a dying planet.

They are developed enough to be interesting, but not enough to be even. It is not your run of the mill science fiction novel, and doesn't shy away from some fairly explicit sexuality and violence.<br />If you can find a copy of this book, I do recommend a read.

The book covers elements of success, practical tips for making it work, and some case studies.<br />What I find missing is the question &quot;Should I reengineer?&quot;. (The answer, I think, isn't always 'yes'.) It would be *most* useful if it first helped managers make sure that reengineering really is a Good and Necessary Thing, given the pain it inevitably causes a corporation. There's also a little bit of a sense that nay-sayers shouldn't be tolerated at all, and I find that a little bit short-sighted.<br />Nice to have for managers and consultants.	2002-04-04

But since all he knows are rock songs from our western world, his results are occasionally unpredicatable.<br />In this book, Jon-Tom has to go searching for medicine for his mentor Clothahump. On the way he picks up a 7-foot high white tiger, his irascable companion Mudge, and a teenage street kid named Folly. Hilarity and mayhem ensues.<br />The spellsinger books are light on the realism and heavy on the humor. Note that many of the jokes are dependent on knowing pop culture from the 80s. I laughed at the Def Leppard jokes. Current teens may not get them.	2002-04-04

Castang believes that she has something to be afraid of, but there isn't anything the police can do for her, since nothing had yet happened.<br />Her death finally allows Castang to take action, as her case becomes his first fully-fledged homicide inquiry.<br />One of the things that Freeling does best is explore the uncertainties and games that underlie middle-class European life. His look at the tiny French town of Soulay is a masterful example of this talent. One of the best Castang books (although I still prefer the Van Der Valk series).	2002-03-28

This is the novel that 7th grade English teachers across the US recommend to teach children the value of books-- I guess that that fact alone earns it a star.<br />Bradbury creates a vision of a world where Firemen burn books when they're found instead of putting out fires. People have wall-sized interactive television which has taken the place of family life. Teenagers are encouraged to drive as quickly as possible when bored, and bearing children is officially nearly forbidden. One fireman, spurred on by a non-conformist neighbor, begins to question his task and becomes alive to the value in books.<br />While some of the messages certainly are still relevant, the book is not as strong of an effort of other Bradbury novels. The tone and the heavy message focus date the book and tend to say more to someone interested in the concerns of the 50s then they really appeal to modern readers.<br />Difficult not to recommend, all things considered, but don't expect too much.	2002-03-28

Having seen several of the women anthologized here perform live, it was a treat to read *some* of the pieces again.<br />I say some of the pieces because not all of them have aged well, and not all of them were very strong to begin with. Karen Finley is always a pleasure to read, as is Laurie Anderson, but the Anderson piece was far too short. I also found the Hughes piece strong, and I also enjoyed the Leeny Sack-- but in the rest of the book I found the selections either not the quality I know that artist(s) can produce, or seemed to be people whose work was not to my taste from the beginning.<br />I suspect that much of what's contained here isn't anthologized anywhere else, so if your interest lies in this direction, it's still a good book to buy. My rating reflects the unevenness of the selections rather than the value of the book itself.	2002-03-19

When the government finally topples, the whores and clients work together to take their impersonations out of the bedroom and restore order by assuming the identities of the great figures who they used to play in bed.<br />Sartre referred to Genet as the prototype of the existential man, whose past as a convicted felon and his subsequent literary career illustrated a life where personal choice drove the moral distinctions. I have read an been absorbed by a number of Genet's works, my favorites being _Our Lady of the Flowers_ and _The Maids_. While I don't believe that _The Balcony_ is up to the level of either of those works, it's an important piece of the history of the theater of the absurd.<br />Worth reading.

It is also the first of the Foundation books that was written as a single book; the others were originally written and published as a series of short stories. When the Asimov's publisher asked for a new Foundation book, he jumped at a chance to finally make a fully developed book out of the theme.<br />Given these facts, it's not surprising that there's some fairly significant differences between the thematic focus and tone of _Foundation's Edge_ and the three novels preceding it. I think this accounts for some of the dismay from fans of the trilogy and the feeling that Asimov somehow stopped fighting the good fight.<br />The Seldon plan still plays an important role, but it is no longer the backbone of the story as it was in the trilogy. Instead, Asimov takes the opportunity to tie together the Robot and Foundation universes, creating a meditation on autonomy and government styles that asks a number of questions about strategic choices and also asks about the relationship between governed and the governors. When the warlike first Foundation sends a troublesome politician in search of the manipulative second Foundation, every party finds more than they bargained for when they reach the planet Gaia.<br />I *liked* _Foundation's Edge_ although I would agree that it doesn't reach the heights of the trilogy itself-- it has a number of weaknesses (the lame explanation of the Mule's origins, for one) and doesn't feel as important somehow. But the original trilogy was a darned difficult act to follow, true?	2002-03-14

She uses the experience of ExEx, a kind of super virtual reality, to dig out the link.<br />I generally really appreciate Priest's writing, and was actually surprised by how much I didn't like _The Extremes_. While I found the setup to be an interesting one, I never gained much interest in or sympathy for Teresa and found the character development in general to be weak. Moreover, the resolution (if you want to call it that) was overly complicated and went farther towards satisfying the author's interest in playing with ideas of Reality (explored much better in his other novels) than it did towards providing a decent ending for this novel.<br />Worth a read if you can get it from the library, but otherwise I'd take a miss.	2002-03-12

First the Mule goes searching for it, and then in the post-Mule era the people of Foundation search for a way to escape its influence.<br />For me, this was the weakest of the three books, not the best note on which to end a trilogy. I think that the character of Arkady herself was an influencer in my opinion-- she seemed a pale shadow of Bayta Darrell (her illustrious grandmother from the second book) and I found her annoying rather than captivating. But that's a taste thing, and it's still Asimov, which is generally enough said to make a good review.	2002-03-06

The formula which they repeat throughout the book (Core Values = Core Ideology + Purpose) is worth repeating more often, and something that anyone who concerns themselves with strategy should remember.<br />One of the things I think _Built to Last_ does particularly well is to not only explain what their ideas are, but to also explain what they aren't. They seem to understand the confusion possible in their ideas and take the time to anticipate, correct, and clarify.

It is nearly impossible not to admire it as an achievement-- the richness of the detail is astonishing as is the mood that the detail manages to create. We follow a family through three generations as they try to negotiate identity in both the colonial and post-colonial worlds.<br />Unfortunately, the structure and characterization in the novel do not live up to the quality of the historic and atmospheric detail. The book follows a fairly standard rags-to-riches story format, and in many cases the characters lack the complexity that Ghosh is able to bring to the surrounding environment. It's a disappointing lack in an otherwise stunning work.<br />It's worth saying as well that I found _The Glass Palace_ an incredibly *satisfying* read. I literally had a really hard time putting it down, and kept it in my purse to read on my lunch breaks and while waiting in lines. I suppose that's a fairly high recommendation in and of itself.	2002-03-06

The most known aspect of the second book however, is the idea that psychohistory is limited in that it is not able to predict aspects caused by wild chance-- and in this second Foundation book, wild chance threatens Foundation in the person of a powerful mutant called the Mule.<br />Well-written, as Asimov always is.	2002-02-05

Because this planet has a very strict matriarchal society, Cendri poses as the master scholar while Dal is relegated to the role of her possession and assistant. They are nominally there to study what may be ruins from the race that seeded the galaxy, but while there they find that their own assumptions about gender and power are called heavily into question.<br />I'd like to stress that this isn't a bad book, and MZB completists will certainly not regret reading it, but the ideas that are sketched out here are developed more fully and with much more grace in both the Darkover and Avalon books. The gender politics come over a little bit too heavy-handed and occasionally make it difficult to focus on the plot.	2002-02-05

Mr. Gray is a fascinating character, and the battle between he and Jonesy is really good stuff.<br />I think that King has his work cut out for him in that the standard of his early work was so high, we're judging his new books against nearly impossible to reach standards. It's a compliment to the overall quality of its work, but it must be tough being your own hard act to follow.	2002-02-03

I know that I got around to reading this book rather late in the day, but I'm here to tell you that it's worth reading no matter what time it is. The computer revolution is important in so many spheres of our life-- it's history that's relevant to business, politics, and culture. This book looks at some of the roots of these crucial changes and sets the scene for our current environment.<br />Happily, it does this scene-setting in a very well-written and engaging manner-- effectively characterizing both groups and individuals in a way that keeps the pages turning. Definitely one to buy, whether or not you're a programmer.	2002-02-03

The stuff in here should be enough to make any investor nervous. This said, I got the feeling that Kurtz ran out of the really interesting stuff somewhere about a third of the way through the book and even though he increases the pace of the events in an effort to make it sound interesting, I found myself getting bored.<br />Ultimately, I didn't really learn anything new-- not about the media, not really about Wall Street-- a little bit about CNNfn, but I'm not so sure that I needed to know that. It isn't a bad read if you've got nothing better to do, but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it.	2002-02-03

It may even have been her first published book.<br />Kate Brannigan agrees to search for a missing songwriter as a favor to a fading rock star who wants to revitalize his career. She finds her, but the consequence of the discovery is murder...<br />_Dead Beat_ is an inconsistent novel-- with a lot of the brilliant flashes that will show up later in McDermid's writing, but also with a lot of strange and stiff formula writing and some fairly strained plot devices. The role of the police is unbelievable, to say the least, and Brannigan herself acts in some fairly odd and unmotivated ways. It's still worth a read because it sets the basis of the character, who I'm willing to bet gets better in later books.	2002-02-03

The interviews are broken into six periods-- Sirk's German Theater period; the German film period; the exile years in Switzerland, France and Holland; his two American periods and finally the time after his biggest Hollywood successes.<br />Sirk is a tremendously important cinema director, and the interviews give a lot of clarity to his history and how he went about choosing the subject matter that he did. Halliday also provides a brief biographical introduction and a biofilmography and Sirk bibliography. A must-have for cinephiles and fans of Douglas Sirk.	2002-02-03

This one is a keeper.<br />_My Sister Mike_, written in the early sixties, is a young adult romance which features the adventures of a athletic young basketball playing girl nick-named Mike, who suffers from having a younger, attractive cheerleading sister. Mike determines to make herself more feminine when she discovers that her date with her dream boy was engineered as part of a hazing so that he could join an exclusive club. With the help of her sister, Mike learns to remake herself a bit and hold boys' attention while still being her athletic self.<br />I'll own that the message in the book is perhaps not the best one for young girls, but it's certainly a better message than most of the books of its era. I read it when I was around ten, and haven't touched it since that time, but in re-reading it I found that it had made a powerful impression. I discovered that I could recite sentences nearly verbatim and I realized how much of this book had stayed with me over time. So the least that can be said of it was that it certainly engaged a young girl's interest. As an adult, I found it far better written than most of its genre and it was still a quick and entertaining read. It's also a decent look at a period where ideas about being a woman were about to go into rapid transition, and the tension of the early sixties was evident behind the text.	2002-02-02

The word 'classic' isn't one that should be thrown around lightly, but I think that it's safe to say that _A Princess of Mars_ meets all the criteria of a classic. This book was the start of a series which defined what science fiction has since become and is very readable and enjoyable apart from its historic significance.<br />Some of the best naming of all time goes on here-- Dejah Thoris and Tars Tarkas and Barsoom-- the adventures of an adventurer, pulled into another world and made a part of its life. Featuring gravity differences and BIG green men and nearly-naked girls, there's something for nearly anyone.	2002-02-02

Aliens have invaded the earth, but instead of using weapons to take control, they're using commerce.<br />Full of many of the standard Simak elements-- friendly aliens in odd shapes, journalists, philosophical musing and old-timey assistants. Perhaps not his best book, but I have to agree with the reviewer who said that he didn't think Simak was capable with writing a bad book.	2002-02-02

The entire trilogy was written in nine stories which were completed in the period between 1941 and 1951.  Asimov notes himself in the foreword that part of what he intended with the fourth book _Foundation's Edge_ was to have a chance to write an actual Foundation novel.<br />I actually like the effect that the story-based approach gives, particularly considering that Foundation is meant to be covering the fall of galactic empire and the rise of a new power. Having chapters based on discrete periods, I think the reader gets a better sense of the sheer time involved in politics than any 9000 -page space opera could ever achieve.<br />One of the things I like about Foundation and its subsequent other parts is that it isn't an action-packed adventure. There isn't high romance. It isn't really about individual heartache and success, although the role of the individual is important. It's a meditative look at both politics and the future, and a darned sharp one at that.<br />An excellent read, even worth the time for people who don't think that they like science fiction.	2002-02-02

Flavia is pulled against her wishes (and against much advice) into the disappearance of a painting borrowed from the Louvre.

Okay, the book is repetitive and occasionally cloying (the 'love letters' are a little bit hilarious) but I have to say that when I look back at former relationships, there were arguments that could have been scripted from the pages of this book. Of course, it isn't going to apply to all individuals, nor do I think that it pretends to do so. I've found that by making some of the suggested adjustments, I really do get better results in dealing with men. Ultimately, that's the best testimonial that I can give.	2002-02-01

Lerner addresses many different varieties of anger in aid of helping the reader to constructively place and channel the anger in their lives. It is smart, but clear, with interesting examples that keep the reader turning the pages-- even when the case studies discussed don't apply to them.	2002-02-01

And I understand that to understand the dietary and health theories behind Macrobiotics, it's important to understand the philosophical basis. However, the way this book is structured, I found it quite frustrating to read, and I honestly failed to follow many of the connections that it was trying to make between the philosophical systems and eating issues.<br />I'm not giving up on the subject matter completely, but I suspect that this was not the place to begin.

The characters are vivid and detailed, there's a great deal of rich local scenery, and the plot doesn't disappoint in terms of either mystery or police procedure. A definite read for Freeling fans and not a bad place to begin if you're new to the Castang books.	2002-01-28

When after a series of frightening pranks and a stint as the Christmas Druid, Alfred Moult goes missing, Troy's husband Roderick is called in to see if murder is at hand.<br />While perhaps not exceptional (the situation is a bit overdone, and it's rather easy to guess the killer) _Tied up In Tinsel_ is a typically well-written Marsh mystery.

I came away with many things after I was done. The detailed way in which Franklin covers his material (what material he does cover in the broken narrative) must be a delight for historians. Moreover, I found that Franklin's personality shone so strongly through the text that I had to laugh out loud on several occasions.<br />I gave the book four stars because I found that the other writings included were a bit stingy. Some were so delightful (&quot;Advice to a Friend on Choosing a Mistress&quot;) and the period that's not covered by the autobiography is so large, that I think a wider selection would have been helpful.	2002-01-28

What I really like about this book is that it never gives into the temptation to take itself too seriously. Mitford draws a great deal of both pathos and humor into her portrait of Grace-- a lovely but not terribly clever woman.<br />When Grace marries Charles-Edouard she doesn't carefully consider what it means to be marrying into Paris society. She doesn't carefully consider anything at all. A war bride with a young child, she's bundled off to Paris after her hardly-seen husband returns from fighting. Charles-Edouard has a flexible set of ideas about fidelity; her son decides he'd be better off with divorced parents; and nobody in Paris considers them married since they didn't formalize their union in a church.<br />The book suffers somewhat from a meandering form, but the writing sparkles with wit and life.	2002-01-09

Durrell is drawn into the conflict around Cypriot independence and is forced to examine his position  as expatriot in a troubled environment.<br />The initial chapters of the book are so lovely and the scenes sketched so charming, that something in the reader rebels when the book turns its attention to the problem of terrorism and the echos of violence. That very quality, of course, is what lifts the book above the average travel book as it creates a Cyprus for the reader than is far more real-- not just a utopian garden existing somewhere far, far away for the weary reader to someday visit.	2002-01-09

She breaks things down into logos and mythos and makes the clear point that \\"Rational thought has achieved astonishing success in the practical sphere, but it cannot assuage our sorrow.\\" She successfully challenges the notion of fundamentalists as wild-eyed radicals even as she makes the clear point that there needs to be a separation between religion and violence.<br />In two parts, she introduces the issue of religious fundamentalism as seen in Judaism, Islam, and Christianity. The first part of the book introduces the history per religious group while the second part of the book traces the struggles and successes of fundamentalism in modern times.<br />_The Battle for God_ is lucid and richly annotated. I complain only that the book zooms past an amazing amount of historical detail and assumes that you either know or are going to remember it all-- not something you can read with half a brain. The glossary of terms is an invaluable aid-- invoke it when you read!

The boy disappeared into the mists of high school, but I've still got the book. I recently decided to re-read it when I ran across it in the bottom of a box, and am certainly glad that I did.<br />John Carter faces a multitude of foes in order to rescue his granddaughter Llana of Gathol. From the corpses that don't know they're dead, to the brutal army of Hin Abtol, John Carter and Pan Dan Chee (Llana's loyal suitor) struggle against impossible odds to win the day.<br />Contains all of the elements that make the Mars series great-- I enjoyed it at 13 and again at significantly older than that.	2001-12-28

I'm apparently missing something here-- or perhaps if I'd read the earlier books I'd feel more loyal and then be more forgiving. Or I might just be the wrong audience.<br />In any case, I found _Tracking Time_ tiresome even for airplane reading. I thought the plot was contrived, the characters quite thin (particularly the monsterous parents who were clearly set up to &quot;deserve&quot; the children they got), and I didn't find April Woo particularly compelling as a heroine.<br />I could see that the writing was fluent, and Glass seems to have a good feel for police procedure, so perhaps it really is just that it hit the wrong notes for my taste. You be the judge.	2001-12-28

I loved the first few books in the Burke series-- found them taut and edgy, dark and smart. Lately though I had the feeling that the medium had gotten lost in the message and I'd found the books harder and harder to read.<br />_Dead and Gone_ takes Burke in a new direction and takes a little bit of the crusading hero out of my favorite anti-hero. The death of Pansy and his new face force him in a new direction and into the reach of new characters in a different part of the country. I liked the character of Gem (even if I'm a little jealous of every other woman in Burke's life :)) and I found Burke a lot more interesting this time around.<br />It isn't perfect, and the plot ends up feeling a bit contrived, particularly at the end. But the mood is pretty close to right on, and that's what I read Vachss' novels for anyhow.	2001-12-28

Trapped in a wheelchair by polio, she's jealous of every aspect of his life and rules the house through her force of personality. When his pretty and simple cousin Janet comes to live with them after her parents are killed in a car wreck, Richard learns that there's an entirely different way to fear Caroline when it becomes clear to everyone that he's falling in love with Janet.<br />A dark and atmospheric mystery, more about the potential for violence than violence itself.	2001-12-26

Modesitt is almost always an entertaining writer-- this is no exception. His books are adept at introducing realism into fantasy, the characters worry about unions and logistics and politics more than they do evil and magic and that is one of the things that I very much like about his writing. I liked this book for the very same reasons.<br />As a series entry, however, _Darksong Rising_ is oddly lacking. We see no character development from Anna and no real continuation of the older more interesting threads (Seers of Wei, for instance)and seemingly nothing new is introduced to be picked up later. It's as though Modesitt had to turn out a new installment for the publishers, but hadn't quite figured out where he needs to take his little fantasy-based political experiment. There are some interesting questions raised here (as in the others of the series) about cultural change, appropriate use of power, and political systems but I think that in order to keep the readers' attention Modesitt is going to have to come up with an equally interesting plot direction.	2001-12-26

She comes to live with him in his mother's home-- a big old house full of the sense of the past. Betsy and Phil become caught up in a story that began long ago as lurkers appear by the well on the property, and strange little trinkets seem to take on a life of their own.<br />_The Rainy Season_ is an affecting and atmospheric novel which succeeds in carrying a mood of sadness and history from beginning to end. This is my second Blaylock, and he's clearly a talented writer-- I think 'evocative' captures his writing best as a word, regardless of how the tone differs from book to book. I have had a problem with both of his books so far in that I found them both a bit slight-- I'm not able to easily define why-- somehow lacking in contours or contrasts. Still definitely worth reading if you're a fan of the more gentle variety of ghost story.	2001-12-26

It feels a bit like an afterthought and many of the aspects that make Coffin books so good (relationship with Stella, presence of his sister Letty) are missing here.	2001-12-09

Wainwright is clearly too close to his subject to craft an objective account, but there's still an awful lot of material who are interested in either _Life_ itself or in the history of magazines in general.<br />Much fascinating stuff, such as the Clifford Irving hoax, the exclusive _Life_ coverage of the astronauts, and the JFK assassination.	2001-12-09

I suppose it's only natural that I'd be disappointed by his first attempt at a novel, given that my expectations were pretty high.<br />_Fountain Society_ is based on the idea of amoral scientists deciding to extend life through cloning experiments and a love affair trying to survive through all the associated horror. The book begins *very* slowly and is full of clunky cliches and most of the major plot points are easy to guess. It did start to redeem itself by the end-- Craven started to get more of a feel for his characters and express more of the complexity that makes him such a good filmmaker. Unfortunately, it wasn't soon enough to save the novel as a reading experience.<br />I *will* read a next novel, should there be a next novel, but I'd definitely take a miss on this one.	2001-12-09

In addition to the standard introductory essay and chronology, Walford Davies also includes a handsome array of critical responses to Hopkins and a bibliography for further reading.<br />I'll be reading further in Hopkin's journals, if I can find them. The selections printed here would be inspirational for any dedicated diarist-- Hopkins took an unflinching look at nature-- recording with delicacy and accuracy and without sentimentality.<br />It will take me longer tto really digest the poetry. I can see what the critics mean by comparing Hopkins to Whitman, but as these are fairly clearly meant to be read out loud, the value is less in a single reading. Even still, poems like &quot;Spring and Fall: To a Young Child&quot; and &quot;To R.B.&quot; were haunting and evocative at the very first read.	2001-12-09

While not laugh-out-loud funny, reading one of her books generally inspires a chuckle or two. _Five Bells and Bladebone_ is no exception-- the book is well-written, and the characters of Long Piddleton continue to entertain.<br />The major problem with the book is the resolution. It's as though Grimes got an idea into her head about the clear-cut nature of murder and wanted to see it through even if it did violence to the characters as she'd already established them. I was very unhappy with the ending of the book-- I found it contrived and at least a little bit silly. Mysteries are better off character-driven rather than being pushed by Ideas of the writer.	2001-12-08

I think that this is because he doesn't waste a lot of time worrying about the science of it, or the potential for paradox, he just enjoys the ride (and so does the reader).<br />A failed biographer gets his chance of a lifetime and gets a lot more than he bargained for-- featuring avenging maidens, body-switching murderers, beggar lords, and Egyptian gods. Somewhat lighter than other Tim Powers books (I'm unlikely to reread, I fear) but still very entertaining and astonishingly well-written.	2001-12-05

I was deeply skeptical when a friend handed this book to me-- suit, grin, car salesman? What did that have to do with consultancy to media companies? What did this have to do with anything?<br />No joke-- it has to do with *everything* in business.<br />A great focused reminder about where to spend your energy and attention if you want to grow your business.

I had to both laugh at and give a helpful vote to the review below which accused the author of citing half-baked fragments of myths and anecdotes as evidence. To a certain degree, it's a fair cop, particularly if you're looking for a book which is going to really stunningly predict the future.<br /><br />_The Age of Unreason_ isn't about predicting the future, it's about training yourself to look at the future in ways that you might otherwise not have done. As such, I found it a valuable and interesting book which is clearly based in a lot of meditation on learning and learning theories.<br /><br />Some of the things Handy mentioned turned out to have become true since the book was written. Other things didn't-- but it doesn't matter ultimately. What the book asks is this: Can you recognize the real causes for pain that you identify? Can you think differently to force discontinuous change? Is your vision of the future based on an accurate perception of the past, or are you looking past major factors because you don't recognize the role of gradual change?<br /><br />People who like this book may like some of the books on developing strategies using scenario exercises. This book also contains a decent (if dated) bibliography.	2001-11-28

She starts off with what she thinks is a girl being treated badly by her family and ends up in an entirely different and more dangerous kettle of fish.<br />Given that Arlette was one of my least favorite elements of the more standard Van Der Valk novels, I'm honestly suprised that I liked it as much as I did. It's hurt by the initial pages, which are unnecessarily confusing in setting the stage. It's definitely not where to begin with Freeling, but is something for the real fan.	2001-11-23

His name still inspires visions of the pitched battles that have arisen around the pieces of his empire and the ethical debates about the role of journalism and issues of media ownership. There is a tremendous amount to be learned from studying Murdoch and the way he built his kingdom, and this book is not to be missed, particularly for people studying media history or the media industry.<br />Shawcross presents a very balanced picture, light on both censure and praise, and manages to give enough personal detail to illuminate the public Murdoch without veering into a personal melodrama. The writing is occasionally a bit dry, but generally of a high quality &amp; the source notes and bibliography are quite valuable in and of themselves.	2001-11-20

Holmes books because she was one of my grandmother's favorite writers. An extremely prolific and popular romance novelist from the mid- to late- eighteen hundreds, her books are warm melodramatic love stories full of charming period details. Although never classed as literature, as such, I find her writing consistently compelling and readable. To curl up under a warm quilt with one of her books remains one of my key anti-depressants.<br />The Abandoned Farm tells the story of a mistaken inheritance, and an old wrong. A spirited young lady goes undercover as a serving girl in what properly should be her family home. She finds more than she expects in the young master of the house.<br />Connie's Mistake is the stronger story, and details the dark secret that keeps Connie from being able to marry her childhood sweetheart Kenneth. Some of Holmes' favorite themes-- indulgence in alcohol leading to dissipation and death, pure love, and mistaken identities.	2001-11-07

Brady Coyne is a very likeable character, as is his client-- the irascable Florence Gresham. The seeming suicide of George seems open-and-shut, but Florence keeps the pressure on Brady to come up with an answer other than suicide. The plot wanders a bit too much for me, with too many characters and details, and some unfortunately rather predictable elements.	2001-11-07

Along the way we see characters like Miser Shen, the most expensive woman in the world, Henpecked Ho, and the Key Rabbit.<br />I generally don't like fantasy set in historic periods but I loved _Bridge of Birds_. It's written with a combination of irony and sincerity that is very difficult to resist. The story unfolds with humor and pathos and I found myself genuinely wondering what was going to happen next after every twist and turn. Absolutely worth a read or two.	2001-11-07

Right up until the end of this strange little book, we don't have any better feeling than Kinsella does whether the threat is anywhere except in Vanessa's head.<br />The book does get tangled up in its own feet at a certain point by introducing too many characters and too much information. Still, for me, it gives a lot of hope for the writer/series.	2001-11-07

The three of them arrive in a small coastal town to assist their mysterious Uncle Merry in retrieving the item.

All the same, Greenwitch is a classic of children's literature, exemplary of the moral fantasy at which Cooper excels. The whole series is a good gift for children *and* grown-ups.	2001-11-07

I think Baker glosses over some very real issues of how these resources are used and probably underestimates the real cost of physical versus digital/microfilm archiving, but I'm also not sure that these issues make up the real point of the book.<br />I found it a *very* illuminating read and it made some really excellent points about how useful it is to carry projects without a clear sense of goal and direction. I thought his concerns about the privatisation of historical archive are very valid. I couldn't help but share his concerns about destruction in order to preserve. Moreover, the book is remarkably readable and occasionally very entertaining (the virgin mummy section, for example).<br />I'll be giving this one away as a Christmas gift to more than a few poeple on my gift list.	2001-11-04

The essays caused so much contemporary anger and scorn, however, that their publication was discontinued.<br />Ruskin began as an art critic, who wrote in favor of a naturalism based in the imagination rather than the eye. His works discussed the moral and political dimensions of art and architecture, and it was probably natural that this would lead him into his interest in socialism and the powerful writing found in _Unto This Last_. He was passionately arguing against the Utilitarianism of writers such as John Stuart Mill and others who saw immutable laws of economy which were rooted in anything except justice. His assertion was that the accumulation of money was in fact an accumulation of power rather than wealth, and necessarily resulted in an imbalance which adversely affected society. For instance, he said that a successful factory which polluted the environment could not be termed profitable because of the resulting damage to society itself.<br />This collection of Ruskin's works (edited and with commentary by Clive Wilmer) contains the whole of _Unto This Last_ and enough of a selection of his other works to give a sense of the chronological position of the essays in Ruskin's career.<br />The book features an early fairy tale by Ruskin which was written for his wife, an excerpt from _The Stones of Venice_ which discusses the nature of Gothic architecture, excerpts from _the Two Paths_ and _Modern Painters_, two lectures which were published as parts of _The Crown of Wild Olive_ and _Sesame and Lilies_, and finally ends with letters 7 and 10 from _Fors Clavigera_.<br />Ghandi credited _Unto This Last_ with providing part of the impetus behind his transformation. And it would not be ridiculous for me to say that the book forced a radical reexamination of many of my own assumptions and ideas. It's also a pleasure to read, with beautiful as well as thought-provoking prose. Worthwhile reading for more than students of Victoriana.beautiful as well as thought-provoking prose.

But when the mother of his only child blows into town, daughter in tow, he needs to take a family visit to Mexico and abandon the act to the tender mercies of a Turkish spy/manager. Sure enough, while he's communing with his father, the French One of the G7 girls becomes the first Dead One, and Starlitz is forced to return before his cheap &amp; fake rock band becomes the first shot in a very real culture war.<br />If you've read Sterling before, Zeitgeist is going to be vastly entertaining. Playing with issues of culture, temporality, and celebrity, it romps across the end of the 20th century. This said, it's thinner than some of his other novels, and I don't think it's the place for a Sterling newbie. I liked it, however.	2001-09-24

The model results in a tacit protection of the status quo, where facts inconvenient to the governing policy are left out or placed in a context that lacks either focus or outrage. This is not caused by an explicit conspiracy, but is rather the result of economic and supply (information source alignment) realities. In the US, we give a great deal of attention to the problem of physical threat as the largest enemy to our closely held ideal of a free press. Herman/Chomsky force the reader to consider other (perhaps more effective) methods of coercion.<br />To support their assertion about the relevance of this model, Herman and Chomsky use paired examples. They choose an instance of an event which occurs in at least two countries (elections, atrocities, etc.). They then make a comparison between how the US media treats that event when given two countries on different sides of the US government friend/foe line. They do not argue that facts are per se suppressed, but rather focus on the context of the presentation of the facts and the relationship between media entities and their owners/advertisers/government forces.<br />Herman/Chomsky clearly have a political flavor (as do most commentators) but regardless of whether the reader agrees with the entirety of their evidence, it is difficult to dismiss the model which has been built here with such painstaking care. Anyone who is a student of media or political economy will benefit from reading _Manufacturing Consent_.	2001-09-16

Actually, I want to give credit where credit is due, McCrumb took on a very difficult topic in _The PMS Outlaws_. If she painted herself into a corner while doing so, that's not so very hard to understand.<br />Forensic Anthropologist Elizabeth MacPherson checks herself into a mental hospital to recover from what she sees as situational depression resulting from the disappearance of her husband at sea. The primary issue in the book, and what makes this such difficult material, is that what Elizabeth believes is the cure for her unhappiness and what actually is the cure turn out to be two very different things.<br />The other plots-- the Thelma &amp; Louise characters, Bill's mysterious codger-in residence-- are sketchily drawn and clearly are meant to focus more as humorous counterbalance to Elizabeth's struggle. The problem is that the publisher also didn't have the courage to highlight that the book is much more about the emotional struggle than the mystery, so the expectations raised by the title and the back of the book aren't met by the story itself.<br />McCrumb remains a smart writer. I do think that she may have been out of her depth here (or too limited by the genre) for what she was trying to accomplish. But I find it necessary to applaud the effort.	2001-09-15

There's a point early on where he states fairly flatly that the best thing Hoffa ever did for the Teamsters was disappear. Clearly, this isn't the place if you're looking for a psychological profile of Hoffa.<br />However, it *is* the place to look if what you're looking for is a history of the relationships between the Teamsters, organized crime, Robert Kennedy and Castro. A fascinating look at the web of power that bound these players together.<br />Moldea has a reputation for dedication and honesty, and the work here bears that reputation out. The writing is detailed and passionate. What I liked best was how clearly it communicated issues internal to the Teamsters. It's a very complicated subject, and to understand it you have to understand things like the role of owner-operators. Moldea reduced that complexity for the uninitiated, a formidible task.	2001-09-15

He commented that he hated intellectualizing, and instead walked her through some exercises to demonstrate the integrative rather than the analytical nature of a gestalt-based approach. It's an interesting moment, and sheds some potential light on the best way to read this book.<br />Essentially what Perls believed was that in order to make intelligent and healthy decisions, you have to make conscious decisions. So the goal of therapy is to bring all the issues at play into consciousness so that by being aware of all the factors involved, real choices can be made in an informed fashion. He used theatrical techniques and group therapy to help his patients achieve their goals.<br />Perls is reported to have viewed the essays in the first portion of the book (The Gestalt Approach) as outdated, and instead wished that he could have made a film to convey his ideas. There are seven essays, which lay out the basic principles behind his theories and ideas:<br />Foundations<br />Neurotic Mechanisms<br />Here Comes the Neurotic<br />Here and Now Therapy<br />Peeling the Onion<br />Shuttling, Psychodrama, and Confusion<br />Who is Listening?<br />I would tend to agree (with Perls' implied message) that reading the transcripts of group therapy sessions in the second part of the book (Eye Witness to Therapy) is much more illuminating for somebody who wants to get some insight into what really is involved in Gestalt Therapy.<br />For me at least, as a layman, it was much easier to get a feel for what was involved by reading the flow between the patients and the therapist in group than it was to digest the message in essay form.<br />Thought-provoking.	2001-09-09

While there's certainly room to quarrel about Cockburn's particular flavor (arguments about how to write requirements can approach religious wars), I think that most would agree that he explains his style well.<br />A good place for beginners to start and I think that even professionals quite experienced in requirements definition will find new ways of thinking about system design.	2001-09-09

Her boredom quickly ends when the class harridan is poisoned and dies.<br />The book is not a serious mystery, and the plot holes are occasionally large, but they're also easy to forgive because of the endearing characters and the author's ability to find the humor in every day small town life.	2001-09-08

Alex Delaware realizes that he's uncomfortably close to the case due to a patient from his past and has to grapple with client/confidentiality issues in order to help Milo solve the murder.<br />One of the best things about the early Alex Delaware novels was the spark that they seemed to have-- a spark that's been lost in the formula for the last two books. An attempt to spice it up by introducing friction between Milo and Alex isn't enough to make this more than a decent quick read.	2001-09-08

Set in Tuscany, the case is important because while the public has sympathy for the girl, it is seen as crucial that the cycle of vengeance murders not be allowed to continue. Two foreigners-- Ninette Lachaise and Peter Landon-- are unwillingly drawn into the family and legal drama and struggle to keep their dignity and new love for each other intact.<br />While marketed as a mystery, _Daughter of Silence_ is much closer to a romance. And while the main thread is interesting enough, the book is plagued with stagy characters and strained psychological analysis. Originally released in 1961, this was the 11th book of the best-selling Australian author.	2001-08-26

Hex is left to sort out which of the family responsibilities (including a shocking request from his mother) he is both willing and able to take.<br />The story is told in a shifting array of voices which carry the language and perspective of all the characters. Symbolism is the order of the day, with both of Billie's husbands having nuclear pasts and the varying shades of purple being used to create a thematic unity. The quality of the writing is difficult to debate-- at points where I had lost some interest in the story I found my attention carried by the craftsmanship involved in the language itself.<br />There were times where I felt as though Moody didn't realize how strong of a story he had created (the mixed horror and pleasure with which Hex must tend his mother's useless body) and relied on the more symbolic elements at points where that reliance was useless and even distracting. The ending is often criticized, and I think that the criticism comes from that fact that while the ending functions very well on the symbolic level, it's less fulfilling in terms of the story. Instead of finally being drawn into Hex or Billie, the spectacular surrealism of the final pages had more the effect of putting me at a distance- perhaps exactly what was intended.	2001-08-26

Yes, amazingly enough, this book managed to keep me fascinated for 1242 pages (I read it in the one book edition, not as two separate books). _Naked God_ has the same wonderful eye for detail as the earlier books in this series. The characters are sketched with care and verisimilitude and I found myself making time in an already too-busy day so that I could read just a little more.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I also find myself in agreement with the reviewers who found the solution to the problem of the possessed just a little bit too easy. I got the feeling that he had either painted himself into a corner or he just was having so much fun writing it that he couldn't think about the ending until the book was due at the publisher. I re-read the ending several times, trying to find a way that I liked it, but it just really deflated the reading experience. Sorry, PH!<br /><br />In all seriousness, the entire series is a really impressive reading experience. Hamilton is one of the best (if not the best) science fiction writers currently active today. This is probably not a good book for a younger science fiction reader (the politics are very complex and there is a good deal of graphic material-- both sex and violence). Adult fans among us should, however, be pleased. The series is recommended for any science fiction fan, but begin with the first book and not with the Naked God.	2001-08-26

These highly successful communities managed to contribute to the fabric of a nation while living out their ideals of celibacy, simplicity of life, separation from the world, and community of goods.

Imagine her dismay when, no matter what she does, the drawing looks like a corpse. Miss Seeton thinks that she might have had a stroke, but the police think that she just might have a clue to a string of child murders that have been plaguing the area...	2001-08-05

I think that it may be hard for the modern reader to find the time to read _Our Mutual Friend_. It's length makes it undeniably difficult to fit easily into the daily allotment of reading time. Weighing in at over 900 pages, it was originally published as a twenty-part monthly serial. There are also a number of situations and details that while very familiar to the Victorians, will be almost wholly incomprehensible to the reader of today (for instance the role of dust and dustmen and the mounds in the yard of the old house).<br />It's also clearly not Dickens' sunniest work. At the time of its release already, people spoke nostalgically about the more gentle nature of _David Copperfield_ or _Oliver Twist_ . While the farce that constitutes such an important element in Dickens' works is present, it's tainted with a note of bitterness that conveys a feeling of pervasive sadness throughout this great novel.<br />Dickens was working on this book when he was caught in the Staplehurst rail disaster and narrowly escaped death when his car was the only one of the first-class cars not to plunge from a bridge into a river bed. He was one of the people who climbed down the side to do what he could for the dead and dying. Dickens himself mentions the accident in his afterword, and at the risk of reading too much into the incident, it's hard not to read this book from the perspective of an aging man who narrowly avoids death himself. The nature of death, and the idea of escaping it by a hand's length, is one of the themes that comes back over and over again in _Our Mutual Friend_<br />The plot hinges around a disputed inheritance and mistaken identity, with a meditation about love as societal coin. The characterizations and situations in this novel are among his best-- particularly worth mentioning are Rogue Riderhood and his resurrection, the insane love of Bradley Headstone, the crippled doll-maker Jenny Wren, and the loyal Mr. Sloppy.<br />I'm not sure that I can call this my favorite Dickens, _Little Dorrit_ still has a strong claim on that position, but it's certainly one of the strongest reading experiences that I've had in a while.my favorite Dickens, _Little Dorrit_ still has a strong claim on that position, but it's certainly one of the strongest reading experiences that I've had in a while.	2001-08-05

I had bought this book because I wanted to learn more about Tom Paine. Paine is one of those historical characters who keeps popping up on the edges of discussion, and about whom I knew very little. I became a lot more aware of him through my media studies, given that he was one of the first radical figures to use media effectively as a weapon.<br />In any case, this isn't a biography of Paine, and assumes that the reader already knows (or isn't interested in) many biographical details. The book is more about Paine's reception by the society of the time, with a focus on issues such as the role of artisans, balanced government, republicanism, and free markets. It tracks how Paine was received as political pamphleteer not only in the revolutionary US, but also in the UK and revolutionary France.<br />I think that the book would have meant a lot more to me if I'd already had more background, but the chapter notes did a good job of pointing me to the best books for further reading.	2001-07-29

Rider Haggard novels together in one go-- but it is such a good thing, that I didn't find it overpowering. Haggard writes with a richness of detail and sense of humor that are able to overcome any sense of datedness. Fine writing that captures the imagination.<br />_She_ is probably the strongest novel in the collection, with the introduction of Ayesha, the ultimate amoral femme fatale. Ayesha is immortal and rules her band of followers with an iron hand. When Ludwig Horace Holly and his ward appear in her forgotten nation, an ancient love triangle is revived. A meditation on the power of beauty and the violent nature of passion.<br />_King Solomon's Mines_ introduces the characters of Allan Quatermain, Sir Henry Curtis and Captain John Good as they go searching for King Solomon's legendary mines. The evil Gagool, wise woman and witch smeller, opposes them in their mission as they brave everything to find what they seek.<br />_Allan Quatermain_ continues the adventures introduced in the book before, with the friends restless for new adventure. Their searching takes among the Zu-Vendi, an isolated people of Persian descent. They are caught up in the warring between the beautiful twin queens Sorais and Nyleptha and love threatens even the bond between the adventurers themselves.<br />Be aware that these books are a product of their time, and are written by a white man and set in Africa. They contain artifacts of prejudice that can offend.	2001-07-29

It's a very quick read, entertaining precisely long enough to be a treat, contains nothing challenging and nothing difficult. The characters are fun, the plot isn't too unbelievable, and the writing is excellent. It should be just the thing if you're in the right mood.<br /><br />Mrs. Pollifax finds young Kadi hiding out in her closet, and takes her on the run to escape her pursuers. The Bishop stashes them in a rather unusual safe house-- a carnival in rural Maine-- and together they need to discover why Kadi is in so much danger.	2001-07-29

It tells the story of Cleopatra through the eyes of Harmachis, a priest who betrays everything holy for the love of Cleopatra and is himself later betrayed. Haggard's passion for beautiful and fiery women who are somehow beyond the normal laws of society and morality is evident here.	2001-07-29

Dobyns has a great eye for real life and conveys it in details of the characters' everyday actions. The characterizations are complex and they avoid almost every common irritating cliche found in this kind of novel.<br />The plotting itself is slightly weaker. The book stretches the limits of believability several times-- although in fairness I should say that the writing is good enough that it was not as noticeable as it could have been. My major disappointment was with the ending, which had a little bit of the feel of an anti-climax.<br />Still definitely worth a read, and I'll be watching for books by the same author.	2001-07-20

When a magician is killed in a stage accident, only Mallory believes it to have been murder. In order to solve that crime and prevent another, she's drawn into a relationship with a charismatic elderly magician who forces her to question basic elements of her own nature.<br />_Stone Angel_ (as has been stated by other reviewers) was a breathtaking book. The problem with it was that it was very difficult to follow. While I don't want to see too much change in Mallory (_Stone Angel_ showed the potential for change, but didn't provide a personality magic wand), I also didn't expect to see this book written as if the events in that book had never happened.<br />There were many interesting and well-written characters in _Shell Game_, but I found the plot itself a little bit weak. Magicians are such an easy target, and there were a few too many stereotypes pulled out of the bag in this book.  It's a bit like a mystery written about the theater, the writer really has to earn the subject matter. O'Connell doesn't.<br />Additionally, the mystery became so complex at a given point that I found it difficult to keep caring about who did what to whom when.	2001-07-15

I'm aware that I'm damning the book with faint praise, but that's the best summary title I can think of. A noir thriller centering around an ex-dealer who wants to do right, his deadly ex-wife, and a straight arrow cop.

Thought-provoking and influential, _The Necessity of Art_ is also quite readable and not at all dogmatic. Book is divided into five sections:<br />The function of art<br /> The origins of art<br /> Art and capitalism<br /> Content and form<br /> The loss and discovery of reality<br />Perhaps the most-quoted passages come from &quot;content and form&quot;, which was indeed for me the most interesting section of the book. Form as solidified social experience fits into his analysis extremely well and the idea is developed here in a fascinating manner.	2001-07-15

Travis McGee promised himself a trouble-free summer. But when the local nice guy turned up after having been nearly destroyed by a professional black widow, McGee reluctantly agrees to help. A tennis-playing brunette with a slightly shifty husband turns out to be more bait than anyone expected, and McGee goes hunting for True Evil in the form of this book's villain.<br />One of MacDonald's best McGee books, filled with the Florida detail and cynicism that are the series' trademarks. What makes it special is the almost unwilling belief in good that the main character nurtures in the face of so much human failing. One of those stories where nearly everything clicks.	2001-07-14

The ability to view video-on-demand got bogged down in a nightmare of copyright issues and bandwidth problems and atoms are still unfortunately controlling the way that we are able to experience bits.<br />Despite the fact that much of it is dated, this book is still useful on two levels. It's a good book to make clients (particularly media clients) understand the impact of the difference between the analogue and the digital world. It's also a good book for people who are interested in the history of the Internet. Given how seminal it was, _Being Digital_ will never go completely out of date.	2001-06-23

And neither is anything else. _The Iron Dragon's Daughter_ tells the story of a human changeling imprisoned in a faery factory, eventually destined to be a breeder for the half-human pilots who ride the Iron Dragons. But Jane is not an easy target. She escapes from the factory with one of the most fearsome dragons and makes a pact with it that will shape the rest of her life.<br />Jane is a lot like a normal teenager in the book, something I notice irritated reviewers. She's self-obsessed, vain, and not very diligent at class. She doesn't exhibit special talent and isn't always terribly courageous. In other words, she's a person.<br />So much of fantasy depends on the formula of an ordinary person being dumped into a magical environment. But usually the magical environment is terribly one-dimensional and the 'ordinary person' turns out to be destined for some feat of greatness or another-- while they may be allowed a potentially fatal flaw, they usually don't have more than one. It was really refreshing to see Jane-- good at some things, and not at others. She's by turns sulky, stormy, and terribly smart. I liked her. She was real.<br />There are details in the book that are really brilliant at taking faery lore and turning it into a real society, with all the complication, churn and darkness. I'm thinking of a moment where the police yell at a milling crowd that their gathering is unseelie.<br />I honestly regretted it when I realized that I was getting towards the end of the book. Will definitely seek out other works by the same author.	2001-06-16

Scarpetta novels are not knee-slappers at the best of times, but this one seemed determined to wallow in paranoid murk. Marino is transformed into a menacing drunk. Lucy is off on a tangent so strange that nobody can follow it. Even the faithful Anna is revealed to have a disturbing past and takes even more disturbing actions in the present. And through it all, the events of _Black Notice_ and Benton's death weave like ghosts. I don't read mystery novels for black paranoia, I read them for conflict and its resolution. I was really irritated that I seemed to have bought myself into a 565 page serious bummer.<br />But it was then that it hit me-- of course the book is a paranoid murk. Her lover was killed, she was brutally attacked, she's been opposed by every important figure in Virginia for her power and insight. Without going down, there was no way to take Kay Scarpetta back up.<br />This *is* a different side of Scarpetta, and I can understand why it isn't satisfying to a lot of people. This is a Scarpetta who questions herself. Benton has been dead long enough to not be a holy ghost anymore. She's forced to deal with her real issues with Lucy's sexual orientation. She can no longer ignore the curdled attraction that Marino feels for her. It's unpleasant to read, but it would have been wrong somehow for Cornwell to have her character simply dusting herself off and going forward with a smile after everything that has happened.<br />It is this troubled Scarpetta who eventually leads the book into the way out, where she has a tiny island of trust and a new direction from which to pick up her life again. It's a manner for Cornwell to renew the series, and I believe that the time had come for that to happen. So applause to Cornell for taking some chances with a familiar character-- always a very risky thing.<br />I wish that there hadn't been such an overabundance of coincidence in the way everything tied together. I can't say anything specific about it without giving away aspects of the ending, but it was the only terribly weak point in what was ultimately a very strong book.n the way everything tied together.

She's suffering from short-term amnesia around the event, but is certain that that couldn't be true-- she had been dissatisfied with her relationship herself. Why would she try to kill herself over a relationship she would have been relieved to have ended? The question becomes more than academic when the pair turn up murdered, and the question is how much Jinx really remembers...<br />The book kept me reading, and fascinated. Jinx was a strongly drawn character and conflicted enough that you buy the fact that people have doubts about her innocence. The ending was unfortunately disappointing for being overly convoluted. It may not live up to the standard of The Scold's Bridal, but it's a well-written book.	2001-06-11

Eliot [fan], and I knew I was going to like this book when the discarded bodies of the evil Fisher King murmured lines from the Wasteland to each other. Powers takes the real world that we live in, and paints a ghost world behind it, full of the things that we both hope and fear are true. The smoke in a casino eddies to show the flow of fate. Ghosts are real, and they want you, but you shouldn't go with them.<br />The center of the book is the cyclical battle to become the spiritual Fisher King-- he who (together with his queen) can interact directly with the archetypes. Every twenty years, all the possible candidates (Jacks) converge on Las Vegas to see who will hold the crown. The contest rules are a mish-mash of superstition, gambling, violence, mythic lore, and poetry. The year that the book begins, the Jack who presents the most serious threat to the ruling King is the son he tried to destroy while still a child. Scott Crane is a one-eyed gambler and reluctant heir to the throne who is thrown back into the ring by the death of his wife Susan and the knowledge that seizing the throne is the only possible way to reclaim the rights to his body-- something he gambled away while still a teenager.<br />I read this book obsessively, and I can't imagine reading it any other way.

There are so many books on the market that discuss the concept of  'brand' from so many different points of view, that it's difficult to sort out the good from the bad. This is one of the good ones.<br />Moon and Millison define the basic concepts around brand. They explain in clear buzzword-light language what influences the growth and positioning of a brand. Finally, they provide ample and well-explained pointers to further reading to help understand some of their basic ideas more clearly.<br />As a consultant working for a systems integrator, one of the things that impressed me the most was the focus on execution. Many books about branding seem to imply that the technical details are irrelevant to brand success, but _Firebrands_ makes the point that a relationship with a customer only has brand value when supported by appropriate policies, training, and technical infrastructure. This is a message that can't be, IMO, repeated often enough.<br />Well worth the time to read.	2001-06-09

There's so much going on here, and so little of it is boring. It runs from the Italian occupation of Greece, to Pelagia's loves, to the History of Dr. Iannis, to the confessions of Carlo Piero Guercio. There are countless twists and turns and more narrative threads than could possible be addressed in a brief review. All these tiny pieces are swept together into a nuanced whole by the catastrophic events around World War II.<br />I laughed out loud in several places, and in several more I felt like crying. The humor saves the book from melodrama, and the sadness saves it from making WWII into something less bleak than it was. The writing style is splendid and the characters well-drawn. _Corelli's Mandolin_ goes to the top of my gift list for 2001.	2001-06-09

A number of the characters who later become a bit frozen in their stereotype behaviour are very real in this book-- I think particularly of Vivian and Trueblood-- and it's worth reading if you're a fan just for those points alone.<br />When a series of grisly murders shocks the town of Long Piddleton, Richard Jury of Scotland Yard is sent to investigate. It becomes clear all-too-soon that these were not the acts of a stranger and the small town is in the grip of suspicion and fear as the death toll continues to rise.<br />A satisfying whodunnit that keeps the pages turning.	2001-06-04

This is because, for me, the cultural and political aspects of Jamaican life that were depicted in _The Book of Jamaica_ far outweighed in interest anything about the protagonist/narrator. I found it odd how unable I was to hold the plot involving the expatriot professor in my mind while I was reading. It created an unpleasant effect because his story would occasionally interrupt the story of the Maroon communities and I would remember that there was more than one thing the story was about. The proportions, in this sense, felt wrong to me.<br />This said, I found the communties and lifestyles described here to be fascinating reading and Banks (at least apparently) wrote with loving respect about the Jamaican culture and people.

She has many interesting entanglements and character flaws that are sure to provide the talented Faye Kellerman with a good subject around which to hang her police procedurals.<br />Peter Decker himself is nearly \\"finished\\"-- there've been so many books about his relationship with Rina now that there's very little left to work out and Kellerman would have to resort to increasingly outlandish plots (we saw the tendency in Jupiter's Bones) to keep the interest level up. His involvement in this book is both peripheral and pertinant-- just at the level that it should be to provide familiarity without losing the attention to Cindy.<br />The not-so-cool part is that the plot doesn't hang together as well as it should. In general, Kellerman doesn't need to use something as obvious coincidence to drive her plots, but she relies on it here to the great detriment of the book.<br />Still, while it may be less polished in some ways than _Jupiter's Bones_ I found it a refreshing change and hopefully it represents a change in direction that will bear fruit in a more fully realized Cindy Decker novel the next time.	2001-05-31

For some people, that's apparently enough to make a satisfying reading experience. Unfortunately, I need a lot more in the way of story to be satisfied. I don't think that it's a problem with the writer as I have not felt other books by Crace to be similarly lacking. Chalk it up to a matter of taste, and by all means read it if you're the kind of person who really loves the kind of portraiture rendered here.	2001-05-27

When Walt receives the Bluebird of Happiness by mistake, he doesn't realize he's become part of a battle between good and evil that will eventually touch his entire family.<br />This was my first Blaylock, and I found it interesting, with touches that reminded me of Dick (always a good sign). I was less interested in the characters themselves than I was in the ideas that made up the plot, and the little quirky moments that seemed to fill the novel.<br />Based on the reader reviews, I think that I will try Paper Grail next and see if it satisfies more by expanding on the elements that I liked.	2001-05-27

Intriguing and informative look at a title (and by extension, an industry) in transition. Clearly illustrates both the reasons for and effects of corporate acquisition of magazines.

Chalker, but hadn't gotten around to reading The Rings of the Master series.<br />On the one hand, the book isn't disappointing-- the plot is inventive enough and the concept and characters engaging. Mankind lives in what is essentially a terrarium of their own invention. Centuries ago, people set computers up to rule the world and prevent mankind from killing itself. However, the computers now rule too well-- leaving people no free will or ability to innovate. Five rings were left by the creators of the original system and those rings have the ability to shut the computers off. The heros of the story must find the rings in the face of the computers' opposition.<br />I think people who haven't read a lot of Chalker won't be bugged by the repetition from earlier books, but even given a lot of elapsed time, I was still struck by how many old familiar Chalker elements there are-- gender switching, mind control, rape, blindness, physical experimentation. It felt a little too predictable in this way-- some kind of fetish (writer or reading public?) being expressed in the body of work.	2001-05-24

The inevitable passing of an older way of life leads to murder at an Anglican theological college on the East Anglian coast. The backdrop includes a mother who never recovered from the loss of her son, a priceless painting, and an group of would-be priests in a tradition of the church that is clearly about to fade.<br />Honestly, James would probably get five stars from me just for writing another Dalgliesh mystery, but Death in Holy Orders earns it in its own right. The novel is delicate, literate, and probes issues that extend beyond a local murder. James writes with sympathy for all characters, and they are heartbreakingly real. Like in the later Christie novels, you can hear her waving goodbye to an older England.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-05-19

Biker gangs occupy a place in Deadly Decisions that is similar to the one occupied by cults in her last book. They represent a villain whose threat to society is only brought home to the main character when it begins to touch her family.  This time, forensic scientist Temperance Brennan is pulled deeply into the world of biker gangs through her outrage at the death of an innocent. To her horror, her nephew Kit is fascinated by this deadly group of miscreants. She must solve a murder and still manage to keep Kit out of harm's way.<br />Unfortunately, social evils and their victims are not a substitute for narrative antagonists and protagonists. Although Reichs is a skilled writer in many ways, with rich descriptions and a feel for the material, she seems unable to grapple with actual characters beyond the characters of Brennan and her immediate circle.<br />The book has many other flaws-- plot points are very predictable, the coincidences are strong enough to make even the most forgiving reader wince, and the character relationships are superficial and unbelievable (with the exception of Temperance's response to her boyfriend's betrayal). I would not only wait for paperback, I would wait to borrow the paperback from the library.	2001-05-19

That experience is further supported by citations from academic research and a great deal of very strong analytical thought.	2001-05-05

Taller, wiser, more beautiful and more kind than all other mortals-- she lacks the ability to find sexual (emotional) completion.<br />Captain Quire is an artist of evil, who seeks an appreciative patron for his finest works.<br />Quire is bidden to weaken Albion and force the queen to marry and sets about it with his usual skill. But Gloriana is no ordinary opponent, and whether the two of them will find destruction or redemption in each other becomes the crux of the novel.<br />Moorcock clearly delights in detail-- historial Elizabethan era, with the tiny twists that make it an alternative universe. Decadence, Dr. Dee, automatons, travelers from other realities, court seasons and public poetry make up the stage-setting which is almost more compelling than the story itself.	2001-05-05

I thought that if anyone could do it, Crichton could. Not only does Crichton not, it seems like he doesn't even try. There are plot holes you could drive a truck through-- are they alternative universes, or is it the past? And if it is the past, his explanation for avoiding paradox seems goofier than any I've seen yet. It really hurt my experience of the book that I just didn't believe the basic premise.<br />That said, the detail and background and plain old respect for history evident in the medieval sections are really impressive. It felt well-researched and well-executed and the reactions of the modern characters to the fourteenth century world seemed believable and well-drawn.<br />And, as usual, very few writers can beat Crichton for pure entertainment value. He's got a keen sense of pacing and plot and  even with my deep irritation at the time travel thing, I had a hard time putting the book down until it was done.	2001-04-15

One of the interesting things about the book is the way the voice of the writers changes between the different sections-- from the precious voice of memoir in the childhood section to a kind of drunken free-flow in her days as a Paris reporter. Parts of the book *do* feel dated in an unpleasant sort of way because of the strong dependence on the sixties ethos, but the writing is good enough that this can generally be forgiven.	2001-04-15

The sections of the book-- 'No Space', 'No Choice', 'No Jobs' and 'No Logo'-- walk the reader through the history of these superbrands, through the efforts of corporations to create brand lifestyles, through the consequences of companies' shift from production to branding,  and finally brings us to the inevitable consumer backlash. Ironically, this book is probably as equally useful to a student of marketing as it is to a culture jammer-- her insight into branding is penetrating and most likely valuable regardless what side of the fence you're standing on.<br />Klein writes with passion and a clearly visible anger which is refreshing because she never descends into hectoring or rhetoric.  The book is apparently well-researched and meticulously supported with graphs and figures. I liked it well enough that I've already ordered copies for friends and family. A must-read.	2001-04-10

This book doesn't go in-depth into organizational issues involved in web content, although it does start to hint at the problems by talking about fitness for certain models and the bias of some of the extant CMS environments.<br />However, what the author does well is to draw together information about the different models of business-to-consumer value exchanges and present it in an easy-to-understand manner. It might well be something I would recommend to a client who was coming in fresh to the online environment. The examples are weakened, unfortunately, by the rather spectacular fall of some of the sites who were defined as doing it well-- but I think that's a problem many books pre-2001 are going to have.<br />The book is divided into sections on concepts and strategies and provides specific value exchange models for a number of well known content sites.	2001-04-09

And it should be.<br />The distinction in the Kano framework between basic expectations, satisfiers, and attractors is very well explained here and put in the kind of way that should make consultants and managers alike understand its relevance to their clients and companies. I've far too often seen clients trying to overperform on aspects of service where they just should be looking for parity and the requirements of most projects do not have a good way of seeing the difference between what their customers find simply nice to have and between the aspects of service that will truly drive the decision to buy from or remain a customer of the company in question.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-04-01

She has a real career, a complicated relationship with the notion of ethics, and a background that makes her both flawed and interesting. I will certainly be interested to read further in this series on the basis of her character alone.<br />This said, I was a little surprised that given how many awards this book won (the Edgar, Agatha, Anthony and Macavity awards) how slight the plot itself seemed. Perhaps my taste just runs more to the complicated and noir, but I would have been interested to see the same character in a situation a tiny bit more complex-- or perhaps with the complexities a bit better developed.	2001-03-31

A demon curse, a vicious but beautiful woman, a cult that specializes in killing virgin children-- sounds like typical horror fare. Only this isn't typical horror. This is typical horror written by Sheri S. Tepper. From the moment that you realize that the main character's name is &quot;Badger&quot; to the introduction to a coven of good witches, the book manages to deviate from genre in all kinds of remarkable ways.<br />If you're a Tepper completist, this is well worth reading to see how many of the threads that are so identifiable in her writing show up even in a very early pure genre play like this one. If you're a horror fan, _Blood Heritage_ should manage to give you what you're looking for, with just enough extra spice to keep it from being banal.	2001-03-31

This is a book communicating a world of pain-- the dialogues in the beginning between Janey and her father as he prepares to leave her for someone else carry the weight of the agony of someone being betrayed by someone so close and all the little lies and tricks we use to pull closer and push away. It's also a book about illness. Janey constantly has pain and infections and disease that cripple her, but she always pushes the physical pain to one side to focus on the men who she knows from the beginning are going to leave her.<br />It is not the easiest book in the world to read-- the emotion, rather than the plot, is the thread that ties the book together. There's a section in the book which is a series of drawings by Janey that provide a map to her dreams. I used this map to give the reading experience a kind of structure and I found that thinking about the book as a dream landscape made the lack of narrative much less jarring.	2001-03-17

Although it is not a major work, it is very satisfying to read and manages to be both moving and funny at the same time.	2001-01-19

There's been more than enough written about the romance as rape fantasy or patriarchal imagining without trying to understand the appeal behind the books themselves. Radway is much more fair than earlier writers and I was impressed, particularly considering that the book was written in 1984 (this was a reprint edition).<br />She begins the book by tracing the history of the popular novel in America and then narrowing that down to the history of the romance. This is an informative and effective way of setting the context. She then spends time interviewing women in the town of Smithton who center around a bookstore that caters to romance readers. Radway seems to genuinely like the women she's interviewing and there's a real sense that she makes an effort to understand the whys even though she clearly doesn't share the taste.	2001-01-18

But all too few people have read this seminal book on project management and software engineering. Containing resources such as an explanation of Brooks' Law, an incredibly useful breakdown of what kind of documentation should accompany a product, and the new chapters which examine what's changed since the book was first released. The whole world would be saved a great deal of chaos if beginning project managers would start with this fine book.	2001-01-14

As the family behind the Times, they were players on the stage of American history for most of the twentieth century. The family itself and the characters in it are fascinating-- the subjects range from Iphegene Ochs frustration that she as a woman would never be considered the heir to the throne, to the way that  Adolph Ochs wheeled and dealed his way into building the NYT, to the hard family choices behind the publication of the Pentagon papers, to modern attempts from within the company to break the family power. It's a wonderful glimpse at one of the most powerful families of our time. It's worth noting that this book is not a business case history and that the reader will not find an explicit overview of any of the strategies that made the Times what it is.	2001-01-14

(Although I did heave a sigh or two when it became clear that we were about to embark on another long series of introspective remarks disguised as conversation with somebody else.) However, I do think that for all the revelation we somehow never, as readers, get to the heart of the matter.<br />The book is at its strongest with its moments of observation, particularly about the past life of the narrator. Eggers has the ability to combine sharp imagery with the narrator's emotional overlay to create really evocative moments-- I'm thinking about things like the forest wallpaper in his bedroom or the mother spitting bile into a half moon hospital bin. I also enjoyed the rambling elliptical structure of the book with all its asides and imaginings and loopy discourses. The character of the narrator was strong, and had the combination of irritating and endearing qualities that are the hallmark of a good literary character.<br />However...<br />While the book touches on some very emotional elements and is nominally very open about exposing private pain points, I somehow felt like (with the exceptions of the moments of imagery mentioned above) we as readers were skittering across the surface. It became like a ride at the amusement park-- all the trappings and screams of fear without any actual danger. Particularly at the ending, which was obviously intended to be affecting, I felt finally like all the sarcasm and cheap humor had  eroded my ability to be ultimately interested in the narrator or his concerns. I rarely felt gripped by the book and read it with the same kind of tepid emotion as I might a somewhat interesting article in a magazine at the doctor's office.<br />One might argue that it is not the job of the author to provide me with an emotional response to the book, but I generally think that the kind of devices (digressions, diagrams, asides) used to create distance in this book ultimately function to provoke the reader and bring them more closely in. I dislike speculating about the emotional intentions of the author, but I feel like he should have done another round of editing with his own idea of his connection to the material fully in mind.<br />Still, I'm looking forward to the next book from Eggers, given how many strong strong elements there were here.ction to provoke the reader and bring them more closely in.

I've heard it described as brilliant, flawed, pretentious, irritating, moving, and plastic. I think that 'charming' and 'smart' are the two words that best define it for me, even though it's hard not to see its flaws.<br />A series of stories about a group of young people in Palm Springs, telling each other stories while they work pointless McJobs and glory in cultural wreckage. The book's strength is mostly in its moments-- the definitions and epigrams on the margins of the pages, the stories that the characters tell each other, and the tiny observational zingers about the American nature that are the hallmark of Coupland's writing. <br />I'm glad I read it.	2001-01-12

The book constantly suprises and manages to do so without any deus ex machina tricks that might make it unconvincing.<br />A mysterious note that claims someone was murdered, a stain on a carpet that may or may not be blood, and a gold lighter with a leading inscription-- these are the only clues that Wexford and his crew have to what might not even be a crime. Mix in a slightly mad painter, three women who gave their hearts unwisely, and a young policeman in love for the first time and you've got a  compelling mystery novel which is one of the best Rendells I've read to date.	2001-01-12

Definitions and basic terms are well set apart from the rest of the text and explained clearly and one chapter builds upon the ones before in a way that makes it easy to read without feeling overwhelmed. Written in 1995, the book is hampered a bit by being entirely lacking in any reference to Internet advertising.	2001-01-12

Card is smart to point out that the first trilogy provided different kinds of satisfaction in the different books depending on whether the subjects were children or adults, and this is a refreshing return to the flavor of the first book.<br />I agree with the reviewer who wrote that if you've recently read _Ender's Game_ this will probably be less enjoyable than it was for me-- I read it years ago, and my memory of it was vague enough that I was pleased by plot overlap rather than put off by it.<br />The writing style throughout the book is consistently good, and the plot that Card crafts for Bean is believable. My only real annoyance was with the Sister Carlotta character who returned too much as a plot device to provide exposition-- it felt a little bit lazy.	2001-01-09
2147106:US	52564468	RKVK4K7CG00N	0553576399	15854629	Distraction	Books	5	8	9	N	N	My favorite Sterling to date	Having read _Holy Fire_ and _Heavy Weather_ I have to say that I enjoyed this Sterling the most, and I've enjoyed all three very much indeed.<br />Sterling's writing is quirky, intelligent, and real. He makes implausible situations (such as a cold war between the US and the Netherlands) feel both believable and appropriate.<br />The characters are wonderfully drawn. I was in love with Oscar-- the fast-talking campaign manager who isn't quite human but can always find the angle in a situation. I believed in his odd relationship with the unlikely and awkward Dr. Penninger simply because it was so improbable but at the same time so true.<br />I can understand why the ending felt unsatisfying to a lot of readers, because it fails to hand you simple or predictable resolution. Indeed, a lot like life, the plot almost fades away, leaving us with the main characters' relationship as the primary movement in the novel. Oddly appropriate for a book written about a time where everyone seems to be frantically sitting still, but grantedly atypical for science fiction.	2001-01-09

And while I really appreciated those anecdotes, I didn't find that he really earned my belief. I often found that he made leaps of logic in the way he lay the thing out that were expected to stand more on the charmingness of the stories and/or the pithiness of the quotations that preface each chapter than on a real well-constructed argument. I often didn't follow how he got from point C to point D and frankly I found many of the connections that he made rather streched in appropriateness.<br />This said, Dyson is clearly a very smart guy with a lot of interesting things to say on the topic, so despite my concerns/disbelief, the book is a worthwhile read.	2001-01-09

Or at least, that's the feeling I get from talking to my friends.  What can I say about the book that hasn't already been said?

This is not a book that you try to sit down and read in a single sitting-- each of the strategies deserves its own session and a great deal of thought. It is worth the time to go through it several times, and to go back and review parts that you had read earlier before going further.<br /><br />I can think of all kinds of ways that this book could be valuable for someone-- business, art, interpersonal relationships. But aside from potentially valuable, it is also quite lovely. To be read, enjoyed, savoured.	2001-01-08

That act of kindness leads him into a kind of friendship which eventually takes him to Tijuana Airport and finally jail.<br />This is the most complex, and ultimately (I think) the most bitter of Chandler's novels. Although Marlowe goes through the motions of solving the murder mystery, the real villain in the end is the whole stinking human race and the price that it extracts from a person for moments of softness and concern. It's beautifully written-- incisive, clear, and with a caustic bite that stays with you long after the book is over.	2001-01-08

Unfortunately, this is where the satisfaction ends. The plot (as noted in the editorial reviews, based on an 'evil other' theme) is confused-- I don't need a no-brainer book, but in a horror book I shouldn't have to constantly jump back and forth to figure out what I just read either. The relationship between Ned and his (not) twin is unclear as is the nature of his powers. I agree with the reviewer who suggested Straub return to the basics.	2001-01-07

When I first heard about this book, I didn't want to read it-- I was frankly in a modern interpretation of Virginia Woolf. She is one of my favorite writers and not someone that I trust another writer to touch and not distort. In the end, I read it for my book club. I did Cunningham a major disservice with my suspicion, because this book is both a worthy homage to Woolf and a moving novel in its own right.<br /><br />_The Hours_ weaves together the lives of different women, illuminating the threads that link suicide, artistry, and failure. These links are made even stronger by the resonances between this book and _Mrs. Dalloway_. (I believe you can read this without having read _Mrs. Dalloway_, by the way. It should stand on its own without problem.)<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2001-01-07

Is it an accident, or is it murder? Mix in a too-young fiancee, Inspector Wexford, a daughter who may not be a daughter, and a trip to the south of France and you have another very readable Rendell. Very typical for her work, never getting far from the mold-- I find that her best books are the ones that deviate in some way from the typical Wexford mysteries.	2001-01-07

With the help of Peter Straub, King takes a detour into fantasy and does it with the same style and flair that he brought to horror with The Stand. This story about young Jack travelling in two worlds to save his mother's life is a classic of the genre-- well-written, tightly plotted, and a compulsive read.	2000-12-14

Unfortunately, the rest of the book fails to live up to that excellent beginning.<br />While Lahiri's writing is clearly well-crafted, she seems to lack a sense of irony, and that lack all too often creates a rather precious tone to this collection. Too much of it has the feel of workshop stories-- writing created in an MFA program somewhere and aiming at the small press market--<br />There *are* exceptionally good stories here, &quot;Sexy&quot; and &quot;This Blessed House&quot; both live up to the standards set by the first, but this is a writer whose voice needs to mature, in my opinion.	2000-12-13

At that point, it may gain cult status, who knows?<br />I had to give this book one extra star for sheer creativity-- whether it was the farm-wife who was (*ahem*) extra-close to her sheep or whether it was the cruddy curse of the human king, Cullen clearly doesn't have a problem with his imagination.<br />The plot was tedious, nothing more than an excuse to feature the various anatomical ways that elves, dwarves, deer, sheep, humans, and chickens (this is not an exaggeration) can interact. Even the erotica had very little virtue except a clearly vivid imagination behind it.<br />Champions of the very strange may get something out of this.	2000-12-13

I agree with the other reviewer who says that it's more like a Gerstner biography than properly a look at the turnaround itself-- more interesting to me would have been less personality and more a look at how a pure business methodology approach (a la McKinsey) replaced the former technical focus and how that impacted the company. While it was amusing to get a feel of the personalities, it was often distracting when trying to read for a real case study.	2000-12-10

A young girl who wants to marry a Reverend's son insists that her father wasn't a murderer. But Wexford is sure that the right man had hanged for the crime, and he should know because it had been his first murder case...<br />Ruth Rendell is generally a fairly reliably entertaining writer and my low rating is really an exception. The trouble for me was that the ending was extremely obvious from a very early point-- unfortunately I read the rest of the book with a growing sense of disappointment that the answer to the mystery took the easy way out. Skip this one.	2000-12-10

I couldn't disagree more. It's easy to focus on the superficial-- a couple is dead, and the book is about what happens to them after they're dead. But it's much more than that-- it's an excavation of all the little histories that brought them to that point-- that being deadness with his hand on her leg.<br />I would not call this an uplifting book. There is certainly room in Crace's universe for love and moments of joy, but these things are sandwiched between distance, disillusion, and (of course) the obvious decay. The book seems to say that we should take our moments of grace where we find them, even when they occur post-mortem.<br />Thought-provoking, well written, and well worth reading.	2000-12-10

Too good to be true? Even in her old age, Miss Marple is caught in a mystery.<br /><br />Perhaps not the strongest Miss Marple, but with many of the elements that made her a great character. It is interesting how much the focus on her age creates an air of melancholy around the book. Miss Marple becomes a pre-war artifact in her own right. I suspect that this aspect alone would make this book particularly interesting for people interested in Christie biographic material.	2000-12-09

Even though I liked the character of Phineas Poe and liked the tone of the book, I didn't find anything really satisfying about it and I was not very charmed with the urban legend come to life aspect of the plot.

The second Coupland I read was Microserfs which I thought was a really successful book-- everything I'd been frustrated that Girlfriend was not.<br />Shampoo Planet is somewhere in the middle. It has many of the same wonderful elements as Microserfs, but somehow it lacks just a little bit of the heart. It's a little too glib, or something. The success-driven son of a hippie mom is sent off-course when his French summer fling appears on his doorstep. It's a typical Coupland premise-- and I don't honestly know where it goes not quite right-- perhaps something about the resolution of Stephanie felt too easy? Not sure.<br />Don't misunderstand, it's still a good read, still something I'd recommend. Coupland is, at least, a talented writer.	2000-12-02

But for me, not as good as I expected.	2000-12-02

Dunmore is clearly a talented writer and well-able to spin a moving tale. However.<br />Despite a promising start, this book about the relationship between two sisters never quite manags to gel. There are elements of a murder mystery, characters that you'd find in a Doris Lessing novel, and a plausible set up to bring the whole cast together. Taken individually, these things are fine, but instead of blending to a harmonious whole, the various aspects undermine each other and I found myself getting irritated by the skeletons in the closet while I was trying to concentrate on the emotional landscape.<br />Too bad.	2000-11-12

Like millions of people, Madeleine L'Engle became a childhood fixture of  mine with the Wrinkle in Time series.

The revised edition (which this is) contains a wide  and well-chosen selection of Lowell's poetry. He notes in the foreword that  he tried to choose possible sequences rather than just greatest hits out of  context. This effort is visible and the book flows together like almost one  book instead of a career's overview.<br />What was interesting for me as I  read it was that I was reading a used copy which was liberally marked up  with underlines and notes of various kinds. Normally, this drives me crazy  and as it was in pencil I began by first erasing five pages worth of notes  and then reading on myself. Gradually, however, about one third through the  book I noticed that whoever it was that had owned the book before shared a  lot of tastes with me. I started enjoying his/her remarks and notitions and  it felt like I was having a little conversation about the book.<br />The  former owner underlined without comment the line where Lowell comments he  &quot;lies to friends and tells the truth in print&quot;. He circled the  &quot;Long Summer&quot; sequence titles and placed an awed exclamation  point after Lowell's poem for Ford Madox Ford. We both, apparently love  &quot;Margaret Fuller Drowned&quot; as it rated one of only three poems  marked with a star in the whole book.<br />It was a wonderful book, and while  this shouldn't be construed as license to mark up books (I still find it a  barbaric habit), it was also a good conversation.	2000-08-20

Bear uses the  characters of a biologist coming off a failed marriage, a disgraced  paleontologist, and a government disease specialist to carry the plot that  is meant to be an answer to this 'what if'.<br />The approach is fresh, and  well-written. My sole complaint was that I felt like he chose a very  &quot;good scientist/bad scientist&quot; approach to members of the  government and scientific communities and created an artificial kind of  opposition that may have made us like his characters better but weakened  the lovely complexity that he'd otherwise achieved. I think he could have  respected his readers enough to let us make our own judgements without  painting the character actions in such big obvious strokes. It's a common  failing, but Bear's a good enough writer that seeing it here disappointed  me.	2000-08-20

I am not an anthropologist, and I am not qualified to judge the claims of either Mead's detractors or defenders. Clearly, she was writing as the  product of her time-- and in fact noted in the preface to the 1952 edition  that this kind of book would provide more evidence about the time and place  the author was from than about the culture being studied.<br />It is certainly  a pleasurable book to read. She paints a picture of an approach to  childhood that sets ours off in a not-too-flattering light-- it  successfully questions the values of her own culture regardless of how well  it captures Samoan culture. I can understand why people from Samoa might  find that &quot;regardless&quot; offensive, but I find it (again) a rather  hopeless thing to try and judge. I do not find this book less valuable  because I question its truth-- I do not know any scholarly book from the  1920s whose veracity would not be tested-- and at this point in time I  think everyone who reads it is not accepting it as an authoritative  view.<br />File it under history of our cultural thought or under Utopian  philosophy if you'd rather not file it under anthropology-- but I'd still  recommend that you read it and file it somewhere.	2000-08-13

By the time Verity had been running around  Cincinnati for a while, I was heartily sick of the whole thing and found  there to be *way* too many pages to string out her secret.

I've certainly never seen a book with so many layers written in such a determinedly spare way. There are a lot of tiny points that jar, but I'm lead to the conclusion that  Coetzee meant them to, by showing how the layers of the world create some  strange plot threads when you see them all together.<br />What I mean is that  a character's action when viewed as a personal narrative may seem to make  little sense, but becomes a necessary part of reading the book as parable.  Alternatively, the parable is broken apart by the vibrant and real (all the  more real *because* they are opaque) characters Coetzee creates. The dogs,  Lucy, the rapes, South Africa, and the relationships of fathers and  daughters manage to be both potent as symbols and potent as real objects in  the space of the book.<br />The book is the hangover after the party. The  early morning feeling of depressed and shallow emotion. The landscape of  living in the world you've made, even when you don't like the world very  much at all.<br />I don't understand it or my reactions in response to reading  it.

She's not less fascinating because there were so many things to dislike (depressing love affairs, callousness about pets, and a  definite preference for fascism).<br />What Souhami manages to do is to paint  a picture that owns the negative without playing down the brave and even  important side to Hall's life.

So the interpretation of some of these authors as to what constitutes a zombie is  a little in question. In the Anne Rice story (lifted pretty directly from  the Witching Hour, I believe) a zombie is anyone who doesn't respond and is  under a spell. In others we get the more classical Haitian zombie. In the  Robert Silverberg story the zombies are what we become when we're inhabited  by passengers from somewhere else. Many of the stories are meant to be  comic or satirical, and those-- for me-- packed the weakest punch. Others,  like &quot;Emma's Daughter&quot; (by Alan Rodgers) and &quot;Though I Walk  Through the Valley&quot; are really impressive and inventive variations on  the theme.	2000-07-29

Civil disaster causes racial tension to explode in  an already divided south. Religious weirdos become weirder when cut off  from the civilized world by disaster. Businessmen see it as financial  oopportunity and struggle to get to a phone and make money. Youth hold the  hope of the future. Etc.

To support this, Laurel reconciles the seemingly  disparate and relates user interface design with producing a play in  theater. For example, the way she brings in the Freytag triangle works very  well.<br />This said, I wish I wish that we would see a book from Laurel (or  from one of her other usability guru companions) that treats with  more  recent issues-- particularly the Internet. I think she's one of the  smartest people out there in the field, and I try to read what she's  written, but I'm getting tired of reading about Habitat, Guides, and the  Holodek on Star Trek. That's not the fault of the book, given that it came  out pre-Internet hype, but it did inflect the reading experience with some  weariness.	2000-07-22

They begin in a hospital for the  criminally insane and have to navigate a long series of red herrings to  finally come to a solution.<br />The parts in the hospital are really  fascinating, and carry that Delaware flavor I like best-- the part where I  feel like he has a real job whose knowledge he's able to leverage.

The woman did not die, but instead received a series of visions of Christ's passion. These visions are what is recorded  in this book in both short (written more closely after the incident) and  long (written much later, after more contemplation) versions. She then  became an anchoress living as a recluse in a cell attached to the  churchyard of St. Julian in Norwich.<br />Julian's visions, even in  translation, are luminous and joyful. She received the assurance that God  will, in the end, make all well. The meaning of it all, as she says, is  Love. This is one of the most vivid constructions of the medieval image of  Christ as mother and is (justly) famous as such. The showings are moving  and beautiful.<br />The Paulist Press/Colledge translation is almost comical  in its padding.

Thompson is  far too clever by half with the names (Jane A. Crostic and A.N. Other) and  ties in Oitar (where the alien Oi Paz comes from) a little too neatly with  earth.

While I was  reading it, I genuinely wanted to read it, and the writing pulled me all  the way through to the end.<br />The book centers around a young merchant's  daughter named Karigan who finds a dying messenger by the side of the road  and promises to bring his message to the King, completing his mission.<br />The big However attached to the book are the many familiar elements  which were so familiar as to jar the reading experience. While fantasy  can't avoid some derivative aspects, there are rather loud echos of Tolkien  and Lackey that seem too close for comfort. This is not to say that the  book's overall tone is derivative-- it isn't-- it's just that some of the  specific elements will leave the reader with a nasty sense of deja vu. It  also seems that Karigan ends up too much at the center of absolutely every  conflict far too quickly, but-- okay-- that's an understandable trait given  that she's the only main character.<br />A book to hold on to, a writer to  keep a close eye on.	2000-06-28

Particularly for expats living here in the Netherlands, it sets a good base for understanding Dutch life-- but I  think it's the sort of book that anyone who loves history would  enjoy.<br />Embarassment of Riches focuses on almost every element of Dutch  life-- political sphere, standard of living, role of women, treatment of  children, moral taboos, legal standards, attitudes towards money and so  much more.

Convinced that this is how it's meant to be,  Medusa enlists the help of a born loser to put all the brainwaves back  together again.<br /><br />The Cosmic Rape is one of these utopia vision sci-fi novels that seemed to populate the late 50s/early 60s. Sturgeon is a fine writer, and his recognizable style makes it immediately much more than the sum of its parts. The characters are grubbily and wonderfully real, even if the plot can't always say the same for itself.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of science fiction writing of the period, and for fans of Sturgeon.	2000-06-23

But there you go.<br />I was instantly annoyed by the Jared-the-ghost opening. It  felt like plastic somehow and wasn't a good beginning. But in any case I  quickly recovered during the charming first half of this book-- I loved it  through the seventies friends and through the girlfriend in a coma and the  unexpected daughter. I even forgave Jared-the-ghost because references were  worked in so nicely.<br />Then the book arrived at the turning point-- for  spoiler's sake I won't say more about what specifically disappointed me  from there on out, but I was *heavily* disappointed. The first half of the  book was well-written and charming while the second half transformed into a  heavy-handed morality play written by a strange crossbreed of Sheri S.  Tepper and Dean Koontz (not a pretty thing). Bleah.<br />Weighing it up, I'm  still not sure which side wins. I hated the second half so much that I  can't feel the same about the first, but on the other hand a book with that  first hand in it can't be all bad... maybe Jared-the-ghost is standing on  the scales of badness or maybe he gets points for reminding me of one of my  favorite Smith's song. Dunno.<br />I wonder if this really is atypical  Coupland. I suppose I'll need to try at least one or two others.	2000-06-23

Reading it again  after all this time was an interesting experience and I felt a lot of  respect for stories that hadn't stuck in my mind the first time like  &quot;Sometimes They Come Back&quot;, &quot;I Know What You Need&quot;, and  &quot;The Last Rung on the Ladder&quot;.<br />In his foreward, King says that  he's not a writer as much as a man with a marketable obsession. And while  his career does not always intersect with my tastes, I must respectfully  disagree on this point.	2000-06-17

First of all, there was the whole Booker Prize thing. Second of all, good word of mouth. Anyways, it's hard to live up to high expectations and  that may have something to do with the harshness of my  response.<br />Amsterdam is beautifully written. McEwan does an amazing job of  economically sketching Molly's lovers. For the first half of the book, the  book carries you along with the plot-- circling through the world that the  dead Molly leaves behind. <br />It goes *badly* wrong at the end. Or, I should  say that the ending doesn't match with the beginning-- I'd bet there are  people out there who don't like the start at all, but really like the  conclusion. A writer has to earn the right to get from point A to point M  in his novel-- McEwan doesn't earn the rather extreme jumps that he made.	2000-06-17

Although naturally passive, she's forced by circumstance into becoming a woman who is able to act on her own behalf.<br />Unique in the fantasy genre in that it refuses to compromise and fall into cliches.

He embarks on a  globally comparative and ultimately reconciliatory survey of kinds of myth  and their relative societal roles. Please note that there is a fair amount  of debate as to both the accuracy and ethics of trying to mine the  universal from global myth in this fashion, but however you come down in  that particular debate, The Masks of God is, on its own terms, a monumental  achievement.	2000-06-11

The amazing thing is that the book doesn't preach, it just  sees-- Marlowe witnesses the world with a kind of fatalistic and  dispassionate affection-- the things people do to each other; the things  people do to themselves.

Even after I made it off the plane, I had to finish reading before I  attended to other business. It asks what would happen if a group of people  you knew were being killed one by one and you had the distinct idea that  you were next, but nobody could prove that murder was involved? There are  holes I could pick in the plot, but I should say that they didn't bother me  while I was reading it.	2000-06-06

What's interesting about this book is that the authors do a  wonderful job of taking substantial research, abstracting the trends, and  rendering their findings into very clear and usable models and messages  that can help most managers who are thinking about growth. It was  particularly interesting for me, as I work as an ebusiness consultant for a  large IT integrator and many of my customers are trying to start new  staircases (as described in the book) via Internet channels and I can  immediately see the applicability of Alchemy to what they're trying to  do.<br />The book is a quick read (almost comically quick, given the price)  and mercifully low on buzz words. Right now, I don't see the appendix as  being particularly useful, but I may find it more so later. Annotating the  bibliography would have added a lot of value.	2000-06-05

After his induction, he expects to be able to protect his king and kingdom, but instead is bound to a snivelling noble whose claim on his time is being related to the mistress of the king.<br /><br />The politics of the kingdom in the novel are realistic, which is probably the best thing about the book. Duncan is clearly a skilled writer, and the book flows well and kept me hooked as a reader. I was less enchanted by the pacing-- it was a little distracting to have years flying by without warning in such significant pieces. I am curious how that will be continued or resolved in later books.<br /><br />The idea of the Blades is an interesting one. It will probably be worth picking up the second installment in the series.	2000-06-04

The biography was well written, and certainly motivated me to keep reading.<br /><br />I knew a fair amount about Akhmatova and Tsvetayeva going in to reading this book and it felt like it filled in missing pieces of the same story. For me, the only unfortunate aspect was the nagging feeling that Hingley was somehow taking sides in the veracity of the various women in Pasternak's life. It added a weird gossipy kind of tone to some of the issues that were discussed.<br /><br />Still a commendable effort, and recommended if you are looking for a decent Pasternak biography.	2000-06-04

I'm here to witness that even people as seriously math-challenged as I am can participate in this wonderful book. It took me a *long* time to read-- I flipped back and forth, beat the pages up, asked my more math-oriented  friends for help. I spent forever trying to solve the MU exercise. It was  worth it. I still feel like I understood parts of it only in intuitive  flashes, but those flashes showed me a room more interesting than most of  the well-lit chambers ordinary books provide.<br />Reading Godel, Escher, Bach  is like joining a club. People who see you reading it will open spontaneous  conversations and often gift you with unexpected insights. (I had a  fascinating conversation with a total stranger about Godel's theorem.)<br />Wish I could give more than five stars.	2000-06-02

The history of the two cities, the difference in philosophies of the Rings, the mysterious other races-- it's a good set-up. The exploration of the world  happens through the eyes of the three brothers of the Rhomatum ruling  family, driven by their conflicts with each other and with their Aunt (the  villain of the piece).<br />The book was a slow start, at least in part  because the author seemed determined to get all the elements of the world  in at once. While the interaction between the brothers is well-written and  fresh, some of the plot points are rather hackneyed and the motivations of  the other characters don't seem nearly as considered or complex.<br />Despite  the flaws, the book has a lot of potential, so really call it a 3+.

However, I also do not think that it positions itself to be. If you are familiar with Mitford as a biographer, then you should expect this to be written with her usual style.<br /><br />Mitford's voice is  laconic and dry. One of the best things about her biographical writings is that despite that dryness, her affection for her subjects is clearly visible. Certainly she is one of the few historical biographers who regularly make me laugh out loud when I read the work.<br /><br />Frederick the Great was a monarch that I knew very little about  from a period of which I had only vague knowledge. I shut the book feeling that I had gained a good high level understanding as well as a real desire to read further. It is difficult for me to assess how satisfying it would be for someone who is a real scholar of the period.<br /><br />A Mitford biography is always a great gift for armchair historians, or for general readers who do not think that they will enjoy biographies. Reading this kind of entertaining work might also be a good way to tempt younger readers into exploring history.	2000-06-01

I've read all about Gibson's books, criticism, reviews, fanatic praise-- and I find it interesting that Idoru really stands up  against the pressure of the expectations.<br />A rock star (Rez) who has been  just slightly out of step with the modern culture falls in love with an  avatar of the modern culture-- the virtual reality  idoru star Rei Toei. In  the persons of Chia and Colin Laney we see Rez's fans, handlers, and  enemies descend on Tokyo-- determined to find out what's going on.<br />The  book is all about virtual realities-- cities in the cracks of the computer  systems, virtual stars who are becoming real, Kafka theme bars, and fans  who meet in virtual clubhouses with constructed images. I said it was about  the realities themselves, but really it seems to be about how the  characters struggle and cope with the layers around them.<br />Very  well-written. In places, I found some plot points to be a little  distracting. I wished other areas were more fully developed. But Gibson  works with a clear, straight-forward elegance and ultimately a kind of  wonderful sweetness. Good read.	2000-06-01

On the one hand, we can sympathize with Anna for wanting a relationship that feels real to her. On the other hand, she is not made to  be a hero and I expect that more than one reader had mixed feelings about  the consequences of her actions with Leo. It's a book about a woman's  desire to be swept away by love, and what happens when she gets her wish in  the context of being the custodian of a small child. The writing is clear  and the book is a quick read.	2000-05-31

Although there are flashes of personal insight-- particularly religious  insight-- these journals are more the record of Mormonism and the issues  about it that concerned Smith as he moved across the country. From lists of  payments and donations, to intra-faith quarrels, to visions of Nauvoo, to  complaints about lawsuits, it gives a clear day-to-day picture of the man  and his movement.<br />The diaries and journals were written by a mix of  Joseph Smith and various secretaries acting in his name. In the  introduction, the editor comments that he was trying for ease of reading  rather than faithful photostatic reproduction-- and I have to say that I  would have hated to see what happened if he'd tried for faithful, because  the major problem I had with the book was that I found it very difficult to  read-- all shorthand, omitted words, crossed out words, and misspellings  were noted as they occurred in the text and while I'm sure that it's more  valuable as a scholarly text because of the inclusion, it was very  distracting.  Also, some annotations about historical events wouldn't be  amiss rather than the reader always being forced to refer to the (very  sketchy) timeline at the beginning. I suppose that most people who will  read this would be scholars of Mormon history rather than people with a  more casual interest, but it would have illuminated parts of this book much  more clearly for readers like myself.	2000-05-28

Reginald Hill currently produces some of the most intelligent and best written mysteries on the market. On Beulah Height (the 17th Dalziel and Pascoe novel) is a fine series entry and should appeal to long-time Hill fans and new readers alike.<br /><br />A town in Yorkshire doomed by a reservoir project had been the scene of a terrifying series of child disappearances 15 years ago. Dalziel had been one of the investigating officers on the case. The prime suspect was never caught. The case is reopened when the disappearances begin again, and Dalziel finds the original cast of characters reassembled, with some in surprising new roles.<br /><br />If you are new to Hill as a writer, you are in for a real treat. He has been called the golden age detective writer for our own time, and the title is well deserved. His mysteries are witty, erudite, funny and full of strong and well-written characters. On Beulah Height is a good example of his work, and I would recommend it.	2000-05-10

The end notes are annoying and Norman can have a tendancy to ramble and I guess that not everyone would find that charming. However, I assert that the strengths of the book more than make up for its weaknesses-- it is an important book,  and one that anyone engaged in designing things for other people should  read.<br />The central point is simple-- the needs of the user are different  from the needs of the designer. The designer might want everyone's actions  with his system to be precise, the user might need to have a &quot;good  enough&quot; range of precision approximation. The designer wants to make  the knobs the same so they look good together, the user wants to be able to  tell quickly which knob applies to which function. It's a basic concept  that can't (particularly on the Internet today) be repeated often  enough.<br />Norman looks at the kinds of errors people make in usage and  discusses how designers can plan to prevent these kind of errors. He  discusses some of the basic things that users find valuable and walks the  reader through some classic (and often funny, because so recognizable)  design errors.<br />The writing is clean and (with the exception of the  aforementioned rambling) very clear. Norman's voice is full of humor and a  real passion for the subject, and that voice is conveyed very well by the  book.	2000-05-09

He mourns because he'd wanted to be a miniaturist, but instead  has elephantiasis. Even though the character never recurs, I thought about  him through the huge landscape of this book.<br />Rushdie has the eye for  detail of a miniaturist, but writes in epic sweeps, fitting in countless  lives and actions. If done badly, this would have been nearly impossible to  read, but the execution is brilliant and instead gives the impression of a  huge rich tapestry running by like film.<br />The book is about the Midnight's  Children (children born in the first hour after the birth of India as a  nation) and their erstwhile leader Saleem Sinai. It traces him (and them)  through childhood, the creation of Pakistan, and beyond. Even though the  events are crucial, to have an understanding of the plot won't give you any  help with the book.<br />My advice to people attempting Midnight's Children is  to not worry too much about catching and understanding every detail. Yes,  knowing more about Indian history will make certain things clear (although  it may obscure others), but there's so much here that it isn't really  necessary. I already know that this is a book I'm going to re-read, and  that will be the chance to pick up missing pieces.<br />One of the highest of  recommends.	2000-04-30

In 1509 Erasmus wrote Praise of Folly for the amusement of his learned friend Thomas More (author of Utopia). He wrote in the character of Folly, daughter of Money and Youthfulness. Folly declaims on the foibles of mankind-- sometimes in a light and humorous vein and sometimes taking  careful and deadly aim at beliefs and abuses of the time.<br />One of the  wonderful things about reading historical satire is that you get a sense  both of the specificity of the time it was written in as well as of the  general and enduring idiocies of mankind. Praise of Folly is a great book  because it is equal parts familiar (railing about the pedantic nature of  scholars) and exotic (discussing the interaction of church and heretics).  The book is published together with the Letter to Martin Dorp, defending  Praise of Folly to Dorp against charages of being insulting to theologians  in general.<br />The Radice translation is clear, and blessedly puts the notes  at the bottom of each page, making them readable. The book also comes with  a context-providing introduction and bibliography.	2000-04-30

Even though Alleyn appears near the end, he's not  involved for long enough to provide his typical witty effect.<br />On the  other hand, the characters here are among her most vivid-- including  ringworm-ridden Panty and the smarmy Cedric. For stronger Marsh I'd  recommend Artists in Crime, Death and the Dancing Footman, or Died in the  Wool.	2000-04-24

The drug becomes a kind of religion, with fanatic users arguing that they really are  transported into Perky Pat's world and that the experience constitutes a  kind of Holy communion. Meanwhile, Palmer Eldritch returns from his ten  year journey bearing a new kind of drug-- Chew-Z-- a competitor to Can-D.  He claims that while Can-D promises a new life Chew-Z can actually provide  it. However, there seem to be more than a few catches...<br />A book that  deals with Dick's perennial obsessions-- God, the nature of reality, and  the experience of the Holy.

However, a human named David who wants to be Maulkian is jealous.  Plots ensue.<br />It's rare that I have *nothing* good to say about a book.  But the characters were contrived, the plot logic was more or less  non-existant, and there was nothing distinguished about the writing  quality.<br />Pass by, gentle reader.	2000-04-24

Those worries are more than born out by a murder and a series of violent attempts on the lives of various manor  inhabitants. Miss Marple needs all her experience to figure who is behind  all the crimes.<br />Ordinarily I love Miss Marple mysteries, but this one is  not Christie's best. Miss Marple seems out of her element and there isn't  enough St. Mary Mead insight to provide its usual enchantment.	2000-04-23

It's almost entirely unleavened with the lightness or spaces you'd expect from prose, even autobiographical prose, and this can make it very hard to read in  places.<br />Initially, as I was reading the book, I was really resistant to  it. Even though beautifully written, it was frustrating to wade through the  encyclopedic portrait of her girlhood, and I truthfully didn't understand  the point of all the microscopic detail.<br />However, when I reached the  latter part of the book, with the attention to her studies, I started to  feel like I understood. This felt to me, in the end, to be an exhaustive  catalogue of the person who began to think, so we (the reader) could come  to understand why she thought the way she did. She doesn't spare herself,  uncompromisingly addressing her faults and sharing the caustic remark that  Weil had to make about her. She also provides a sense of her biography via  books-- discussing what books she was reading when and how they impacted  her. As such, I finally found this book extremely  valuable.<br />Unfortunately, I think a lot of people start here with  Beauvoir, and in my opinion that's a serious mistake. To begin with her  prose, I'd recommend 'She Came to Stay' or 'The Woman Destroyed'. For a  biographic overview I'd recommend Dierdre Bair's biography. I'm going to be  looking forward, myself, to reading volume 2 of the autobiography.	2000-04-23

Almost everyobody in the Fens has a reason to kill Lorrimer, which complicates the matter for  Dalgliesh.

If you aren't familiar with the literature of the area, this book  might be moderately helpful.<br />In the true classic supermarket book  tradition, this book has the feeling of a semi-scholarly survey which was  given to an editor who then added a plethora! of! exclamation! points! and  unrelated bits about Christ being an alien.

Parts of it (particularly the essays grouped under 'Creativity and Design' and 'Users and Contexts') are very useful for today's interface design world.  However there are sections (particularly the section on 'New Directions')  where it feels *very* dated and really suffers from being written before  Internet time.<br />An extremely impressive group of writers participates.  Including: Howard Rheingold, Don Norman, Bruce Tognazzini, Nicholas  Negroponte, Alan Kay, Timothy Leary and Gitta Salomon.  It's definitely  worth a read, but don't be afraid (unless you're a Macintosh history buff)  to skip large sections.	2000-04-19

Once again, Murdoch  visits the question of the Good and how it applies to human life. This time  the question centers around Marcus, who anchors the novel as a character  from myth-- sometimes a saint, sometimes Prospero, sometimes a lunatic.  Each of the other characters in the book have to find their way (through  eccentric marriages, chaste romances, resurrections, and mysticism) in a  world where all the familiar rules no longer apply. All the solutions  (where there are solutions) are complicated and costly.<br />As usual, the  writing is crisp and incisive, the characters well-formed and very  complete. One of the great Murdoch novels.	2000-04-13

Two things struck me about the experience of re-reading it. One is that while I can't  claim full understanding, I no longer found myself struggling with the form  in order to read the book. The second is how much more resonant the book  became for me now that I'm older and can identify more with Mrs. Ramsey  instead of seeing the book only through the character of Lily Briscoe.<br />To  the Lighthouse centers around the Ramsey family and the people they bring  in their wake to their home on the Isle of Skye. Families in the world of  this book are fragile things. The first half creates the Ramsey family  group so well that when the second half is without it, the reader is  constantly aware of the ghost images standing in the empty spaces.  Meanwhile, Lily tries to understand the world she's in and make her  painting by meditating about the Ramseys and how much has changed in the  world around them.<br />The book is tremendously beautiful and sad. I'll look  forward to re-reading it again in another ten years.	2000-04-11

From that fact, the book goes on to build a work of fiction, painting a picture about what might have happened.<br /><br />The novel is well-written, but the pacing is odd, which makes the book difficult to enter. This could have been an artifact of the translation. I cannot read the original Spanish, but the English felt stilted throughout the book, and was often frustrating to read.<br /><br />There were enough good things to explain the reputation, and I may well pick up a book by another translator.	2000-04-05

However, the good research wasn't nearly enough to save this novel. The premise of the book is that at the end of  the second world war, the nazis released some kind of virus that wiped out  most of the world population rather than admitting defeat. The problems are  as follows:<br />1. He used a noir-ish tone for his characters, but it wasn't  well done and instead of stylish, it just came across as badly  written.<br />2. The constant action scenes were better suited to a bad film  than a bad novel.<br />3. The characters were cardboard cut-outs, and their  actions in relation to each other made very little sense at all.<br />Total  summation: Skip this one.	2000-04-05

He has the real knack of cementing his stories with the necessary details of life. His characters don't spend very much time fulfilling prophecies and being  whisked willy-nilly through interdimensional portals, instead they stand  guard duty and clean sewers and have to deal with the real problems of  cleaning up a city after you've conquered it.<br />Colors of Chaos covers a  lot of the same ground as  the Magic Engineer, only this time from the  point of view of Cerryl the white mage (whose boyhood had been covered in  The White Order). My primary problem with this retelling was that it's been  a while since I read the Magic Engineer, so I didn't have the best  recollection of all the scenes so instead of getting a nice dual  perspective, I got a nagging sense of 'have I read this before?'. Also,  this was a first time with a Modesitt book that I've ever had a sense of  the book being a little bit too long in places.<br />The ability of Modesitt  to change the protagonists from black to white mages only highlights his  ability to show both sides of a matter with balance and wisdom.

I felt angry that it felt like he blamed her for the destruction around her, but then it seemed like his attitude was much more complicated  than blame.<br /><br />When She was Good is almost an essay on the nature of morality in constrained circumstances and the cost of high standards. Roth writes his story in a very linear way. It has the plot and form of a Douglas Sirk weepie-- family melodrama in a straight-up fairly realistic style. I liked it, but it is so straight up that sometimes it feels a touch old-fashioned. In general, however, I found the form and conceit to work very well.<br /><br />There are moments where the authorial presence felt too heavy-handed. The book works best with explosive material when it treads very lightly. It may really be 4.5 stars instead of 5, but it is thought-provoking enough that I find it worth giving it the benefit of the doubt.	2000-04-03

It begins with Agamemnon returning home triumphant from the Trojan war only to be struck  down (together with the tragic Cassandra) by his wife Clytaemnestra. Her  motives while just (he sacrificed their daughter Iphigeneia to calm the  winds) are impure because of her adultery with Aegisthus.<br />The second play  is the vehicle for Clytaemnestra's punishment, as her son Orestes returns  to kill both her and Aegisthus with the help of his sister  Electra.<br />Finally, the Eumenides has the trial of Orestes by Athena, as  she stops the furies from taking him in return for the blood-guilt he  incurred for killing his mother. The Eumenides provides the way to end the  cycle of revenge by banishing the furies from active participation in the  world of men.<br />The cycle can be read in any number of ways. The  introduction to the Penguin/Fagles translation contains a summary of the  various readings. I kept wondering what Proteus, the missing fourth  satyr-play would have provided. We read it so clearly as a trilogy and the  Eumenides has such a harmonious ending that I can't help but wonder if the  circle closed in the third play reopens in the fourth or if it was  something else entirely.<br />My only complaint about the book is that in the  Fagles translation the notes are at the back of the book rather than  assigned per page, and I find that a cumbersome style to read.	2000-04-02

I was interested in  reading them for their historical value. As such, it's a great read.  Through the verses, you get a look at the period's preoccupations-- who is  named pope, the future of France, alchemy, and the desire to distinguish  prophecy from astrology. Nostradamus has had an enduring impact on writing  since he put his prophecies on paper, and you can trace that legacy here  from the original verses.<br />The commentary-- Henry C. Robert's  interpretation taught me more about World War II than anything else-- he  seemed determined to prove that a disproportionate number of the verses  referred to the second World War. Probably unsurprising, given that he  first wrote his interpretations in 1947. However, he stretched so hard to  fit the words to his ideas, that it unfortunately made me suspect his  translation. I also could have done with more of an effort for establishing  on what basis he was assigning some of the meanings (explanation of period  symbolism, the alchemical references, etc.).<br />If I get a chance to buy  another translation version and compare, I probably will.	2000-03-29

I usually hate it when I dive into what I think is going to be a mystery, but instead is a collection of short stories featuring the detective I expected. Somehow the books always try and hide that it's short stories  rather than a novel, and I find them poorly developed because they don't  have the arc I've come to expect.<br />However, these short stories featuring  Lew Archer are solidly not terrible. The hard-boiled/noir-ish aesthetic  carries makes the lack of more developed characters acceptable. It moves  smoothly in the genre of tough guys and bad women who are really not too  bad at heart. Even the titles sound right-- &quot;Guilt Edged Blonde&quot;  and &quot;Gone Girl&quot;.<br />Pleasant surprise, even if I'd still rather  read a novel.	2000-03-29

Ray is the primary voice of the present in the novel, but the book shifts between all party members' POV of past events between them. The novel is very well woven. It gives us a hard look at the decisions people make and how these decisions become the life that they lead.<br /><br />I recently read an interview with Swift where he said he thought that there  was too much circularity between the media culture and the modern novel and talked about how much he respected writers like Faulkner. While it is difficult not to agree with that, I missed a certain circularity with *something* in Last Orders.<br /><br />It was such a beautiful little self-contained world, and for me that was both its strongest and weakest point. It may well be that not being British I miss the larger context of the book (just as you may miss textures in Faulkner if you are not familiar with southern culture) or it may just be that my taste runs towards more things that while not as perfect, reach farther. I don't know. But for me, as much as I admire the book, it felt a little bit lacking.	2000-03-24

It consists of two parts of unequal length-- the first shorter part by Guillaume de Lorris and the second longer part continued 40  years after de Lorris' death by Jean de Meun. Throughout the medieval  period, this was one of the  most widely read book in the French  language.<br />Scholars have rather endlessly debated how unified the allegory  really is, and the trend recently seems to have shifted to seeing the two  authors as less in opposition, and more composing a complete treatment of  courtly Love.<br />For the casual (non-academic) reader like myself, the  experience is rather less unified. The de Lorris section is quite lyrical  and fits more with what I imagine an allegorical dream poem to be. When  Idleness leads the dreamer into the garden of  Diversion and when Love  shoots him with the five deadly arrows that bind him to the Rose, the  imagery is compelling and lovely.<br />On the other hand, the second part,  while often *very* funny is much more obviously satirical with long  digressions that focus more on social mores than on the world of the  Dreamer as established in the first half. The effect is sort of like a  serious and literary Spike Jones song-- which is not at all a bad thing.	2000-03-18

Just for the books it added to my reading list, this book was  valuable.<br />The idea of the book that has stayed with me the most since I  read it is the idea that an artist neither accepts myth as historical fact,  nor rejects it as useless, but moves somewhere between those two extreme  poles to mine its history.<br />The book is dense, and not always easy to  read. It took me a long time to pick through it-- particularly in sections  with pages of quotations-- but it was ultimately quite rewarding. Being  only an amateur student of religion and mythology, I am ill-equipped to  judge the merits of its scholarship.	2000-03-17

Between this and Death Du Jour (Kathy Reichs) it seems like we're in a spurt of post-Heaven's Gate paranoia. Cults are bad. We get the message.<br />This is  not Faye Kellerman's best book. It's not even close. As far as the mystery  itself is concerned, this book would only rate 3 stars at best. The  situation feels more than a little contrived in a number of places and the  ending is overly sensational. I also think a lot of diehard Peter Dekker  fans may be turned off because we see rather significantly less of Rina  than we usually do.<br />What saves the book and made it (in the end) a good  read is the care with which Kellerman handles her family unit of Rina  Lazarus and Peter Dekker. The trials of Peter and his maturing step-sons  contain enough realism and conflict to keep the reader firmly hooked.  Kellerman provides enough resolution to leave us satisfied, but nicely sets  up the seeds of future problems for later books. Along the way she manages  to do some fairly intelligent musing on the differences between orthodox  religious adherents and cult members.<br />Worth a read, particularly if you  like the series.	2000-03-09

The characters (Jude and Sue,  primarily) can't live with the choices that law and religion demands, but  they can't live outside them either and their attempts to do so only drive  them down deeper. The central thesis of the book, and the one that was so  shocking a the time, was that these moral and legal strictures prevented  people from fulfilling their dreams and living happy lives. Jude the  Obscure challenges the sanctity of marriage by building a tragedy about  people trapped by its convention.<br />An important and challenging book. It  continues to be relevant today.	2000-03-01

That is, once I realized what it is. Or rather, what it isn't. This book is pushed as science fiction with names like Heinlein and Gibson mentioned on the cover  and it is science fiction in the sense that it's fiction set in the future  in a set-up generated by scientific advances-- but it isn't science fiction  in terms of adhering to classic genre rules or plot. Several points:<br />1)  This is a novel musing on the possibility of Utopia in a future where our  'greed and growth' (as the book puts it) have grown to dangerous  proportions.<br />2) Not a whole lot happens to anything except on an internal  and a narrowly interpersonal level. Don't look for action.<br />3)  Occasionally very dense passages heavily laced with current and historic  utopian thinkers. I've read 'em, so it meant something to me. I shudder to  think what it would have been like if I hadn't.<br />4) Charactization gets  lost, sometimes, in all the philosophizing. Roger, in particular, feels a  little bit stock.<br />5) The ending has some definite lameness. It's as  though he suddenly woke up and decided he had to put some action in, quick.  So he did.<br />If you go into the book while knowing all of the above, you  may well enjoy it quite a bit. If you go in expecting escapist genre  fiction, it's really going to suck.	2000-02-27

Wheeler tells of her travels through the modern Greek island of Evia-- exploring the remnants of ancient Greece (including the fascinating Dragon Houses) and the modern culture of the  island. This is a warts-and-all kind of book with Wheeler being constantly  harassed about her freckles and unmarried state and her opionions about  Margaret Thatcher. However, she doesn't neglect the good things-- like the  warm hospitality of the people and her good fortune in being able to stand  as koumbara to a Greek child.	2000-02-27

Set following the failed Scottish rebellion, 'Kidnapped' tells the story of young David Balfour, whose greedy uncle  tries to cheat him out of his inheritance by having him kidnapped and sold  in the American colonies as a slave. On the way, however, he befriends a  Jacobite rebel and is instead caught up in the Scottish troubles and has to  fight his way back to his home and claim his inheritance. The adventure is  all the more exciting because it feels like such a real world with all the  careful place-related detail Stevenson employs. While the language can be  difficult in places, that quickly fades once you get into the rhythm of the  book.	2000-02-23

Books	4	3	3	N	N	Marketing, Passivity, Disaster	Three unlikely characters interact in this social satire-- Glade, a passive girl with an American boyfriend; Barker, a bouncer who reads medieval history; and Jimmy, an eager young marketeer. A scheme to sell  soda pop via subliminal viral marketing brings these three characters into  contact and eventually conflict with evil American corporate men presiding  like Mephisto over the whole debacle.<br />Thomson is an extremely good  writer. Soft!, unfortunately, was missing something (particularly compared  to his other novels-- Five Gates of Hell or The Insult) and I'm not really  sure what it was. Glade may be a little too passive for us to care about,  or perhaps it's that we get the feeling that he didn't care about the  ending as much as he should, or maybe the satire isn't clear enough and we  really can't take these characters straight. It's still better than most  current novels and certainly not something I regret reading. I don't know--  I'll read it again in a month or two and see if I feel better about it.	2000-02-23

It ends with &quot;The Incubi of Parallel X&quot; which  concerns itself with aliens, parallel worlds, and a new dark age. Along the  way the stories (6 in total) wander through mysteriously murdered  scientists and tripartate aliens who are forced to assume human flesh. Also  entertaining are the anecdotes about various editors from Sturgeon's past  which preface every story.<br />Like Clifford Simak and Philip K. Dick, he's  as interested in character as in plot. The result is clear in this  collection of  well-written and very entertaining stories.	2000-02-23

That's the central question of The Lovely Ladies  and it's  one that extends into a fascinating mystery in the finest  Freeling tradition.

Fugitive Game is the exciting and often moving story of Kevin Mitnick, who  in this book seems more like an overgrown kid than the evil mastermind he's  made out to be elsewhere. It's given particular poignance now when you  realize how long Mitnick spent in jail for what was (in the end) a minor  array of crimes. Lots of government and law enforcement idiocy thrown in  for humorous spice. Good read.	2000-02-20

In this book, a planetary expedition looking for a lost hero finds instead a planet at the center of  the universe which might be an endless trap or might provide the answers to  all the questions that they could ever have. Simak  provides his usual  combination of off-beat characters-- an outlaw planet finder, a big game  hunter, a blind man who hears voices, and an alien being named Hoot. This  unlikely party  must each find a different path to the secret of the  planet.	2000-02-17

That suspension bridge of  disbelief shook and crashed about the time that we figure out that her  relative from another state is also involved. I think that this device was  meant to highlight the frightening nature of cults, but instead it just  makes the reader think that Reichs doesn't know how to write a plot.<br />On  the other hand, she clearly knows forensic medicine, and is a good enough  writer to bring forward information about that career in a way that  interests the reader. I also think that if you gave Temperance a halfway  decent plot, I might even like her as a character. The trouble is that when  everything around her is so contrived, it's hard to care about her as a  person.<br />I hope in her next book she takes some of her obvious talent and  aims it at the plot.	2000-02-14

That is, they can't seem to resist some kind of  transformative moment which saves the character-- some kind of stock  situation that, while tempting to believe, is ultimately unfulfilling  because it's so false.<br />The Book of Ruth doesn't write personal history  the way we want it to be. It writes history the way it so often is. Some  lives are wasted. Some abusive relationships aren't all bad. Some people  never recover, no matter how much you wish they would. While this book  doesn't close the door on Ruth, it doesn't leave you with a satisfying road  map of happiness either. And that uncompromising vision is part of what  makes it so strong and beautiful.<br />Hamilton is a very good writer, and can  make something beautiful even when logically you agree with Aunt Syd and  know it's a disaster. Really a marvelous book.	2000-02-14

If I accidentally read one, then I generally dislike it. The genre and I are simply not made for each other. Legend of the Seventh Virgin is different, in that it and I have a history  together. Between the ages of 8-11 I must have read this book 60,000,000  times, and when I saw it in the store I had to buy it to see if it was as I  remember.<br />It may be that Victoria Holt is a formulaic writer. I've never  read any of her other books, so I wouldn't know. What I do know is that the  same impressions I had as a child came back to me very strongly. I loved  Kerensa and I hated Mellyora. I totally supported Kerensa's decision about  Nellyphant and would have done exactly the same. The one signal difference,  I suppose, is that I felt much less dissatisfied about the ending than I  did as a child (her fate no longer seeming so awful to me).<br />I kind of  figure that anything that vivid can't be all bad.	2000-02-13

Margaret tries to live the  life of a twenties heroine (her ideas of the free life very reminiscent of  Fitzgerald) but the context of this time had completely irrevocably  changed.<br />The book covers the prewar period with the infighting on the  left and the politics of Trotsky and Spain, the coming war and sexual  freedom. McCarthy writes with incision and great wisdom, mocking, mourning,  and loving her characters all at the same time.<br />The only problem with the  book is that it was originally not a book at all, but several short stories  on a theme. As such, it hangs together remarkably well, but before I knew  that it had been short stories first I was already puzzled by some of the  abrupt jumps and breaks.<br />This is the first Mary McCarthy I've read, but I  will certainly be reading more. Highly recommended.	2000-02-13

Most great religious figures have one thing in common-- they start as nobody, then go  away somewhere and come back somebody. Four could be seen as a kind of  preface to that process.<br />Much of seems remarkably direct and helpful and  recasts many basic religious tenets as more concrete steps to  enlightenment. On the other hand, much of it is quite beyond me. In the  interlude about religious meanings in nursery rhymes, for example, I know  that am lacking in understanding about what he was trying to say.  Additionally, the discussions of ritual items seem less useful without a  greater understanding of the Law of Thelema (which I don't have).<br />Hard to  critique. Worth reading.	2000-02-12

I find him a lucid and literate writer who works a cut above just being entertaining.<br /><br />Sailing to Sarantium is a  very good first book in what looks like a promising new series. I can understand the disappointment of some of his fans because the book moves more slowly. It is a lot more in the realm of the real rather than in the land of myth and perhaps seems to be lacking some of the largeness that the Fionvar books had.<br /><br />I think, however, that while different Sailing to Sarantium is not any less for being different. The characters are still quite compelling and I loved the eye for detail that he brought into the book. The setting is fascinating and I bought his vision of the world.<br /><br />Minor quarrel: the book did not feel as complete as it should as a book on its own. I realize that this is the first novel in a series, but I do not want to depend on the next book to get an experience of the first.<br /><br />I'll be waiting (impatiently) for  the second.	2000-02-10

Nothing in the book is simple or clear cut, and the reader is not given the  luxury of having a clear moral position to adopt. That is, except for the  moral position of intolerance of violence and intolerance for the people  who perpetrate it-- whatever the cost.<br />I was puzzled myself about why I  didn't want to give this book five stars, but in the end although it was  masterfully written, I found that it didn't contain spark or the flame I  needed to carry it above just 'very good'. However, I will certainly seek  out other books by the same writer in the future.	2000-02-10

Similarly,  I felt that the book was hindered by the constant need for people to wait  by the telephone and the inability to reach people-- even though the book  was written a while ago, cell phones and answering machines were obvious  components of the future.<br />However, the flaws do not detract too badly  from the overall worth of the book, or the pleasure in its reading.	2000-02-07

We've read the kind of book before where a boy is interested in a woman and his youthful curiosity gets him involved in a  murder that surrounds her. What's strange about this is that the book seems  amazingly preoccupied with the boy in question's sex life.

It was given to me as a gift, and I felt obliged to read it. Whenever I hear the words &quot;heart warming&quot; used to describe a book, I generally stay miles  away.<br />However, it really isn't bad. While it won't get mistaken for great  literature, it's very well-written and compelling. Evans avoids the mistake  of so many of his contemporaries and allows his characters to have real  flaws and real obstacles. His obvious writing skill makes what could have  been a pretty hokey novel very readable.<br />The story is simple, a girl and  her horse are badly wounded in a traffic accident, and the mother turns (in  more than one sense) to the only man who can help her rehabilitate the  horse (and, by extension, her daughter).<br />It's been said in a lot of these  reviews that the ending is bad, and I rather have to agree. It seems like  Evans painted himself into a corner and didn't know how else to get out,  but despite that it still earns four stars.	2000-02-03

He only considered five of his books (according to his friend and literary executor, Max Brod) to have \\"counted\\" and asked for the rest to be burned when he died.  Following Kafka's plan, there should have been many more stages of the  trial developed before the end. Also, Brod arranged the order of the  chapters to the best of his ability based on knowledge that he'd gleaned  from Kafka during his lifetime. These factors may account for some of the  gaps and disclarities in the novel rather better than its own surreal  qualities do.<br /><br />I can only wish that I had the ability to read the finished  novel, because this is a wonderful and complicated book. It's often made  out to be a simple parable, but it's far from simple. K. is more than just  an innocent man (you can even argue that his lifestyle marks him as more corrupt than we're given to know) and the process is more than all-powerful  and unstoppable.<br /><br />The logic of the book is like a dream and has the same crazy sense-- people go in and out through doors that require them to cross  beds, women fall in love with condemned men because of the air of doom-- it  carries very well the idea of a machine that clearly has its own rules that  the individual is not given to understand. Even with the limitations of its  unfinished state, the Trial is still an important read.	2000-01-29

His land beyond the wall is not only the home of flowers made of  crystal and little people, it's the place on the edge of the map where the  monsters dwell.<br />Tristan Thorn is an excellent hero in the classic mode--  belonging neither in one world or the other, he does his best to navigate  through both. Although I have to admit to a certain disappointment that we  didn't see a direct follow-up to Neverwhere, this is a very strong and very  entertaining book.	2000-01-29

Prelude  contains material on the background of Hari Seldon and psychohistory, as  well as a rich and complicated view of a political world (Trantor).

His critique of  society and the psychiatric institutions is based on the idea that at least  some mental illness is actually a curative journey working to heal the  sickness of the society around it. Point being that people should be  treated as people, and not as things committing actions.

This book is an introduction to the rules that  Tarkovsky set for himself in achieving this goal.<br />The book covers his  thoughts around a wide range of his films, beginning with &quot;Ivan's  Childhood&quot; and finally ending with &quot;The Sacrifice&quot;. On the  way he covers his view of various aspects (both concrete and philisophical)  of the cinema.

It's  useful on the level of the student learning film techniques (he provides  some wonderful examples of the difference in how major and minor directors  handle the same character moments in different films. It's also useful as a  book about the philosophy of art in general (and cinema, obviously, in  specific).	2000-01-21

You've got the betrayed wife, the amoral doctor who  crosses the line into evil, the helpless friends, the works. While it's not  terribly plotted, there is also nothing interesting or new.<br />  Furthermore, the writing style is uneven. While it picks up steam later in  the book, the first few chapters read like a writing workshop exercise,  with one adjective per sentence-- &quot;blinding brightness&quot;,  &quot;bitterly cold&quot;, &quot;perfect blanket&quot;, and &quot;southern  sky&quot;-- and this all in only the first (short) paragraph.	2000-01-16

While many mysteries focus around theater and theater  people, Allingham's look at their characters lacks either sentimentality or  malice, and provides one of the most focused and accurate portrayals that  I've ever read.	2000-01-16

Explained well, and backed up with solid and very applicable examples.<br /> It's important to remember  that this book prepared the way for current Internet-based/personalized  approaches to marketing.  To a current marketeer, it may feel a bit dated  (many of the examples are dependent on using snail mail and fax machines)  but it given how many large IT projects are centered around database  marketing, it's worthwhile reading for a lot of professionals and technical  workers who may be missing part of the point of the systems they're  developing.	2000-01-16

Despite an occasionally messy plot point, this book delivers some of the most interesting  speculative fiction around. The German-Mexican brother sister pair-- Jane  and Alex-- are full and complex people and rather than simply acting out  some kind of mythic archetype they move in this futurescape the way you'd  expect real people to move. The sense of scene is also rich and full, with  the cultural details full of verisimilitude. Perhaps not my favorite  Sterling, but still a great read.	2000-01-11

This is not the radient noble Arthur  of the myth's popularization, this is the baby killer, abandoned by God and  Merlin and tossed on the waves of fate.  A wonderful rendition of Malory,  suprisingly not hurt at all by the modernization.<br />This book is  unfinished, and ends with the beginning of the romance between Guenivere  and Lancelot. Steinbeck never finished it, and it's presented here edited  with a collection of his letters about the book at the end. The letters are  interesting, but-- sadly enough-- are no substitute for what the finished  book might have been.	2000-01-11

She *definitely* knows how to write a hook. Despite all  the flaws in this book, I'm still curious (actually against my own will)  about what happens in the next book. However, her writing is curiously flat  and the plot is relentlessly repetitive. It was as though she sat down and  set herself an exercise titled 'writing a series about magic  competitions.'<br />As the title suggests, this book is about competitions.  There are multiple and repeated competitions throughout the book. They do  not vary (except in character and magical power) and the fact that they do  not vary kind of neatly removes anything like dramatic tension.<br />The  characters are simple and more or less one dimensional. They've all got  some pretty clearly defined emotional handicaps that they're also pretty  clearly going to have to get over before they can go on to succeed in the  later books. Oh, and the bad guys are (you guessed it) really really bad  and spoiled and cruel and awful and stupid.<br />So, the question is, why did  I finish it? Why am I probably going to read the next one? The answer is in  the plot itself, I think. She neatly incorporates some nice mystery about  the set-up and never really gives you the sense of a complete book so you  really are left with this annoying sense of wanting to know how the darned  thing ends. Like I said, it's a puzzling book.	2000-01-07

John Bingham was a classic mystery writer from the early 50s in the UK and he belongs in the ranks of the best of breed. Five Roundabouts is his second novel.<br />The  book has much of the dark moodiness and imperfect characters that you'd  find in a book by someone like Patricia Highsmith. You won't find the stock  sympathetic characters here. Roundabout's characters commit adultery, lie  to each other, mock their friends, and contemplate murder. The reader  looking for someone to cheer for will be rather hard put in this  instance.<br />Definitely not typical escapist detective fiction, and all the  better for it, IMO.	2000-01-07

Handing a classroom full of  kids his essay on elements, for example, would be a great way to make clear  what isotopes actually are and how it all fits into the future.<br />All the  same, I was expecting a little less teaching and a little more Asimov.  While it's all interesting, it was in places unfortunately rather dry.  Particularly if you're used to other Asimov essays, you really have to  switch your expectation gears pretty abruptly. The first half of the book  (as per the title) focuses around great moments in  science past. The  second half is more about where science is going.<br />I think that the second  half, had I read it when the book was written, would have carried a lot  more charm. The problem was that the time frame for many of his predictions  have come and gone and very little of it is relevant. The little that is,  however, is rather astonishing. His warnings on population and resource  depletion ring truer than ever today.<br />All in all, a mixed reading  experience, but I certainly am not sorry that I read it.	2000-01-07

There were sections (particularly in Brobdingnag) where I could almost recite word-for-word  what was going to happen next.<br />Happily, like Alice in Wonderland, this is  a book that ages very well. There was still the element of being just a  plain old good travel story with strong images (particularly in the  Lilliput and Brobdingnag sections) but there was also a wicked sense of  satire that continues to be relevant and funny now more than three hundred  years after the book was originally written.<br />The latter two sections of  the book-- Laputa and the land of the Houyhnhnms-- are perhaps a little  less vivid for being more pointed in their satirical content (interestingly  I have no memory of these sections from my childhood reading) but that in  no way detracts from the value of the book.<br />A must-read.	2000-01-04

And (with the exception of the background into Captain Kidd) you don't get a sense of much historic  background. In fact, Rowe likes to repeat popular myth about this figures  that he knows to be false in a very confusing way, so that it's almost  unclear that he knows it's false.<br />The selection of folk tales and history  ranges from the history of the life-savers to pirates to sunken gold ships  to ghosts. An entertaining enough read for a vacation or a Sunday  afternoon. Also useful as a pointer to myths and histories worth following  up in more depth.	2000-01-02

I was in a shop with a limited selection of English books and it looked like the best option I had. I didn't, frankly, know what to expect from it. It looked a bit like an Anne  Perry novel + magic from the back cover. I hoped for reasonably  entertaining at best.<br />I ended up with a book that I couldn't put down.  The characters were well-crafted, the world they moved in was richly  detailed. The system of magic Wells created was so well worked-out that we  didn't need everything explained-- the characters moved through the world  in a natural way and everything became clear enough (while still leaving  much room for information about this society in later novels.)<br />Excellent  example of the genre. Not great literature, but certainly high  entertainment.	2000-01-02

It's an apt comparison, but where Pym's province is excellent women and their ilk, Mitford's characters live on the society stage. What Mitford shares with  Pym is a sharp wit, a dry sense of humor, and an eye for social satire via  the novel of manners.<br />Lady Sophia Garfield is cross because her  arch-rival Baby Bagg has been posturing as a beautiful spy. Sophia is so  busy being jealous of her enemy that she fails to notice the ring of spies  operating out of her house. Refined British screwball ensues.<br />Read and  enjoy.	1999-12-30

It trails through Buddhism, cryonics, methods of meditation, parking lots, and apples on its way towards attempting to present its  theory of fuzzy logic. I can understand why somebody quite familiar with  the theories involved might find it quite frustrating as discipline and  rigor didn't seem to be two of its strong points.<br />For me, however, it was  a useful read. I have been curious about Data Mining and Neural Networks  and the book was recommended to me as a place to begin with the concepts  and what I found was that once I got the hang of the loopiness, it did a  remarkably good job of bringing home some of the basic ideas to a math  challenged person (me).<br />I tend to be a suspicious person, so I wasn't  convinced by some of his more grandious claims and I think I like Aristotle  rather better than he does, but these points didn't prevent me from feeling  like I got something out of the book.<br />At the very least, I felt like I  finished Fuzzy Thinking a bit better armed to dig further into the subject  matter, which was really what I was trying to accomplish in the first  place.	1999-12-27

Ozeki's writing style is clever and smooth and she has a good sense of both  character development and situational humor.<br />Where the book went wrong,  for me, was in her seeming inability to separate the documentary aspects  from the novel. I realize that the main character was a documentary maker,  but I think it constitutes an allusive fallacy to think that makes the  unvarnished anti-meat politics any less grating. I am not really a  meat-eater myself, but I prefer my politics a little better blended into  the narrative than she accomplished here.<br />Furthermore, it seems to me  that Ozeki gives in unnecessarily to the desire to make her point clear by  making the situations so black and white.  The relationship between Akiko  and John started off fascinating (as was Akiko herself, an ex-manga artist  turned meek housewife) but was much more interesting when the abuse was  largely psychological and cultural. Akiko's victimhood felt as strained as  her sudden and ultimate rehabilitation. Another track I'd describe as  similarly unsatisfying was the Rose story. We'd already gotten the message  in spades about meat (Akiko's aversion to it carried it's own message by  itself) and we didn't need such a dramatic denoument.<br />Had this been her  third novel, I don't think I'd ever go back to one of her books. However,  since this is Ozeki's first book, there were a lot of things about it that  I liked enough to make me want to read her second.	1999-12-26

When I read it as a novel, I  enjoyed it tremendously with very few reservations-- the characters danced  through the pages and the wealth of detail that he provided made them feel  alive to me as I was reading. I was very interested in the outcome of the  murder case by the time I reached the end of the book and he successfully  carried across this sense of looking-glass justice where you simply can't  believe that someone like that (who collects faberge and loves antiques)  could be convicted by our courts for killing a violent rent boy. Even if I  thought he should be, the book created a sense of disbelief by placing the  murder in the context of the new south.<br />What always troubles me about  books like this is what happens when I begin reading it as non-fiction.  It's hard to escape a certain guilt when I consider that that murder victim  is at one and the same time a real person who recently lived and a  character in a novel, serving the purpose of the book's author in creating  his portrait of modern Savannah. This troubles me, at least a little.  Chablis has already written her own book in response to this one, but  nobody will ever hear Danny's real voice and this book must stand as his  remembrance.	1999-12-26

It certainly succeeds at giving you the feel of realism, skilfully using shades of grey to paint the characters right up  until the end when you don't know who you're cheering for anymore.<br />Dee  uses all the senses to invoke a feel for crime in the big city in one of  the most successful of the gritty realism novels that I've read.<br />My only  quarrel is with the plot; there are points where it relies too much on the  stock in trade of detective novelists-- coincidental and hidden  connections-- but given that this is a first novel, those are relatively  minor points to care about.<br />I'm looking forward to reading the other  books by this author.	1999-12-25

Archy McNally is kind of what you'd get if you crossed Lord Peter Wimsey with Cary Grant's character from the Awful Truth. He's urbane, irresponsible, retro  and witty-- an unavoidably appealing combination. The plots themselves are  more vehicles for Archy's charm, but are adequately written as such-- this  one contains enough interesting background information about faberge eggs  and con men to carry me through without getting horribly bored.	1999-12-25

Tautly plotted, apparently well researched, and an amusing departure from the lean and desperate detectives who populate much of the mystery genre, I really enjoy the John Putnum Thatcher novels by Emma Lathan. Although now we have cozy detectives who have virtually every possible profession, at the time that these novels were written it was really revolutionary to make a polite and almost stuffy Wall Street banker the hero of a detective novel.<br /><br />Emma Lathan's Thatcher novels may be the only mysteries I enjoy for their documentary value. Thatcher's work is explored and entwined with the mystery at hand. In this, her 15th Thatcher book, the focus is on cocoa futures. It may sound dry, but it works very well.

Having grown up on the shores of Ontario, it still managed to provide me with local history that I'd never heard (and filled in some gaps  on things I had-- such as the Edmund Fitzgerald wreck). There are moments  where the prose gets a little strained (how many different ways are there  to say &quot;stormy water&quot;?) but it doesn't really detract from the  charm of the book.

Even though the book was published in 1995, the information seems to be cut off in the late 1970s.<br />What I'd like to know about ghost books by Holzer is why every  haunted house always turns out to have a whole bunch of ghosts once the  psychics get involved.

The writing has the plain nature of an attempted parable, however  there was no parable-like point. The characters have, as far as I can tell,  no real flaws at all. Not only the main characters (the rugged, deep, yet  simple Noah and the beautiful, creative, and privileged Allie) are perfect,  but even the antagonists in the piece seem to lack flaws. (Allie's mother  keeps Noah's letters from her, but she only did it out of deep belief in  what was right, etc.) In all this respect and perfection, there's one  *huge* missing element, and that's tension. Even though there's a supposed  choice involved in the book, I never felt a moment's doubt about what Allie  would do.<br /> I am giving it two stars because the section in the nursing  home had some genuinely interesting moments, but unfortunately they tended  to get lost in the book's Hallmark Cards aesthetic. I just don't have the  taste for all the sugar.	1999-12-16

Lowell is one of those writers who are often pushed down  your throat as being &quot;The Most Important Poet Ever!&quot; by college  professors and I have to admit that this attitude lead me to resist reading  further.<br /> I want to say that this was a mistake, because of how much I  enjoyed this book, but I'm not sure how well I could have appreciated these  poetry books had I been younger. They are not simple about anything they  touch-- not histories (public or private), not love, not death, not  depression. They are complicated words that are painted in detailed layers,  so the richness gets deeper the longer you look. The setting is so subtle  that when Lowell does say something overt, it comes as a distinct shock.<br /> I didn't want to stop reading the book when it was over, and went back  and started reading the poems again-- it was that compelling.	1999-12-15

I realize that's a strange headline to write this many pages into a series, but still-- it's true.<br /> The first volume in the Otherland book (it really is *a* book, not really a series as such) really frustrated me  because I liked it so much and it didn't end with the minor resolution I  expected to find. With the second volume I knew what to expect (or, rather,  what not to expect) but I was worried that Williams would get so wrapped up  in the cool possibilities of virtual worlds that he'd take his eye off the  ball. With this volume, however, he's managed to ease my major concerns.<br /> Williams clearly does love the cool possibilities of virtual reality,  but unlike other writers, the different layers that his characters go  through all serve a purpose in driving the plot. I never had the sense that  something was in place simply because Williams couldn't resist leaving it  out. The characters are well-formed, their problems are interesting, and  the world is intriguing.<br /> The book doesn't get five stars from me yet  because it isn't finished. I still have some skepticism I want to see  Otherland set aside (how the AI will be handled, the seeming  invulnerability of Dread), and I'm not willing to buy into it 100% until I  know where the whole arc is going to end up.<br /> Very interesting exercise  in form. Worth reading.	1999-12-14

Dick: Selected Literary and Philosophical Writings	Books	5	35	36	N	N	Something for everybody	There is a place in this collection of essays where Dick says &quot;What helps for me-- if help comes at all-- is to find the mustard seed of the funny at the core of the horrible and futile.&quot; That sentence in  particular carries the feeling that drew me so deeply into Dick's subject  matter whatever he happened to be writing about. When he discusses the  death of a dear friend by cancer and announces that he believe the spirit  of that friend came to inhabit his cat it is-- on the one hand-- funny. It  is also-- on the other hand-- clearly what he truly believes; so it's like  so much of what Dick writes-- strange and moving and humorous and lightened  with that quality of perceived truth that so few writers manage to convey.<br /> This volume of essays covers everything from biography to notes about  the conversion of &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot; to  &quot;Blade Runner&quot; to possible sequels to his novels to musings about  the gnostic revalations and how they relate to Dick's idea of the universe.<br /> One of the most thought-provoking books that I've ever read. My one  caveat (warning) being that this is perhaps not the best introduction to  Dick and I suggest reading at least one or two of his novels (ideally the  Divine Invasion books) before attempting these waters.	1999-12-14

Where a lesser author  builds their book on cool magic- magic is only one of the elements that  make this tapestry rich.<br /> For the squeamish out there, it's worth noting  that A Clash of Kings doesn't pull it's punches. Children are not spared  just for being children and sex (even rape) is given its accurate role in  the field of war. Just because it's a fantasy novel, doesn't mean it's for  children.<br /> My only real complaint is that it's probably going to take so  long for the next book to come out!	1999-12-05

The effect is a layering of historical periods. With the help of the editing, you can peer through and see not only the period of Mary Jemison's captivity, but also the prejudices of the following time. An interesting example of the simultaneous respect and loathing with which the early settlers viewed the native inhabitants. I first read the narrative in high school, and would recommend it for young and old readers alike.	1999-12-05

I am not a believer, nor am I on a spiritual path. I'm a writer who's been researching dreams and  dreaming and I've become slightly jaundiced from reading so much Jung  recast as spiritual clap-trap. In that regard, this book isn't really an  exception. However, it covers a much wider base of material with a  significantly higher degree of internal cohesion and logic than others of  its kind. It also provided a number of excellent references for further  reading. I might have given it a higher score, even given that I don't  share a common belief with the author, but I found the 'reality check'  meanings of various dreams that he provided to be almost wildly stretched  examples. What he cites as examples of dreams being reflected in real life  the next day are (for the most part) as vague as horoscopes and that  seriously dilutes the examples where the application is really striking.<br /> Still, an interesting addition to a dream library.	1999-12-01

I'm half in love with him myself. This wasn't my favorite Peter Wimsey novel,  but even in being my not-favorite, it was satisfying and  enchanting.<br />Sayers reminds me of GK Chesterton in this novel in the way  she uses the form to gently deflate the radical political ideas of the day  without losing the plot. The trial procedure for the peer of a realm  contrasted with the romances of Wimsey's sister Mary neatly highlight the  decaying class system in which these characters move. It's full of  priceless moments, such as the one where a character is told witheringly  that while he could be forgiven being a murderer, he can't be forgiven for  being an ass.<br />The book suffers a bit from an overly complicated plot that  only becomes overly complicated three-quarters of the way through and  Sayers accidentally makes several of the red herring characters more  interesting than the really pertinent ones. Most importantly, I felt like  the character of the murdered man was not illuminated as well as she has  done in some of her other novels-- despite all the details provided, he  felt curiously unfinished or stock.	1999-12-01

It should also not be forgotten (as it too often is about Sexton) how well this work depicts not only the sorrow, but the tentative steps towards something lighter:<br /><br />\\"I cannot promise very much.<br />I give you the images I know.<br />Lie still with me and watch.<br />A pheasant moves<br />by like a seal, pulled through the mulch<br />by his thick white collar. He's on show<br />like a clown. He drags a beige feather that he removed,<br />one time, from an old lady's hat.<br />We laugh and we touch.<br />I promise you love. Time will not take away that.\\"<br /><br />All My Pretty Ones is also one of the poetry books that functions very well together as a book rather than as merely a collection of poems. Accordingly, even though many or most of these poems are available through other collections, I would advise you to read this as a single volume if you can find it.	1999-11-26

If this particular book has a flaw, it is only that perhaps it contains a few too many of the familiar Simak elements. The plot is also possibly a little lopsided-- a little too much here, and not quite enough there. It does not really detract from the reading experience, but is not quite up to his own high standard.<br /><br />Simak is an interesting writer. He is often pastoral, but not really romantic. He never mistakes folksy for virtuous. His view on human nature is often unflinchingly bad, but he holds to the hope that it can be better. But still, there can be a bitter taste in his writing and A Heritage of Stars has quite a bit of that flavor.<br /><br />As always with Simak, highly recommended. If this is your first Simak, I might recommend beginning with [[ASIN:1882968271 Way Station]] or [[ASIN:0425029875 Enchanted Pilgrimage]].	1999-11-26

It may be that this was so much a book of the sixties that it now seems inappropriate. I don't know.<br /><br />Heinlein remains  a talented writer, and the book is engaging. Up until the cult business begins, the premise is well explored. For me, it is as though halfway  through the book he realized that he had a point to make and started rushing you through to get to that point.  The ending of the relationship between Ben and Jill is glossed over, all  the real emotions of the characters about each other are neatly trampled by the idea of 'grokking' it, and I started to heartily wish for Mike to show some real flaws.<br /><br />When I was younger, I'd read this book and been much more impressed. It hasn't aged well.	1999-11-26

It may be a flight of fancy, but it seems that you can see Asimov as a scientist when you read his novels. Unlike other speculative writers, there is a clear sense of details that ring true to the present day. For instance, the  trouble with getting robots to respond to a question reminds me of some of  the more comical experiments with intelligent agents.<br /><br />Although the allegorical nature of the Solarians gives the book a somewhat dated feel, it still has that Asimov magic-- combining study of human nature with  speculative fiction. A first class author, as always.	1999-11-23

An interesting book from somebody who is obviously a very smart guy. I'm willing to follow most of his arguments because he seems like a very smart guy and because his tone is so engaging and compelling. This is the best thing about The Invisible Computer.<br /><br />The weakest points in his book for me, however, is that he tries to an extend a metaphor without proper back-up in the way of solid evidence. At the same time, he still presents his issues as objective. Norman does a better job, in my opinion, when he is talking about design.<br /><br />At least I have to say that it is well-written, and raises some interesting issues about the future of technology.	1999-11-23

I am disappointed to see that this book is out of print, as I can think of several other people who would appreciate it.<br /><br />The Waterall is a beautiful little love story, set in the aftermath of the birth. Drabble has written a novel about doomed lovers and doppleganger cousins. These sound like the most standard of tropes, but they are handled here with freshness and grace. The book resists the temptation to wrap up neatly and reminds us that the non-conclusions of the real world can be just as satisfying as a more literary ending.<br /><br />I did not admire this as much as I did Jerusalem the Golden, which is one of my favorite books. The Waterfall lacks the scope and reach of  some of her other (more famous) works. People who have not read Drabble before may want to begin with either Jerusalem or The Ice Age.  Still, there are also much worse places to begin. I found the Waterfall both affecting and well crafted and would give it a high recommendation.	1999-11-23

This book has a lot of the trappings of science fiction-- life extending technology, genetically engineered pets, virtual reality games-- but the center, in the end, is the search for emotional completion engaged upon by Mia Ziemann, the protagonist of the book.<br /><br />Ziemann goes  through a radical life extension procedure that pushes her past the life of the young and vivid and out the other side through to the Holy Fire. She embarks on a quest for completion that is not aided by hidden magical talents, destiny, or instant success. Instead, she becomes a person who can live her own life with will and sustained follow-through.<br /><br />Many things impressed me about this book, and I found it very hard to put down, but one of the things I liked the most was the high quality of the characters, and their very real emotional responses. I have some minor quibbles-- there were some loose ends in the book (I felt like the memory palace and the Plato sequences were never developed fully enough) but the book itself was strong enough to carry them. Definitely recommended.	1999-11-21

At their worst, Tom Deitz books feel a little bit like they were written as wish fulfillment for the Society for Creative Anachronists or Southern Fae junkies. Unfortunately, this is not one of his better efforts.<br /><br />I read the first few books that he wrote with considerable interest and enjoyment, but most of what has followed has seemed stuck in the same old groove. Even though this book is not in the David Sullivan series, it honestly felt as though it might have been. It had similar characters, plot points and emotional issues.<br /><br />I remained essentially unconvinced by many of the major character  moments in the book. The relationships never felt like there was really very much at stake. The Gryphon King (the character) raises some good questions about the relationship of Jay and Dal is one that really holds water. It was a good question, but one that the book never entertains as valid or even worth asking. This is a graduate school where true lovers find true love and hold it, and that is perhaps the most fantastic part about the book.<br /><br />Character flaws aside, Deitz does his usual credible job of anchoring the book in mythology and  folklore (although the roots are not as deep as they are in the early Sullivan books). I enjoyed the work that he did with the miracle plays, although even that was not as well developed as I would have liked.  He is a talented author, and it makes me sad to have such a feeling of  pastiche from reading this book.<br /><br />Fans of Dietz might enjoy the outing. People new to his writing should start with the David Sullivan books instead.	1999-11-21

It is not particularly challenging, but it provides an awful lot of reading pleasure.<br /><br />Cluny Brown is a girl who just does not know her place, and all the adventures that follow come from that lucky not knowing.<br /><br />I read it first as an awkward preteen, and still enjoyed it as an (I hope) less awkward adult. I would recommend it for any age. It is, by the way, one of the rare books where I enjoyed the film just as much.	1999-11-21

I don't know if mysteries written by foreign authors just sound more intelligent or really are, but the effect remains regardless of the reason. These detectives, Grijpstra and de Gier,  really come alive in these books. They have a warts and all kind of  approach not only about their own personalities, but also the personalities  of their friends and family members as well that I really like. Almost  incidentally, van de Wetering makes you very interested in the ultimate  whodunnit. As an American living in the Netherlands, I also appreciate the  view of Amsterdam.	1999-11-18

The idea of linking Dracula to the Borgias was interesting enough, but it never felt  like it became fully fleshed out enough. It was good enough to encourage me  to read other books in the Dracula series to see if I find them better than  this.	1999-11-18

We love different Bergman films and she likes to rip on Truffaut, who I adore, but never mind. If I wanted to read what I agreed with, I'd read my diary-- and even then I'd probably disagree  with myself.<br /><br />What impresses me about Kael is how much her love of cinema  comes through. Everyone uses the word 'passion' when they write about Kael,  and really, that word comes unescapably through every page of her books.  She is more than passionate, however, and combines that emotion with a real  and powerful intelligence and an often hilarious sense of humor. She's a  critic in the tradition of Dorothy Parker, with a little bit less  nastiness. Whenever Kael is vicious about a film or an actor, you don't  have a sense of cynicism, but of real anger at someone defiling her  art.<br /><br />Going Steady can be a bit difficult for youngsters like me, because  I'd only seen a fraction of the films she discussed in it. It was  originally released the year I was born, and the 60s are not an era whose  films I've particularly studied. However, this book contains her famous  essay \\"Trash, Art and the Movies\\" and for that piece alone it's  worth a read.	1999-11-09

I found the book largely entertaining, and even though there's been a gap since the first book, it immediately brought the  first book back. The characters eventually grow tiresome with all their  endless strength and fortitude (one starts to long for a little bit of  weakness and groveling that isn't caused by demons) and it does start to  seem contrived how the plot forces them into separate places constantly--  it gives this book the unfortunate feeling of churning sideways as the  result of shallowness of plot.
