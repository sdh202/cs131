Wolff certainly has done the research and then written a passionate account of this \\"learned musician\\" for the ages.  Among the fine qualities of this biography is a clear, concise writing style with erudite thinking demonstrated sorting out the historical sources surrounding Bach's life.<br /><br />Tracing his life chronologically, the book's theme is one of a composer/virtuoso/organ expert who develops out of self-interest and passion for music and especially his family background of musicians.  He certainly had some ins because of this family heritage, but certainly on the same hand earned his way by his demonstrated abilities on the organ, pipe organ construction and maintenance and finally composition.<br /><br />Revolutionizing the music craft by his counterpoint and harmonization, his influence both to those who come after him including his two older sons, this man continues to play vital role in unfolding world of music.<br /><br />Minor missing element which certainly is understandable for the non-theologically inclined is the major influence that Bach's theology played in his music.  From the surviving Cavlov Bible that we have from J.S., we know this as certainty.	2005-09-10

God's gift or man's choice of accompishment, symbol of salvation?<br /><br />Winsomely, convincingly from Scripture, Jewish baptismal customs at Christ's time, early Christian church, Das shows that from outset, baptism is gospel, gift, grace, God's power to saving through the washing of sins by water and Word.<br /><br />His exposition of Scripture is strong asset.  Slowly, choosing common understood terms and supposed obstacles to baptizing infants, Das exposes the fallacies of Believer Baptism.  One cannot find Scripture to support a person deciding to be saved: because of Original Sin, which is another strong point of this book, since he sets it out at outset of the problem baptism with God doing the saving, accomplishes.<br /><br />This is outstanding book to clarify why one does believe with Scriptural explanation from wide source use, and challenge to those who question this Biblical and church historical practice.	2005-08-25

The three views pertains to five authorities giving their opinion as to comptability between Eastern Orthodoxy and evangelicalism.  One says yes, two say no, and one maybe.  You'll have to read to figure out who lines up with which compatibility assessment.<br /><br />What is good about the exchange is the format of major essay by one, than the others react.  This is excellent format and provides salient interaction to occur.  Nuances are discovered and brought out, allowing the interested reader to explore.<br /><br />What salient differences provided here include:  different authority of tradition and resultant view of Scriptures; totally different view of original sin; resultant divergent views of Apostle Paul's theology; resulting in different anthropology, esp. image and likeness issues which result in different soteriology.<br /><br />The two as Horton points out are not really that close, other than outstanding agreement on Trinitarian issues, outside of filoque.<br /><br />What is lacking in this otherwise well done volume is limited confessional reaction from Reformed evangelical side, but realization that having Lutheran/Roman Catholic/Arminian etc., would be a huge and tiresome volume.  For Lutherans, Issues Etc. just had an excellent interview in month of August, 2005 which can be listened to on their archives with Eastern Orthodox spokesman.<br /><br />This provides a good base to go from.

Melanchthon was predicted by Luther to drift moderate so he knew that Lutherans would not follow Philip which happened.  The Reformed liked him for some of his teachings but not others.  So, no confessional body truly reveres and follows all of Philip.<br /><br />Thus, this fine contribution of essays on the topic primarily by Reformed with a few Lutheran views thrown in.<br /><br />There is fine essay on Melanchthon's influence on Calvin by Richard Mueller as well as an excellent contribution by John Schneider on his rhetoric.<br /><br />As was quoted in the book:  how could such a peacable man of his age become in historical reflection such a man of such embattlement?  Moderate brings this with it.  Middle might be the most dangerous place to be.	2005-08-18

This guy is into it!<br /><br />Reading this delightful book takes me back to fly fishing times and emits once again those feelings that he so accurately and passionately describes in this book.  It is a collection of his various outings, most for trout in Colorado and Wyoming, moving out to Idaho and steelheading in Oregon with other trips east and some even south to Oklahoma and to Nebraska for bass and bluegill types.<br /><br />The hiking out of canyon and wilderness at dark; fishing in pouring rain and snow; catching that big one with no one to witness; glorying in the gorgeous aethestics.  All these touched the dormant fly fishing spots in my memory and evoked great remembrances.<br /><br />This guy can fish and he can write about it:  \\"my fly box has over a hundred flies in it .. but use only two.  I'm beginning to wonder why I carry the rest.\\"  \\"With steelhead, that's like teaching a new driver how to start a car and then turning him loose in rush-hour traffic\\"  \\"The one about the guy who kept a twelve-pound rainbow that he wanted to mount, but who then dumped it on the ground halfway out because ...\\"  \\"sign saying 'See the Real West' means this is one place where the real West no longer exists.  Signs in the real West say 'No Trespassing.'\\"<br /><br />Fishing and outdoors are about this, memories and stories.  This book has them in spades and will take those who are into fly fishing and these spots there with author vicariously.  Those who haven't experienced them firsthand, will likely get as close as possible in reading this great book.<br /><br />The unique accompanying drawings are just outstanding!	2005-08-12

I have read Barna for years and have consistently credited him with being a most able marketing research, marketing, and leadership practioner of the finest level.  His successes would exhibit this.<br /><br />However, equally as consistent has been my criticism that Barna makes emphatic, foundational assumptions claiming God said, when in fact God has not said, e.g. Jesus and Paul were the consummate marketing men when the Biblical proof he offers is bogus.<br /><br />Here it is more of the same, applying supposed God says to Church Leaders who are visionary leaders for change in fulfilling God's vision.  What does Barna suggest here and in the books he has written on vision?  Quoting Proverbs 29:18, he defines visionary leadership as the pastor sensing what better future he has in mind for a group of people as a blessing.  If only he would clearly tie this to the Gospel of Jesus Christ he would be ok.  But no, he ties it to some dream, some Joel Osteen like wish and hope inside a person which doesn't equate at all with God's constant revelation of true interpretation/applicaiton of Prov. 29:18 ----  that then turns Servants of the Word, true sent and speaking for God pastors into CEO/Leaders which Barna exhorts here in this work.<br /><br />Since this is based on business/management principles for leadership, it is useful to those in that pursuit, be they Christians or not.  But for Christian church, this is leaven being brought into the church from world.  To be rid of, or Barna et al will have to provide Biblical proof for it.<br /><br />Was Jeremiah a leader sent by God according to Barna's criteria?  I don't think he can pass the test Barna presents here.  The other prophets and the current cannot either.<br /><br />This is dangerous work which must be exposed as not for church but for industry.	2005-08-11

The Growing Controversy on the Origins of Life in the Universe	Books	5	25	44	N	Y	Clear, Concise Entry Into the Discussion	This is a well done entry point into the question of origins of life in the universe.<br /><br />O'Leary as journalist provides welcome toned down insights into the many camps which slug this issue out in the public: the young earth creationists, the old earth creationists, the ID, the evolutionists, the Christian evolutionists, etc.<br /><br />I like these words from her beginning:  \\"We peer into space, fire off spacecraft in every direction, land on the moon and on Mars, always looking for signs of life.  We peer thkrough electron microscopes, below the wavelength of visible light, trying to understand life.  Life ... what is it?  How does it come about?  What does it mean?  Where did the universe come from?\\"<br /><br />These were supposedly answered (and continue to be answered with constant shifting modification by some) by Darwinism.  This is now being challenged by scientists of all religious positions (including atheism, which is a religious position) by Intelligent Design among other models of origins.<br /><br />O'Leary explores this increasingly debated topic with great clarity and charity.  Especially useful are her sidebar discussions which include helpful definitions and background examples of the points expressed.<br /><br />What this reviewer found has best of this work were the two chapters respectively on \\"Is ID Good Science?  Is ID Good Theology?\\"  The former I think is yes, while the latter is debatable.  Clearly, ID can be thought of as an apologetic to begin the dialogue with those who are opposed in everyway to any discussion with theology over science.  However, the stated opposition to ID by some creationists are withstanding in their merit.  Theology correctly done proclaims that God has given conclusive, judicial type evidence to every human that He alone is the Creator by evidence of His creation, even though it too has been corrupted by the fall into sin.  This natural knowledge of God however does not deliver the answers to where this creation is going, nor what this Creator God thinks of us.  To that, He has given supernatural revelation in His Word.<br /><br />What impresses this reviewer is the lack of integrity by many of the Darwinist persuasion who continue to resist their persistent spewing forth of the five evolutionist proofs exposed by such as Jonathan Wells in his Icons of Evolution materials.  Scientists need to be more open and honest.<br /><br />This permits many who have not heard the sides and wish to, or to have a nice compendium summary to use and recommend to others.

Such is the case outlined by Christian apologist Groothuis in this book.<br /><br />Modernism has been replaced by postmodernism and the author shows the logical inconsistency of this worldview and truly the untenable position of living its logic out to conclusion.<br /><br />For some readers who already like this reviewer have now read more works on postmodernism sections of the book on this will only be rehash, but well done it must be said.<br /><br />What was of great value was Groothuis then reacting to this with what apologetic Christians need to take to help stop these truth termites.  He has many good things to consider here, e.g. \\"presenting the Christian vision as the most cogent explanation for a whole range of facts in accordance with the essential tenets of logic and critieria for evidence that are required for all critical thinking.\\"<br /><br />He concludes with two excellent chapters, one of \\"True Beauty\\" in the arts being redeemed and stripped of its postmoderism, and TV being a significant postmodern termite.<br /><br />To be read and pondered.

The title must be special to those with hearing loss, since I heard a blind golfer (Kevin Hall) speak that he too listens with the heart.<br /><br />He is a fascinating human who brings his enthusiasm for life and better relationships to his counseling with those with hearing difficulties.  He does this in relating ten counseling cases concerning such as: student-pupil-parent-school faculty tensions; old age and hearing; the isolation and despair of hearing loss; hearing + deaf marriage; parents and birth of deaf child; siblings dealing with deaf sister;<br /><br />There is much to be gleaned from this read, all written with great sensitivity and joy and humorous style.  Harvey demonstrates with his own practice experience how hearing loss affects not just the individual, but those around as well.  One will certainly garner a heightened awareness and sensitivity to these individuals, who normally feel low esteem, isolation and depression due to not catching all the hearing world has to offer.<br /><br />Remarkably, this outstanding counselor has helped many with his kind, but to the point approach.<br /><br />Hoping to receive some spiritual tidbits, there were really not much of these.  Some from Dali Lama, etc. but not much for the Christian.  The last case with the older lady who was in close contact with God was exhibited as experiential.<br /><br />That said, this is valuable resource for those in counseling, or around deaf and hard-of-hearing to raise our sensitivity bars to new levels that we might be more kind resource for these individuals.	2005-08-04

It starts with quiet head, then weight transfer with right loci of hands, and ends in clubhead at right knee level.<br /><br />While this appears to some to be brain surgery, the golfer who will just take the time to start with proper setup and adequate shoulder turn(there is neat drill at home w/o club to achieve this), the four essentials can be drilled into a player.<br /><br />This is phenomenal stuff which yields repeatable grooved swing with a little persistent effort.  What this reviewer finds intriguing and right on is the lattitude Barrett provides in certain checkpoints, given one's flexibility, body structure, etc.  But the four essentials still are essential.  One can improve significantly just by the quiet head.  Worst suggestion all golfers know which most hackers and their friends suggest: keep the head down.<br /><br />This little book in pages but large in gifts will bless all handicap golfers who want a groove and with patience, intensity and persistance, give its essentials a chance.	2005-08-01

Madden dispels this with likely the most misrepresented part of the Crusades, that of whether they were offensive or defensive.  The historical evidence not filtered by modern agendas is that they were defensive, meant to simply take back Christian lands that had been overcome by raiders from other expansionist countries, i.e. Rome and Turks.<br /><br />Madden's book is great for the non-scholarly in that he takes comlex data such as leaders, and distills it down to readable, interesting prose.  References are available for more detailed investigation, many of which Dr. Madden has authored.<br /><br />Highly recommended for that the person who wants to speak not from ignorance on sources with a bias, and begin to view the Crusades in a far truer historical light.	2005-07-27

This salient collection of essays seeks to probe the connection between religion and science, to see if they are truly diametrically opposed when correctly understood and practiced, or rather, friends.  This book argues for the latter.<br /><br />Having read half of the book thus far, the passion, clarity and refreshing presentation of this topic by ten prominent scientists/theologians is certain to raise many stimulating questions in the reader's mind.<br /><br />Pearcey provides salient presentation of how science became a Christian vocation, showing that many of those significant in modern science development felt strongly that science and theology were not at odds, but co-patriots.<br /><br />Chemist Scaeffer contributed a passionate tale of his journey into answering the question: Science & Christianity: Conflict or Coherance.  He provides in much memoir and historical tracing how many past and current scientists of some repute felt as he: definitely coherance.  What many today think is a sealed and done deal that the answer should be conflict, Scaeffer shows that this might be too hasty.<br /><br />Jastram gives forth a fascinating romp through the lens of \\"image of God\\" in creation of humanity, and then its connection with mediation between heaven and earth, a unique place in created order.  Opens one's mind to expansion of limited, narrow definitions of \\"image of God.\\"<br /><br />These were but highlights of what delivers on being a sizeable contribution to the dialogue, and especially to interested Christians considering the connection between science and Christianity.

Further, great grilling time charts in every section which are very useful!<br /><br />What caught my perusing eye was such creative entrys as \\"Beer Can Turkey\\" (already into the Chicken on the Can); Sweet Pork Sausages in a Dijon-White Wine Sauce; French Onion Dip burgers; Jack and Coke Soaked Pork chops; Portobello Mushroom Dip with Pita Points; Italian Grilled Cheese Skewers; and a terrific twenty source rub and sauce recipe section.<br /><br />This adds much to the spectrum already out there, including Bobby Flay, James Purviance, Chris Schlessinger, Steven Raichlein, et al.  Neat to see the ladies really into great grillin and BBQ, e.g. Karen Adler and Judith Fertig.<br /><br />Fun book to read and use.	2005-07-22

Thus, the power of civil religion.<br /><br />This collection of essays on the topic is vital and well executed primer on the subject.  It is complex topic, having developed over time but becoming more and more prominent in our midst, especially heightened by 9/11.<br /><br />The thrust of this effort (and rightly so) is the deceit of many who claim name Christian are actually civil religionists.  Followers of Christ have Him first, then if one chooses, country second.  Even that would be Biblical suspect ranking.  Many I believe don't realize this serious faith issue, having and being mislead by pastors and preachers who support their error.<br /><br />This volume provides for many an intro to the discussion.  For those who want more depth, it is here as well.  There is excellent intros historically, Synodically (LCMS), and theologically, sociologically, etc.<br /><br />For this reviewer, especially vibrate to chapters 5, 6 and 7, which respectively highlight theology of glory vs. theology of the cross; confession & Great commission; and new character of American civil religion.<br /><br />This is worthy material to be read, pondered, discussed.  Keep it coming, CPH. You do the church, world and yes, American civil religion a great blessing with this fine contribution.	2005-07-20

Characteristic of his previous writings is thorough acquaintance with the history of the theology at hand before engagement.  This certainly typifies this work as well, a prologemena to a forthcoming work on scientific theology.<br /><br />In this first of three volumes constituting this intro material, McGrath tackles the tough issue of \\"nature.\\"  Often talked about, but in very nebulous modes.  Mother Nature, laws of nature, et al.  Besides defining and debunking this definitional obstacle, McGrath also tackles the intellectual obstacles of Barthian response to natural theology as well as liberal elements as well.<br /><br />His goal is establish a credible, apologetical response in dialogue with the natural sciences outside Christianity regarding the order of the created world as well as the regularity of such.<br /><br />One quickly surmises that the author is easily at home on this turf of science and philosophy, as well as Reformed theology.<br /><br />Not sure I will continue the other two volumes.  Likely wait for his promised work on scientific theology.<br /><br />Nice read, somewhat short of his own sustained ideas.  More a sweep of the historical past to present, with his own reaction to such as he goes.  Always an engaging author.	2005-07-19

Jeffers probes the world's oldest secret society.  He surmises that its history as to its ancient origins is shrouded by tradition and myth, unsubstantiated by history and documentation.<br /><br />What is deceitful about this organization is its supposed claims to be an acceptable organization for Christian men.  My own church as well as Roman Catholic and others have correctly denounced it as being unacceptable for a Christian for many reasons which should be clear and unchallengable to a Christian.  A Christian would not align themselves with anyone who purported any ole Deity as equally acceptable and allegiance to those who would only symbolically state the Bible as the guide, when that very Bible would refute the Gnostic, ancient anti-Godly character of this organization.<br /><br />What is done in secret the Bible would say shout it from the rooftops, tell it to all people if it is the truth for all mankind, rather than behind closed doors with secret entrance.<br /><br />While this volume searches the shady history of the group of its prominent members of both past and present, this shouldn't signify much to the thinking person who just wants a reasonable ethical, moral, philosophical system to live by.  The reader will however gain much perspective from this read with insights that previously I did not realize about the lodge, e.g. significant move away from stone masons to non-stone masons and move away from Christian ties with Anderson's Constitution; Anti-Mason Party in 1830's.<br /><br />One can read our analysis of this on lcms.org or one might also seek the fine work by John Ankerberg \\"Secret Teachings of the Masonic Lodge.\\"	2005-07-09

This follows his excellent work on Ouimet and the start of America's love with this game and its champions.<br /><br />Frost is good at weaving the story here of Jones and the only Grand Slam to date with the surrounding cultural news.  This provides necessary backdrop to the golf.<br /><br />The persistance of this individual who many a time could have and felt like chucking it in, but kept on, learning and growing not by wins so much, but by the losses.  Fate had its share in all this as well, as Jones and associates knew.  The incidents on and off the links where it almost seemed as the script had already been written, as Pop Keeler sensed from the outset.<br /><br />There are many good stories here, written with gusto and passion and solid wordscultping.  Wonderful photos grace each new chapter.<br /><br />Many developments leading up to the Slam never realized were revealed here:  Mail Freeburg saving them from burning train bridge; skip shot across the lake; etc.<br /><br />This is must reading for avid golfer, for the paths cross likes of Nicklaus, Palmer, Eisenhower, Hagan, Sarazen, etc.  His legendary amateur status, then retirement, accomplishments in studies and law, and friendships abound.<br /><br />Long but will hold one's attention and get one through, so that re-reads can and do happen.	2005-07-05

But what is so wonderful about this textbook is its exposure that the reader will be given to a wide ranging yet vital topic for today.

There I look for the fascinating work that is not one of my areas of interest, e.g. recently I have found three such of these: Bobby Fischer Goes to War; An Imperfect God: George Washington's Slaves & The Creation of America; and now this fascinating work on the infamous violin maker.<br /><br />What strikes one about this attempt to probe this mysterious violin giant is that the mystery like so many remains unsolved.  How did he manage to create instruments that no one has been able to duplicate to date?  The angles, the varnish, the wood, the maturation.  They all continue to be analyzed.  Even all the modern technology hasn't been able to understand nor exceed this Italian craftman's abilities.<br /><br />Faber, a young violinist once, becomes intrigued with the mystery after reading about the contention over the possible forgery of \\"The Messiah,\\" Strad's most popular instrument.  So he begins looking at this man from Cremona, Italy and tracing six of his instruments, and their players, their owners, their trading.<br /><br />So the epicenter of the stringed instrument world has shifted from Italy to Paris to London to NY City.  Could the Third World be next.  Authenticity for buyers becomes solely word of expert analysis and insight.  Millions paid for one Strad.<br /><br />Most readers will be exposed to giants of the stringed instrument world that they never have known, such as Davidov, Lipinski, Bohm, Marie Hall, Tarisio, et al.  Strads go through many players that many will recognize, e.g. Yo-Yo Ma, Paganini, du Pre, etc.<br /><br />This is really a most interesting journey through one of the most popular musical instrumnet and its genius maker.  Faber pokes and probes this mystery from many angles and views, leaving much of this intrigue an open question, but not forsaking his research conclusions.<br /><br />Great appendices with a useful glossary, chronology, exhange rate analysis.<br /><br />A wonderful, enlightening read.enlightening read.	2005-06-08

One will learn many insights into this man, his times, and the issues the earliest Americans faced.  All written well in a form that flows and keeps ones interest peaked.<br /><br />Just outstanding.	2005-06-04

Hagelin presents this in experienced manner with good writing and personal examples from experience.<br /><br />She makes so many good points, just a few that caught this reviewer's eye:  kids are not the problem we adults are!<br /><br />  many want and are making money off our kids by preying on them immorally<br /><br />  it will take guts and committment and teamwork between husband/wife; church and parents, etc.<br /><br />  it's worth the fight!<br /><br />Then she provides resources for each area,i.e. mothering, fathering, schooling, media, etc.<br /><br />One theological issue I have which is not minor, but major: she claims and seems to agree with her church's mission: \\"To love God and people above all else.\\"  This is Jesus' summary of the Ten Commandments, see Luke 10:25-29.  That \\"no one\\" will get to heaven via this path, see Galatians 3:11-12.  Knowing that some will accuse this critique over minor objection, it is anything but minor, it is major, only thing that counts.  And she doesn't really say enough clearly about faith in Christ being only thing necessary for heaven and eternity.<br /><br />This being said, this book is truly valuable, in fact I plan on using it with my church's School parents to help with their children.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2005-05-27

Look what came out of it, much documented in this fine work: the Bachs, Handel, Mendelssohn, Praetorius, et al.<br /><br />Here, Christian musicologist and composer Schalk traces its beginings to restoration beginning with Luther himself and his Kantor, Johann Walter.<br /><br />From there he traces thread to fine contributors e.g. Rhau, Schein, Scheidt, and Schuetz.  There are excellent documented references here for followup.<br /><br />What comes out of this fine read is that Lutherans chose to enlighten music content of Divine Service rather than limit what Roman Catholic church was doing, and even worse the ban which came from Calvinist/Zwinglian side.<br /><br />Fine work that is much needed.	2005-05-19

To do this one needs to bring efficacy, which is achieved by working on the right set of attributes of previous failures and modeling each barrier as a potential hurdle to overcome.<br /><br />Valiante provides this target golf mental game by revealing where previous \\"mastery\\" golfers as opposed to \\"ego\\" golfers have their orientations.  This he accomplishes with classic champs such as Nicklaus and Hogan and current mental game champs such as Woods, DL3 and DeMarco.<br /><br />This is a good read, encouraging the journey as much as anything to keep the joy and challenge of the game and courses at the forefront.

Many chefs have already been into these, but never hurts having other approaches and twists of these around and this will be very beneficial to those who haven't experienced these pantry basics.<br /><br />The following chapters are a bit cookbook unorthodox as titled, but match up in most cases with the usual.  Rather than the typical appetizer he has \\"Devouring\\"; rather than \\"Comfort Food\\" he has \\"Noshing\\"; Consuming = Take Out Oriental + Italian you Make Yourself; Tasting = Seasonal Veggies and Fruits; Savoring = Holiday/Seasonal Hearty Meals; Licking the Plate Clean = Desserts.  This is fun though, and nice for change.<br /><br />The recipes in most cases are unique, not too exotic on the required techniques, equipment and ingreds.  They are tasty, classy and rustic, most of all flavorful.  Being around Tyler's cuisine one finds he is centered on intense flavors, and this recipe collection brings that out in spades for us the home chef de cuisine!  An added feature that is truly nice is that right, directly under each title is the time estimate, including any special time additions (e.g. marinating, etc.) along with serving estimates.<br /><br />I'll start at the back and work my way forward as to some of favorites so far:  Unbelievable \\"Warm Pear Tart with Blue Cheese and Honey\\" (I'm bonkers for this one, combining some of my fav flavors!); Basil Ice Cream with Wine-Poached Cherries;Peach and Blueberry Crostata; Muscat Gelee with Blackberries and Rosemary (get best Muscat you can purchase); Roasted Pork Shoulder Stuffed with Carmalized Plantains; Brothy Pumkin Soup with Pancetta and Cabbage; Barcelona Style Rice; Grilled Pizza with MOzzarella di Bufala, Sausage, and Fresh Tomatoes; Field Mushrooms Roasted with Sausage and Raisins; Sauteed Feta Cheese.<br /><br />There are many more global flavors to experiemnt with here and delight any menu or dining situation challenge.

That was exactly Pres. Bush's response on the news of GM's latest loss, one of its largest.<br /><br />While many reviewers attack some of the details as some kind of proof that the overall thrust of this book is wrong, the numbers of declining market share and consumer trust do not defend them.<br /><br />Growing up in the 50s and 60s, I firsthand can testify to the Big-Three's arrogance to the market.  Big cars are it.  We don't care where this small car demand is coming from.  And they didn't.  They did not respond in time to this threat.  It allowed the Japanese who initially as this book reports did not do well in the marketplace initially, but the American arrogance and back turning on the marketplace allowed them time and space to continue.  Continue they have, winning millions of loyal customers.<br /><br />My family is such.  Now they won't even consider American makes.  The Japanese they have had for years are too reliable, too valuable at resell.  Squawking about the past glory or waving the flag won't help.<br /><br />What will help is retaining current customers.  This will take some yomen work.  Union problems.  Upper management musical chairs.  Failed new product launches.  Huge contiual recalls.  Incentives which cut customer's resell.<br /><br />The Big Three are a mess at the top.  They are not in touch with the market.  They are driven by other things: short term profit, stock price and braggidocio about each litte success they have.  All the time the imports cut into their market share.  They haven't learned to compete.<br /><br />Compete will take time.  It will take different thinking and products.  It will take some kind of reformation of the union dominated factory.  It will take consistent, tough, market driven upper management.  Don't know if Detroit has the moxy to do this.<br /><br />They shoot themselves in the foot too often, and seem to enjoy it so much they do it again and again.  How many \\"new\\" chief execs do they enjoy having, who say just wait, we're regrouping and then announce huge win campaigns which betray declining market shares.  Market shares don't lie.  Neither do massive stagnant inventories.  Nor do low resell, and massive recalls.<br /><br />Worst of all, the momentum is swinging against them.  It will get worse unless it is stopped first.  Then started in the other direction.<br /><br />Significant point this book makes which most overlook is the public attitude difference in the American vs. Import pr.  American's like to make big splash, while Japanese are reserved.  Why can't American learn from their mistakes?<br /><br />They are not driven by the market. Their execs are out of touch.  Seems few of them even know what their potential customers who are turned off with their offering for over two decades, and even know some are defecting care about.<br /><br />Many would like to see the Big Three truly be that.

One quickly finds that family is everything there.  It determines much in life, how one thinks, who one marries, etc.  For women especially, even after freedom from Taliban, there is still residual.  Eyeopening.<br /><br />While the family is atypical in their wealth, they are very typical in most else.  The bookseller's obsession with his own book future determines everything in their orbit.  There is more parallels here with our own career driven lifestyle for many.<br /><br />Education plays out in Kabul and this family in vital way.  With it there is possibility and hope. Without it, fate is all too often determined by others.  Thus, outstanding that the author provides royalties to help women and education there.<br /><br />The religion and politics highlighted from a limited perspective and few pages devoted gives just a snippet of what likely is occurring there, but nonetheless this engages us Americans with other views than likely we get over the tube.<br /><br />Enlightening and engaging read.	2005-04-22

This reviewer's only fear is that many won't even consider them, either due to the misleading title or the number of pages.  The title, while the book makes a case early on and on the back cover to explain itself, doesn't at all captivate and fit.  Much better would have been something like: \\"God's Word in Action:  The Reciprocal Relationship between Doctrine and Practice\\" or \\"Confessing the Faith in Doctrine and Practice\\".  Some more succinct and memorable title would do this marvelous book wonders.<br /><br />The length of over 450 pages should not be obstacle, since it is easy to read, and has marvelous discussion questions at the end of each chapter along with the answers to these at the end.<br /><br />This deserves wide read among Lutherans, and for that matter Christians who want to be in God's truth, both in their doctrinal statements and in their practice thereof.	2005-04-20

This is impressive, uplifting book if one has any conscious pangs about priority problems.  If success at any expense leaves one putting family, friends, faith low on the priority list, this book is real treat.<br /><br />Karen Hughes tells us of her plight with becoming significant advisor to the President and the sacrifices of her son and husband and normal life to aid in the countries business.  Guilt is a tough taskmaster and she reveals her wrestling with its demands and justifications until she comes to the conclusion to rethink her life's priorities.<br /><br />It's comparable to riding on the back of a tiger--- both alternatives are unattractive: get off vs. stay on for the wild ride.  She shares some of her earnest tradeoffs with the developing priorities in this talented journalist, Christian, mom and wife, friend.<br /><br />In all this we get not only a great background view of this history making lady but also of the company she keeps: all the significant newsmakers of our day.<br /><br />This reader also was extremely impressed and thankful for her several clear and wonderful confessions of Christ as her savior.<br /><br />The book is extremely well written and is just delightful and insightful reading, and her sense of humor and humility pervades: Chiding herself throughout for not having much of the gift of vocal music, she will be a great singer in heaven!<br /><br />Strongly recommended.	2005-04-18

The chiefest of these is that life to him is much more than golf.  The joy that comes from the game is import to him, not winning, accolades, etc.<br /><br />His family is primary also, as evidenced by the decisions he has made in favor of his family over golf, e.g. Mercedes tournament absence.<br /><br />There is much revealed in this chronicle of his magical Masters victory, which is the organizational center, then revolving around this is past memories which cropped up in his Green Jacket round, and then contributions by friends, competitors, relatives, caddie, etc.  This makes for a great insight into the talented, competitive golfer who so often is misunderstood and misportrayed by the media.<br /><br />Thus, this book helps to clear the media polluted air about this great golfer and more importantly, family man.  The story of his 2003 with all its trials, but especially about the severe, life threatening birth of son episode endures this great person to me even more.  The joy he takes from more simple things off camera are touching and should be inspirational to many.<br /><br />A great read to all golfers and those interested in Phil.	2005-04-12

Such then is the emphasis of this collection featuring seasonal fruit in this easy to use and prepare fruit dessert recipe collection.<br /><br />These are arranged by fruit with several what may be termed \\"standard recipes\\" while others are creative and not found in other collections.  Being one who is attracted to the latter type, intrigued and delighted with the following: Cheeese, Apple and Nut Melange; Carmelized Apple Timbales; Lemon Bananas in Crisp Shells; Summer Cherry Pudding With Rum Sauce; Crepe Souffles in Grapefruit Sauce; Souffle of Mango with Mango Sauce; Fragrant Melon Soup; Peach and Walnut Tart; Pears Au Gratin; Roasted and Carmelized Pears; Quick Plum and Almond Cake.<br /><br />I'm with Pepin in his approach to cooking and dining, here specifically that fruit desserts are refreshing and symphonic in bringing the entire meal into harmony.  This book will aid in that realized goal.<br /><br />It has wonderful color photos with many of the recipes, and instructions and advice on fruit buying and prep are worthwhile reading.	2005-04-05

That is what the profound thinker/author Guinness thoughtfully writes about in this work.<br /><br />He is careful to contend continuously that he is not just making the case against the cognitive virus of postmodernism but against all systems and philosophies which seek to hijack the truth.<br /><br />His conclusions are salient: the problem is the self. When self delegates truth to itself and self only, that is humanity's ultimate and only problem.  It cannot start within us, but from outside from above.<br /><br />While some including this reviewer appreciate and vibrate to his excellent illustrations from philosophy and literature (which would suggest five star review), many will be frustrated by this inclusions (thus three star or lower) resulting in my four star conclusion.<br /><br />He does sprinkle in some current event type illustrations, e.g. Clinton but more of these would have helped the layperson to be more engaged with this excellent, penetrating delve into truth in the modern practice of it.	2005-04-01

Thus, its strengths are its weaknesses, that it has to contend with theology and history via sociological study methods and principles testing theses.<br /><br />While these produce a delightful, easy read commentary on how Christianity could have begun as a split from Judaism and then succeeded and still does by social factors, it ignores any supernatural intervention of a master salvific plan which could utilize politics, history and yes, even social factors that would achieve its intended and realized march through time and space and history.<br /><br />The author's bias against good Christian exegesis and history is obvious at times, e.g. the status of women holding \\"deaconess\\" office he seems to want to equate with \\"bishop, i.e. pastoral\\" office which is incorrect.  However, that being said, his analysis that the Church elevated the societal role of women is correct and should be.  Thus, can sociology, even sociology of knowledge contend for truth of Christian doctrine?  No, say the best of sociologists of knowledge, this is best left to philosophy or theology.<br /><br />His overall analysis and conclusion that Chrisitanity succeeded where other religions failed to prosper because of a strong moral dimension is somewhat true but misses the point of the truth of its worldview and soteriology.<br /><br />Found his statistical analysis at the beginning of the numbers today being achievable given the starting point to be fascinating and the biggest benefit to this work.	2005-03-30

Walther.<br /><br />Pless does a truly fine job of writing in modern terms and examples.  He is quite the prolific wordsmith, so he makes what could be dull, academic discussion fun and enlightening.  This is coupled with discussion questions after each of the 13 chapters.  This makes it an excellent candidate for group and individual study.  Also appendiced is Luther's Sermon on distinguishing between Law and Gospel.<br /><br />Let me give several examples of this fine writing:  \\"When the Law is not preached in such a way as to uncover unbelief, it will create Pharisees.\\"  \\"Doctrinal error left untreated can lead to spiritual death.\\"  \\"The human heart prefers its own enthusiasms rather than God's Word.\\"<br /><br />A significant, timely and well done resource for the Body of Christ.

Thus, following Biblical admonition in this as Jesus states in Matthew 6:33: \\"Seek you first the kingdom of God and His righteousness\\".<br /><br />Know that this irritates and frustrates and even angers postmodern types, but this will only place them in confessional groupings where they only think they are getting it right.<br /><br />It is confusing and troubling to have to search so many alternatives that say that \\"speak the truth for God.\\"  Discernment here is what is called for, cf. Hebrews 5:11-14 and Acts 17:11.<br /><br />Included are some nice outlines of confessional beliefs including my own, LCMS.  However, the recommended resources for followup are not that good.  I would recommend others as starting point.<br /><br />What are all these comments about not including \\"non-Christian\\" groups, e.g. Mormons, Islam, etc.  The author clearly states this is not the scope of this book.<br /><br />Mediocre and dangerous guide if one is seeking to affiliate with God's truth.	2005-03-15

This is lots of good, basic recipes for all occasions, and for all ages with a special grouping for the kids.<br /><br />I'm into these: Chicken with Tabbouleh; Wheatberry Salad; Sunday Rib Roast with Stilton Sauce and Horseradish Mustard Sauce; Mashed Yellow Turnips with Crispy Shallots; Frozen Key Lime Pie; Scrambled Eggs Three Ways; and one of my all time favs: Jam Thumbprint Cookies.<br /><br />This is not exotic food, so when you're really out to wow someone with all the culinary genius and steps you can chew off, this is not the recipe collection for that. But for family gatherings with great food, they'll enjoy eating these and you'll enjoy the simplicity of prep and serving.<br /><br />Good sections on Menu Suggests as well Kitchen Tools Recommed and Nine Pantry Items to Have on Hand.<br /><br />Great wordsmithing intro as well as color phots.

That's his goal and he achieves it in this liitle over than 300 page offering with 4-color photos.<br /><br />What I find enchanting about this is His \\"Easy Tips\\" with each recipe.  Here he unloads some of the technique, or ingredient shopping, or substitutes, or secrets when adding an ingredient.  These are the things one learns when cooking which add that extra pizazzzz that we all know we've discovered when eating food really well prepared.  Here he also offers ideas about other dishes to serve with and sometimes beverage suggests.<br /><br />The recipe collection is wide and succulent.  Try the likes of: Pistacio-Vanilla Crusted French Toast.  Here he offers almonds in place of pistacios, and if you're like me, can't get enough nuts.  This is delicious with better slice of bread and vanilla scented.  He even recommends jam or Berry compote as alternative to syrup or powdered sugar.  Southwest Strata with turkey Sausage is great brunch or large breakfast crowd serving.<br /><br />Working my way through such as: Zesty Lemon Bars;Banana Spring Rolls with Two Dipping Sauces; Sun-Dredi Cherry Pinot Noir Sauce;Wild Rice and Arborio Risott with Sauteed Apple; Peppered Filets Mignons with Sherry and Raisins;BBQ Turkey and Green Chili Quesadillas.<br /><br />There is superb Appendix on Kitchen Equip recommendations and Wolf's Favorite Wine Lists.<br /><br />The photography is nice, with many of prep steps shown and explained.

It is here at the beginning that I experienced \\"mild\\" frustration.  His tendency is to quote from older sources, and neglects more recent exegetical looks at the NT Communal passages, e.g. omission of A: rt Just's Lukan commentaries or Lockwood's views in 1 Corinthians commentary or Art Just's great book: \\"The Ongoing Feast\\", or John Stephenson's work in the Confessional Lutheran Dogmatics on the subject.<br /><br />However, this minor frustration aside, Bartels does provide an excellent overview through time of the thinking and practice of this sacred meal instituted by Christ.  This quote from the final chapter is salient: \\"How has it happened that four litte words, \\"This is My body,\\" have been so variously interpreted, resulting in such a myriad of applications and beliefs?\\"<br /><br />He answers: philosophy, ecumenism, human opinion.  Even the Lutherans who by their very namesake stood for Sola Scriptura have abandoned their dogmatic position.<br /><br />This study showcases these developments, providing not only the historical accounts but also well supported bibliographic references for more research and questions with answers after each chapter.<br /><br />Good for individual or group usage.	2005-03-10

Neat treats they are, i.e. The Manor Born Banana Cake with Coffee Buttercream; Mississippi Mud Cake; Summerhouse Cake; Nutty Ned's Walnut Bars; Lemon Ice Box Pie (great story here of first cooks' obtaining free fur coat saving labels from key ingredient condensed milk labels); Schrafft's Tutti Frutti Chiffon Pie; and their infamous \\"Frrrrozzzen Hot Chocolate\\".  This is fun to eat/drink/slurp stuff!!!<br /><br />This is fun collection.  The stories and favorite seats of famous and rest of stories are as good as recipes.  Not that difficult of technique or ingredients, one can find much \\"serendipity\\" with these!

China has been one of those \\"iffy\\" places where publically the government would want us to believe there is religious freedom, but there are real doubts.  What is truly fascinating from this read is that China Christians feel God's call to the Islam nations!<br /><br />This book serves to provide a view of that very thing, with a well documented history and insights into the Far East power, with this well written former editor of Time magazine in China.<br /><br />The profiles of the key players both from the government's Religious Bureau and the house churches and foreigners is illuminating.  Theology is not discerned much, just a journalistic type mentioning of its leanings at times, along with some of their confessional publishing appendixed.<br /><br />God bless all those that have and are and will take a stand to confess Christ in that place.	2005-03-06

Neither could 16thC saints with ours, as Gregory writes: \\"The prospect of doctrinal pluralism horrified and disgusted them.  They preferred a world in which truth did battle, come what may, to one swarming with ever-proliferating heresies.\\"<br /><br />This very fine written account of Protestant, Anabaptist and Roman martyology in the early modern period gives one great insight into this very different world of committed believers in a time when governing rulers held orthodox vs. heterodox seriously, even at times serious to the point of captial punishment for non-repudiation of false doctrine.  What strikes the careful reader is the amazing research and documentation that is here presented at a reasonable price for such a record.  Thanks to the publisher for the notes tied to page number for those of us who like to see the documentation as we're reading easily, conveniently.<br /><br />His introduction and challenges to modern mind and academia is outstanding and worthwhile just for this beginning which this reviewer amens!<br /><br />One will grasp much more about this time by this read.  Neat to learn that Luther wrote first hymn in honor of martyr.<br /><br />One of the best reads for me in quite some time.	2005-02-28

Because in this God reveals clearly His Law and Gospel and the Gospel clearly articulated by His Apostle Paul.<br /><br />What initially attracted me to Schlatter was the glowing praise given him by Martin Franzmann, one of my favorite NT commentators.  Reading this work on Romans, one sees why Franzmann's strong recommendation.<br /><br />Schlatter is a wholistic Bible interpreter, not being able to be completely classified with other approaches.  He is very much into philology, but never gets completely confined by it.  He is the consumate Lutheran in allowing proper Biblical tensions to be maintained, not resolved by hermeneutical gymnatstics or higher criticism, e.g. simul peccator et iustus.<br /><br />Translated from the original German, this is good addition to one's library on the important letter to the Romans.	2005-02-24

Nevertheless, his salient and penetrating analysis of the whole field of views on an OT Book is worthwhile and will yield substantial gleanings.<br /><br />This reviewer periodically consults this volume at the very start to each OT sermon or OT bible study.  Rereading Hummel's thoughts start me out on good path, supplying author, date, style, relevant theological thought, etc.<br /><br />This would not be the place to send a layperson, but even then, some of the more insightful might want to consult this as well.

Thus, the flow for him to this Sermon on Mount is high Christology.  This completely flies in the face of common held moral usefulness of this discourse, i.e. purpose driven church and life.  This is rules for Christian life, right!  No, says Scaer, this is not prescriptive but descriptive.  This is Gospel not Law.  Scaer makes worthy point that since Matthew's flow up to this discourse if high Christology, then it would be startlingly turn to shift to \\"rules for living.\\"  Rather, seen in its context of John and Jesus' preaching of repentance for the kingdom of heaven has come, this is seen as \\"essence and heart of Christian preaching.\\"<br /><br />Thus, verse 3 is critical, just who are the poor?  All those who have need for the Good News to be preached to them (repentant).  This does include everyone, except not everyone senses this need, i.e. healthy don't need a hospital, just the sick says the Lord.  Thus, rich in relationship to God without Christ alone don't need the Gospel.  Rules for living will be fine, thank you very much.  Don't tell me I'm theologically poor!  I am not a poor miserable sinner.<br /><br />Thus, Scaer provides church with needful corrective to abuse of this text which abuses the Gospel and Christ and church.  Here Scaer contributes signficant point, which I'll quote his words: \\"The Beatitudes are the christological prism through which the followers of Jesus find their standing before God.\\"  Scaer devotes much space to exposure of critic's view, which to the uninformed seems only for academia to argue over, but it does have major relevance to Christ's followers.  Due to media's continued coverage of critic's views of Jesus and Paul on the tube especially, the people of God need such well informed response from this able interpreter.<br /><br />How magnificent that this significant Servant of the Word gives to Christ's church this commentary on Christ's catechetical training to edify the foundation of the church's life in Christ.  There is no being \\"a better Christian,\\" but rather \\"being a follower of Jesus.\\"<br /><br />Worth the read.

Not only well written that keeps one's attention, but this is fair and balanced, many times sounding Reagan opposition as well as laudatory.<br /><br />Truly a complex individual, Reagan is hard to capture without maintaining tensions, and this book achieves that.  Looking at his life in politics, it provides some background before his involvement with Screen Actors Guild, then his GE days before his governor days leading to the White House.  Then it disects his presidency from viewpoints of economics, Soviet Union, etc.<br /><br />One forgets just how passionate and into his love of freedom and country so this account provides this joggers so that the reader can see just how intelligent and responsible this leader was.  History I believe will bear that his was one of the significant presidents of all time, since he accomplished so much.<br /><br />Learned much that I had forgotten about him, e.g. his admiration of Calvin Coolidge, as well as famous wit and debating skill he possessed.  As Thatcher said of him, \\"He won the Cold War without firing a shot.\\"  This was the Great Communicator.	2005-01-24

He convincingly shows that the current view of Islam's history and beliefs compared with Christianity's is somewhat distorted and untrue.<br /><br />He aspect by aspect shows how today's world is not shown the entire breath of Islam's past and current cultural and theological stance on many societal issues: women, charity, liberty, justice, war and peace, Jesus, the Crusades, science and medicine, law.  These are all fascinating and enlightening discussions, and at the least would fester further research and inquiry into interested subject matters with bibliographical materials included for such persual.<br /><br />If one seeks but a theological comparison of the two, one would be wise to check out the best source I have found: Norman L.

How about a family of four losing a combined total of 560 pounds on it?  How about a gourmet chef who gives us what worked with them to achieve this?  How about unique approach and recipes which apply this?<br /><br />I was attracted to this after watching George on his FoodNetwork program.  He is very humble, yet reliable credentialed chef who has experiemnted with many twists and combos of good cooking yet with low carb.<br /><br />It avoids lots of the scientific stuff but emphasizes what must happen in pantry and cooking to achieve a healthier diet habit.  Sugar and carbs are of course the focus.  His approach is doable and the taste is exceptional.  I especially like his approach with heavy cream, butter and low-carb foods.<br /><br />What I find especially attractive is his breakfast section, one of the toughest meals of the day for most of us to habitually maintain healthy and yet one of the most important.  So there is such variety and ease of prep here, with great muffin and omelet and blinis and quiche.  Great advice to make them up in advance, freeze and then micro each morning with coffee.  Try: \\"Ham and Cheddar Morning Muffins\\" or \\"George's Gorgeous Macadamia Banana Muffins\\" or \\"On-Hand Omelet.\\"<br /><br />The other menu sections are equally creative, filling and easy to prep: Grilled Country-Style Pork Ribs with Bourbon Barbecue Sauce; Ham and Mock Potato Soup; Chocolate Pecan Brownies with Cream Cheese Frosting; Jicama Matchstick Fries; Minute Steak Salad; Tequilla Chicken;<br /><br />There are some 125 recipes in this collection, with easy to follow instructions and advice as well as some color photos.

In this book, he seeks to do that by analyzing how the Constitution is fairing in recent judicial times. His judgment is that it is chaos.<br /><br />He believes in natural law basis which then gives inalienable rights, that is rights that cannot be overturned or suspended for the sake of majority vote.  He emphasizes at the end that we are a republic, not a democracy just so that the majority cannot take away individual rights.  He sees this happening in many areas of our judicial system: right to bear arms, free speech, bribery of witnesses, breaking law to enforce, etc.  In these, he provides examples, not just theory.  Those interested might check out John Warwick Montgomery's book: Law Above the Law.<br /><br />He then takes on the current administration for their suspending rights due to terrorism prevention.  This is only area the Judge makes which does not have my full support.  There must be more(hopefully so) to the story than we know.  Yet, that too is scary part because can the government hide behind national security interests and strip ordinary citizens? Napolitano makes a strong point here:  \\"We are a nation of laws, not men, and no president is president forever.\\"<br /><br />This will truly get one thinking.  His chapter on \\"What We Can Do?\\" is enlightening.	2004-12-23

Dogs seem to be able to adapt and put up with tasks it would not seem they were bred and equipped for.  This is the thesis that Katz explores in this well written work.<br /><br />Dogs traditionally were for work: hunting, herding, guarding, etc.  Now they seem to be moving towards work that is anything but what they were bred for.  To get humans through difficult situations: divorce, loneliness, old age, etc.<br /><br />This the author does without bias and very well balanced presentation.  His exploration is up close and he is able to probe and captivatingly for the reader present the evidence.<br /><br />The reader senses the author has compassion for the dogs and their owners.  What primarily comes forth is that training is truly called for, not for the dogs but for their owners who need to learn how a dog thinks and reacts.  Our motivation for having a dog is many times suspect, and leads to the dog reacting in ways that further estrange this masterful creature from its normal, giving response.<br /><br />A book that will help many in this regard also:  \\"Latchkey Dogs: How The Way You Live Shapes the Behavior of the Dog You Love\\" by Jodi Anderson.<br /><br />Katz is truly the dog lover's friend and this well researched and written work provides much to ponder and admire in these amazing canine friends.	2004-12-22

How wrong this would be!<br /><br />They when read in their full context of the Magdeburg Confession of 1550 are rather in the train of Luther.  They follow the two kingdoms and the warnings of Luther written in his documents regarding when resistance is not only not sinful, but expected by Christians.  The discernment to call such into play is major and significant for both Luther and Magdeburg pastors and is to be sure a last resort that hopefully, prayerfully would never be called into action.  However, as in the case of Magdeburg it was.<br /><br />These brave souls stood against the Emperor and his threatening forces in the seige of their city over nothing other than their right to preach the Gospel as they sought to.<br /><br />Whitford's insights into this significant historical event for our time and others is well worth this short but provocative read.

From firsthand experience I will attest that until one trys his approach personally, the suspicion of why all this extreme effort and care will not pay off.  However, attestation can also be given to once invoked, this guy's skill and attention does pay off: I tried his unique Bliny recipe with huge payoff!  Never going to use another nor purhase Bliny again.<br /><br />Here he shifts from the French Laundry approach to one his favorite ways of dining, French bistro style.  For him bistro is about technique, so he refines and refines the refinement to a high standard which is provided here in this large format recipe collection.<br /><br />Keller teamed up with Jeff Corciello to form Bouchon, dedicated to the best in bistro.  Their outpouring here is enhanced by the same high standards of publishing which gave us the French Laundry Cookbook, huge format with rich photographay and grand wordsmithing by Michael Ruhlman.  This collaborative team produces a huge resource that is magnificent in its style and layout, easy to keep spread open and cook with.<br /><br />The recipes exude the bistro style of few, usually plain ingredients prepared in tried and true technique, here enhanced by Keller and associates to the ultimate level of richness and taste explosion.<br /><br />An example of this care of prep can be exhibited by one of my favorites here taken to heights: Roasted Beet Salad.  His tips of selection and prep are key, and for best results should be adhered to:  buy beets with tops attached, utilizing fresh squeezed OJ.  This is sensuous salad, which I can vouch even non-beet lovers will!<br /><br />Second, if you're a afficianado of Onion Soup, here is the recipe, carefully crafted and layered for unbelievable result!  How about two pages of intro about the vessel, carmelization, size of onion slices, broth vs. salt, etc. before even beginning?  This is the care and extent to which this collection goes, so the naive cookbook owner who doesn't share this passion to truly turn out a work of love in an Onion Soup will be repelled by such.  For those who love providing such, this recipe is typical of this collection.  Rewarding will be the effort.<br /><br />There are truly some true gems of recipes here!  Try the likes of Duck Confit with Brussels Sprouts and Mustard Sauce.  Or Cod with a Stew of Sweet Peppers.  Braised Beef with Red Wine has been tried by this reviewer from many different sources in many different creations, but this one is special, due to the details here suggested in the Bouchon refinements of the classic.<br /><br />For finisher, try the succulent Apple Ice Cream with Calvados, made with a creme fraiche base which gives it a richness level to delight!  Also, the Profiteroles for the Cream Puffs with Vanilla Ice Cream and Chocolate Sauce will satisfy and excite the Chocolate Lover in your dining group!<br /><br />There is a Basic Building Block Section for prep and technique as well as brief one page listing of sources.<br /><br />This will remain untouched by many who buy or recieve this who are not yet to the point of taking time and patience of lavish food preparation with the best in ingredients.  This book does have the distinct advantage though of not the exotic ingredients of the French Laundry fame, although it will be intimiating for many.

The two have always been interlinked by cultures.<br /><br />Here Sire expands on his previous work \\"The Universe Next Door\\" where in the modern world of the religions being more universal in scope he presents his additional thinking on the subject.<br /><br />Certainly this can be beneficial in several senses.  First, for the Christian one can gain insight into the consistency of one's own worldview.  What I mildly object to is the sense that one's behavior overall speaks of one's worldview.  According to Romans 7, then this is impossible consistenly.  Second and more importantly, apologetically speaking this is of value is helping Christians speak of worldview in case of discussing with other worldviews.<br /><br />All this needs tempering with the Biblical truth that no one will be argued into the faith, either philosophically or worldview speaking.  The Spirit must teach the truth or no penetration will succeed, no matter how good the worldview is.<br /><br />He has good biographical sources cited, especially would this reviewer suggest Nancy Pearcy's book \\"Total Truth.\\"	2004-11-30

He does not assume that his readership is well versed in technical legal jargon so is careful to define and explain as he goes, which this reviewer found very helpful.  Even when I thought I knew what he was referring to, his clarity and succinctness helped immensely in the experience.<br /><br />For much of our country who harbors wrong thinking about the Supreme Court, how they operate and what they are to do Constituionally this is just the book to give the needed correction.  Essentially this book serves that purpose well: to provide the chronolical history of the court's developments including profiles of the justices, its changing legal posture, its historic, landmark cases and Chief Justice Rehnquist's running commentary on such.<br /><br />It is lucid, well structured and thus easy to follow and insightful.  Especially was his valuable contributions on just how the court has functioned, now functions on selecting cases to hear.  I was intrigued especially by the government's seizure of the steel industry and Montgomery Ward's Chicago headquarters during WWII.<br /><br />Just a great read from beginning to end which will and should span a wide breath of readers.  Worthy to become classic on the topic.  Glad that he didn't write this as memoirs on his court term.  That likely will to come, or be published posthumously.	2004-11-19

It presents the argument that the same polarization that faced both Alexander Bell and Edward Gallaudet are still with us today.<br /><br />I never knew much about either of these productive individuals, but what Winefiled provides in this work is substantial.  The parallels of their upbringing and the differences are chronicled in easy-to-read text.  Winefield is able remarkably to remain aloof from adding his own view and let's these two giants of the debate speak with their lives and their opinions.<br /><br />Integration in the hearing world versus full individual potential are laid out, leading up to and beyond confrontation between these two innovators of educating deaf children.  The oralist versus the combined method continue to be debated and tested.<br /><br />One salient point brought out in this fine work is that the attitudes and expectations of each individual will determine his response to this debate.  A fine work to aid in beginning to understand the complexities of this yet resolved historical communications issue.	2004-11-19

Many great restaurants have their wait staff announce when taking orders:  \\"Tonight's special are .....\\"  I'm one of those that attentively listens and asks questions and frequently orders from specials.<br /><br />Turns out my thinking is like Lomonoco's: this is where chef's creativity is being experimented with, usually to highlight an ingredient just found, or use up ingredients that are around, or to try something new to see how it catches on before making it on permanent menu.<br /><br />He believes this nightly special concept is an important intersection for the home chef, since the restaurant chef has little time to get too exotic with the line chefs and must provide clear and not-too-detailed steps to get these specials out.<br /><br />Here in this creative and sizeable collection Lomonaco of TV fame (FoodNetwork and Epicurious) and 21 Club and Windows on World has had background and experience to let his imagination and zest for food to be displayed in over 125 \\"spontaneous and creative\\" recipes for the home chef.<br /><br />They are nicely broken into usable groupings, i.e. soups, salads, fish, beef, etc.  What is nice and usable is the concept being adapted by lots of wonderful chefs such as Ming Tsau and others is that of basic recipe with tradeoffs and substitutions of both ingredients and techniques.  These options make it superb for home chef who wants to do more with food than simply micro or heat up in pan, but wants to minimize labor over stove and prep area. These still take some time to prepare and only addition would have been nice is estimates provided of prep time and baking/cooking time.<br /><br />What is provided are creative, scrumptuous food that we have come to expect and appreciate from Lomonaco: \\"Roasted Summer Vegetables with Blue Cheese\\"; \\"Open Faced Swordfish Portobello, and Pancetta Club\\"; \\"Alpine Baked Pasta\\"; \\"Toasted Barley and Butternut Squash\\"; \\"Ceviche of Bay Scallops and Blood Oranges\\"; \\"Pan Roasted Halibut with Asparagus, Fava Beans, and Thyme Broth\\" (here is example of his options: not wild about fava beans, substituted french green beans with great results); \\"Grilled Whitefish Salad with Yellow Tomato and Tarragon Vinaigrette\\"; \\"Grilled Pork Chops with Coffee Barbecue Sauce\\"; \\"Triple Berry And Pecan Crunch Pie.\\"<br /><br />A beaut that many will not find if they are not familiar with this exceptional chef, who has a flair and energy for great food which certainly has caught my menus.

This continues to develop as she senses signs which she responds to which eventually culminate in the founding of her magnificent work with cancer children.<br /><br />Puzzling and of concern is her admission that she was babe in the Scriptures and still seems to be convinced by outward confirmation of rather bizarre happenings, rather than clear fountain of God's Holy Word. For example, her story in Detroit with the key to the kingdom is more poignantly given in Scripture repeatedly said to be Christ crucified for sins, e.g. Luke 24 et al.<br /><br />While truly a model for all, but especially young and talented, to serve humanity, her tendency to follow outward occurrences and inward emotions to the exclusion and reduction of clearly revealed Word of God is dangerous and suspicious.<br /><br />Don't let any of this reviewer's spiritual concerns detract anyone from this fine read and inspiration to all to get involved and serve.	2004-10-30

His humor and talent show from his culinary acknowledged beginnings of Pop-tarts, then from ABC Sports to cookbook reading in libraries!  This book is lively and informative and creative and great eating tarts!<br /><br />Applying all his French learning with his creative touch led to City Bakery fame.  His desire for quality and seasonal menus breathed life into his enterprise and this resultant cookbook.  How neat that he has shared all that work and development with us who like to whip up a tart every now and then. This work will greatly aid!<br /><br />What is neat is that his goal of making simplistic tart recipes so that new employees could achieve the high quality he wanted is achieved for us home pastry types.  Here they are seasonally offered after a just unbelievable primer on Tarts 101.  Ingredients, equipment, then tart dough recipes and procedures, as well as decorating and chocolate tips.

This is her fourth venture into publishing books on this, and each is just outstanding, fun, practical, and interactive.<br /><br />Here she goes where not many venture, into inexpensive but good wines for everyday, home dining. She offers recipes paired with selections that one would not normally think of.  Here she introduces us to what she learned in Spain --- having wine with our dinner, and not just our ordinay routine of trying to enjoy our favorite with everything, but reaching out to try Reisling with \\"Plank Cooked Salmon\\".  I was not into this at first sight, but first bite changed it all.  She is right on that the combo of the Indonesian Five Spice BBQ sauce lights up with a great WashState or Aussie or NewZealand Riesling.<br /><br />There are more great things like this to try out, all lined up by grape type, i.e. Chardonnay, Dessert Wines, etc.  This is nice way to venture out, e.g. try type normally wouldn't or go the other way and line up a recipe like \\"Turkey Quesadillas with Sesame-Sweet Potato Mole Sauce\\" and she what she pairs it with: in this case \\"Barrel Fermented Chard.\\"<br /><br />She writes with spice and it is just plain fun to treat your taste buds to new delights with the likes of \\"Chicken Legs Braised in Pinot Grigio Mojo\\" paired with a Pinot Grigio.  Or for finale, how about \\"Ice Wine\\" with \\"Tropical Fruits on the half-shell with Banana Crunch Topping\\".  Truly Yum!<br /><br />Finally, couldn't resist letting you into some combos here that knocked me out: Spanish wines with Spanish Stype Scrambled Eggs with Chorizo and Manchego Fricos, and Cheese Grits with Shrimp and Chorizo.  Great brunch or weeknight supper with an attitude!<br /><br />There are some good color photos, source suggestions along with technique advice.

Given that the Gay Activist have been thus far so successful of making it into an acceptable sexual orientation and even getting some to believe that since homosexuality is genetic than we should just accept it.  Dr. Satinover gives insightful parallels from the outset and throughtout with alcoholism.<br /><br />Given that their is no conclusive evidence exactly why some have homosexual orientation, we are each individually and collectively in society left with moral decision.  Satinover chooses to base his on a Christian worldview.<br /><br />To be sure, such clear and concise writing will and has brought negative reviews.  Note carefully how most of them do not seek to refute the author's with \\"any\\" listed scientific research?  Not one of them lists any work any of us can go and check out.  Notice the misleading comments on Christianity which no respectable Christian would agree with, e.g. the New Testament has no such labeling of homosexuality a sin. Check out Romans 1.<br /><br />This is the terrible time we find out society in.  One that is so fashioned by political and media blitzes which has pushed us in directions that are just not well thought out, investigated areas.  Homosexuality is one of these as so well exposed, thought out, and articulated for us in this work by Dr. Satinover.<br /><br />As one thoughtful and accurate Christian reviewer pointed out, the Bible does not label homosexuality the greatest sin of all.  The greatest sin of all is not believing in the one true God and His revelation, the Bible which has all sinners' transgressions paid for by the crucified one, including homosexuals.  A far different story than the one the Gay Activists would like to paint.  You read His Word and decide.g homosexuals.  A far different story than the one the Gay Activists would like to paint.

I've been a cookbook fan and user of Karen and her husband having enjoyed cooking from their cookbook, but now to have one devoted to Karen's outstanding talents and love for desserts is neat.<br /><br />She has a philosophy here that should comfort and inspire: to get us back cooking our own desserts using great recipes.  That's how she and previous generations learned, at the side of someone who had a great recipe.  Her styling of this collection of desserts is with the home chef in mind.  So, ingredients, techniques and equipment are with us in mind, and she tells us her preferences and what she used to make these.  Also, she provides info as one proceeds with the recipe on what to expect, adjust, etc.<br /><br />Most of the recipes are not complex, nor simple, but all delicious and most very unique and creative.  But none of them are of that category of being \\"over the top\\" that would scare most of us home dessert makers to ignore trying them, except in those unique times when we would torture ourselves and our patience to take days to make a special one.  None of that here!  Just great desserts!<br /><br />I've tried several of the following with great results and look forward to more of the same: Lime Meringue Tart; Blackberry Slump with Sweet Potato Dumplings; Bourbon Creme Caramel with Bruleed Bananas; Summer Cherry Berry Pudding; Dark Chocolate Peppermint Pattie Cake; Banana Upside Down Cakes; Pumpkin Cognac Cheesecake Brulee; Ruby Port Ice Cream; Purple Plum Rum Sorbet; Cornmeal Vanilla Bean Shortbreads; Raised Cocoa Waffles a la Mode.<br /><br />There is much useful sections as well: Baker's Bookshelf; Sources; Equivalent Pan Sizes (this I find extremely useful);<br /><br />All in all a most delightful and substantial dessert guide for just us home bakers.

Braun helps by providing his own interpretations of such, and for this reason this work is helpful.<br /><br />He breaks his investigation into timeframes: Stone AGe, Bronze Age, Iron Age, Hellinistic-Roman.

Thus, this addition to the cookbook collection to make for her.<br /><br />It appears from this elegant and lush work an abundance of great chocolate based recipes.  The author used sixty pounds in making them.  There are some grand ones: Chocolate Pecan Turtle Tart; Grilled Chocolate-Stuffed Bananas; Chocolate, Dried Cherry, and Pistachio Bread and Butter Pudding; Crisp Chocolate Chip Cookies with Dried Cherries and Pistachios; Chocolate Creme Fraiche Ice Cream.<br /><br />With more than 65 recipes covering dessert gamut, this is worthy collection of an accomplished chef, chocoholic, and gourmet writer.

Lewis and Sigmund Freud Debate God, Love, Sex, and the Meaning of Life	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Very Excellent, Revealing Read on 2 Influential Men	This is truly a great read! It deals with two influential figures on history's stage with two converging and diverging views: Freud and Lewis.<br /><br />They both had experience in atheism, both influential in their fields, both extensive writers, and both still influential in our day.<br /><br />What divides them and thus the main topic of this book's investigation is that Lewis came out of atheism into Christianity.  Thus, psychiatrist Nicholi compares the thinking of these two are \\"the question of god\\".  Fascinating discussion concerning love, sex, evil, death.<br /><br />What comes across in this so well done work is that: 1) Freud comes across as a troubled soul, never at peace with himself, his world;  2) Lewis' life and world subsequently changes after his conversion to Christianity.<br /><br />Nicholi puts forth the evidence from their writings, and writings about them with his comments added as well. Makes one want to delve more into each, but especially for some of us who are far more familiar with Lewis' books than Freud. I especially appreciate his use of endnotes sorted by the page number that they are found.  Most useful!<br /><br />Certainly one doesn't have to totally agree with either man's perspective on things, but as Nicholi asks, which one's views appear more reasonable and concur consistently with how they lived their life in harmony with this worldview.<br /><br />Absolutely a great read!	2004-10-11

He makes the salient point that there are pervading issues of uncertainty on this controversial issue of stem cell research, especially in the two areas that some would make it seem it's a slam dunk:  scientific and medical.  What is not told enough to the general public about this issue is that there are equally if not more promising technologies out there to benefit disease and suffering than stem cell.  Further, he shows how some of the previous track record of science in promising huge societal returns if society will only let science take the ethical risks have not only not fulfilled their beneficial promises, but have brought about tragic and troubling ethical/medical results.  He further intimates that the results of some already stem cell research has brought more opening of \\"ethical can of worms\\" than it has solved.  These need to be thought out, and he argues convincingly that science needs to provide more justification for such contentious reserach before gaining go ahead approval.  Just playing the old \\"religion vs. science\\" card doesn't fit here, nor should it be played.<br /><br />Many other essayists bring out what is not really being discussed enough: source of stem cells.  In vitro has allowed a supposed research population, with too much assumption about \\"eggs ready for research\\".  Possibly this is area that society has a whole has been too uninformed and needs to reconsider.  The supposed right to have a child at any cost mentality and ethic that has spurned such an industry and frozen embryo population has brought about this bioethic dillemma,now seeping into stem cell and cloning.  James Peterson gives an insightful essay into this source issue.<br /><br />The highly fluid discussion of any moral status the embryo might have is engaged uniquely by Brent Waters. He suggests we turn to a most useful concept is our judging of this\\" our neighbor.<br /><br />Since this issue is in the news and the 2004 Presidential election, citizens interested in various religious views will be served well with this work.  It includes some major religious confessional bodies' statement as well as the President's Council of Bioethics statement as well appendixed.source issue. <br /> <br />The highly fluid discussion of any moral status the embryo might have is engaged uniquely by Brent Waters.

I recommend you see and read my review in \\"Da Vinci Code: Fact or Fiction?\\" by Maier and Hannagraf.<br /><br />There you will find that from the outset Brown deceives by assuming as \\"fact\\" something that is fiction and has been proven to be so: that of the Priority of Sion.<br /><br />As well, he is deceptive on Constantine as well as the voting at the Council of Nicea.  The noted review above spells all that out.<br /><br />As polarized as our culture is it is easy to see how some on both sides seek to distort and standarize the falsification and misleading of people honestly seeking the truth on such issues as Christ, evolution, etc.  To make fiction fact, and the opposite is becoming too characteristic of our culture.  Many will unfortunately read this fiction of a book and assume it disproves the claims of Christianity easily and decisively.<br /><br />For this the author has made a serious mistake.  Although his plot is intriguing, it is seriously flawed from the outset and he makes no such claim that it is fantasy and fraud.  Unless he has other proof for which he has not provided.<br /><br />Smacks of the problem with the culture elites such as CBS News and Dan Rather.  Our country deserves better than this.	2004-10-04

Maier is a pre-eminent history scholar of the times of the apostles and Jesus and Hannigraf is an accomplished apologist in theology.<br /><br />They from the beginning of Brown's bestseller debunk it as a hoax starting with his opening assumption:  assume as a fact that the Priory of Sion exists as Brown's novel writes about it!<br /><br />Factual or fictional assumption?  Fictional.  This is quickly unloaded as being an unresearched, unchecked bit of writing.  Maier quickly shows that an ex-con Anti-Semite had planted these falsified documents at the Bibliotechque in Paris and that this has been authenticated.  See his footnote on this fact by NY Times Book Review Laura Miller who checked this all out and shows that this is all one big hoax!<br /><br />Next, is what Brown writes about Constantine true: that he was the one who made Jesus into a superdeity, that he collated the Bible and other devious, manipulative schemes to make Christianity thrive?  Fact or fiction?  Fiction.  There is not one shred of valid historical evidence to support Brown's wild speculations.  Thus his plot quickly falls to ruins.<br /><br />Or, did the Council of Nicea when voting on the deity of Christ have an extremely close vote as Brown's novel suggest it did?  Fact or fiction?  Fiction: the vote was 300 to 2!<br /><br />Need to go on?  I don't, but some of you who are moved by anything even suspicious as disproving history and deconstructing it will likely not be impressed by this or this book or any significant, tested and accepted by all evidence.<br /><br />We believe what we want to.

Why does Allah and Muhammed and Buddah not enjoy this same treatment?<br /><br />Fact or Fiction?  Check it out.  You should be disturbed by what you find.

I must admit to being far more partial to the non-fiction, but I do glance over the new fiction offerings and force myself at times to read some.<br /><br />Recently on one of these excursions, I came across an author I was familiar with, Sparks whom my wife has read all his works and adores them.  That and the title screamed instantly: Buy me and read me!<br /><br />Having did both, I am so pleased that I did.

It delivers the chronicling of the social and political movements that were a part of atheism's history, rather than the desired by some philosophical, abstract analysis of atheism's thought system.<br /><br />McGrath has a personal stake in this movement, and not just a abstract, academic one, but a personal history involving culture, politics, religion.  No sanitized removal of this thought system apart from its weaving into fabric of society and its political and social dimensions could tell this story.<br /><br />McGrath is proficient in analyzing subjects which interest him.  His fame as investigator into such as: Luther's Theology of the cross, Intellectual foundations of Pre-Reformation theology, Calvin, King James Bible, Justification of God history, etc.  What an amazing list!  Check out anyone on these who knows anything, and you'll find McGrath's works on such at the top.<br /><br />This latest contribution achieves that same prominence for those of us who have followed and read his past contributions.  It is thorough, well documented, fresh and erudite.<br /><br />His main premise is that atheism is in a twilight zone, where it has faded to shadows of society.  It flourishes in times when religion oppresses, but suffer withdrawal when spirituality is an asset to people's lives.  Thus, now is downtime for atheism.<br />This as McGrath rightly clarifies does not infer that it will remain down for the count.  This quote shows some of that: \\"The future looks nothing like the godless and religionless world so confidently predicted forty years ago.  Political opportunies and cultural sensitivity have led to religious beliefs being treated with new respect.  The atheist agenda, once seen as a positive force for progress, is now seen as disrespectful toward cultural diversity.\\"<br /><br />For the discerning reader who will judge the work on the agenda set out by the author (clearly done in this work) will find this a fascinating and well laid out \\"snapshot\\" look of the period which McGrath lays out as rising (French Revolution) of golden atheism period to its decline (following of Berlin Wall and Communism).t out by the author (clearly done in this work) will find this a fascinating and well laid out \\"snapshot\\" look of the period which McGrath lays out as rising (French Revolution) of golden atheism period to its decline (following of Berlin Wall and Communism).	2004-09-28

It does take effort and devoted time to do these correctly, especially for those who have not attempted such before.  But as others profess, the results are worth it!  One that particularly grabbed my tastebud attention was Escargot Forestiere made with snails, ham, mushrooms, with flavorful Merlot Veal stock. This turned out absolutely unbelievable, reminding me somewhat of Esgargot Under Pastry, which is one of my favorites.  Being the exploring non-traditionalist that I am when first attempting something, I turned to an exotic dessert tamale also: Arborio Rice-Dried Fruit Pudding Tamales with Rum Cream.  It was rich and outstanding, the perfect finale dish for any who enjoy Rice Pudding.<br /><br />This is truly a great resource to play with and explore different flavor combos, what cooking is about and when it becomes fun. This cookbook is one of those that inspires going off it one's own culinary directions, having seen what these three Tamale Masters do.<br /><br />There is great source section and even dinner plate source info if desired.<br /><br />This is great one-dish specialty cookbook from three great chefs!  Already familiar with the likes of Miller and Pyles, neat to learn from Sedler, who has some of my favorites from this.  Great photos and written text.	2004-09-23

What is so useful is finding out about Luther's use of reason as magesterial vs. ministerial.<br /><br />Being educated and catechized in the medieval theology Luther knew the center as Reason around philosophy, which still dominates RC theology (see Ratzinger's \\"Principles of Catholic Theology).<br /><br />Many misinterpret and thus misuse and abuse Luther and his theological offspring by taking him out of context concerning Reason and Christianity.

Being the Bible person that I am, couldn't resist adapting the author's fight to Joshua and Jerico, and the walls came tumbling down in both.<br /><br />Wells to this reviewer brings down the walls of \\"supposed textbook evidence\\" for evolution.  What has for too long been touted and flounted as \\"fact\\" and \\"science\\" has been exposed by others for many years, but here gathered, refined in some cases and presented so that the average reader can hear the two sides of evidence and make a decision.<br /><br />This reviewer in an introductory cultural anthropology class in college had one complete textbook which said (as Wells quotes) the fervent evolutionists saying: Science is a fact, and if you don't believe that than you are an idiot.<br /><br />Sounds parallel to liberal response and strategy in most every realm this days of sharp polarity: politics, theology especially.<br /><br />When the stakes are high in these three areas: (power and its retention can make for desparate and even deceptive actions) Wells shows that the public especially at formative age in high school, college and even graduate school has been continually fed \\"standardized misinformation\\" about the evidence available to show the evolution is a better model for origin of life debates than creation or Intelligent Design, et al.<br /><br />I am indebted to Nancy Pearcy in her amazing work: \\"Total Truth: Liberating Christianity From Its Cultural Captivity\\" for shocking me with her discovery of these honest scientists such as Wells who have scientifically and systematically took apart the Evolutionist faulty, shoddy and even in some cases deliberately falsified evidence.<br /><br />This is shocking for our children.  Our society should take notice and correct this tragedy post haste.<br /><br />However, we mustn't make the pendulum mistake of diminishing our respect and desire for good science, whether of the Christian worldview or materialist.  God bless honest and forthright scientists, but God forbid the continued, liberal cultural support of this evolutionary false evidence that cannot stand the test of time or scientific investigation as Wells does so wonderfully in this book.<br /><br />A must read for our times.

This book impressed not only because of the main argument, that Christians have allowed the church to be regulated by a two-story worldview which places them in the tenuous upper story relegated to values and fairie tales, while the lower story is controlled by naturalism with facts and evidence.  This many of us have known for sometime, especially due to our acquaintance with the writings of Francis Schaeffer, whom the author is indebted to as well.<br /><br />What is totally impressive is how she ties this with so much other good and profitable thinking.  The emphasis on worldview and Christianity as the most viable and accurate to describe and explain the evidence is outstanding, as well as her honesty in placing apologetics in its proper place, as a usuable and valuable aid with some people, but not the basis of faith nor the tool the Lord uses to convert any unbeliever.  At best it is intellectual slum clearance so that the precious Gospel can do its saving work.  I am especially grateful for the updates that this work provided to this reviewer on the subject of origins, stimulating the reader to further investigation into the new arguments about origins which rightly now center on philosophy of science and not so much the scientific evidence and chance of the past.<br /><br />In describing the dualism into secular and spiritual, she provides an important philosophical tool.  Her well formed argument for the Christian worldview permeating all of a believer's world is admirable.<br /><br />One wishes she would have provided more Scriptural evidence rather than philosophical bent, which could lead some (e.g. Roman Catholics) who spend all their efforts on philosophy (see Ratzinger's interesting tome on this, \\"Principles of Catholic Theology\\").  Theology although interacting with philosophy at many points, can not be controlled nor dominated nor influenced by philosophy.  Countering the history of philosophy can take the Christian down paths which cause one to think not theologically correct but philosophically.  Dangerous, although it is a useful apologetic area.  See several interesting books on this, especially J.W. Montgomery's \\"Tractitus Logic0-Theologicus.\\"<br /><br />There is much in this to chew on.  This reviewer had many statements that troubled him, so there will be much to ponder and sort out in comparision with the Holy Scriptures.<br /><br />Wonderful work to read, discuss, share and contemplate.e to think not theologically correct but philosophically.

Background had this as major contributor, however, Chemnitz and gang resolved that sermon format was not the best, so rewritten.<br /><br />What is attractive and solid about these six sermons on controverted doctrine is his reference to Luther's Small Catechism for the answer to finding out how to discern equally sounding controverted positions.  Before someone objects to Catechism being over Scripture, one must realize what Catecism is: Asks question, then answers from Scripture.  This is solid and enlighenting and pertinent to today's controverted issues.	2004-09-10

There seems to be little real discussion based on the culture of America neutering the gospel.  Oh, the authors would argue there is much about environment and politics and modernism and so on.  But, this is where these two truly \\"miss the point.\\"  The gospel is above and beyond culture, and these two are reacting from purely cultural points of view, their culturally conditioned opinions.  They and especially Compolo, react from subjective opinion and seek to minimize objective Scripture.<br /><br />While astounded and delighted in several of their reactions to what's happening in broad, popular Christian circles these days: Bible has less to say about accepting Christ as Personal Savior, the sinner's prayer, and altar call; also, that worship is individual centered rather than God centered... they miss much.  Their idea of worship is unbiblical, centered on God as passive observer of humans praising, forsaking the true nature of God gifting and blessing the people sacramentally and incarnationally to be His people to the world!<br /><br />I enjoyed the stress on being God's people to the world on environment, etc., but the stress is way too great on these areas and not enough on why we do them --- to gain a hearing for the Gospel!  They miss the point here completely it appears.<br /><br />They come across as anti-seminary, and in some cases for good reasons.  However, their opinions on female ordination never once addresses the real Scriptural point: order of creation.  They further miss the point on the image of God, the righteousness that permeated the original relationship, stressing too much the dominion over creation.  Compolo can't get off the kick either of being overly for created animals, whales, chimpanzees, etc.  Man certainly is the apple of God's eye, not these of his creations, although we are to be stewards of them, but not at the sake of humans.<br /><br />There overall seems to be an unbibical stress on innovation in theology and application.  This is so seductive and tempting.  A corrective to much of this is the outstanding book by Nancy Pearcy \\"Total Truth: Liberating Christianity from It's Cultural Captivity.\\"et off the kick either of being overly for created animals, whales, chimpanzees, etc.  Man certainly is the apple of God's eye, not these of his creations, although we are to be stewards of them, but not at the sake of humans. <br /> <br />There overall seems to be an unbibical stress on innovation in theology and application.

Oden never seeks to provide evidence that there has not been uniform applicability of the teaching of justification by grace through faith, nor that he would limit such evidence to primarily the early fathers, but would attempt to show that the Reformation teachers understanding of this was the same as the early church writers.  In this his attempt is successful.  He provides much evidence from varying confessional statements to show these veins of agreement across the ages.<br /><br />This certainly then should be of utmost concern to the church in ecumenical discussions, that this was their historically from the beginning, now where did it go offtrack?  Oden's desire for ecumenical consensus is admirable and certainly provides at least one target area for such serious discussions.  His challenge for others to refute this evidence is valid.  Since this doctrine is pivotal to all the rest, it surely must be a considered firm, starting point.<br /><br />The writing style is tight and organized and the thought progression of his thesis is well laid out and easy to follow.  His paraphrasing of fathers and confessional statements alike is masterful.  The thoughtful reader will find many paths to followup, e.g. my desire to discover more on the mysterious Ambriosiaster.<br /><br />Looking forward to his next effort in this series on Good Works.	2004-07-20

His writing as though the early church fathers were of this same mind is a matter that I honestly am not knowledgeable on, but will investigate.  Suggest other readers understand a common theological problem with quoting the early church fathers, that of they wrote so much that most all sides of an issue find support in them.  It is confusing.<br />Excellent gem of work that shows abortion is not a modern problem nor is the church's countercultural witness against it either.  Valuable resource to the church.	2004-07-14

Christ says it is about forgiveness of sins, not putting more people in the worship space. In Biblical language, gospel is what God does for sinners, forgives them their sins, which continues until they are taken to be with Him for eternity, not just at conversion.<br />The opposite is the law, what we must do or not do for God.  This is what this book is about, it puts people back under the law.  It centers on rewards earned in this life by applying the gifts God gives for the purpose of growing His church.  And this doesn't center around the relationship of justification to sanctification at all!  Witness this short quote from this book:  &quot;One day you will stand before God, and he will do an audit of your life, a final exam, before you enter eternity. ... He will ask two questions: What did you do with my Son, Jesus Christ?... Second, what did you do with what I gave you?&quot;  Then he proceeds on this premise for over 300 pages that it is what we do for God, not what God has done, is doing and will continue to do for us in Christ!<br />This thus centers the non-discerning Christian into the law, and not the gospel.  What is so dangerous about this book is that it comes close at times to the truth, that not one of us can please God with our lives and our doings, but only faith in what Jesus does for us (forgives our sins) counts for eternity.<br />By using the stick of the law and rewards in heaven as the carrot, Warren thus seeks to turn faith from the obedience that Christ achieved for every sinner to faith in that sinner's obedience to work for Christ.  Warren muddles up law and gospel, justification and sanctification in unbiblical ways that this book has to be totally overhauled before it should be used as any guide to Christian living. This is dangerous best seller.<br />Much more would I refer Christians to excellent book's on true, Biblical Christian living, e.g. Hal Senkbeil's &quot;Dying To Live: The Power of Forgiveness&quot; or Gene Veith's &quot;The Spirituality of the Cross&quot; or Daniel Preus' &quot;Why I Am A Lutheran.&quot;. Hal Senkbeil's &quot;Dying To Live: The Power of Forgiveness&quot; or Gene Veith's &quot;The Spirituality of the Cross&quot; or Daniel Preus' &quot;Why I Am A Lutheran.&quot;	2004-07-07

Preus clearly and concisely explains why Lutheran beliefs are true and Biblical, since they focus on nothing but Jesus at the center, and Him crucified for sins.<br />This for sure insults some Christians who falsely believe that their confession and practice of the faith has Jesus equally at the center.  But if they would openly check this out and compare with what Preus professes from the Bible and the church's hymnody, it is anything but Jesus crucified for sins at the heart and center.<br />He provides excellent illustrations both from his life and pastoral experience as well as from the Bible.  Especially his use of three mountains sprinkled throughout provides the Biblical life-saving thread, i.e. Mount Sinai, Mount Calvary and Mount Zion. This clarifies the essential differences between theology of glory versus the theology of the cross.<br />Written for the layperson, this is very well done and can be read easily by most and if studied in conjunction with the Bible correctly understood via law and gospel, will significant bless all readers.<br />You owe it to yourself and to Christ to read this book.  Highly, highly recommended.	2004-07-07

Therefore, I immediately started jotting down next to Warren's a solid translation, e.g. NASB, and found considerable doubt being shed on Warren's whole premises for &quot;the purpose driven church&quot; as he postulates it.<br />The church is not purpose driven to recruit more people for the pews, it is for the purpose of saving souls, of justification.  This Warren, many would argue, is exactly what he writes about, but the truth be known, it is anything but this.  Forgiveness of sins through faith in Christ's gospel must be at the core and center, and it must have prominence and dominance over everything else.  Warren permits and promotes other needs to circumvent and override this.<br />Then as the kicker, he even relates that copying what Saddleback has done is not to be followed, that it won't work in every other setting.  What is going on here?  Where is the assurance that if we preach and teach the truth of God's Word purely that He will bless?  This is shame and shamble of this whole movement to consumerism and leadership by sayings and principles that are not Biblical.  Check them out in a good English translation, such as New American Standard.  Better yet, find yourself a pastor who can work in the original languages (Hebrew and Greek) and he'll tell you that NASB is head and shoulders superior to the ones Warren puts all his case upon.<br />The church of Jesus Christ needs only turn to its Lord and continue to faithfully proclaim His desire:  that repentance for forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in His name to all the peoples (Luke 24:47).  That and only that message clearly and purely proclaimed in all the church will and can grow the church and God's kingdom.	2004-07-06

These are words about Venturi, who it seems most of his life was always dualing with himself against others to show them what he was made of: toughness and talent that could and would succeed in winning.<br />He suffered through much: hand injuries, marriage trauma, etc.  But the biggest hurdles were those letdowns, those meltdowns which occur in sports when one is so close to seizing the brass ring, only to have it slip out of grasp.  As Venturi would describe, someone else always played phenonemenal to do just that.  He would be a previous generation's Greg Norman.<br />Anyone who was so close and fondly associated with the likes of Nelson, Sarazen and Hogan, now this is a special person.  Or for Vince Lombardi to admire the look in an competitor's eyes, this is a special golfer.  One who endured severe heat and win his country's national golf championship in the doing, this is a special golfer.<br />This carried over in his broadcasting.  Concise, poignant, to the point.  Let the golf describe most of the action.  I like millions admired and respected his great gifts for commenting, but never really knew about the stammering.  Maybe the greatest hurdle of all.  What courage he showed and can encourage all who have such to do the same.  A man of principle.<br />Somehow as good as this read was with all the fascinating stories and incidents, I thought it was slightly &quot;I oriented&quot; too much.  Thus, four not five.	2004-07-06

It ends up five because I truly want to believe in the trend evidence and hopeful future which this book purports.<br />Its basic statement is that the identity of America is shifting away from its historic identity and this shifting is being led not by the majority public, but by a small minority elite.<br />This is truly valid.<br />What I waver on believing is his statistical and qualititative analysis that things on shifting back towards the historic identity.<br />The book is well structured into four parts: identity issues, historic American identity, challenges to this historic identity, and the possibilities of renewal of this identity.<br />This made the book and its argumentation easy to follow.<br />I concur that immigration is out of control, and needs to be rectified.  Here again government bureaucracy between competing layers of government bureaucrats makes even the best of legislation tough to police and implement consistently and effectively.  His data about the ampersands and diasporas was truly enlightening in this regard.<br />What should fascinate many readers of this fine work is that this same challenge to American identity carries over remarkable the same into other cultural areas, especially religion.<br />Presents the problems and possible scenarios very well.

These two TV commentators have predicted several of conflicts with Web of Terror accurately and so this work on Endgame strategy is worth contemplation.<br />They correctly purport continuing to take the offensive to them and any of their supporting cast of countries or allies that would aid and protect the ring of terrorist activities against our country.<br />Correctly they deduce that the terrorists in the 80's and 90's saw our government as unwilling to challenge their attacks on American interests and even on our own soil with the First Twin Towers and the other overseas attacks, so they decided to step it up with 9/11.<br />New government's continuing offensive threat to them both here and more importantly on foreign soil where they seek to operate out of is detailed here by these two excellent military strategists.<br />I believe their frank and brunt summation that the Web of Terror does not want this offensive to continue is correct and should in itself be an enormous warning sign to Americans.  But we have not only enemies outside but within as well, who seem to shy away from seeing this enemy and turn their crosshairs on what should be friendly targets.<br />Especially impressed by their astute insight that the cultural image that much of our own elite media and academia projects to overseas is not what general American public is about or condones, but this only fuels Radical militants who are fueled by such immorals.<br />This is fine work on dealing with terrorism which certainly has already gained enormous strides against terrorists, but needs to find more unity.  This fine book should help aid more to realize taking the war to them is best strategy.	2004-06-01

The reason:  as one gets to know the author and her intent with the writing, one senses a person truly one would enjoy sitting and conversing with.  And this is exactly what Tucker has done with those who have walked away from the faith.  More with stories and not with Scripture, but meaningful and useful nonetheless.<br />She is honest and skilled in holding the reader's attention.  Whether one agrees with all of her assesment or not, there is easily much to be gained from reading this familiarization with those who struggle to believe.  That is salient point of this work:  they truly do struggle to believe. Sometimes with differing results, but struggle they do. Tucker also provides helps on what the church can do to assist.	2004-05-28

God used this particualarly later on with his magnificent evidence for the two natures of Christ.<br />Preus has devoted much of his life to translating Chemnitz from Latin, and has left a wonderful heritage.  Here, though, he departs from translation and gives us a theological biography that is rich in its scope and wordsmithing.  If anyone today knows Chemnitz, it is Preus.<br />Chemnitz was all about sources, not about cutting down personalities in debate.  The Formula of Concord was the outcome primarily due to his work of resolving theological tension.  Oh, the Lutherans today would use this as our model.<br />Worth finding before it goes out of print, or finding a copy somewhere for your reading and library.	2004-05-26

Sure, and so can it's cookbook.  This is outstanding selection of interesting ingredients, techniques and creativity, all around that cuisine we call &quot;soup.&quot;<br />What is especially useful about this cookbook's structure is the page heading describing not only the main ingredient, i.e. veggie, beef, etc., but also its fat rating, and dairy free, etc. warning, as well as &quot;spicy&quot; warnings.  Many times there is also listed &quot;Variations&quot; recommendations, which gets one thinking about possible modifications and/or new recipe creations of one's own.<br />This is fun soup cooking and great eating!  Try the likes of some of my favorites: &quot;Winter Borscht With Beef Short Ribs&quot;; &quot;Cauliflower Vichyssoise&quot;; &quot;Valencian-Style Paella&quot; (with saffron and lobster and shrimp and baby artichokes); &quot;Yucatan Chicken-Lime&quot;  (my absolute favorite which I also spice up with some broken tortilla chips which one can buy flavored these days); and Pot Pie Soups, chicken, lobster,mushroom.<br />The book is also fun due to great and comical B&amp;W photos and excellent additions such as Periodic Table of Soups and Soup Personals, e.g. &quot;Successful, long-stemmed Wild Mushroom seeks family of Barley, 2-3, 1 cm, for Eastern European soup romance and possibly more.

Then there's brats and burgers and every fixin that goes so well with these.<br />They're all here. This is truly a source for them all.  One doesn't have to travel all over to discover them, just pick and choose on a BBQ journey around the country cooking through this one.  Or if you desire to visit a site or region, this even provides the places and addresses to find personally.<br />I like to try different stuff that I've never had before, so for me thus far I've tried: &quot;Alabam BBQ Chickens with White BBQ Sauce.&quot;  Who has ever heard of WhiteBBQ?  But this is soo good!  The horseradish, vinegar sauce is a hit, a triple at least!  Also into the ribs, so a marinated in apple cider, with a &quot;Magic Dust&quot; rub really caught my eye and mouth, and you've just got to try the &quot;Apple City Championship Ribs&quot;.  And finally, a Tuna &quot;London Broil&quot; with Wasabi Cream Sauce.  This is fantastic dish with a dry rub, and the contrasty taste of seared tuna with cream sauce is rich and superb, even for squeamish sushi avoiders.  And what BBQ is there without dessert, say &quot;Smoked Alaska.&quot;  This is a treat, not as hard as one would think.<br />This is such a thorough book it will take many years of grilling to explore all its varieties and offerings, but many of us will and should!

Its restaurants exude this same characteristic, and as the Foreword proclaims, the brand is about: taste, elegance and flair.  These three describe this recipe collection perfectly.<br /><br />Do not skip the delight of reading the Foreword and Introduction which  place these recipes in the rich history of Mr. Marcus starting and coaxing on the branches restaurant's to their current rich status.  Here the branches provide classic and new recipes from ten categories: Soups, Starter Salads, Small Plates, Sandwiches, Salad Entrees, Main Courses, Sides and Condiments, Desserts, Drinks, and Basics.<br /><br />My actual sampling over time at their in-store restaurants has been concentrated on soups, salads and small plates.  This has been mainstay of their biz, so it is exciting to see the main courses added.  I can tell you firsthand that the likes of the Steak Soup with Tobasco Onions and the Duke of Windsor or Rainbow Trout Sandwiches are just outstanding, as are the salads like the Tuna Pecan Salad.<br /><br />Again the class they exude in taste, elegance and flair is trademark in each recipe offering.  They have been perfected and thus here we receive classics like the Chocolate Chip Cookie, which contrary to all rumors is never sold or refused to be given out.<br /><br />This is a marvelous, well rounded collection of various world cusines from southwestern to Middle Eastern to French to Asian, with all the trimming and condiments included.  The Boursin laced Mashed Potatoes are incredible and the Apple-Red Onion Compote is a phenomenal companion to all kinds of dishes, e.g. chicken, game birds and roasts.  Try their tip of using bacon fat rather than olive oil and it will render even superior taste.<br /><br />This is rich, class cookbook due to unique items, spectacular layout and rich color photos and historic text.  Truly a keeper and gift giving item superb worthy of the name Neiman Marcus.	2004-04-25

It is very similar to Ming Tsai's new book: &quot;Simply Ming&quot; in that they both provide a new technique, e.g. how to make a marinade, a vinagerette, a sauce, souffle, braising, etc., then provide recipes which use and build and modify this basic.<br />While Ming is into East-West fusion, here Ash is into inspiring even the one who feels they are not very good in the kitchen to delve into the fun world of great cuisine.  Ash is a proficient educator who truly believes in dialogue as a prominent learning tool.  Here he aptly anticipates questions and answers them.<br />His selection of topics is contemporary and popular, as evidenced by his starting point: salsas.  This is topped off by a wonderful &quot;Fresh Cranberry and Tangerine Salsa.&quot;  I really appreciate that each topic provides &quot;VARIATIONS&quot;, which stimulate each of us to consider taking off in varying directions depending on our taste likes and ingredient leanings.<br />Try some of these, which are not difficult once you've began mastering the technique: &quot;Roasted Eggplant Salad with Charred Tomato Vinaigrette;&quot; &quot;Cold Cream of Red Bell Pepper Soup from the juicer&quot;; &quot;Couscous Risotto with Oven-Dried Mushrooms and Tomatoes and Pecorino Cheese&quot;; &quot;Herb and Pistachio-Stuffed Veal Pot Roast&quot;; &quot;Twice-Baked Goat Cheese Souffles with Watercress and Oven-Dried Tomatoes&quot;; &quot;Poached Chicken Breast Salad with Curry Buttermilk, Apples, and Pecans&quot;;<br />There is also a section on Tofu (not one of my favorites) and Simple, Sophisticated Desserts.

He knew the golf swing for himself, and demonstrated that.<br />Here an amazing sharing of his involvement with this man, a young man who shags balls and watches, and shags and watches and interacts for the rest of their lives together.<br />The simpleness, yet dramaticness of this relationship is revealed in brevity in terms of words and pages, but pondering what goes on in these 160 pages is intense and profitable for golfers.<br />For those outside golf, Hogan must come off as insolent and insensitive.  Yet, he is ultimate golfer.  The Swing Secret is revealed, and it is amazing, right knee and left wrist.  Am going to find out &quot;in the dirt myself.&quot;<br />The stories here are priceless and will continue the great mystique and rightful place of the Hawk.  Favorites include the response to the German pro watching him during Kostis GD story, &quot;You're a golf pro.  You should know the answer.&quot;<br />The second was the ad shoot.  Hogan readies himself for filming hitting three consecutive terrible swings.  Then on cue, perfect contact and swing.<br />People want the easy way out.  To hurdle over the time and expenditure of effort and toil and yes, dirt.  Hogan was not of this mold.  Golfers appreciate this.

Books	5	8	14	N	Y	The Good and Bad of Missions	Everyone is in to this question:  What has gone wrong with Christianity?<br />For the bad of the book:  Certainly the world has changed.  When hasn't it?  To argue that the major premise is to come out of a modernity paradigm for missions to a post-modern one that is still emerging is inappropriate in my mind.  This is all the rage in missiology today, paradigm shift and meeting the changes of culture.  When will we realize that Christianity spans across cultures and paradigms and what we are about are cultural pilgrims, strangers, vagabonds who are on our way to the City of God, thus in the world but not of it.  The Bible leads us to believe that as this journey nears its end (either for each generation or for all) the world moves further away from truth and into greater rebellion against God.  The answer here which is different is provided wonderfully by Willimon and Hauerwas \\"Resident Aliens.\\"  Further, to suggest that conversion must always be balanced by social transformation betrays what Jesus and the apostles were about:  let it alone.  This is confusion of kingdom of God and kingdom of secular authorities that God places and disposes of for His own purposes and use.<br />For the good:  I appreciate their rejection of pragmatic utilization of managerial techniques and programming and sloganeering as main missions thrust to save the billions who are going to hell and we must do it now!  attitude.  Their strong conviction and suggestion that we return to engagement one person at a time with the gospel to include them as disciples in community with Bride of Christ is to be praised.<br />All in all, mediocre book which doesn't rightly address the Biblical concepts of missions, but spends much too much time engaged with models and concepts outside Scripture, which is modern demise of missions.  The power of God to save is the pure Gospel preached and taught and rightly distributed in the Sacraments as Christ mandated them.  When will we believe and trust in what Christ has graciously given us, the mysteries of God to save?  This is not even stressed at all here to the detriment of all who follow the authors' proposals.at Christ has graciously given us, the mysteries of God to save?

If there certainly is one word to describe this phase of church history, it is ecumenism.  The Biblical admonition to be one church is upon us, as it should.  What is not yet in this movement is the process, the structure to achieve this.  The efforts today which stretch over eight decades at least, have attempted all kinds of process without the success.  Everyone seems frustrated, that is the outcome.<br />Here, Richard Bucher puts forward his doctoral thesis (under the recognized Luther scholar Carter Lindberg) of Luther's stance on how to determine necessary doctrines for unity.<br />To say that Luther was against unity would be a totally uninformed opinion without historical substance of Luther's beliefs.  Here Bucher aptly takes one through the development of Luther's ecumenical hermeneutic, one piece at a time.  Only those teachings based on the right Scripture rightly interpreted and those that are necessary for salvation, i.e. tied to the gospel of justification, can be declared to be absolute and necessary doctrines.<br />Three examples of Luther actually doing ecumenism at its Biblical basis are provided:  Dialouge with the descendants of Hus (the Unitas Fratrum), the Marburg Colloquy, and the Schmalkald Articles.  These shown specifically and in the context of differing confessions, how Luther utilized his hermenutic to determine just what must be agreed upon in order to achieve oneness in pulpit and altar fellowship.<br />The author then applies this to modern day ecumenism, recommending this approach of Luther to today, rather than the processes of reconciled diversity, accomodation and consensus, which do not achieve the unity God mandates.<br />While one wishes that the author would have expanded his application a bit more to the contemporary scene, this is such a vital and well done addition to the ecumenical environment that surrounds us that many will richly benefit from its perusual and implementation.	2004-04-13

Seems that many of greatest had touch of both believing and not at times, and who doesn't.  Just shocked, as author predicted most would, as the inclusion of Wagner. Only heard that he was God opposed conductor, so to hear of spiritual side for Christ was startling and fascinating.<br />The intro to each composer is well done, and suggetions for music listening for each also make this truly pleasure.  Numerous notes allow all that wish to delve further a ready bibliography to begin.<br />Especially liked Hadyn's response to certain church types who thought his music too ebullient: Since God has given me a cheerful heart, He will forgive me for serving him cheerfully.\\"<br />Also, the humbleness and piety of Dvorak was refreshing.<br />Well written, read with relish. One to reread.	2004-04-03

There are plenty, especially the spirit of the place, which one quickly realizes is the heart and soul.<br />Bookcased by Air Jordan's entry and retire, Katz in good prose that flows well style relates how a middle-distance runner and his coach and eventually some Japanese shoes turned into the giant Swoosh Just Do It corporate wonder.  For those of us from this time in our history, one distinctly remembers the embodiment of that spirit, Prefontaine.<br />You see the dominant style of the venture comes from the playing fields, and many customers for it shoes can feel it, and so they buy it.  Others are caught up in its powerful draft, not understanding at all the athletic side.  Knight does, and he and his company relished it and grew it.  Amazing.  I remember setting right next to a mother and her teenage son, both of us guys trying on cross-training shoes.  Me, non-Nike, and this young kid insisted he would only wear Air Jordan.  The salesman said they didn't have any in that style in his small foot size, the smallest size 2-3 sizes too big.  The salesman said it would be harmful to his feet to wear them, but the kid was incensed to have them on.  And mom gave in.  Stunned, I was.  Then to hear about what kids would do to have these shoes.<br />I relate to all of this as one who never really cared personally for those who stood for the Swoosh ala McEnroe, but respected very much their talent and drive.  That's my response to their history and this fascinating chronicle of it:  I don't really care personally for what they were about, but have great respect for their drive and talent.  You have to give it to them.<br />They ran the great race, up those trudging hills, and through those barriers that all distance runners have to run through.

After writing excellent, provocative works such as two of my favorites: Becoming a Chef and Culinary Artistry, combine again to research and bring together this impressive volume sketching out the emerging New American Chef.  Words like fusion and New World and other concepts seemed to fall short of what they were trying to get at, so this concept: New American Chef showcases ten world cuisines which bring there own philosophies and emphases and ingredients and techniques to these United States to combine with our burgeoning wealth of culinary talent to produce this wonderful new cuisine which this book showcases.<br />I can remember becoming first interested in high school when taking a date out on that impressive prom meal when gourmet was specific dishes, e.g. Steak Diane, etc.  But now, there is such a wide variety of everything, with so many more choices of not only dishes, but cuisine specialty houses and more.  This book gets to that.  The mixture of cultures and global reach has brought us to this melting pot concept of gourmet. Here there are ten major world cuisines: Chineese, French, Mexican, Indian, Spanish, Moroccan, Italian, Thai, Japanese, Vietnamese.  Each of these is represented by its approach, similarities and specialties, then a representative recipe sampling.<br />While there is ample opportunity here to learn more about cuisines I'm already into: French, Moroccan, Italian, Mexican, Chineese, Japanese; there is certainly opportunity here to explore some new cuisine such as Thai, Indian, etc. although I'm not all that enthralled with them in my experience so far.<br />And just that is the beauty here, one doesn't have to be excited about all ten, or the majority of them. There is so much here to be learned and experimented with.  The standards of each are explemfied in all: balance, aroma, harmony, seasonality, etc.<br />Recipes that caught my attention to make include:  Deep-Fried Fillet of Trout(Masu no Agemono); Shrimp in \\"Crazy Water\\" (Gamberoni al'Acqua Pazza); Barcelona-Style Flounder with Raisins, Nuts, Lemon Butter and Anise; Cherry Gratin (Gratin aux Cerises); Maine Lobster Tail on Salsify with Pinot Noir Sauce, Vanilla Oil, and Crispy Leeks; Rock Candy-Ginger Short Ribs; Chile-Orange Cold Noodles; Braised Lamb Shanks with Masala Raan;Guajillo-Spiked Pork-and-Potato Tacos (Tacos de Puerco y Papas al Guajillo; Salmon Panang (Grilled Salmon in a Creamy Red Curry Sauce); Quail Bisteeya;Chicken Tajine with Prunes; Couscous Mango Mousse.<br />Many of the contributors are already great culinary friends and inspirations to millions: Batali, Bayless, Boulud, Feniger, Vongerichten, Wolfert to name a few.  I'm sure many of the others will go on to such fame and become regular fixtures in this growing, wonderful world of cuisine.<br />With each cuisine there is ample background text as well as cookbook and other reference suggestions.  No color photos, just the author's usual nice contrasty B&W but with unbelievably good text for chefs both pro and amateur.<br />This is definitely one to grow and have fun with.

This work is truly a contribution to the furtherance of the history and interest in this instrument, which has charmed many, but yet remains not as popular as most other winds, likely for its difficulty in mastering.<br />The book is divided into almost two sections.  The first 124 pages deal with the pre-history of the instrument's roots up until the modern era beginning in 1828.  After a fascinating discussion of just where the oboe started, the authors surmise that since many wind instruments all claim the aulos and tibia are archetypes, thus doubtful that this was truly ancestor.  However, in the Arabic cultures the early shawnlike &quot;zurna&quot; are definitely related, then giving way to the popular hautboys, which gave way to their widespread use in baroque music.<br />This especially takes off in the era of the seventeenth century with various types and names and styles, regionally located according to materials and composers and performers and craftsmen and trade of ideas/commerce.  Then in 1680 outbreaks the French hautboy, which begins to dominate and leads in turn to the now standardized Conservatooire oboe during the Industrial Age.<br />There is much to be gained from this history tracing, including the match between hautboy maker/composer/musician.  Standing out especially and his ties to the modern oboe is Treibert and his Systeme 6 which then was disseminated throughout the world by Gillet's students, especially here in North America.  When former Treibert foreman Francois Loree started his own oboe shop enhanced by Gillet's endorsement, this standardized oboe started to dominate, evolving to the now commonplace material of grenadilla.<br />Along the way the compositions and musicians are featured.  Then beginning in chapter 8 which for me is the highlight of the book, the technical capabilities are stretched since WWII.  Here is highlighted the giants of the oboe compositions and their performers.  Also so poignant is their technical discussion of embouchure, air stream problems, reeds, and &quot;vibrato or not.&quot;<br />The last chapter closes with the two topic discussion of avant-garde techniques and compositions highlighting such as multiphonics, microtonoality, pitch slides, etc., and secondly, return to period instruments of the baroque era especially.<br />Included are fine detailed notes, a significant bibliography, a compiled discography which is meant to be only representative of the book's discussion, and an adequate index.<br />This is a fine scholarly work which will certainly disappoint if any reader seeks a beginning intro to the instrument, i.e. should I play oboe, how to start, etc.  This is more academic as to the instrument's history, current status, etc.  All oboe enthusiasts will continually turn to this fine, thorough and well researched and written resource.compositions and their performers.

He slices the body politic open to expose the spreading cancer of judicial activism.  Exemplified by increasing international law and judicial review gone awry, the results are drifting further away from our US Constitutional moorings. If the constitution has no primal meaning or intent, on what firm basis do we have any confidence in any legal ruling?  If we cannot argue over \\"intent of meaning\\" than we are left to whatever controlling body is on the bench. The culprits provide no explanation, other than victory.  In fact, Bork quotes the recent ABA president: \\"An attack on activist judges is an attack on our Constitution.\\"  Go figure!<br />In convincing and lucid writing, Bork concludes: \\"When it becomes apparent, as it has over and over again, that the courts are not expressing the meaning of those documents (constitutions and approved treaties) but merely using the documents as launching pads for the reforms they prefer, the claim of constitutionality is revealed as fraudulent.\\"<br />What does the liberal left respond with?  Name calling!  See Ann Coulter's erudite research into this \\"Slander:Liberal Lies About The American Right.\\"<br />Providing legal case history to support his contentions as he proceeds through international law, US Supreme Court, and Canada and Israel, Bork serves up more than adequate fear which \\"should\\" spread fear and terror in all American citizenry.<br />If only that would happen.  That likely as Bork surmises would be the only way now to reverse what the Court intelligentsia has done damage to our system.  Vote out all the New Class from politics, academia, and slowly bring back Constitutional judges so that the reversal of such judicial creativity to soothe their cultural dreams.<br />This is Bork's best work to date.  He has provided us with clear treatment of landmark judicial activism.  No more poignant than this dissent opinion by Justice Blackmun: \\"not because they contribute, in some direct and material way, to the general public welfare, but because they form so central a part of an individual's life. The concept of privacy embodies the 'moral fact that a person belongs to himself and not others nor to society as a whole.\\"  Bork replies: \\"No greater endoresement of radical individual autonomy or of sentiment more disintegrative of society has every before been articulated in a constitutional opinion.\\"<br />Toss out the rule of law!  Toss in the rule of judges.  Lord have mercy on the 'ole USA.

Veith has experience which is pertinent, but more than that, he has read and thought much about the topic.  The fruit herewith for us to digest is nourishing and confrontational.  He honorably does not just protest without provision of action.  And all of this in a wonderful prose and style which is truly a joy to read.<br />This is a clarion call for the church not to withdraw from engagement with a culture gone awry, but to bring with us minds for Christ into all disciplines.  Because God is of creation and humanity, He provides the Christian with learning and contributions to cultural and academic pursuits.  Veith argues persuasively using Daniel at the University of Babylon as the Biblical standard for doing just that.<br />For students/learners of all ages!<br />This wonderful resource for the church should be utilized widely as to how the love of God in Christ Jesus for each Christian should be carried out to to the world we live in.

They, the left, will go to any means, even breaking of the law to rid the country of Christianity.  While accepting and promoting in many settings other forms of religion, Christianity is so offensive to this societal segment (academia, NEA, media, et al) that they constantly lash out with all means at their disposal.<br />Trying to hide under the false guise of Constitutional protection which is not there, they show they are inconsistent, close-minded, and morally defunct.  See the valuable treastise on this: A Nation Dedicated to Religious Liberty by Arlin M. Adams and Charles J. Emmerich.<br />Limbaugh provides case after case after case to show this.  Also, as this reviewer has done to his benefit, go on one of the websites of the legal action groups policing this stuff, e.g. FIRE and monitor the current scene.<br />One can easily surmise that this massive display of evidence is only the tip of the coming iceberg for Christians in a country touted on its very foundations for freedom of religion.<br />As one other reviewer has put it so well, Christians have been told we will suffer for the precious name of Christ that we bear.

McIntosh attempts what is sorely needed by some of us in Christ's vineyard in order to get on the Church Growth bandwagon, biblical support.<br />In much of what is given from the pages of Scripture, McIntosh succeeds, even providing what one doesn't read or hear from CG advocates, temporing of allowing unbiblical, non-God pleasing elements into the church.  However, the title in this reviewer's opinion clouds the issue at the very least, and possibly even defeats his warnings, with the subtite of: &quot;How You Can Work with God to Build A Faithful Church.&quot;  What troubles me is this addition of &quot;you&quot; to God in order to build.  Just as on that first Palm Sunday Jesus said that even the rocks will cry out their Hosannas to the Lord if we humans don't.  What is being challenged in all of this is the vital question:  what does it take to save someone?  Does the precious gospel purely preached and the Sacraments rightly administered according to the Lord's mandate need any additon or capabilities or cooperation of man?<br />This reviewer says the Scriptures clearly teach No!  McIntosh honestly and sincerely believes Yes!  Let the reader judge.<br />The book is a vital step in clarifying just what CG sees in the Bible as the basis for their methodology, so in this I commend and thank this articulate Christian writer for this effort.  May the dialogue continue based on the Word alone.	2004-02-27

First there is the language and jargon associated with any field.  Second there is the task of attempting to construct a workable historical chronology that will aid in understanding the gamut of the field.  Third combining all of this with the modern classical state.<br />Thinking this book might aid has been a disappointment.  It is overly wordy and doesn't flow and transition well.  Detail after detail likely weave a fascinating story to insiders but as a true outsider trying to peer in, this book fogs rather than clears the air.<br />While he suggests managers, maestros and corporate involvement among other factors, it isn't tied together with any clarity or convincing hypothesis testing that I could follow.  Again, in fairness maybe it is just a matter of not relating to the writer's style and the foreigness of the vocab, but if classical music is going to interest more outsiders like me, shouldn't this be a goal?  This aloofness and cavalier attitude is definitely a barrier to many.<br />Frustrated, but still pursuing obtaining some insights into this struggling arts area which should survive and thrive.	2004-02-09

He does this in much the same excellent exegesis as Wenham's famous commentary on Leviticus in the NICOT series by Eerdmans.  However, being the good Lutheran exegete that he is, he adds the much necessary incarnational and sacramental theology, with the marvelous organizational addition to each section commented on by adding a section on &quot;Fulfillment in Christ&quot; with its pertinent application to today's True Israel.<br />The importance of this inspired Word of God is for correction of not only justification but sanctification as well.  Kleinig observes: &quot;God did not keep his holiness to himself, nor did he use it to distance himself from his sinful people.  Instead, he joined them on their earthly journey so that he could share his holiness with them.  They did not sanctify themselves; he sanctified them.&quot;<br />Chapter 19 is pivotal Scriptural stuff and Kleining sees it this way as well.  God's holiness being given to the people through the means of grace is the focus, not just as Kleining comments: &quot;the poetentially holy Israelites generated their own holiness by observing God's performance and prohibitive commandments.  That contradicts God's repeated assertions the HE is the one who sanctifies his people ... they were called to observe God's commandments because they were holy and so needed to maintain their holiness.&quot;<br />So relevant a corrective is here in this Biblical book to modern Western reader's tendency to reject ritual as having any place in our life today.  Many wrongly believe that Jesus abolished any need for such OT ritual legislation.  However, Kleining offers this: &quot;So churches that prize the Good News of free forgiveness through faith in Christ may mistakenly assume that they should no longer use Leviticus to nurture the saints, even though the entire book is concerned with forgiveness and atonement--more overtly than any other book of the Bible.&quot;<br />Kleinig correctly sees Leviticus' relevance to the church today in aiding her in &quot;returning to her ancient roots and profound appreciation for God's gracious work in the Divine Service through the liturgy of Word and Sacrament.  The contemporary church is also being called upon to confront the attacks on the exclusivisity of Christ as &quot;the Holy One of God.&quot;<br />Thus, a great commentary, relevant to rediscovering &quot;Holiness&quot; or for delving deeper and clearer into God's grace in Christ.  This is a sizeable additon to aiding God's church to heed His &quot;I am holy thus you are to be holy.&quot;s abolished any need for such OT ritual legislation.

The left is good, we must admit it and this book exposes it, at not debating the issues or truthfulness of an incident, but rather spinning and namecalling until one becomes so sick and tired ot it.  Thus, America is not at all impressed nor trustworthy of mainstream media anymore, with the exception of Fox News.  God bless that we have them around.<br />Her analysis of a madeup \\"Christian right\\" and the reluctance of publishers to print conservative books is truly worth the cost of this and reading it and keeping it around.<br />For me the best punch was the shot she made about the dog food executive who laments not selling as much dog food as he would like, proclaiming we're doing it all right with our image and promotion, but why, why aren't the consumers buying it.  The answer: the dogs just don't like it!<br />The liberals don't get it: the stupid, moronic, Christian right that comprises most of America just doesn't like their thinking and ideas and governance.<br />Keep 'em honest.

He firmly believed the Gospel should be promulgated in every Chrsitian's life, via their vocation and calls.  This does not come so much from intentional programs and organized campaigns but the the Liturgist of the Church, Christ working out through His people to the world.<br />A true champion of the power of the Word to save this world, he writes convincingly that the Bible is a missionary book.  The mission outreach is not some sort of special appeal, but the fundamental life expression of the church through its faithful proclamation of the means of grace.<br />Especially of interest and delight is that Luther sees much mission evidience in the OT, as he quotes much from the Torah and Prophets for salvation going out to all nations.<br />Interesting and useful work for any interested in what Luther thought about missions.	2004-02-02

Schmidt carefully unloads the words which are tossed around in our society, multicultural, pluralism, diversity.  These are held up before America's eyes as words worthy of her adoption and embrace.  We are scolded, threatened and lectured at to be humans, for humans embrace such.<br />But, as Schmidt so carefully and thoroughly shows in this read, these words mean so much more than what the casual American would think.  It is not at all just about learning about other cultures and respecting them.  No, it is about holding deep seated wrath for our heritage of melting pot, and everying Euro-American and of western culture in general.<br />These Marxist leftists have infiltrated and influenced our great country of one people, E pluribus unum for far too long.  The people must rise up to take it back.  Schmidt provides the beginning to raise our attenanas and be tuned into what is going on in this area .... in government, in churches, in universities, in media.<br />This has certainly sensitized me even more to these issues clearly researched and communicated by Schimidt in this book.  I will seek more to read and study and learn about this dangerous threat to our unity and existence as a melting pot country.	2004-01-27

Barry Sanders jitterbugged his way into my world in 1988 as he dismantled by beloved Cowboys in the Holiday Bowl.  I thought then what a terrible defense we had that day, only to learn later on how wrong I was.  What a great back this Sanders is!<br />He is the greatest so far.  I've seen them all: Brown, Horning, Sayers (he could have been if injury hadn't cut him short; also from Kansas--what have they got in their water there?), Payton, Emmitt, et al.  This guy for me was the player (as so many others have said) one would pay money to see him run!<br />Speed, explosiveness, elusiveness, power, vision.  More important, couple this with his personal temperament: a true anti-celebrity.  A true good guy, a Christian athlete.  An honest man.  A family man.  This is role model stuff formed by the Creator God Himself, whom Barry gives all the credit.<br />The book is very well done.  Not by some known-name author, but Barry's friend Mark E. McCormick who does an excellent job outlining this exciting life and reporting it as it would seem Barry would: few words, to the point, tell it like it is.  So there are a couple typos.  Makes it more authentic for me!  It speaks of what he feels like before, during and after a run.  What is all this talk in some other reviews about nothing revealed really worth reading?  What is missing is normal super=jock stories of ego and media hype, etc. Hand the ball to the ref in the endzone, pick up the Heisman, thank the Lord.  Thanks Barry and Mark McCormick.  You did it right!<br />The DVD I find exeptional.  Especially thankful that less than more of his dismantled of Wyo is not shown.  Some of the runs, e.g. one against da Bears is awesome, but there are others as well.  Especially like the spin moves and neat straight arm.  This guy could hit as well as dodge.  He had it all.  He was the best.<br />Revealing that what many thought was true and it is neat that Barry lets it out: for some weird reason, the Lions slowly dismantled the team that could have. . .

One can certainly read this and find evidence that the author certainly believes, practices and admonishes all other proclaimers of the true Gospel to do the same.  However, he also adds some caveats throughout which diminish, detract from the strength of this Gospel.<br />Burce reveals in the writing that his theological geneology comes from the Lutheran Church and the Missouri Synod, but that he went the way of the Seminex split and the subsequent ELCA, of which he is now a pastor.<br />This thus places him in the Gospel Reductionist camp which sounds as if they truly are for the true Gospel proclaimed in all its dimensions, yet they want to at the same time dabble in speculative theology, such as historical criticism.  Thus, he fires salvos at what he terms &quot;stern old Pastor So-and-So's particualar heresy,&quot; even quoting Dr. Walther to back him up.<br />Walther provides no such relief for this error, since what Burce condemns is the very teaching that Walther condemned.  Walther would agree with Burce in that Walther's Thesis XIV cites the Word of God not rightly divided when preaching says that one is saved by their faith, on account, for the sake of their faith.  Burce seems to go on and equate this with believing one can know and believe and proclaim all of God's truth, as the LCMS has.  Walther states equivocally that retaining all of pure doctrine is not to be made a condition of salvation nor his salvation according to one's being a part of the visible orthodox Church.  However, Walther also teaches &quot;Contempt of pure doctrine is contempt of truth; for the pure doctrine is simply nothing else, absolutely nothing else, than the pure Word of God.&quot;  And in another place: &quot;I belong to the Lutheran Church for the sole reason that I want to side with the truth.  I quit the Church to which I belong when I find that it harbors errors with which I do not wish to be contaminated.  I do not wish to become a partaker of other men's sins, and by quitting a heretical community I confess the pure and unadulterated truth.&quot;<br />Burce argues against such when he feels he is the one who has come out of the heretical LCMS, being educated and persuaded by teachers who did not hold all of God's Word to be God's Word, but made it suspect and in need of experts to help sift out the wheat from the chaff.<br />The joy he takes in American agnotics, who he claims are many of the people in his pews, and in many of America's pews.  This is dangerous, since it allows all to be comfortable with whatever &quot;they believe&quot; is true, so long as they hold some faith in gospel.  The Scriptural danger here is that all other doctrines other than the Gospel, while not necessary for saving faith as Walther and Burce agreed, are up for grabs, but that each and every one of them is attached to the Gospel in order to protect, guard and uplift God's powerful saving Good News in the Gospel.  This interconnectedness speaks out against Burce's soothing his own conscience against &quot;just Gospel alone for me, thanks&quot; attitude, which prevailed in LCMS especially in the Walkout episode and in still circles, but is and was never any official acceptance by this confessional body, but rather was and is declared unbiblical, and unLutheran since.<br />Although one is certainly encouraged at many places to proclaim the truth of Scripture's Gospel boldly, persistently, and consistenly even in the face of cultural pressure, this work suffers from too many questionable stretches on areas such as who may occupy the office of public ministry, the issue of Biblical inerrancy and the relationship of all doctrine with the Gospel all others, to make this book suspect in many areas.sins, and by quitting a heretical community I confess the pure and unadulterated truth.&quot;<br />Burce argues against such when he feels he is the one who has come out of the heretical LCMS, being educated and persuaded by teachers who did not hold all of God's Word to be God's Word, but made it suspect and in need of experts to help sift out the wheat from the chaff.<br />The joy he takes in American agnotics, who he claims are many of the people in his pews, and in many of America's pews.

This is a book which necessarily contemplates the question for those pastors or those contemplating the office, where does one turn when in need?<br />Frye answers: to multiple sources to find Jesus the Pastor: The Word, spiritual gifts and brother pastors and saints.<br />His compassion and heart for the sheep and those who will be brought into the fold is touching and commendable.<br />This reviewer's concern is directing one away from the only source of power and salvation:  The Word Incarnate.  Is Jesus not located where He wishes and mandates that He is?  For sure?  For 100% sure?<br />Jesus locates Himself in the gospel purely preached and in the Sacraments administered according to His mandates!  This is where every pastor and individual will find Him!  We find Jesus there to forgive our sins as pastors, strengthen our faith and keep us in this faith, and deliver us finally to the church triumphant.<br />What Frye suggests that I cannot agree with is seek spiritual gifts for empowerment.  Consider Luke 16:19ff.  Does Jesus suggest that we find salvation in any other place than in the Word?  Further, Matthew 7:21-23, \\"(Did we not) do many might works in your name?\\" and 1 John 4:1-2 demand that any spirit which would detract from Jesus Incarnate in Word and Sacrament is not from the Holy Spirit.<br />In last days that we are in, when every church growth program and latest is not delivering the numerical growth they have been proclaiming is Biblical, where do they turn?<br />These moments of desparation show us where faith is.  Only in what God has spoken and mandated that He be found:  in the Gospel purely preached and Sacraments administered according to His mandates.<br />For all the compassion and desire to be God-pleasing that Frye so humbly speaks of in this book, to lead pastors to anything other than God's Word is not what God has said.  Let us consider what His Servants of the Word should be!<br />Thus, I cannot recommend this to pastors or those contemplating the office due to these serious misleadings.  Wish he would have more directly and in detail, expounded the Biblical admonitions for pastors, such as 1 Cor. 11, 2 Cor. 4:12; 2 Cor. 11:2; 1 Tim. 3-4, etc.  For a good treatment of these, see Jonathon F.

Using the South Beach Diet, 15 pounds have been shed and am on my way to about 8 more.  Like others, the boredom and desire to find ingredients and recipes that help spice up the diet is a goal.<br />I am a cookbook collector, reader and user.  This is truly one that I will seek for guidance and creativity.<br />What struck me immediately is the great and thorough sections about restaurant dining by overall tips for selection of a restaurant and then once there, what to order at various ethnic eateries which we all love.  The insights like to order sauces on the side and ask questions about ingredients are insightful.<br />The section on mastering low-gi cooking is outstanding.  Ingredient recommendations and alternatives are given in the hope that even us amateur gourmets might develop the cuisine that would allow us to modify our fav recipes to fit our new dietary needs.  Some of this seems contradictory to South Beach advice, e.g. use of fruit juices.  It must be said however in fairness to the author that this can be easily overcome with other alternatives.  Again, principles to creativity.<br />The extensive recipe section which covers necessary categories like appetizers, salads, soups, etc. is attractive, creative, and provides needed great variety.  Gravitate to such as: Quick Chicken Chili; Sunrise Smoothie; Buttermilk-Oat-Bran Pancakes; Bacon, Egg and Cheese Breakfast Sandwich; Cajun Grilled Tuna Salad; Cashew Crunch Turkey Salad; Chicken Breasts with Savory Apple Stuffing; Slow Simmered Pork Roast; Oat-Bran Pizza Crust; Very Blueberry Mousse.<br />This is just outstanding and one can turn and use this to one's health easily and reliably.  Only one small wish that a &quot;Sources&quot; listing for certain ingredients were included for those in areas where finding such might not be found, or for those of internet age who might want to purchase that way.ay.	2003-11-13

What a delight of a quick read, all of five minutes or so.  But what a read!<br />Story of a seed, dry with no hope of becoming anything worthy.  But through being set aside, doused in water, but into the deep, dark cold ground, drowned with water, covered with manure, and struggling to reach top of the trellis and finally to produce blossoms, supported by trellis and Nice Woman, it happens.<br />Knowing the author's faith and numerous Biblical references to plants and bearing blossoms (e.g. Psalm 1 and Mt. 13:18-52, and John 15:1-9), one cannot but sense that this is real parable's meaning here.  Although many will derive pleasure from the read and wonderful illustrations, and still others will sense morals of patience, perseverance, support, etc., the strong spiritual implications here are obvious, what with the strong Biblical allusion and Karon's faith evidenced in the Mitford writings.<br />Blessings on this creativity and beauty communicated so wonderfully for all ages to be encouraged to blossom and bloom where and when the Lord wills.	2003-11-13

Many Biblical references are given throughout and thus provide for great devotional work in looking them up and meditating on them.<br />The range is broad and covers so much that can enrichen and enliven one's time in devotion, meditation on Scriptures and prayer.<br />As the translator's preface states the purpose of this publication:  &quot;the stark message of the Law will drive you to the Savior's arms.

As he demonstrates consistently, he can write and hold our attention by having well researched, layered plot veins, and then wordsmithing them into the mystery attention holder that is fast becoming his reputation with these last two novels.<br />Dr. Jon Weber again becomes the focal point as he seeks to verify the factuality of Joshua Ben-Yosef.  For 249 pages one is left in the deepening sense that the eschatological progrosticators want to take us to an intermediate state with Jesus' return.  Much like the scheme of Gerzone's bestselling \\"Joshua\\" series, however, with the addition of much more reasonable theology, Maier sets Ben-Yosef as a more likely returning Messiah.  Almost convinced of his authenticity, Maier suddenly leaps forward with the crack in the case which his loyal reading followers were waiting for, explodes into the work.<br />The intricacy and reasoning behind the conspiracy and its discovery show forth the active, sophisticated and informed intellect of this author.  Although I found the final resolve and public disclosure of this solution slightly more \\"trumped up\\" than his previous theological thriller with Dr. Weber, it was a riveting and enjoyable read.  Interested in the topic readers might check out Philip Jenkins fine work: \\"Mystics and Messiahs:Cults and New Religions in American History.\\"<br />My only wish for this book would have been the author's resisting interjection of his own opinions concerning the troubles in our synod, i.e. Yankee Stadium comments and overal ecumenical, fellowship slants at times.  However, Dr. Maier certainly with his background and accomplishments derservedly has the right to express them.  This humble reviewer however expresses his regrets for their inclusion into this fine work dispelling the unbiblical \\"Last Things\\" phenomena, which somewhat distracted the overall taste for this otherwise superb fictional work.	2003-11-08

Having enjoyed his previous writings, this one is no exception.<br />He argues a salient point that the Declaration of Independence might certainly be more about government by the dissent rather than by consent.  In this regard, he cites the section of the Declaration which speaks of repeated replies to dissent by continued injuries and disinterest.<br />He then relates this thesis through the three lenses of: Allegiance, Disobedience, Interpretation.<br />Making good points along the way, he concludes:  If instead we celebrate, always, results over people, bureaucracy over democracy, and centralization over community, then, we are saying after all that we have no interest in the &quot;repeated Petitions&quot; of which the Declaration speaks, that we will, as our revolutionary forebears charged against George III, meet the petitions only with &quot;&quot;repeated injury.&quot;  If that is what constitutionalism has wrought, it is but one more sign that our celebration of the Declaration of Independence--indeed, our claim to democracy itself--is a sham.&quot;<br />Only wish is that his theology in places were more Biblical, i.e. that he saw the import of Romans 13 and the true Soverign's role in placing authorities, followed by understanding the two kingdom's functioning.	2003-11-07

Various writers of these disciplines examine the identity and clash of American Lutheran movements competing the soul and future of the Lutheran presence and identity in this country.<br />Of special interest are the articles by Mark Noll on the identity and contribution nationally by Lutherans in the past, present and potential for the future.<br />The article by Alvin Schmidt \\"Multiculturalism and the Dilution of Lutheran Identity\\" is well done and raises necessary questions which have not been answered, but need to.<br />The Mega-Church survey report of Thumma and Peterson is revealing.  Over 2/3 of the growth reported by these \\"Goliaths\\" are from transfer growth.  See Wm. Chadwick's excellent work: \\"Stealing Sheep.\\"<br />For this reviewer of particular interest was the essay on the LCMS by Mary Todd, controversial historian from the Chicago area.  Her analysis is flawed and slanted, and shows a bias that is betrays the dysfunctional character of this confessional body for quite some time.<br />The question for Lutherans and Christians is, does sociology inform theology, or does theology inform sociology?	2003-11-06

This is just a superb addition to the growing Commentary Series from CPH.  Being the first OT commentary, the excitement for this reviewer is to explore an OT book which admittedly so has not been given much attention by me to this point.<br />This shall all change though with this commentary's appearance to guide me on this exciting journey.<br />Mitchell is a competent and thorough exegete, and provides not only an unbelievable complete historical overview of The Song's interpretative past, but further adds his own researched and careful analysis verse by verse.  As with the other series' commentaries, it begins with his own interpretation, followed by extensive textual notes, and then commentary.<br />What impresses one is not only the length and depth of this massive work, but the richness therein contained on such exciting and vital topics to the Body of Christ as marriage, and its major thrust as the very relationship between Christ and His Bride, the holy catholic church.  This becomes Mitchell's major task and theme, and this reviewer is excited to begin the journey and discover its incarantional and sacramental treasures.<br />Certainly this volume has the potential to become a major resource for this neglected but vital Scriptural book.	2003-11-05

As this is a comprehensive history up to the Post WWII era, the author by necessity touches on every area, yet leaves some at the macro stage where one wishes for more.  This is well supplemented with a thorough annotated bibliographic section for further research.<br />From its frontier routes with the Natives and mountain men to the explorers and natural resource, railroad and ranching industries which comprise this land, Larson weaves a tale which engages the interested reader and keeps your interest growing.<br />The book is equally divided from its beginnings and overall description and then section two of the 19th C. on.<br />A treasure of a state history.  It must be added also that the line drawings by Brodie are very nice!	2003-10-31

Many Church Growthers are honest and admitting that CG has not been growing the church -- e.g. see George Barna in &quot;Boiling Point&quot; or William Chadwick's excellent book &quot;Stealing Sheep.&quot;<br />So, leader Wagner and others are doing something they admit the church catholic has never attempted -- fill the office of apostle.  Do the exegesis of their proof -- Eph. 4!  It will not allow their heretical translation.<br />This is desparation in motion!  To pride themselves on moving away from theology to practice and say that they are still holding to Reformation theology.  From justification to sanctification;  from cross to crown!  This is dangerous and faulty theology at its worst!<br />This is an exhibition of 2 Tim. 4 coming true in spades in our time -- &quot;for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires.&quot;<br />No sheep who follows the voice of the Good Shepherd will recognize his leading voice in this.	2003-10-31

Ms. Karon writes from a depth of faith lived out in her writing that relates and touches the soul deep within its readers.  And we thank God for her and it!<br />Emmanuel (God with us) is prominent in this latest book.  From His workings in Father Tim and Cynthia to the other characters, this Holy Child of Bethlehem takes His place at the center of all adoration and praise and thanks as His story is retold through the heartbreaks and gifts given and received in this small Carolina place and time.  A small wish that she would have stuck with the Biblical way of salvation, not a saving prayer inviting Christ into hearts, but believe in the Christmas story and what it brought into the world, Our Savior, Redeemer Lord!<br />In her identifying style the author makes this gracious Lord's outpourings burst forth in its radiance and magnificence in the characters' lives.  What this reader found attractive and new in this work was the continuing flashbacks Tim has of his youth and father and abiding around the barn as a shepherd, to the ending of Tommy's receiving the same 2-wheels!  Great, touching stuff!<br />As the rest, will anxiously await the next and final installment.  This will certainly become a classic to be shared, given and treasured.<br />All praise and glory to the gracious Christ Child!	2003-10-30

Guinness is profound in his penetrating analysis of the current state of Western Christianiy.<br />Thinking the dire need to be more relevant, the church has made themselves irrelevant.  Caused by cuddling up to modernity's false notions of time, the church is off course and missing the target.  Not caring about the past, they concentrate on the future. Read for yourself the latest and greatest on the New Apostolic Reformation and see what he's talking about.  The focus is not even on the present but on the future!  How arrogant to assume they know what's coming.<br />Guinness has so many tight sayings which if truly sorted through using the Word of God will cause each and every humble, believing Christian to stop and take stock.  Time is uncontrollable.  Redeeming the time is what it's all about, and this book shows what that entails, and what it does not.<br />Frank, provocative, astute.

His final years were devoted to this cause, and Brecht preserves this history in his continued easy to read style, but very scholarly and historically accurate.<br /><br />While all around him toil and turmoil reigned against this pure gospel and its valued proclamation, the Reformer remainded steadfast in spite of failing health.  His disputes with those who wanted to reform too much as well as political problems and disputes even within those of the Lutheran persuasion all troubled him.  At times his patience wore thin, and there were signs of anger and rudeness exhibited.  But, my God, what this man endured and his steadfastness to the Gospel and God's means of salvation are phenomenal and to be followed.  We certainly want to not follow with his sometimes harshness, but when it erupts, seek our dear Christ's forgiveness.<br /><br />As much historical biography of Luther is of his early period, this treatment of his latter is valuable and a reliable one.	2003-10-14

Wagner himself admits that the church &quot;catholic&quot; is against him.  Up till the 1990's, no one has ventured to reestablish the office of apostle and prophet.<br />Wagner et al have been confronted with a desparate situation:  Church Growth has failed them for over two decades and they admit it!  See Chadwick's truly amazing work: Stealing Sheep!<br />Now, in desparation they begin what Wagner terms in this book: &quot;The reinvention of Christianity.&quot;  This gathering together of previous CG principles: charismatic, spiritual gifts, leadership from corporate world, marketing, etc., bundled up with real leaders now, is only reached by reading into Scripture what isn't there.  Check it out in Wagner's books on the theology behind this: &quot;Churchquake&quot; and &quot;Apostles and Prophets&quot;.  You'll discover an unbelievably poor treatment of Ephesians 4.  So many errors!  One careful with the Greek text can make mincemeat out of this!<br />Hybels et al contribute essays on this New Apostolic Reformation!  This is a farce!

Here, Chemnitz in his style, looks to the Scriptures, ancient fathers in examining these topics.  He takes little use for man-made traditions unless they are conducive to what is mandated in the Word for the life of the church.<br />Particularly relevant to today is the talk about festivals.  Chemnitz provides clear evidence of his theological concern for the gospel:  &quot;Although church gatherings are not bound to this day in the NT by any necessity of eith law or precept, it would be nevertheless be barbaric willfulness to be unwilling, without good cause, to observe this custom of the apostolic and primitive church for the sake of order and harmony, just because Christian liberty has been granted to consciences,particularly because this serves and can be used for the efification of the church.<br />Here one will be well instructed on both the errors of Rome and also those who want to detach far from Rome without consideration for the edification of the church.	2003-09-22

Here is an honest Christian pastor who was and is ready to examine all he has been led to believe in as God's truth in light of Scritpure.<br />Once led to believe that all growth is God-pleasing growth, Pastor William Chadwick writes of how he discovered to his shock and surprise that Church Growth to date has failed in its goal: kingdom growth.<br />It has succeeded in what Chadwick calls the sinful growth &quot;Transfer Growth,&quot; or stealing sheep, rearranging the flock, etc.  He details his discovery of large churches growing at the expense of other churches, shamelessly, unlovingly.  Guilty here is the movements principles being drawn not from the mind of Christ, but from the mind of the business world and other enemies of Christ.<br />What is truly remarkable about this is the fact the Chadwick still identifies himself as church growth believer.  He sees a future and place for it still.  Although I disagree with the author on this, the church is indebted to this work and his honesty, and what one could only pray and trust that his mind will continue to be open to the Lord's leading.<br />This is must read for all interested in growing Christ's Church!	2003-09-12

Were to such a thorough work be done on Vatican II.  To give but a little flavor of its excellence from the chapters on purgaroty: &quot;From this contrast of the statements of Scripture and the opinions of purgatory it is clear that the fiction of paplist purgatory is not only lacking in documentation and testimonies of Scripture but is such that it diametrically opposes the constant statements of Scripture and its chief passages, overturns the article of justification, changes the goal of salvation, distorts the Word, the sacraments, and the keys of the kingdom of heaven, overthrows true repentance, makes the obedience, death, and the satisfaction of Christ no effect, substitutes a false righteousness and satisfaction, detracts from the goodness of God, perverts the sleep and rest of those who have fallen asleep in Christ into the sharpest torments, takes away sure comfort from consciences, nourishes and strengthen impenitence and carnal security in those who can buy abundant intercessions after death.  And briefly--purgatory is the mother, the fountain and origin, of all deceits of the whole papacy.&quot;	2003-09-06

Reviewing Roman Catholic and Reformed views primarily, he senses the inadequacy of four-fold concept: one, holy, catholic and apostolic church as well as the marks of the church method: Word, Sacraments, discipline (latter, betraying his Calvinistic orientation).  Thus, he sequences all this history forgetting Lutheran ecclessiology which gives correctives to all these as well as Eastern Orthodox which he does not address either.  From this, it is small step to modern ecclessiology which seeks to break out of this for more ecumenical, dynamic, mission orientation purpose for the church.<br />Thus, he arrives at book's purpose: the focus of local congregation.<br />While he provides much of Biblical view at times concerning Christ's church, he is too vague in his conclusions, i.e. confession.<br />As corrective to all this, interested theologians will pursue Kurt Marquart's monumental work &quot;The Church: Her Fellowship, Ministry and Governance.&quot;  He magnificently shows from the Bible and Lutheran Confessions how defective ecclessiology (as exhibited by Van Engen) comes from defective Christology--- &quot;Is it possible to discern a pattern in the ecclesiologies of these major versions of Christianity?  Without oversimplifying unduly, we may say the traditional Roman Catholicism (before Vatican II) particulary, but also Eastern Orthodocy, externalize the church, while Calvinism spiritualizes her.  Lutheran theology, by its innermost logic, understands the church incarantionally.&quot;<br />Such a false division of visible and invisible church understood in wrong sense allows such ecclessiologies as Van Engen's to begin to put purpose of church back under law talk: what real congregations will and must do, rather than means of grace talk about God doing it all through the pure preaching of the Gospel and the right administration of the sacraments.<br />This book certainly provides one to realize where much of evangelical movement and Fuller is at concerning mission and ecclessiology, Christology, and where they want to make gignatic, non-static paradigm changes to effect more pragmatic numerical growth.  Such not only ignores biblical realities, but will not comprehend theology of cross and rejection of truth, apostacy.rch understood in wrong sense allows such ecclessiologies as Van Engen's to begin to put purpose of church back under law talk: what real congregations will and must do, rather than means of grace talk about God doing it all through the pure preaching of the Gospel and the right administration of the sacraments.<br />This book certainly provides one to realize where much of evangelical movement and Fuller is at concerning mission and ecclessiology, Christology, and where they want to make gignatic, non-static paradigm changes to effect more pragmatic numerical growth.

This book shows the disfunctionality in the LCMS now that has been allowed to exist for at least 50+ years now, possibly even since 1939.<br />The theology behind this book was rejected and termed as unbibical in the Praesidium's decision concerning false doctrine filed against one of the authors.  Sad that the decision said that this most basic doctrine of Justification and Law and Gospel is not understood by the authors.  So no wonder when the Lutherans took over CPH and doctrinal review they discarded this.  How about Courageous Churches and Luecke's book as well.<br />Certainly who is in seats of power in synod publishing and control makes all this happen.

What has happened to repent and believe?  This is Jesus' way of saving!  His Words of grace and forgiveness in the gospel purely preached and the right administration of the Sacraments of baptism and communion --- these are how Jesus says the church grows!<br />George wants to alter this to what the people want.

No, they would rather have the &quot;helpful, practical prescriptions, both spiritual and numerical&quot; that George offers here.<br />Bogged down at a number of attendees?  100?  200? 400? 800? George has slick answers from marketing and sociology and church growth experts, but not much from God's Word that I can find.  Oh, there are Biblical quotes, but check them out carefully, noticing context and other places the Bible speaks on this and you'll find like me that there are very suspect as being anywhere near what God wants to say.  For example, does God want the church to be run like the discovery and manufacture of aspirin?  (page 58-59)<br />This is more of Church Growth desire to have the church be relevant and successful in a culture which it seems more and more deplores the truth (see 2 Timothy 4:3ff) which is not at all that bad of desire.  But to let the desired results drives the means without God's saying so is unbiblical, unchristian, and dangerous.	2003-08-02

The battle cry of Dr. Scaer.  And true it is, that all revolves around one's answer: And who do you say Jesus is?<br />Many want to skip over this ever so quickly, answering that of course we all agree that He is the Savior, the Lord.  But what does this mean?<br />Dr. Scaer is not one prone to such.  His work seeks not to be an exercise in historical theology, but rather a contempary dogmatics on the topic.  He contends that the greatest challenge comes from the field of NT studies, where he himself is a student and published author.<br />He makes sharp, pointed statements which are supported by exegetical evidence and historical precedents,e.g. &quot;For those who have no firm confidence in the historicity of Jesus, a true Christology is impossible.&quot;<br />Particularly well done is the chapter &quot;The Preexistence and Incarnation of The Son of God.&quot;  Taking on the inadequate Christologies of the historical critics and the Reformed et al, Scaer contributes to this vital doctrine with erudite writing, e.g. &quot;The prinicple of the incapability of the finite to be joined to or associate with the infinite attacks the heart of Christianity as a religion of God's salvidic revelation and easily unravels any meaningful Christology.&quot;<br />Scaer is a profound exegete, researcher and wordsmith.  This brief but engaging discourse on Christology is a worthy contribution to modern dogmatics.  This comment illustrates:  &quot;Thus the Resurrection is neither simply an event which happened nor merely the act of an all powerful God desiring to express His soverign will, but the final expression of what it means to call God life and the One who makes alive (Jn. 5:21-29).<br />All who are interested to keep Christ at the center of the faith will benefit from usage of this sixth volume in the Confessional Lutheran Dogmatics Series from the Luther Academy.	2003-07-28

Thus, this commentary will certainly serve a major place in the life of Christ's church.<br />The false teaching that Paul exposes and condemns in this letter to the church at Colossae is herein expounded upon by Deterding's fine exegesis.  He sees one of the greater benefits of this letter as Paul's contribution to the relationship between Christology and cosmology.  He in the author's view: &quot;Colossians expounds upon the relationship of Jesus Christ to the created order, for the letter presents Christ as both Creator and Reconciler of the universe.&quot;<br />Further, this work ackowledges that Colossians presents serious textual problems.  Thus, a proper commentary will treat this issue carefully and thoughtfully, as this volume certainly does.<br />The structure of this Commentary Series is delightful to use: Translation from the Original language, followed by Textual Notes which address the formal issues as the textual criticism and other exegetical highlights; followed by the Commentary section which seeks to provide a running interpretive description of what the Lord of the church wants to communicate through Paul; finally, various excursus supplement the rest of this commentary with well done essays on such as &quot;Pauline Anthropology, The Powers,&quot; etc.<br />This commentary addresses the heresy in the Colossians with the resounding clear message of Christ for the Colossians and all people in the reconciliation of the cross.  This reviewer truly appreciated the fine work given to one of the favorite evangelism sections of the NT, Col. 4:2-6!  One of the strong attributes of this commentary is the emphasis on the pure proclamation of the Gospel, e.g. &quot;As this mystery is proclaimed, God the Holy Spirit works through it to create and sustain in the hearer saving faith; through such faith the mystery becomes known.  Thus the power for understanding the mystery of the Gospel comes from the proclamation of the Gospel mystery itself.&quot;<br />This is well done, faithful to the Word tool for the life of Christ's church.  Deterding's research and insights into this letter will benefit the church and any Christian who wishes to delve deeper into this book.this mystery is proclaimed, God the Holy Spirit works through it to create and sustain in the hearer saving faith; through such faith the mystery becomes known.

I found the separation into tough-minded and tender-minded apologetical approaches helpful and insightful.  The Christian Church certainly needs to reclaim and make full use of the arts which God has so graciously bestowed upon it, and recently have been abandoned or culturalized popularly in the church.

He provides additional resources for followup as well.<br />Highly recommended.  I am now using it in an Adult Bible Study on Bioethics.	2003-07-10

Many reviewers speak against such, but why?  Honest and to-the-point polemics are healthy, as they eventually expose those who say it correctly.<br />This book is definitely polemic concerning the branches of Islam, and their impact on the worldscene.  Certainly, this got all the world's attention on 9/11.<br />Whether Schwartz's polemics accusing the Wahhabi branch of Islam are true or not remain for others more schooled in the history and ways of Islamic branches to help the rest of us sort out.<br />As analogy, it is like someone not familiar with all the Christian confessions believing the lie that all of them are the same.  To believe the supposition that all Christian confessions believe in the physical violence some provide on abortion clinics is to seriously misunderstand and misquote the majority of Christian branches.<br />If Schwartz's analysis of Islam is true, Wahhabism is not representative of all Islam, but is responsible for much of the terrorist activity from this part of the world.  Responsible for this support and propogation, so this book states, is Saudi Arabia.<br />Shocking the charges he files against the US government and its naivity and approach to such if true.<br />Chilling read and this reviewer will await and seek other voices as this gets shifted out.	2003-07-09

It is a wonderful read and the author has an intense, passionate story to tell which she does with an excellent style of prose.<br />The sadness and evil that humans impose upon other humans, here exhibited in the South African culture, is truly something we each can oppose and condemn.  The story told here of Joshua journeying to SA to become a missionary who eventually realizes the mission society that sent him is much the enemy of justice.<br />However, to relate this seeking of justice so strongly with the God the Bible does not present the Biblical picture completely true.  Where is there any evidence of Jesus protesting the government's inhumane treatment?  And there certainly was political oppression of the Israelites.  Jesus even has opportunities to do so but resists, for His kingdom is not about this world's kingdoms and politics, nor His the oppression which He came to set all humanity free from to be correlated exactly with each and every political, social oppressed group.  This sort of misinformed theology is known as &quot;liberation theology&quot; and is not Biblical.  Does not the Lord say that His peace is not anything that this world can give, and that His kingdom is not of this world?  It is difficult to understand but careful Biblical reading and interpretation will not allow any of us to read into it our own political/social needs.  His kingdom of grace is about the oppression of original sin and its forgiveness in Him crucified for it.<br />Let this not put any total damper on this excellent read.  One cannot help but read this work and be moved by the inhumanity done to the people Joshua falls in love with.  The involvement of Gospel preachers of Jesus Christ and the governments of this world must not be confused.  For an excellent review of the major Christian responses to this, see Robert Webber's excellent work, &quot;The Church in the World,&quot; and Gene Veith's book on the Kingdom of God.	2003-07-03

This assumed, Hefner can easily make such unorthodox statements about God implying that technology and true spirituality exist around the same &quot;imagination.&quot;<br />This plays out so far that Hefner even concludes &quot;Technology is even a sacred space.&quot;<br />This totally disregards Scriptures as what they say they are, the true revealer of the Creator of all things, including the atomic order that Hefner writes about as well as all the components necessary for any technology to occur.<br />Thus, what Hefner denies is the basics of the theology from above, that God has revealed man's rebellion and constant desire to be free of any true relationship to Him.  Thus, this freedom plays itself out in our time as so illustrated and divined here by Hefner as true faith, creating one's own dreams to their ultimate limits.  Who needs a God of salvation and redemption from such?<br />Attractive to a sinful, theology from below, but for the theology from above that came down at the Incarnation, this is pitiful but imaginative celebration of man's alientation and rebellion against the Creator's will for mankind.	2003-07-02

If anything was a negative for this reviewer, it was my lack of vocabulary.  Constantly turning to the dictionary for aid with such as ennui, flummoxed, etc., it is always good to be stretched and expanded.<br />The twists and turns of the unfolding drama kept me interested and attuned to where the prose led.  His style was not cumbersome and not predictable which lent itself to the large volume not being distracting to the overall pleasure of this read.<br />The complex plot is intriguing and will capture the reader with its mixture of greed and family intwinement and legal collegiality and competition.<br />Carter has sharp mind and talent as writer.	2003-06-27

Growing up with this guy, we baby boomers need one like this to exude what it truly is about -- not the titles or record or such, but how one played the game and treated others.<br />Such neat memories from AP's life: earning nickels hitting over the ditch for ladies when young; his detest for media's microscopic view; his leaving the French Open after being mistreated by the Frogs (guess things never change); his opinion of the PGA's historical problems; his committment to his word; his enjoyment of piloting immediately after tournament, whether win or lose.<br />Guy is first class and leaves us with much to emulate and pass on.  His family roots run deep and it's evident.  Maybe influence some parents to such as well.<br />More enjoyable read than assumed.  This guy has given so much to the development of the sport we love.  His views should not be lightly glanced over.	2003-06-11

I just recently relooked it over and am amazed at the accuracy of the direction Linsell believed the church was going.  And lo, the church is there.<br />He recalls from historical analysis how the church since the Englightment on has been taking on the values and shape of the culture, and how this is influencing American Christianity away from its God breathed (inspired) values and the will of God for His church.<br />His prediction that all the major denominations have given way to pluralism is totally right on!  The quote which should sting us back into reality: &quot;These churches are doing nothing of a serious nature to purify their bodies and return themselves to the orthodoxy that prevailed at the time of their founding.&quot;<br />My own church, the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, is evidence of this move away from orthodoxy and its founding. Those in charge now proclaim with great pride that they have led the body away from its out-of-date moorings into the future which they have contended God will bless with growth. But to date this has not happened.<br />Amazing work to reread and contemplate.  Also see books by David Wells.	2003-05-28

Squeemish at times for those of us not use to inside O.R. environments with all the procedures and organs being talked about, this rivets one to pediatric heart surgery.<br />Fashioned around a premier surgeon at a leading hospital, the reader is taken on a whirlwind of living on the edge of technology and skill and emotions as heart defects are diagnosed during pregnancy while others found at birth and thereafter are the daily routine of this top notch surgical team which Ruhlman lived with and writes about.<br />One is touched by the intensity of the whole enterprise, the stark reality of it all, day after day, year after year.  The enormity of it all.  Patching this, switching that, shunting here, stiching this together---all to keep young precious life.<br />The history of the discipline and current happenings are reviewed, with its emphasis on comparative mortality stats for various surgical procedures.  Scary to think one's future might well be determined by where one lives and where taken when heart defects occur.<br />The precision and dedication of those who live in this arena is beyond most of our scopes to even begin to fathom, but this book seems to take one there in spirit and interest.  The compassionate care looms ever large.<br />Thoughtful, provocative and reflective view of speciality surgery at the leading edge and all the while on edge.	2003-05-27

It sees seeker services as primarily evangelism (in the train of tent revivals) and not enduring in the long run. It emphasizes the seriousness of God's presence and what God would want to do in the Divine Service.<br />It should be challenged on its insistence that men or women as worship leaders is immaterial; that there needs to be a confluence between Enlightenment generated worship and postmodern, all the while maintaining the central elements: Word and Sacraments.<br />Very worthwhile read and source of discussion and contemplation for all traditions.	2003-05-09

One can tell that Guder has thought long and hard on this, and has reflected as well on many others' reflection.<br />Here he presents the case against the Western Christian church which he feels has succumbed to gosepl reductionism. By this, he means when Christians reduce the gospel in all its fulness and mission to a controllable, manageable level. Pertinent to this understanding is this quote: \\"We are constantly tempted to assert that our way of understanding the Christian faith is a final version of Christian truth.\\"<br />He resonates to the freeflowing tension always seeking to move Christianity along unknown paths, ever broadening and deepening its hold on humanity. Reductionism as he defines it severly restricts it as it diminshes what for him is vital and called its \\"incarantional witness.\\" Here he refers to God's grace reaching out in a Christian's call and vocation.<br />He appears to drift back and forth from orthodoxy to something far from it, especially evidenced by his continued reference to ecumenism as being important and vital element in the repentance and continual conversion needed by Christianity. Although he speaks at length passionately about Jesus and the cross, he severely reproves the church for focus on salvation of individuals.<br />By continual conversion he refers to a rather liquid, dynamic movement in Christianity without boundaries, yet constantly refining what institution is already there. When Chrisitans becomed concerned about maintenance, then mission is lost. Continual conversion refers to this movement back to mission.<br />In many cases on many ecclesial and theological issues, he advocates a moderate position, but this only appears to be one mitigated by his resolve to movement from within existing ecclessiastic structures, rather than disbandonment and new ventures.<br />There is much to be contemplated in this writing that is worthwhile to reflect on even if one is not of the author's theological posture or without accepting his proposed remedies.

Although many may be offended by this and cry out, we do already, not so fast.  Read and learn what this means biblically before so doing.<br />There is much to be gained from this well thought out work, especially how the theology of the cross might play itself out in such diverse witness situations such as Russia, Latinos in America, etc. Bioethics and postmoderism are explored as well.<br />Witness we must, and this work admonishes the body of Christ to do it with the core and heart of God's revelation, the theology of the cross.  Lutherans who already realize this will be encouraged, and those outside such a theology will gain insight into the mind of God for outreach.	2003-04-23

Grimes.<br />In this we see the top of the culinary world in action, amazingly from an unencumbered inside view.  Boulud allows the author pretty much free access to the internal workings of Daniel.<br />What is reported is a calculated mad dash at service time to prepare amazing dishes on time to serve them so that it appears to the customer as seamless and enchanting how this marvelous food appears.<br />The controlled chaos that is observed among the army of cooks, the pass and wait team is of a world and language even many of us home gourmets are unaccustomed to.  Fire this and where's this and too much of this, etc.  Having cooked for hundreds on an evening, this appears to be nothing compared to this monumental complex of intricate, complex gourmet construction.<br />It was most useful to hear from the reviewer Grimes at the end why he initially gave three stars and then changed it to four.  Further, his explanation as to what each star meant was enlightening.<br />For us gourmands and those in or interested in entering this field, this is captivating reading.  For even those who just enjoy superior dining, this is revelation of the highest from one of the world's best.	2003-04-18

A tangy sweetness to it that here is married with honey, orange and pine nuts.  This is superb!<br />How about Cod with Blood Orange Sauce and Creamy Grits from Seasonal section?  Who would have thought to put blood organes with cod?  Citrus goes so well with seafood as this, but with grits?  This guy is truly French-American chef.<br />I find his abilities and recipes to be inspirational for amateur gourmet.  Techniques are not too formidiable and much is offered in the way of purchase and prep techniques.  The small, details are what is worth the book.

Here, one in the know for many years, Gen. Stiner shows us this is not the evolution and future of our SF.<br />Recapping an amazing career and showing the evolution of SF into what they are today, this is enlightening to say the least.  What admiration and pride we should have in these well trained servicemen.  The need to be well-rounded, balanced and skilled in so many areas and disciplines makes these probably the most important warriors in our country's arsenal.  The representation they bring to our country abroad is amazing, e.g. the transfer of the water buffalo, the treatment of the Kurds, it goes on and on.  The intellectual and compassion of these warriors is truly something to be thankful for.<br />What does concern one though is the infighting among the branches, and the distrust of the SF that even was evidenced in Desert Storm.<br />Possibly we are seeing this resolved in Iraqi Freedom, let's hope this is so.<br />Finally, the story of the SF in a hide site in Iraq in Desert Storm and his instant decision not to kill several decision due to his Christian beliefs, eventually placing him and his group in harm's way was a great read, and the event's outcome simply amazing.<br />Well worth the read.	2003-03-30

Thus, Warren fulfilled this in Orange County, CA.<br />All telling is his use of some of the least reliable English translations of the Bible when he needs the largest amount of support for his program suggestions on how to grow the church. Suffice this major example for even learning new principles. Warren quotes from Living Bible (one of the most unreliable) on Prov. 18:15 &quot;The intelligent man is always open to new ideas.  In fact, he looks for them.&quot;  Sounds good to modern mind that wants to sweep away all traces of ties with historic, catholic church.  But a reliable English translation, e.g. NASB has for this verse: The mind of the prudent acquires knowledge, and the ear of the wise seeks knowledge.&quot;  Something totally quite different than Warren trumpets.  One will find such careless use of poor Bible translation to make his case.  Not all of quotes from poor translations, such as Living Bible, Today's English Version, and NCV are this far off, but many are in this book.<br />Also, he hedges much of what he touts as the Lord's will, by saying that copying what he does will not guarantee growth, but following principles will.  Statistics of those who have implemented such will not back this up.  See Barna et al who now constantly say such as Warren have mislead the church.  It is not increasing kingdom of Christ numerically at all, in fact it is hurting the church by moving sheep around.<br />Serious misconception that evangelism is worship and thus need to divide worship services into different congregations, those on Sunday and those on Wed.  Fractionalizing the church is not the Lord's idea.  Certainly we are to fish for the lost, but not cater to them as we assemble together in the Divine Service.  To do this he presents undocumented opinions which are mythical, e.g. Luther's &quot;Mighty Fortress&quot; came from popular song which cannot be documented, etc.  Preaching which does not confront the unbeliever with the scandalon of the particulariity of Christ crucified has no power in it to save anyone.  <br />This kind of bait and switch, Hot-Tub Christianity is unbiblical.  His Scripture does not support his opinions and pragmatism, no matter how he rails to the contrare.  This is threatening to the flock, for it says that we have to cater to pagans and the apostate who will not permit the real transcendant God to be present among them to do what He desires, to forgive them their sins and cleanse them with the pure Gospel.<br />This is revivalism gone amuck in progressive, consumer-driven, individualistic Orange County.  Will Christ find true faith when He returns?	2003-03-26

The legend of this amateur and supposed gentleman is tarnished by his association with Roberts and his seizure of power and control of what has become golfing legend.<br />Without the champion's name and backing and tournament, The Masters and Augusta would be just another club and tour stop.  But from the outset it was Bobby who kept it together.  Then the illness and pulling away, and the inroads of Cliff and the rest is history, here well documented by one of the great golf writers.  Sampson again weaves his literary magic with different piercing vignettes of the personalities and events which have led to Augusta lore and legend.<br />Story upon story from various facets permeate this fluid read--from club caddie to townfolk to neglected member and player -- one is given much to contemplate.<br />The tales are superb, sampling but a few: the caddie deliberately overclubbing Robert's opponent on a Par 3 course contest; Dave Marr's respone to Arnie that even his divot cleared Rae's Creek on 15; the asst. pro's wife being offered big money for the rope marker that only quandred off souvenir sales.<br />Augusta appears to be the premier &quot;ole boys&quot; club.

Here he takes on a difficult, yet more pivotal doctrine that many take far too much for granted: imago Dei, human sin, grace, etc.<br />His survey of doctrinal history is adequate, however concentrates as it should on Hoekema's Reformed heritage.<br />He comes out with a position that appears to be untenably suspended between soverignty of God and man's freedom, while all the time upholding total depravity.  This is part of the Reformed dillemma, which focuses not on Christology but on soverignty.  There is no issue with soverignty if primarily tied to Christology and soteriology.<br />In this reviewer's analysis, the tensions left are not Biblical tensions, due somewhat to this faulty anthropology.<br />For a different look, try and locate a magnificent treatment: &quot;The Doctrine of Man in Classical Lutheran Theology&quot; by Chemnitz and Gerhard.  Here anthropology jives with Christology and soteriology, as what is central to imago Dei is lost righteousness before God, restored in justification in the &quot;now and not yet&quot; of proper eschatology.  Original sin has its way, thus freedom in spiritual matters is gone with Christology and means of grace working.<br />Hoekema is certainly worth the reading and careful attention to his opinions, and this volume certainly delivers such.	2003-03-21

Would it be that equally balancing this was a passion for the unabated, unaided truth of God's Word.<br />Hybels even admits about a period of WC: &quot;In spite of the fact that every message I gave was absolutely biblical, certain themes were stressed to the near exclusion of others.  In that era, I inadvertently emphasized grace but not holiness, and as a result, we adopted a kind of careless Christianity.&quot;<br />He admits putting all of his theological eggs into the basket of relational evangelism.  While there is nothing wrong with relational evangelism, it is not the primary egg.  The power of God to save anyone is the faithful, pure preaching of the gospel, Christ crucified (Romans 1:16-17).<br />Hybels even said during ABC News Special that he doesn't feel Christianity can be refined down to just one symbol: the cross.  Here is where many in the church, including this reviewer, see Hybels and his followers for going off the track.  Those who he wishes to engage with the living God will not tolerate the scandal of particularity of the crucified, so he seeks to attract and retain them by other means till they might be drawn into faith.<br />Classic bait and switch.  Switching not working, as Barna and others have documented.  This and other Church Growth techniques have not built up Christ's church, only took away sheep and moved them.  Further, frustrated members of other sheep pens who compare their numbers with WC and demand similar results.<br />The ignoring of Biblical apostasy is striking!  Cultural relevance to the exclusion of Biblical faithfulness smacks of 2 Timothy 4 predicitions.<br />You decide-- is WC God pleasing or not?  See Galatians 1:6-12.lness smacks of 2 Timothy 4 predicitions.  <br />You decide-- is WC God pleasing or not?  See Galatians 1:6-12.	2003-03-19

Writing at a level where the uninformed can grasp these deep, profound theological concerpts, he then applies them to this intense time of change in American culture.<br />The only thing this reviewer found questionable was his classifying African-Americans as rapidly acception Islam, which with the little I have read is incorrect. Black Muslims are not true Muslims, see \\"The Nation of Islam\\" by Steve Tsoukalas.<br />He does a most excellent job distinguishing among the world's religious choices between those of law and those of gospel.<br />This book is good reading, since it sets on off thinking about critical issues, especially so in time of threat and danger. Turns the reader toward the crucified solution to it all.	2003-03-17

In fact, it wasn't until the final chapter where he tends to put it all back together again that I saw where he was going.<br />He aptly describes the chaos of culture by one that is wavering between modern and post-modern, a world without a center or a circumference. As he writes: \\"a balkanized world of warring factions.\\" To this disjointed complexity, add five generational groups: builders, silent ones, boomers, GenX, and bemused millennials.<br />Previous attempts, visions, strategies, programs, traditions are inadequate in themselves to deal with such quantum change and choas. What is needed the book suggests is a whole new outlook and orientation: one that basically (in author's view) returns to first century apostolic church which was driven by small group of believers committed to Lord that replicated themselves throughout the world. Appointed and empowered by apostles, they were not influential or socially prominent, but operated on the margins and infiltrated all society and turned their world upside down with the gospel.<br />He offers many compelling critiques of previous church growth strategy, but never totally dismisses them as unbiblical, but primarily as pragmatically not working.<br />He replaces such with \\"a mission orientation\\" which is faith led, and not a paradigm per se to be copied in detail, step-by-step, but contexualizing its principles of quick striking, infiltrating and making the gospel relevant to changing cultural setting.<br />Much is to be challenged of this, e.g. his fine reference points for the missional church - faithful to the gospel, inspired by the hope of Christ's return, informed and enriched by heritage are softened in this reader's mind by the addition of: \\"relevant to its ministry setting.\\" He does unload this by explaining it as finding ways to get the gospel across in terms and language culture will accept as relevant.  The problem with this is that doctrine is separated from the practice thereof, allowing and glorifying in permiscuity doctrinally speaking.  As one astute observer wrote: \\"It is when the church begins to accomodate theology to the culture in which it exists that the church loses its moorings and begins to drift away from the truth.\\"<br />He to his credit critiques much of what is wrong with worship these days, however in some cases places too much on work of people in worhsip, rather than God's work to people.<br />I was torn between three and four stars, so really 3.5. Worth reading and continuing thought about what he offers. Much of analaysis that is helpful to the church, and some fine challenges to all branches.

The problem is that the book is 450 pages long, so sorting is necessary.  The titles are deceptive.  By them, this would be a fantastic collection.  But they are deceiving, and the delectable title does not guarantee savory reading.<br />I've consumed about half of this collection, and find some very sumptuous cuts, including a most delightful work by Escoffier on the Art of Cooking in Modern Society as well as John Ash's lovely story on lunch with M.F.K.

There are many one can take away from this and use, however two that stand out in my mind are: great leaders don't enter knowing everything, e.g. Shackleton had never even slept in a sleeping bag before, much is learned; second, in At Edge experiences, overcome uncertainly with structure and distractions.<br />So much more could be said about this excellent contribution to leadership.  It is well structured with Shackleton's lessons first, then biz cases which are each unique and contribute to illustrations of these leadership lessons.  After each section there is reflection, while at the book's end, more intense follow-up excercies and resources to be pursued.<br />One great leadership adventure!	2003-02-23

Thus, to Luther even the common plowboy or in modern work a gas station attendant, is every bit as important as work as the missionary in Africa if done in faith in Christ.<br />This great restoration of Biblical teaching by Luther was furthered by Gustaf Wingren's classic &quot;On Vocation.&quot;  Veith was given this book, from whose reading comes this work.<br />Veith has the gift to put the complex in simple sentences and vocabulary.  Wingren is difficult reading for most pastors, let alone the common layperson.<br />Classic quotes come from this,e.g. &quot;But work done in faith has a different significance than work that is done in unbelief.  The doctrine of vocatin helps Christians see the ordinary labors of life to be charged with meaning.&quot;<br />This will benefit those who read its treasures and apply it to their own vocations.	2003-02-19

Certainly one can challenge the data, process and Schiller's deductions and insights, but this does offer each reader the benefit of Schiller's massive undertaking and cataloguing of the case.<br />I enjoyed this read.	2003-02-14

Here is a great collection of games for singles, groups, even tournaments to enhance one's outing and even provide competition while on the range.<br />For instance, there's an outing format called Tombstone where each player is given target score (3/4 handicap) and when that score is reached, stop there and mark it with tee and paper showing he reached that.  Player that gets furthest wins.<br />Or Bucket, a driving range competiton awarding points for accuracy with the longest club.<br />Great fun stuff with wide variety, and improvement hints throughout by a golfer we all know works hard at his game, but has fun doing it.	2003-02-14

Of the foulest, sickest kind.  History will concur with Medved that this increasingly slippery slope has led all other leading civilizations to decay, disease and collapse.  Can we be of such historic stuff?<br />Medved provides convincing evidence in this, and most disturbing is Hollywood's seeming \\"don't care\\" attitude.<br />Suffice recent stars stance on Iraq as infuriating most of country's citizens.<br />More like Medved and this reviewer, should boycott most of Hollywood.

However, as one would expect, this reviewer challenges the basic supposition of the work, that evolution is a scientific fact.<br />To many, his statement on pg. 6 is patently personal opinion, amply demostrated to be untenable, even in scientific circles: &quot;Evolution is a fact amply demonstrated by the fossil record and by contemporary molecular biology.  Natural selection is a successful theory devised to explain the fact of evolution.&quot;<br />There is no ample fossil record, and contemporary molecular biology itself provides reasonable doubts at to any evolution, e.g. Behe's &quot;Darwin's Black Box.&quot;  This is tragic when competent scientists such as Sagan change personal model choice of world origins into scientific fact.  This cannot be demonstrated.<br />Even more recent evolutionists such as Gould agree.<br />Jumping off this given, Sagan then speculates how the human brain has and is evolving.  Much interesting and useful observations from inquiry into the human mind is good reading however.  Taken with a filter of truth, this book provides for such a good read.	2003-02-14

This is more vital than disputing the outcome, for it must be all about a legal system with the best chance for a true and fair outcome for all parties, including society.<br />Agree with the author that biggest lesson is that trials as this are flashpoints for what is really on culture's mind at the time, here race, decreasing attention spans and bias without basis, spousal abuse, etc.<br />Further, we learned that tv and courtroom don't mix well.  That massive DNA data without certifiable collection/preservation.

I was so interested in watching our judicial system handle such a case of national interest.  My reaction after seeing all of this was twofold:  if a juror, I would support the decision of acquittal, due simply to the fact that the prosecution did not put forward a case that proved beyond reasonable doubt; two, I like all suspect O.J. put the facts of the case as presented did not support this.  I continue to be disturbed that many fellow citizens cannot clearly make this distinguishment.  Our whole legal system is built on this, innocent &quot;until&quot; proven guilty.<br />What one thinks is irrelevant. What is relevant is allowable evidence in the court.  Schiller gets behind scenes and gives much background info for consideration.  Especially does he provide picture of defense and prosecuter teams.  Fascinating stuff!<br />Schiller helps clear some of the smoke away.  Cloud of suscpicion still pervades however, and might never be dispersed.  Great read as all of Schiller's.	2003-02-14

Luther's was right for the Reformation, Hus premature.<br />Same guarantees made to both for the Councils.  Luther wisked away after Worms, while Hus' fate not so good.<br />Amazing account from Hus scholar who has researched and written extensively about this event.

Thus, Christology is front and center and prominent.<br />The author finds five meal sequences in Luke's Gospel which he thus harmonizes and develops into its fullness in Jesus opening the eyes at the Emmaus meal.<br />Will benefit anyone serious about contemplating the meaning of the Easter event as well as Good Friday and communion koinonia today from the Lukan viewpoint.	2003-02-13

Then the tie with Carnoustie and the wee little iceman.<br />Boy this author can captivate you while getting it all down.  This flows and ebbs till it ends up at the Burn and that 18th.

Must overall agree with another reviewer that the author does not truly address what he sets out to: provide requiem for classical music in N.A.  What he does provide is primarily evidence from his musical career and life as what can be called &quot;exhibits&quot; at best.<br />This is all fascinating reading, but avoids larger picture which he said he would provide, and possibly &quot;over the top&quot; &quot;kissing and telling.&quot;  Certainly, there are improprieties which he discloses in this highly competititve world of classical music, but airing all of this doesn't truly help his cause..<br />What does help is the picture barely began into at the end of lack of education at lower grade levels, and the cultural changes which are shoving classical music further and further into the background.  Locally there is fight on whether instrumental music will be continued at public schools.  Local FM classical station off the air, replaced by hard rock.<br />Seems the cultural air we breathe now is so polluted by such dominant areas which do not appreciate nor wish to see prospering classical music.<br />We need other cultural areas than the rich and dominating who are typically ruining local classics in most communities (as this work testifies) who need to jump in, i.e. church and education and communities.  This book certainly provides some impetus for that and at the same time provides a good read of a musician's wide ranging life experiences.	2003-02-01

Bless their boldness and conviction!<br />Although the book starts rather slow at getting to its agenda, by the time it reaches the later chapters it is right on.  One might summarize its diagnosis of current church leadership by this quote: \\"What we call church is often a conspiracy of cordiality.\\"  \\"This accounts for why, to many people, church becomes suffocatingly superficial.  Everybody agress to talk about everything here except what matters.\\"<br />The call is to readjust what is meant by a successful ministry.  What an insightful analogy used here:  To be a successful pastor today is almost as damning as having a happy marriage\\" i.e. one free from conflict.  \\"Many successful pastors are happy only because they surrendered so early.\\"<br />To not surrender means preaching the gospel purely and administring the Sacraments according to God's mandate.<br />What a daring book that for a pastor to ignore is dangerous.  To contemplate is worthwhile.  To implement is God pleasing.	2003-01-27

Learning from himself and his world, and everything in them that will help him achieve.  He makes good points about fear and disappointment building barriers to improvement.  The battle between competing voices of critique and edification, of between differing interests, e.g. Holt's musician vs. writer.<br />All this is comforting and inspiring for the adult learner in each of us.  Attempting to pick up the oboe in my fifties, having abandoned it at 14, understand much of what Holt communicates so well.  However, his issues of tuning and fret memory are replaced for the double reedist by the ever trying reed dilemma.<br />I did not profit from the lengthy recall of his music past.<br />This touching and useful sharing of music growth will stimulate and inspire aspiring musicians of all levels.  Learning to be a learner is a wonderful thematic gift of this work.	2003-01-25

Scalia certainly fits in the latter, Tribe the former.<br />Scalia it would seem proposes what true Biblical exegeis seeks, to find the original intent, while Tribe hedges on this even being possible.  As Scalia succinctly puts it in his reply, &quot;if one can't interpret original meaning in the Constitution, can we have any fair statutes?<br />Salient was this Scalia retort to Tribe:  &quot;Prof. Tribe takes refuge in candar and ... self-conscious humility.  Rejecting base certitude he acknowledges that he does not know the answer to either of these questions.  Indeed, he is not even sure and mean to disparage candor and humility, virtues that are not only admirable but also rare, particularly in intellectual circles. They would assuredly carry the day if the issue before us were quality of character, rather than soundness of interpretative theory.  But they are of little use to the judge who must determine whether and whither the Constitution has wandered, and who is not permitted to render a candid and humble judgment of undecided.&quot;<br />Amazed as questioning of inclusion of Constitutional interpretation while entertaining statutes.

This treatment of the subject is thorough and easy to follow in its points.  Written from a solid Christian perspective, the authors make the consistent point that country has as its roots a Christian, gospel orientation.<br />While such orientation does not predominate, it is there and has always been there.  Now, contemporary country fights the battle with other venues of the pop culture.  Amazing the story of Alan Jackson at the CMC awards.  Right on Alan.  I knew this man was a winner!<br />One learns much about the real world from country music.  Nothing is hidden in the lyrics of this music, it tells it like it is.  People can relate to it.  It's not all the hype of pop.

Indeed, sociological conflict between two religions positions commonly rests in the logical incompatability of their respective beliefs.\\"<br />\\"The desire for religious unity, though not logically justifiable, is eminently understandable; it is a special case of man's fundamental concern to bring oneness out of the diversity of his experience. . . . \\"We may wish most fervently that the world's religions taught a unified doctrine, but what is the case is not determined by what we wish to be the case.\\"<br />What Feiler wishes to be the case from random, speculative stories does in no small way override the deep-founded, sacred beliefs held to by the three religions, incompatabile at their root level.<br />Poor effort, unfounded by serious believers of any of the three. Wishful thinking doesn't make it so.	2002-12-23

Starting with the history of the court and its justices, he then proceeds through the major areas of Supreme Court cases, starting with freedom of speech, moving on to first amendment concerns, then on to religion in the public arean, then parochial schools and public money, right of privacy, affirmative action, gerrymandering, mapp and miranda issues, statuatory issues, federalism and presidents and the court.<br />One notes these trends in Starr's analysis:  the inconsistency of the court in some areas, e.g. state aid to parochial and church-related schools, federalism.<br />Starr certainly provides insight into the troubling concern of some why a conservative court doesn't quickly overturn previous court decisions, showing their reluctance to polarize country with fast moving direction decisions.<br />As a respected trier of fact and Supreme Court advocate, Starr expresses his opinions with eloquence, compassion and clarity.  It certainly shows the vastly enlarged role the highest court has taken in the life of our country in the post-Warren Supreme Court era.<br />A great read which simplifies and explains much of what many of us don't understand nor take the time to research.  Here Starr does all that in a most readable and enjoyable work.	2002-11-10

It differs as he carefully points out in its basic disagreement that W.D. Fard is Allah (God), and that he is a man, a black man.  As anyone familiar with Islam is aware, this is totally against their view of Allah.<br />In a procession of messengers, beginning with Elihah Muhammed, continuing to Malcom X, then to Louis Farrakan, the author provides intro to this development and its implications.<br />Also, he provides advice on how a Christian can witness, given God provides the opportunity.  This is very useful, as well as the accompanying discussion on a Christian evaluation of NOI.  He is lacking on an understanding of the communication of Chrsit's two natures, which would alleviate the problems in this evaluation.<br />A good introductory read to the subject.	2002-11-08

This provides what we need to order Fletan Aux Moules.<br />Where does one start to comment on this massive undertaking of reviewing this, only to say that the recipe collection is extensive and flavorful and within the reach of serious home chefs.  One certainly cannot comment on trying even a small majority of these quickly, however, the few tried on magnificent!  E.g. Mediterranean Fish Soup (Bouillabaisse) for which he provides a history of the dish, the contentions over its meaning, etc. Plus he adds tips to achieve as close to the real thing dish in making the rouille, spice tricks and fillet advice.  The result is superior Fish Stew!<br />Second dish tried was Saute of Beef or Lamb En Surprise.  This amply demonstrates his concern to provide necessary substitute considerations (e.g. here for morels).  This quickly prepared dish is exquisite, and demonstrates the depth of flavor and concentration on the red wine beef broth which serves as defining layer here.<br />I cannot wait to dive into other delights here.  This is truly one to invest in and turn to often.  Most of us home chefs will thrive on this most welcome and well-done offering.	2002-10-29

One's view on the Law definitely affects one's view of the Gospel.  Thus, antinomianism is destructive of the pure Gospel.  Further, the allowance of existentialism into theology caused Lutheran scholars to achieve an unfaithful hermeneutic of Law/Gospel which leads to removal of any Law.  The history here on simul was fascinating.  Its retranslation to sequential explains the resultant mistakes.<br />Broken into three historical periods: 1940-60; 1961-76 and 1977-98 was most helpful and allows the reader insight into developments and influences.  Prolegomena is significant here, as Murrray so aptly points out as the discussion progresses.<br />Enjoyed very much the intellectual rigor the author held to, and his succinct running commentary.  Excellent work to understand what's at stake in the debate over third use and what has occurred on the theological battlefield to date. Will benefit the church significantly.	2002-10-09

First, three meals served by some famous Parisians: Picasso, Brancusi and Man Ray.  Then there is what is my favorite, a section of specialist menus with recipes for such as \\"A Breezy Summer Dinner,\\" and thanksgiving.  These are special, just the think when one wants a coordianted menu without all the indiviudal fuss of finding and creating.  For example, the Summer Dinner was just outstanding, with Crabmeat, Apple and Mango Salad on cumin Apple Crisps, with Roasted Striped Bass with Chive and Sour Cream Sauce, Spicy Garlic Potatoes and Zucchini finished off magnific with Berry Puffs with Orange Muscat Sauce.<br />The layout and photos are first rate and so are the recipes.  Neat stuff in here, e.g. Butternut Squash and Hazlenut Lasagna, Ricotta and Candied Fruit Puddings, Pear and Hazlenut Frangipane Tart, Snow Peas, Portk and Cashed Stir-Fry, Spiced Roast Goose with Dried-Fruit Pan Sauce, Cornmeal Crusted SoftShell Crabs with Cilantro-Lime Tartar Sauce,Lamb and Eggplant Pastitstsio, and Pumpkin Chiffon Mousee with Gingersmnap Crust.<br />This book is not for the timid or shy cook, but for those who seek adventure in dining and cooking to really impress those tastebuds with adventurous, intensely flavored food, this book will be a most welcome addition to your collection.	2002-09-30

Amazing inner look at this huge, off-limits to most of us, major religious institution.<br />His analysis his thorough, he wants evidence that is credible.  He sifts out things well, and strings them together to make sense, or breaks up strings which won't hold together.<br />The stuff with the Vatican Bank and its director is shameful, and Cornwell discloses this with dignity, yet allows real inner struggles to be seen.<br />Worth the read.  His hypothesis of what occurred from his investigation is fascinating, and has all the signs and tastes of close to the truth.	2002-09-26

Rather, consistenly God deals with us through means of grace, all the time pointing ahead to the reality of Christ.<br />Divine redemption is thereby dominant to both Testaments, since Jesus and the apostles continally demonstrate they understand the typological method of interpretation.<br />Bible students will do well to read, ponder and apply the astute learnings of this book.	2002-09-16

Shows the development, passion and humanity that this man possessed.<br />The added timelines show that his development of the gourmet art coincided with other major breakthroughs.<br />Great tidbits such as the development of the aprix fixe meal, the ala carte way of organizing the restaurant, the origination of Peaches Melba.  His history is fascinating, with its interaction  with prominent people and wartimes.  What a great happening when German Emperor was told that the chef of your upcoming meal is none other than a former war prisoner from France who wants to poision you.  When asked about this by one of Emperor's officers inspecting the kitchen, Escoffier replies\\" \\"You may dine in peace.  If, one day, your country once again seeks war with France, and I am still able, I will do my duty.  But for the time being, you may relax and not let anything trouble your digestion.\\"<br />One is charmed to hear repeatedly of this man's concern for the less fortunate, the retired chefs with no pension, the senior citizens home he attended to, etc.<br />Great stuff, here.  Nothing boring, but fascinating, e.g. note that Ho Chi Minh was working in Escoffier's kitchen preparing vegetables in 1914. Asked why French are such powerhouses in gourmet world, Escoffier said among the reasons was the the people in each area had their specialties which they kept going, and great food at gatherings is relished and past on from generation to generation.<br />This covers a most influential man in gourmet history, during crucial world/Eurpoean events as well.<br />Great read.	2002-09-08

Jones concludes:  &quot;The God of the Bible locked in mortal combat for the souls of men with the goddess of revived pagainism--who would have imagined such a scenario in civilized, Christian America at the end of the twentieth century?&quot;<br />One only has to look at ELCA and other bodies, where the feminists have power gobbled up much, and seek more.  What they have eroded and distorted with their deceptions is traced in this well written, researched work.  It will serve many to contend for the faith without being contentious.	2002-09-06

You run with theses and seek expert opinions on them.<br />This Strobel does with the precision that were his trade: a journalist specializing in law, which he had the academic background to do.<br />He examines the skepticism against the LORD from nearly all perspectives, archaelogical, historical, medical, pshycholigical, Biblical, etc.  In each of them, an expert is sought to defend historic Christianity's position, with Strobel acting as investigator and cross-examiner.  With each topic and expert's answers, Strobel provides discussion questions as well as further reading lists.<br />This is rehash of arguments that have been made for quite some time, yet here Strobel places them on a level that most of the public can relate to.  He trys and succeeds at bringing sophisticated arguments down to laypeople terms, with illustrations that help present what's being discussed.<br />Above all, this work exposes the presuppositions which the skeptics all start with and cannot really defend.  As happened with Strobel and others (cf. Frank Morrison &quot;Who Moved the Stone&quot;), the evidence stacks up quickly in favor of the Biblical Jesus.<br />This can immensely aid the faithful in not only supplying them with objective looks at their faith, but also serve as resource to share with unbelievers.  Disagreeing wholeheartedly with &quot;preaching to the choir,&quot; anyone who &quot;claims&quot; to be intellectual and open-minded will take the time to read and refute these positions if they have the goods.  I don't think many of them will do either.  But we can try, and God will use this apologetic I'm certain with some of our friends, family and contacts.	2002-09-05

They don't keep open mind to other scholarly credentialed views which can make just as impressive a scholarly position as these, or maybe even refute such.<br />Written in early to mid twentieth century background, now interesting to view the author's certainty of evolution, while now most all of the supposed facuality of its model as been swept out from under it.  The fossil record is nonexistent and it is unable to solve many of the purely scientific problems which confront it.  Even its most adamant followers now state it on &quot;faith terms,&quot; i.e. no transitional proof, just big significant changes one has to believe occurred without any evidence.<br />The theological much that is expressed here of a liberal and neo-orthodox mindset has been exposed to be theologically backrupt now.  The Jesus Seminar, et al suppose that learned people will put all their spiritual stake in non-existent documents, with wild creative plots built upon their shaky suppositional foundatins.<br />Here, we see how one soul was deceived and caused to stumble.

This is an absolute gem, due to its tracing a person's theological journey.

He certainly has been down the roads that most of us don't ever take, and can only speculate what it would be like.

Ratzinger even acknowledges this in the included address given in honor of Cardinal Volk: &quot;If theology has to do primarily with God, if its ultimate and proper theme is not salvation history or Church or community but simply God,then it must think in philosophical terms.&quot;<br />Although philosophy to be sure has its place in the world of theology (apologetics and evangelism) it certainly is not to be central to theological formulation.  Church history is replete with the trainwrecks of faith that have flowed out of theologians majoring in philosophy.<br />The section where he debates the apolostolic church was one in this work which was rare in that it focused primarily on Scripture arguments rather than philosophical spins.<br />He certainly demonstrates an active and precise mind and writing style.  At times it is difficult to follow, given our differences in theological circles.  However, it must be said that his critiques of Luther are partial illumination of what the Reformer said, e.g. on church and where it could be found.  He does not clearly state Luther's central tenet that church is where the pure gospel is preached and the Sacraments administered according to the gospel.<br />His constant insistence upon tradition and succession becomes mute when only the persistent philosophical bents are offered as primary assurance.	2002-08-28

Strong characters of A.P. and Sarah and Eck and Maybelle, et al, form the nucleus of this formidiable foundational country/folk.<br />The ties with the likes of Atkins and Hank Williams and Elvis and Nitty Gritty, etc. are documented in such a unasuming and relaxed way that it seems as though you're there in their warm hospitality which they showed to all who came to Clinch Mountain.<br />The reader will surely take away fond stories, such as: Maybelle's panic to find instrument for June to play as approach Texas radio gig, writing chord changes on autoharp, June recalling Mom's admonition &quot;You will learn to play the autoharp this week;&quot;  or Cowboy Slim borrowing Maybelle's guitar, only to lose it in a poker game; to dreaded Al Gore Sr.'s singing.<br />Appreciated spiritualness of the Carter's.  Interesting point Zwonitzer makes on page 311: &quot;Sam Phillip's boys--Elvis, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Johnny Cash--were raised on gospel and country music.  .... But their hit songs were the yearnings of the flesh.  In fact, by the mid-fifties, everybody seemed to be sings about the scratching the big itch, and Maybelle's more indirect and innocent songs of woodland cottages and myrtle, dewy roses and heavenly light, were starting to feel a little dusty.&quot;<br />Author is real wordsmith.

Late Rome in Africa is so fascinating.  Never before has it been brought to me the significance and the breath of this, yet here Brown does truly make one thirst for more.  And I trust that this would be the highest compliment to his massive effort here, that one is stimulated for more of Augustine and his times.<br />Truly this should be read and judged by its intended scope, a history, a biography, not a theological or philosophical work.  He achieves his purpose convicncingly with what he had at the time.  Amazed at the continuity and yet slowly opening maze of issues, personalilities, and cultural developments that the author maintains, yet all the time revolving around the inner tensions and development of this amazing individual.<br />His background in Cicero and rhetoric served the church so well in his later years, as did his stints in Platonism and Manicheeism provide the necessary connects to his sigificant contributions to the spread of the early church and their bouts with Donatism, paganism and Pelagianism.<br />Certainly has awakened my appetite to further study into this great Christian.

Look at these pages for inspiration and fresh ideas, then make the dishes your own, either by substitutions we have offered or through the endless possibilities evoked by the foodstuffs themselves.\\"  Further, nearly all recipes include suggested substitutes, e.g. for the Asian=Glazed Wild Boar Chop he suggests pork, lamb or chicken.<br />Especially attractive to this reviewer is the enormous collection of game: from grouse to partidge to quail to antelope, buffalo, venison, et al.

Thus, the lonely way.<br />Confessional words from this studied church historian and exegete and ecumenist pour forth on observation of his own ecclesiastical scene as well as ours here in the States.<br />The opening essay is fascinating, since it entails Sasse's initial visit to America.  His comments are penetrating and analytical, e.g. \\"This churchliness of life has a down side to be sure: the secularization of the church.  ...  Tkhey have opened their doors in part to modern civilization, which has endangered the purity and depth of the faith.  Here is the reason for that superficiality of American church life which repulses us Germans.\\"  \\"The consequence of this, along with the concurrent leveling effect of American life, is an elimination of confessional anthitheses.  ....  All this has  created a common religious atmosphere, in which the confessional lines are blurred.  Thus fighting has been replaced by cooperation, one of the great American catchwords.\\"<br />Delivered in 1928, an essay on the church as body of Christ is yet another of Sasse's confessional themes, strongly confessing the Lutheran substance of sacramental presence of Christ:  \\"The church is the body of Christ, is identical with the body of Christ, which is really present in the Lord's Supper.  The participation in the body and blood of Christ present in the Lord's Supper is synonymous with membership in his body.\\"<br />Instructive thoughts and admonitions which provide more than ample reflective thought of their adaptation and input to current theological issues and ponderings.<br />A valuable resource for the church of the Reformation and those interested in listening in on this timeless saint of the Lord's literary output.timeless saint of the Lord's literary output.	2002-07-26

They just kept on insulted the country by rubbing our faces in their amoral, political agenda for fame and power.<br />As the author records one account, \\"On the very last day more criminals were liberated than at Bastille.\\"<br />Sad to have to see the conartists they are at work to liberate such as caught, convicted terrorists for the sake of political advantage.  That's all there is with these two--exploitation of everyone to achieve their goals, not the countries.<br />How dare them then spin it to make the conservatives look like uncompassionate, ruthless leaders.  These two will certainly go down in the annals of American government as poor examples of what America is about.<br />Articulately Olson shows the lengths the Clintons went to vent their anger on traditional values and institutions, when advancing their own liberal bents, delighting in mocking the office and even site of the centre of power and influence not only in our nation, but the world, The White House.<br />The connections with relatives and friends and financiers is all here, with enough tantalizing details and media accounts to force the reader to ponder the conscious of the Bill/Hillary team towards anything wholesome.<br />So descriptive of this is Bill's continuing need to be out in the spotlight, as an ego need and as a strategy to detract from other spotlights when they get close to unturning the truth.<br />This work will contribute to the mounting documentation of the saddest holdings of this nation's highest office.  What honor Olson and her husband Ted in contrast provide the country with, honor and dignity and a resolve to get the truth out.<br />Honored likely along with many others of this book to contribute to the scholarship fund in honor of Barbara's life.

One finds it in this read, the character and strength of this great amateur.<br />What impressed this reviewer was Jones' humbleness, and love for the game.  He wasn't really into all the winning, which in fact caused him anxiety.  Moreover he was into the challenge against Ole Man Par and himself.  He relished the comradre with his fellow competitors and is most quick to give them praise rather than discuss what he didn't have in his game that round.<br />Neat to realize that his prized trophy was the first, which he thought was improperly awarded to him, while Alexa Sterling should have won it, no question.  This is what golf is about, not slugging it 300+ yds. to screaming fans playing for millions.<br />Takes us back to what the game is and should remain.  It's become far too commercialized.<br />Will take a honored position in my growing golf book collection to be fondly recalled and reread.	2002-06-29

He questionaires they and their pastors as to the factors that led them to an active Christian faith life.<br />Surprising and valuable is the insight that they were attracted and joined churches which had the doctrine right and emphasized and taught this.  One of the troubling concerns here is the size of so-called &quot;non-denominational&quot; churches.  This is an oxymoron.  It is impossible to be &quot;non-denominational.&quot;  A denomination is a group of people gathered around a certain body of beliefs, doctrines of their Christian faith and practice.  We all know they certainly are repelled by organized denominations which are large and could be bureaucratic and stifling.  However, even it's only one small congregation, they are a denomination unto themselves, even if they choose never to bond with any other congregations.  They have to have a doctrine of church, ministry, sacraments, etc.  Even if they allow diversity on such, this is a doctrine in itself, therefore they are a denomination.  It's a farce to our language that this continues.  It's like calling someone a &quot;layminister.&quot;  You are either a layperson or a pastor, there is no mutation of the two.<br />There are several other troubling issues in this work.  First, he admirably refutes churches and pastors that have gone over the line towards marketing the faith, consumerism.  However, he also sides with those churches/pastors which are attempting to be Biblically loyal yet cognizant and responsive to the desires of the formerly unchurched in meeting their worship desires, etc.  He admits that he doesn't know where the line between these two positions should be.  That is unacceptable.  The Bible does provide guidelines and obervations here, e.g. let just a little yeast into the dough, and guess what will happen.  How much yeast?<br />Secondly, he identifies with leadership skills as valid, yet hedges along with the researched pastors that this is not the reason for the growth, but yet defines it as just that.  Look at John 6:41-68, especially Jesus' reaction to those who couldn't accept his speaking the Word truthfully when they exit the church. Talk about leadership?  There is far too much being laid these days on conflict management, leadership, etc. and not enough on Biblical preaching and teaching.<br />This book does a marvelous job (having already got my concerns off my back) with promoting back to what Bible stresses, Acts 6 for pastors!  I fully concur and resonate to this.  He admirably puts before the church further an attitude and passion for the lost, which no church/pastor can be without and be God pleasing!  There is much to be gained on this from this book.  I admire Ranier's passion and commitment.  Notice his pastoring multiple congregations in vacancy all while seminary serving as well.  Great lead by example!<br />This is valuable book for pastors and laypeople concerned with church Christ's way.

His sweep his broad and primarily deals specifically with the arts take and reaction to cultural shifts, looking in the macro sense at literature, art, drama, music, etc.<br />He has a penchant to focus on rather obscure historially speaking individuals whom the author feels typify the times and impacted them, e.g. Walter Bagehot of late nineteenth century times.<br />One of the few periods where I am well familiar, the Reformation, Barzun writes in a very biased and modernistic way, rather than paint the period disattached. For example, he incorrectly attributes &quot;consubstantiation&quot; to the Lutherans, and chides Luther for his views of inerrancy.  These and other errors made this reader wary of his writing into history much of his modern viewpoint, rather than reporting what happened.<br />His organizational flow of ideas was helpful.  His writing style is concise and vocabulary loaded (one will spend time in the dictionary with this one).<br />A work to reflect and check back on as one reads with specific periods.	2002-05-29

Olson has so much good to say: that Church Growth is not working and more importantly that it is not God's way of growing the church, as is modernity's approach not that either.<br />What he presents is return to being a traditional pastor with a twist.  The twist being trusting completely in being a means of grace pastor and then letting God build the church.<br />How well put.  Except, he doesn't really ever come clean about the inerrancy of God's Word and repeatedly seems to back female ordiation as Servants of this Word.<br />Nor, does he come right out and speak of sin and its defestation, nor the pure gospel as the only remedy.  Unless these means of grace put forward this pure healing balm, there is nothing.<br />Well serving as this book is by making pastors reflect on what their &quot;God-given&quot;task is and who they are accoutable to (and there is much good stuff on this), this book falls ultimately short in not clearly declaring a confession of faith that this reviewer can Amen.<br />Much to commend one's reading of this book.

These are certainly sincere, emotion filled testimoies of conversion from \\"Lutheranism\\" of various confessions to conversion to Roman Catholicism.<br />Since most are of a nature in this reviewers mind not representative of what a Lutheran confesses, believes and holds precious, it is simply the case that they have never been true Lutherans in confessing what the \\"catholic\\" church (captilization reviewer's on purpose\\") has sought precious since the apostles.<br />There is much naitivity among the authors of this book as to what the Confessions deal with so wonderfully, the differences between Luther and his followers and the church of Rome. It has not changed to this day. Truly open-minded, interested parties will seek out reliable works from both sides, e.g. Ratzinger, and their Catechism and the writeups on the Joint Declaration between ELCA and Rome. As well, they will check out such works as \\"Justification and Rome\\" by Robert Preus, as well as the reactions therein in my review listed which speak of the Rome/ELCA agreemeent.<br />Having several times heard our theologians interact with the like of Neuhaus, Avery Dulles and Cardinal Cassidy, I can see exactly why they are with Rome and I with Wittenberg. I believe in the Word of God, both incarnate in Christ and contained in the words of Scripture. As Luther said so well as Worms, \\"Although I have great respect for popes and councils, unless I am convinced from Scripture, I will not recant, I cannot recant for my conscience is bound to the Word of God. Here I stand, so help me God.\\"<br />Luther would not move unless shown only from God's Word. No one in Rome could show Luther and no one since has shown the world proof from Scripture only that all of their teachings are from God. Their only answer, as this book testifies: \\"Tradition plus Pope ex cathedra plus Scripture.\\"<br />Certainly, the uneasiness about abortion, marriage, etc. should give more in ELCA's midst to contemplate where theire church is going. In this realm, however, what about the current scandal of allowing the molestation of young men by Priests, condoned by Cardinals? Corruption certainly will always be in Christ's church as well as in the world. What will never change, though, is the church tied to the pure Gospel!<br />Saint Paul even takes on Saint Peter on this matter! Galatians 2 shows that this great apostle would not extend the hand of fellowship with the likes of James and John if what Christ had taught him directly was not the same.<br />Fellowship by canon law and popery simply will not cut it in the sixteenth nor the twenty-first centuries, for Christ's sheep, for they listen only to the voice of THe Good Shepherd.<br />Amazing to me is that in my interactions with common Roman Catholic priests, they are totally uninformed about my theology. None of them I know have read even a little of Luther let alone our contemporary writers. I and most other Lutheran pastors I interact with, have studied RC theologians, to test our faith and see what is coming out of Rome.<br />Inadequate, dangerous testimony if allowed to stand unchallenged by its claims. Read more, test the spirits.his realm, however, what about the current scandal of allowing the molestation of young men by Priests, condoned by Cardinals?

I don't konow why I shuld feel hopeful after playing dreadfully for thirteen holes and now facing the most comfounding hole on the course. That's golf.  That's a golfer.&quot;<br />Such charming writing about what every golfer that I know has ever played speaks of Dornoch, it is the essence of Donald Ross and links golf and everything the game is about.<br />What the season life at Dornoch gives Rubenstein he also passes on, the Clearances and the plight of this people of pipes and drams and links and books.

To this I concur and endorse these enthusiastic apologists of the first class.<br />However, to suggest that the culture dominated by secular, deceived thinking can be countered with apologetics is naive and unbiblical to this reviewers way of confession.  However, to be sure we cannot nor must be be discouraged to continue apologetics to the unbelieving world, but our sites must only be as &quot;a minfield&quot; clearing exercise that the Gospel might be heard in its purity.  Prophecy predicts what we are seeing, both in and outside the visible church, e.g. 2 Tim. 4 and those who refuse to follow true doctrine and find and establish false teachers who tickle their ears.  This has always been in the church of Christ and world, but we who are of the body of Christ are to be aware of this, test the spirits and develop discernment through constant time in God's Word (Heb. 5).  When all the dust settles on theological debate within the visible church, true confession of the faith handed down can be the only practice that counts!<br />Thus, I commend this excellent collection of concise, precise apologetics with this mild comment.  There is much here to chew on, pass on, e.g. &quot;Christian apologetics that's worthy of the name is a call to martyrdom--perhaps not a martyrdom where we spill our blood (although this too may be required) but a martyrdom where we witness to the truth without being concerned about our careers, political correctness, the current fashion or toeing the party line.&quot;  &quot;Indeed, we have permitted the collective thought of the world to be controlled by ideas that prevent Christianity from being regarded as anything but a harmless delusion.  It needs to be emphasized that we, the Christians, the church of Jesus Christ, have done this.&quot;  &quot;One we thoroughly understand a false idea, we need no longer be intimidated by it.&quot;  &quot;The Christian apologist is a contender for the faith, not merely a seeker after truth.&quot;the name is a call to martyrdom--perhaps not a martyrdom where we spill our blood (although this too may be required) but a martyrdom where we witness to the truth without being concerned about our careers, political correctness, the current fashion or toeing the party line.&quot;   &quot;Indeed, we have permitted the collective thought of the world to be controlled by ideas that prevent Christianity from being regarded as anything but a harmless delusion.

This book on the KJV is surely in that vein that we have come to expect out of this profound author.<br />Beginning with the Reformation and Luther's desire to provide the Scriptures into the people's hands and language (actually inheritance of John Hus), McGrath historically paints the movement of the Bible into English via Wycliffe, Tyndale, Coverdale, and Grafton. Fascinating stuff to be sure.<br />Matthews' Bible to The Great Bible to the Geneva Bible, the transitions and history thereof make fascinating reading, and McGrath's writing aids and keeps the reader's interest.<br />To get to KJV one becomes embroiled in politics, here the politics of the monarachy.  This explains this translations beginning, and likely is a major contributor to its success to this day.  As McGrath documents, even the goals of the translators were political in nature, not to deviate from previous translations unless they had to.  Interesting that they really wanted to \\"update\\" the language, especially away from \\"Thee and Thou's\\", but couldn't because they were bound to the translation rules handed down to them.<br />When many today speak of the need to maintain such language as \\"holy\\" wording more reverent than other pronouns, McGrath shows that this was not the case for the very translators themselves:  \\"By the sixteenth century, the use of the singular form to address a single individual had virtually ceased in English, except in the specific case of family and inferiors.  To address another as \\"thou\\" was thus to claim social superiority over him or her.\\"  \\"A careful study of the court records of the northern English city of Durham suggests that \\"you\\" had replaced \\"thou\\" as the normal form of address in spoken English by about 1575.\\"  \\"As is well known, the King James Bible retains the use of \\"thou\\" to refer to God, a human being, or even the devil.\\"<br />For modern Christians to insist that \\"Thou\\" and \\"thee\\" are more respectful titles for God, McGrath rejects on two points: (1) same forms used indiscrimately in early 16thC England; (2) usage if anything is derogatory.<br />McGrath shows convincingly that even the translators believed that it was \\"a translation\\" and not the final translation; that the Greek manuscripts were not the oldest nor best; that the Hebrew needed much improvement; that the meanings changed so drastically that at many points, the average reader today, let alone fifty years ago, has no clue sometimes what is being meant, e.g. as McGrath illustrates with KJV 1 Th.4:15  \\"For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.\\"<br />To be sure, this work details the enhancement to the English language development contributed by KJV and Shakespeare, and its spread in American Christianity.<br />This well written, fairly balanced work, presents the history of this remarkable translation with clarity and style.d \\"thee\\" are more respectful titles for God, McGrath rejects on two points: (1) same forms used indiscrimately in early 16thC England; (2) usage if anything is derogatory.<br />McGrath shows convincingly that even the translators believed that it was \\"a translation\\" and not the final translation; that the Greek manuscripts were not the oldest nor best; that the Hebrew needed much improvement; that the meanings changed so drastically that at many points, the average reader today, let alone fifty years ago, has no clue sometimes what is being meant, e.g. as McGrath illustrates with KJV 1 Th.4:15  \\"For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.\\"<br />To be sure, this work details the enhancement to the English language development contributed by KJV and Shakespeare, and its spread in American Christianity.<br />This well written, fairly balanced work, presents the history of this remarkable translation with clarity and style.	2002-04-10

The views on abortion are slanted towards pro-choice, however most of the time seeks to present a balanced opinion.<br />One of my areas of interest is an example of such balance, the area of informed consent,e.g. &quot;We distort the larger issues of human research when we absolutize either side of the question-means or ends, present or future, individual or society.  There is undeniable truth on both sides.  We are on better ground if we pose the question in terms of responsibility.  The researcher is responsible to the welfare of the subjects of the experiment.  Their free humanity cannot be violated without impunity. The researcher is also responsible for the welfare of the larger society. There is potential harm in not doing research as well as risks of doing it.  Beyond these affirmations, we who attempt to perceive the world through Christian lenses affirm our responsibility to God.&quot;	2002-04-05

Here they do an admirable job, providing historical background and some contemporary assessment.  However, what I continually see the work falling short on is where to go from here. This is so typical of our time, seeing the yeast multiplying and taking over more and more of the dough, however little suggestion of how to isolate, surgically remove, etc.<br />In a church environmnet that is all the things shown in this fine collection (individualistic, pluralistic, relativistic, postmodern, etc.), there will have to be concord in some confession of theology, not in more respected academia or focused seminaries.<br />Churches and their confessional bodies are where the trenches are where the spiritual wars are being lost and won.  Many of those who see themselves as generals and strategists don't know exactly the daily pressures the trench fighters go through, nor provide even recognition of what resources and assistance they can provide.  The dumbing down of the faith is rolling.  To just acknowledge pros and cons on all sides, and then leave it there is tragedy.<br />This book leaves it there.  Well done, but tragic in its void of what will aid the church.	2002-04-05

He defends the proposition that logic must be valid because its denial is self-defeating.  On the otherside, he rejected the idea that theism could be deductively proved.  Therefore, he challenges Thomism's belief of a deductive approach, and finds that it cannot be validly proved.<br />Natural knowledge of God's existence doesn't take a person very far, not far enough.  Thus, he centers on an evidentialist, experiential approach. Here he latches onto systematic consitency, the lack of internal contradiction coupled with external agreement in one's experience.<br />He proposed in other works and this that one's apologetic approach should mirror the times, as he stated: &quot;an apologist must play it by ear.&quot;	2002-04-04

Included are selections by Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Tertullian, Origen, Athanasius, Augustine, Anselm, Aquinas, Calvin, Butler and Paley.<br />If one has not been exposed to these famous apologists, this book will handsomely serve this purpose.<br />There is a well done Bibliographical essay on the Apologetics Scene in the 19th and 20th centuries by the author.<br />This is a valuable resource in the Christian apologist's resource library.	2002-04-04

It is a true fine application of Law/Gospel, while doing it in a way that can only garner the attention of the unbeliever at the least.<br />One will profit from the usefulness of this set which seeks and contributes to taking the Gospel to the world in which we live.	2002-04-02

This text serves many as an intro into the field.<br />Geisler is a Thomist in his approach as an Evangelical Protestant.  He first builds a test for truth claims, then applies each worldview (philosophy) to this criteria.  Then, having shown theism to be true, he presents evidence for its claims.<br />Primarily does Geisler rely upon the tests of unaffirmability for a false worldview, and undeniability for a true worldview.<br />When moving on from theism to its competing worldviews (Judaism, Islam, etc.) Geisler abandons the previous tests and uses rather \\"systematic consistency.\\"<br />For this reviewer's apologetics, Geisler cides too much on the reason side.  I prefer more of a classical approach, particularly William Lane Criag.	2002-04-02

This book will have a cherished place, because it's such an honest, insightfully written epic of an average golfer who finds out what the upper reaches of the sport are all about.<br />Finding myself playing to much the same level of the author, I knew enough from being around some mid-level echelon golfers that one dedicated year to try and crack this game would not be enough.  One would have to start much earlier than that and want it far worse.<br />JP is a neat guy, one that many of us would enjoy so much treading around the links trying to keep each other playing our best, but enjoying whatever we're given that day in this humbling game.<br />JP is pro league writer, and his ability to transmit what was happening inside is not only articulate and entertaining, but it to this reviewer is so admirable, not trying to embellish or spin to portray the disappointing results any different than their raw numbers.<br />I'll take away from this great read some unforgettable remembrances ... promoter Buddy's unplayable lie invention, the Skill-O-Meter analysis, the MJ incident with failure by one shot, etc.  Great stuff for us who love this game and collect incidents like this for the 19th.	2002-03-27

If not Buick, then Pontiac, and so on.  Here, applied to sociological categories of every 19 year grouping, if don't like Builder's way of doing the faith, try Boomer's. If not Boomer's, then Gen X.  Put these all together under one roof, one modified name to make all happy and one leader, and you have their solution:  TriGen Church.<br />Rather than bridge generation gaps which have always been around and were bridged with putting oneself and one's own desires and needs subservient to Christ's, this GM approach is offered to bring the Burger King &quot;have it your way&quot; church, but do it together to have economic and sociologic scale gains under one united, generation combining effort.<br />Sounds good enough to Builders, Boomers and GenXer's (who buy into what sociology and market research finds from trend and interview research), but is it Biblical?<br />This reviewer finds it terribly the opposite.  Christ wants all to be one under His leadership.  He gives undershepherds (pastors) Ephesians 4 to be His Servants of the Word to make this happen gathering around the precious means of grace, Word and Sacraments.  This drives it all!<br />Why change what God wants done?  Well, the answer comes back.  The people, a sizeable number of them reject this.  Of course, and His Word predicts an increasing number will as we near the end.<br />This book ignores the Biblical mandate for faithful preaching and teaching and pastoral leadership, and inherits worldly ways of coping with serious spiritual maladies.	2002-03-21

He is a good writer, able to express himself imaginatively and with a nice, tight style.  Evidence in support of his current call to preaching professorship at Duke.  This chronicle provides compassionate journey to loving the people and the realization that many seminarians have unrealistic expectations of themselves, their first call, and what it means to be an undershepherd of The Good Shepherd.  I especially am fond and can relate to his sayings some small churches of the Lutheran fellowship, the chain saw massacre of his parsonage trees and the saying: \\"country people never pay a professional to do expertly what they can do recklessly for nothing.\\"  (I believe this applies to certain congregational leaders irrespective of confessional assoication or congregational size) The heart the Lord gives him for hurting, needy people is well documented and important component of a servant of the Lord.<br />However, now for the negative spiritual direction of Lisher which is severe to this reviewer.  Having read his excellent work on MLK Jr.'s preaching, I was drawn to this work to sense Lisher's theology, since he doesn't really critique MLK Jr. in the way that any Lutheran would.  He gives quick evidence in this work that he either never truly believed as a Lutheran, or that he became frustrated with the true, narrow way and fell away.  One can understand this mainly because of his theological pedigree.  He was at the sem when he became purposeively infiltrated by \\"pseudo-Lutherans\\" who had a game plan to take over the church and take it into the modern era.  Cheap shots in my opinion are shot about the Sem walkout, when there is absolutely no proof that it concerned what Lischer argued with his cong. pres, \\"women's ordination.\\"  Further against all Lutheran theology is his blatant admission that he really didn't cling to faith in the gospel, but in some sociological community idea.  What a shambles these frustrated Lutherans try and make of incarnational, sacramental theology. Luther clearly sides on doctrine over life, but not Lisher, who at this time in his ministry claimed to be Lutheran. It's a sham and a shame!<br />One must appreciate the delightful writing style and remicising with a new pastor, accompanying him on calls and counseling and interaction with layleaders and leaving for a new call.

Ph. 3:13; Rev. 22:11; 1 Cor. 10:12; Ecclus. 18:7; 1 Cor. 8:2.<br />Briggs, an Anglican priest, mines Luther across his years as he comes to grips with the gospel and its rich, multi-faceted interconnected majesty.  He senses well the potential minefields if one tries and corner or simplify Luther (or Scripture for that matter).<br />Especially does this book reveal the &quot;present tense&quot; of baptism as Luther came to see it, and the unyielding hold Luther had on God's chosen locatedness in the means of grace, never allowing the Word and water to be separated.  Nor would he allow the church's boundaries to be firmly etched based on baptism nor to make visible the inner circle of those who return again and again to their &quot;trysting point&quot; in baptism, as this Englishman likes to speak of it.<br />This work is rich and thorough.  One to read and re-read.  Before I comment more on this wonderful discovery of a read, I shall do the same.<br />One will come away from this with a greater appreciation of the depth and conscience boundness of the Great Reformer to Scripture.

What transforming values have plagued us, as Specter laments:  \\"And so it came to pass that the impeachment of Clinton established the political standard that a president, however errant, would remain in office unless he had lost the confidence of the American people that he could perform his official duties.  History will not say that president was not guilty, although he as entitled to acquittal because the charges were not proved in a Senate trial, but historians will reject William Jefferson Clinton's brazen contention that it was all Republican politics and a right-wing conspiracy.  For me it was just one more investigation.  As I had argued to question Jacqueline Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, so, too, I sought the testimony of the key witnesses and Bill Clinton.  As I had thoroughly questioned Robert Bork and Anita Hill, so, too, I sought more thorough examinations of Sidney Blementhal and others.  I was diappointed in the Senate's failure to the American people in the trila as my father was in not receiving his war bonus from the Congress.\\"<br />Although I do not agree with some of Specter's cherished convictions, I do admire him greatly and believe he represents the wholesome, dedicated public servant which youth of this great nation can pattern themselves after.

On top of this, there is just an outstanding section on how to communicate with one's butcher, be it from a supermarket or specialty butcher store.  Also, pictures on given on each cut so that one can know what you're looking for when shopping.<br />The recipe sections are by cut, and they are plentiful and very creative.  I would not describe the majority as requiring the \\"too hard to find ingredients or techniques that are difficult.\\"  These are unique, solid recipes, such as the ones tried so far:  a Basil-Crusted Meat Loaf with Brandy, Walnuts and Spicy Wine Tomato Sauce (this is superb, and makes heavenly sandwiches);Lazy Sunday Pot Roast with Caraway and Green Apples; Fennel-Crusted Flank Steak with Orange=Black Olive Relish and  Spicy Mint Honey;Grill-Roasted Bone-In Leg of Lamb with Grilled Peaches and Red Onion-Cilantro Salsa;Hoisin-Glazed Grilled Pork Blade Chopes with Spicy Korean Vegetables.<br />What is unique also is that with each recipe there is included: \\"Other Names,\\"  \\"Other Cuts You Can Use,\\" \\"ButcherSpeak\\" and my favorite: \\"Cook Once,Eat Twice\\" which provides advice on the delicious leftovers.<br />This is so well thought out, researched and presented.  On top of all this, the recipes are so creative and excellent and turn out as listed.  Not every recipe has a color photo, although there is a sufficient number of color shots in the middle insert.<br />Just the best resource on these meats I have found.  All chefs really into it will enjoy using this reference.	2002-02-26
1644717:US	52476938	R97H007I2CC3X	0028631528	994081622	Fish: The Complete Guide to Buying and Cooking	Books	5	46	47	N	N	Wealth of Info on Over 70 kinds of Fish/Seafood	A plethora of useful info on the subject, well written.  It begins with what all of chefs speak strongly on the subject, the ability to purchase fish with confidence.  I especially enjoy his admittance that he too as many of us approach our fishmonger with the question, &quot;what's fresh today?&quot; to be answered, &quot;everything!&quot;  He provides great insights and helps to aid in discussion with our fishmonger or even some tips on packaged fish.  Further, he gives what I think is the best advice on how to store and freeze fish.<br />The recipes come with the caveat that there will be no &quot;marinated shrimp wrapped in ham over a red-peppercorn passion-fruit sauce, etc.&quot; recipes.  These recipes are just plain designed to bring the best out in the individual fish/seafood being served.  One must not think than that it's just a question of bake, saute, fry.  Here one will find technique and accompaniments targeted for each fish/seafood.  One can easily experience after trying several that this guy has did his homework, combining elements which allow the fish at hand to truly shine forth with all its flavor.  For example, one fish that my monger seems to have fresh in abundance, Porgy, Bittman offers in a chowder like version, &quot;Cotriade: Fish and Potato Stew,&quot; comibing bacon, onion and thyme in a great combo.  Consider also what he does with Sea Bass, &quot;Crispy Sea Bass with Garlic-Ginger Sauce.&quot;  This is a knockout dish, expertly offered crispy in shallow bath of vegetable oil, covered with sauce flavored marvelously with ginger to make the bass sing!<br />His shellfish recipes are just as delicious and rightly paired. Outstanding also is buying tips on each species in addition to possible fish substitutes for most recipes.<br />The only drawback for us in the Great Lakes is an absence of the great fish we have here, especially the Lake Whitefish,although there are recipes here which will work.	2002-02-22

It's a world that not many of us experience in the magnitude and charm that this delightfully done cookbook brings. The format is rich with words and photos which endure the context of the desserts in their cultural setting. There is much text on the pages, but the font is bold and clear enough that the interested can easily read, and even read to the elderly who would like to hear of this delightful European tradition of Vienna, Budapest and Prague.<br />The infamous strudel is here, along with additional categories of tarts and puddings and dumplings, all done in the tradition, nothing reductionist or fused with modernity.<br />I'm caught by this tradition and will continue to tread my way through this, delighting in such discoveries as: Farmer's Cheese and Strawberry Dumplings; Gerbeaud; Berry Meringue Slices; and these two have become favorites: Dobos Torte and Walnut Torte with Walnut-Custard Buttercream.<br />These are rich dishes and an equally rich presentation in this cookbook. I will continue to treasure the exploration of this great cuisine, and most who like to create great desserts will too. For the discriminating cook/baker.	2002-02-22

From Boston Baked Beans to Coq Au Vin, this has the recipes we all enjoy.<br />Receiving this one free is likely the only way I would have this in my collection.  I have others that I turn to for more inspiration on American cooking, such as Sheila Lukens &quot;USA Cooking&quot; which is exceptional, or James Beard's &quot;American Cooking.&quot;<br />This is not worthless or poorly done, it is just too bland for my tastes, such as a simple Meat Loaf with the ketschup smeared on the top.  Many will gravitate to this food, so to each his own meatloaf.	2002-02-22
1648563:US	52476938	R2LZZI8T0E80HW	0140183884	652475340	The Man Who Was Thursday: A Nightmare (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)	Books	5	3	5	N	Y	&quot;A Question of a Sub-title&quot;	One living in an age of pessimism writes a maddening but captivating tale of pessimism raining down, but small drops of hope intersperse, providing possible double meanings eventually only to languish.<br />Chesterton as is pointed out in his work cited at the end, claims the book to be about the sub-title: &quot;A Nightmare.&quot;<br />Truly an epic book of complexity and twists and turns.  Captivates though as it mixes Biblical imagery with political activism of the intensest nature.<br />An Anarchist Council surrounds the plot, with increasing characters who fill the screen and cause the thoughtful to ponder, only to find each new introduced scene shifting the whole to a new level.<br />Is this meant to inform or entertain?  You be the judge, but this reviewer thinks both.	2002-02-19
1649244:US	52476938	R2745HZMP9MQHH	094557584X	272043762	Party Receipts from the Charleston Junior League: Hors D'Oeuvres, Savories, Sweets	Books	4	7	10	N	N	A True Party Assistant	This is geared towards party recipes--- from drinks to demitast soup to finger deserts to all kinds of dips and snack mixes.<br />Many will find here the ole reliables, and as I can determine, just about all of them--from Party Mix fame to Wassail to many ways of serving crab and shrimp dip.<br />I particularly am attracted to the unusual, and there is plenty of that here.  I enjoy such as Escargots A La San Diego, Goat Cheese Tortillas, and Papaya Stuffed with Curried Crab.<br />This will assist those looking for some easy but delicious things to serve the party guests that will bring raves.	2002-02-19
1651252:US	52476938	R262ADBHA8D1S6	0684846004	224080330	The Cases That Haunt Us	Books	4	3	4	N	Y	Fascinating Read	I don't typically read this kind of work, but picking it up at a real bargain price, it looked interesting, given all the media attention this renown profiler receives.<br />His analysis of this collection of unsolved mystery murders showcases his analytical abilities, honed over years of work.  He primarily spends a great deal of time on two key areas:  context of area in which crime committed and victomology.<br />From Jack the Ripper to JonBenet Ramsey, he applies all that years of working the toughest cases has brought to him.<br />One that fascinated me the most was the one I knew the least, the Lindbergh kidnapping.  The missing chisel, the removed flooring, all this pointing to the convicted one.  Also, that Gen. Schwartzkopf's relative was involved.<br />These cases do hold our yearning to solve mystery, especially that where justice is sought and all can see if their hunches play out.	2002-02-17
1654723:US	52476938	R2APCUMEI0YCWL	0226039595	450774910	Hole in Our Soul: The Loss of Beauty and Meaning in American Popular Music	Books	4	13	22	N	Y	Excellent, Detailed Overview of American Pop Music	This would easily have risen to the level of five stars if the author would have confined the sometimes long-winded writing of historic ties and examples to the endnotes for the serious reader who wants to delve deep, and highlighted her main views in the text.  Thus, the four stars.<br />She makes excellent points.  The heritage of American popular music is jazz, blues, country and gospel.  These had serious musical abilities and a sensibility which ungirded and monitored them.<br />Then came art school and the perverse modernism's entry.  It again took away what the African-American slice of the American pie had contributed so wonderfully and turned it into something which severely disconnected it from its past.  That's where the debate must center.  Do we want and need to disconnect?  And the hope for our future of popular music, can we reconnect?<br />There seems to be hope.  What with all the interest in jazz and big band sound, etc.<br />This is well written, well argued and well documented.  It suffers from being at moments high browish, written by a big-city critic.  However, if doggedly pursued as this reader did (took me over six months to finish), there is much to be gained.<br />Those serious in pursuing historic roads of popular music and its possible myths, will find no better source than here.	2002-02-14
1663784:US	52476938	R3SYQXFLL3L7SQ	0525946292	100746834	How to Quit Golf: A Twelve-Step Program	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Tongue in Cheek Look at a Passionate Game	Places this game from Scotland in the light of twelve step addiction programs.  Highlights the borderline addict (at least) in everyone of us passionate about this great game.  Why do we continue to toruture ourselves?  This fun book delves into this, poking fun as would a standup comedian in a nightclub would take shots at the audience.<br />I teetered on this one--from two to four starts, likely because the book itself surges from good to average or slightly below.  Reaching its high pint in chapter five, it then descends into the kind of cheap, over exaggerated category of humor we have come to in our times.  Sex oriented with reference after reference to different items and people that I became saturated with this.  Much of the talk about club throwing, gimmick helps, etc. seemed like they could easily have come out of a brainstorming session by a high school golf team holed up in the clubhouse waiting out a rain.<br />Sprinkled in the high-point chapters however are some great one-liners, e.g. \\"Golf if like a sting operation, setting you up at every turn.\\"<br />Enjoyed more the creative side of books such as: Flatbellies, Enchanted Clubs, the Greatest Golfer who Never Lived and A Mulligan for Bobby Jobe.	2002-02-07

Kotler summarizes this field which is wide and becoming wider.  In cogent, succint style, this book takes the marketing executive, student or executive who has to deal with marketers through where the field has been, where it is today and where it is heading.'<br />This is well done.  Examples from real world are included (not much hypothetical, classroom or research stuff included) with great questions to ask yourself at the end of each chapter to probe deeper into the topic.  Additional references are provided for those who wish to utitlize the concept further.<br />I find Kotler very easy to read and follow.  The approach here presented is right on!  There is a warehouse of great lines that can propel one's marketing, e.g. \\"If companies focus only on their costs, they will never grow to greatness. Without a top line, there will be no bottom line.\\"  or  \\"The way to beat your competitors is to attack yourself first.\\"  \\"Finally, customers don't want promotion; they want two-way communication.\\"<br />This is a gem of a book to mine for info or to put into practice.  Likely those not familiar at all with the field will gain much from reading, while those engaged will find this work extremely practical, productive, clarifying and motivating.  Not only does he point out trends and weaknesses and opportunities, but in most cases, provides real practitioners and examples, plus optional opportunities.	2002-01-31

Call it familiarity or rythym but it works as this skilled wordsmith weaves a captivating story (at least for this reviewer) about a man who seemed destined to use and abuse.<br />Back to roots.  To the sea.  Remote place.  Proulx is into that kind of place.  Out of the way, Wyoming, Newfoundland.  Ranching and shipping.  Makes it come to life.  Family lines found and disturbing of piratcy and home yanking across frozen ice.<br />Fascinating end.  Community delight.  All seems right again with main character.  Come home. Found home.  Good for him, and Wavey and offspring of Petal.  Enjoyed time at the sea with vivid characters.  Now understand Pulitzer for Annie.  Agree with their choice.  Remarkable story.	2002-01-30

This is great resource to help.<br />Having sought our at times just these goals, this book has always delivered.  For instance, winter squash blaws? Try Winter Squash Creme Brulee or or Spaghetti Squash Tetrazzini.  Amazingly is the richness of flavor in a parsnip based dish called Pike's Peak Souffle.<br />Just examples to wet your interest to find and try this.  Over 450 recipes, each clearly detailed to follow.  Not exceptional ingredients of the hard to find category.  From Artichokes to Zucchini, this is handy reference to follow.<br />If chance, pick up his volume, one of my favorite cookbooks, Bert Greene's Kitchen Bouquets.  He's a great cook and writer!	2002-01-30

Indicative of the stuff you'll love finding here and trying.<br />Also a plus to this delight is notes which accompany most all of the recipes that tell about alternatives, serving suggestions, history where the dish came from, etc.  Adds zest for us foodphiles!<br />One can easily see why so many other reviewers have raved about this -- it enticed me to try it.

Passed on was Kitty's love for the people and their food.<br />What attracts me and just might you also is the seductive use of fragrant spices, herbs and dried fruit in wonderful, delectable dishes such as:  Stuffed Meatballs with Dried Sweet Onion Sauce, Tangine of Chicken with Preserved Lemons and Artichoke Hearts, Briouats of Shrimp and Chinese Rice Vermicelli, Chicken B'stilla (the best! cinammon laced chicken filling in razor thin pastry, here made of phyllo), or the Spiced Tomato and Honey Coulis, or the Sweet Cinnamon Couscous with Dried Fruit.<br />Worth the inclusion into the venturesome gourmet's repoirtoire.  A delight to thumb through and to cook from.	2002-01-28

Having just gotten it finally, it is truly an amazing cook who has put this together.  The creativity, polish and sensitivity to taste, presentation and perfection is all here in spades!<br />The only ones possibly who come close to this level:  Trotter, maybe Nobu.  Here unmistakenly is clearly a fine-tuned chef who has refined his art to strong, rarified levels.  One who likes to eat and cook such is left in awe just leafing through this.<br />What amazes and fascinates and I can't wait to put to the cooking test is such as: Macaroni and Cheese (with Lobster and Mascarpone enriched Orzo; Roquefort Trifle!  Strawberry Sorbet Shortcakes.  The ordinary made outrageously vibrant!<br />The layout is so pleasing to work with:  much white space on each page with small typeface but justified on the page just right to read and work with easily.

Well representative of the cuisines and done with helpful hints on each.<br />A workhorse for the cook willing to use it to branch out and experiement in these formative areas of food history.  For openers, try Spareribs with Black Beans and Pepper Sauce, Halvah Cake or the Seafood Risotto.<br />My humble opinion is that Roman cooking is slighted out of the three.  See Malto Mario for some great Rome recipes.	2002-01-24

His passion for desiring that we all grow in our abilities to hear and understand the music we love to listen to comes forth easily from his writing.<br />I received many useful bits of info to aid the depth and breath of my music listening adventures.  His point that this type of help is necessary to charting the waters of more complicated musical styles is appreciated.  His emphasis on styles recognition was good, and challenging.  Because they blend and ebb and flow between each other and then there is that modern category which delights in casting off any resemblance to anything.<br />I will have this guide with me to puruse when listening, and it will make a valuable resource contribution.<br />I wish there was more of a practical slant at times, such as what I find with a concurrent book I'm using: Listening To Music, by Wright which fills in the blanks for me at many turns, due to his clear definitions and examples accompanied by CD's.  Copland's work is supplemented by listening suggestions.	2002-01-18

Her accomplishments in a short life are dazzling.  Like many others naturally gifted with athleticism and a burning desire to compete and win, Babe did just that.<br />This is well written, but suffers from my own perspective with an underlying desire to document how cruel and unmodern Babe's cultural times were to not allow lesbian relationships to be openly exposed and women to be subjected to conformity.<br />We live in just the reversal, where abnormality shines brightly as acceptable or even desirable, and where has this sexual revolution gotten our society?<br />Babe loved the game of golf, and my interest was primarily in this achievement area of her career.  She should deserve more recognition as one of the game's truly greats!	2002-01-12

All these fascinating and relevant sources for the Confessions were out of print, or never published in English before.<br />As now involved in teaching class on the Formula, fascinated by the Leipzig Interim and Chemnitz' &quot;Judgment on Certain Controversies.&quot;  He states things so plainly and is not politically correct at all, e.g. &quot;it is of utmost importance to establish what limits are to constitute the defining elements of this harmony.  Often in the church not only princes and political advisors, but even theologians have sought harmony on the basis of human judgment which led people away from the purity of the Gospel.  Therefore, it is necessary in the church that the rule for such harmony be the Word of God.&quot;<br />Wingert's translation of Luther's catechetical material as well as Melanchthon's Disputation, The Catalog of Testominies, Luther's sermon on descent into hell, and the Saxon Visitation ARticles of 1592.<br />This is great collection of wealth of background info which we Reformation students will sink our theological teeth into and be well rewarded, having greater perspective on the Confessions.<br />Translated by renown group of Lutheran scholars.  Highly recommended.	2002-01-05

It's source is one of the world's renown chefs and the cuisine shall we say is one that most of us don't have access to (all of the exotic seafood: eels, abalone, etc. and sushi).<br />However, there are many dishes which one with access to fresh, high quality seafood and basic chef skills can achieve some success with.  I've had raves over the Grilled Scallops with Tabbouleh Salsa as well as Baked Monkfish Medley with Tosa-Zu and the Lobster Salad with Spicy Lemon Dressing, Green Tea Parfait.<br />High level cooking with fusion of Japanese and other cuisines.

It is in-between.  There are simplistic contents on technique, sources, ingredients, getting started, etc., which the beginner on up in cooking experience utilize to prepare great menus.<br />There are sophisticated recipes that the intermediate cook can sink their teeth into, e.g. Chicken Satlimbocca or Grilled West Indies Spice-Rubbed Chicken Breast with Grilled Banana.  Sides are concentrated entrees brimming with flavor, great for beginner to intermediate: Bell Peppers Stuffed with Couscous, or Eggplant Caponata.<br />Receiving this as a gift, I likely would not have purchased this for myself, as there are just more cookbooks I'm into having.  However, I defintitely would give this as a gift to cooking friends who fall in the beginner to intermediate level.  There are recipes here for all.  Well done.

1713744:US	52476938	RI8I7M0920ES4	019511132X	298911654	The Preacher King: Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Word that Moved America	Books	5	10	27	N	Y	Excellent Evaluation of King's Preaching &amp; Theology	One can easily see why this book was awarded the Outstanding Book of 1995 by the Religious Speech Communication Assoc., it is so well written.  The research appears exhaustive, the writer is is firm touch with his subject matter, having poured over sermon manuscripts and listened to tape after tape, and conducted interview upon interview.<br />One is able to grasp the essence of King's preaching from this reading.  Long suspecting that King comes out of the liberal element in the church, this confirmed that suspiscion.  The theology and subsequent preaching is far from what my confession would maintain as Biblical.  This is social gospel, theology not from heaven down, but earth up, trying to impose its agenda upon God, rather than letting His word and plan of salvation have its way.<br />While one can easily relate to the race problems and frustrations with an American that would not listen to the pleas, but an America that responded violently, there remains no cause to make the precious Gospel a political one.  Jesus had attempts to preach such freedom from political oppression, but in each and every instance, He maintained the gospel at the level it is intended, spiritual.<br />King thus is out of sync with his namesake, Martin Luther, as well as the historic Christian church.  The gospel is about the forgiveness of sins for the life everlasting.  As the famous hymn sings:  &quot;What is the World to Me?&quot;<br />This book is vibrant with the complexities of the background and influences on King's theology and preaching.  Enjoyed it, yet sad that the title &quot;preacher&quot; is applied to such a false teacher of God's Word.  To apply humanity's agenda above and beyond God's is the height of sin and rebellion.	2001-12-31

Most of the recipe collection is basic, healthy stuff that one has already seen, but nonetheless it is good stuff.  Doesn't truly excite one to cook often or much less, use for a major gourmet performance, but solid in its own right.<br />Thus far, enjoyed dishes such as Veal Scaloppine with Fennel and Orange, Southwestern Shrimp and Snapper Stew.	2001-12-28

A story better be awfully good, to be 35 cents a page!<br />I don't believe this book accomplishes that.  To be sure, it is a warm and touching story of non-competition for the fun and community and comradeship of it.  This is to be applauded and passed on.  But one wanders, especially this reviewer, if for this most precious time of the year, one's thoughts (even Mitford's and especially Fr. Tim's) should be focused more on nativity scenes and not winter wonderland scenes.<br />There certainly is nothing offensive in this work.  But 23 pages for the price?  One thinks the marketing with Hallmark is over-dominant here.<br />Having thoroughly enjoyed Karon's previous works in this series, this was a letdown.  She can do better.	2001-12-18

I look forward to delving more into her approach.  What has been attempted to date has delivered what promised:  rich food that is healthy:  Seared Lamb with Moroccan Spices and Tomato Jam, Country Terrine with Pistachios, Risotto with Red Wine, Rosemary, and Champagne Grapes, Upside-Down Red Wine-Pear Tart, Chocolate  Mousee Cake.<br />Broad is the scope of this work, laced with Charts (e.g. one of the best detailed I've seen on rice and grains) and Sections on Rubs and Essences and Marinades.  It is exhaustive and well laid out, with pleasing type font that is easy to read and pleasant to the eye.  Also covered are techniques, glossary, index, and sources listing.<br />A resource that will be used repeatedly to try out this new flavorful way to cook.

Here he explores such efforts as the Coptic, Georgian, Sogdian and Nubian Versions.<br />Amazing is the fact that before movable type in printing, there were only 33 languages with any Bible translated.  In the 19th century alone, over 400 languages received Bible translations.<br />Then he goes in depth into English translations, with especially attention given to the King James of 1611 fame, and those that preceded and influenced it so greatly.  This fact is typically forgotten or severely deemphasized by the &quot;King James Only&quot; crowd.  Witness this extraordianty statement:  &quot;It (Tyndale's) became, in fact, a foundation for all subsequent efforts of revision, so much so that 30 percent or more of the English Bible down through the Revised Versions has been estimated to be his in those portions of the Bible on which he had worked with such skill and devotion.&quot;<br />Metzger writes with the simplicity, clarity and passion coming from an authority who has worked with Biblical translation during his life.  He simplifies, clarifies, and presents his esteemed opinions with grace and support.<br />This book will help the serious Bible student to understand more realistically the problems presented to the translator of Scriptures from the original languages.<br />Highly recommmended to all who want to understand the breath, depth and critique of English Bible translations.	2001-12-12

He has studied and researched them, but more importantly, he has lived with and loved them.  Here he pours forth on what one must consider one of his favorites, cats.  He's had much personal experience, and has investigated the subject thoroughly, and thus has much to offer.<br />One can learn much about cats from this read.  For example, I never knew that kittens were atricocious at birth, their eyes and ears are shut.  Also, Caras' theory about cats and dogs finding their way home by sensing magnetic fields is utterly fascinating, and could be true.<br />Curiosity and the cat is intriguing.  Sensing the info a cat must accumulate and act upon instantly for safety and survival seems relevant.  Caras shares the size ratio issue as basis for this.  Made me think about the first time our 8 lb. cat saw our 120 lb. Great Pyrenees.  Ran and hid for days, only later to become the dog's best and trusted friend.  The ratio here is 15 times greater for the dog.  Consider how the cat then sees me; 22 times bigger, similar to my viewing a creature that was 22 times heavier than me, or around two tons!  What a creature to watch and observe, to know when to scramble for my life so the thing wouldn't crush me, and know its moods thoroughly.<br />A great read for cat lovers.	2001-12-07

It further predicted the focus then on terrorism.  The question is: Why didn't they take it so serious back then, become more aggressive?<br />Me thinks, it's the change in leadership.<br />The main point he makes is this:  &quot;Carlos the Jackab and Abu Nidal were essentially fighting for a place at the table.  They wanted recognition for their movement, they wanted recognition for their demands, whereas Osama bin Laden and Ramzi Yousef . . . want to punish and destroy, they're not looking for a place at the table--they want to destroy the table.&quot;  (pg. 265)<br />Fascinating look into this complex, perlexing evil upon the world.	2001-11-19

Further, he is able with a succinct, tight writing style capsualize the salient conclusions and insights he wants to present.<br />Taking his clues from discovery of sociologist Sorokin, he guides our tour through history using large systems of cultural change, breaking them down into Ideational phases (interest in things spiritual) and Sensate phases (interest in things material, of the senses).<br />The author sees our society and history as in Transition from a declining Sensate time to an increasing Ideational phase.  The Church of Christ should rejoice?  Not quite yet, as Baue so accurately portrays, this is not all good news that some put it forward to be.  Yes, increased interest in things spiritual, but not in the most healthy, true spiritual sense.<br />The main thesis put forward is his clever coining of this new phase as the &quot;Therian Age,&quot; using the greek word &quot;there&quot; for the beast of Revelation who portrays himself as love but turns out to punish the real love of God shown and believed in His church.<br />Baue has clearly shown that postmodernism is not the enemy now.  Past that, the world is entering a spiritual age, but a dangerous one in which everything is tolerated enthusiastically, except for the true spiritual entity, Christ's holy and apostolic church.<br />Encouragement and hope are expressed, with tempered prognosis and well thought out responses suggessted.<br />Could well be a &quot;break through&quot; book!  Fascinating reading to be continually reflected upon and considered by God's set apart people!	2001-11-12

These choices and the writing on each one is limited, as this effort does not define itself as total in its coverage, but does provide scholarly, informative broad coverage.<br />Features include a compiled index which goes beyond the 314, and each entry provides a &quot;Further Reading&quot; section as well.<br />Testing the meeting of its goals and objectives with this reviewer's own theological confession (Lutheranism), I find its entrees to be well done, sweeping with proper emphases and tensions illuminated.  Inclusion of the works on Luther, Melanchthon and Chemnitz are illustrative of the sought after scope of this fine effort.<br />I look forward to using this has a handy resource to find one's historical bearings and then proceed further with its recommendations for further probe.	2001-11-05

Aspiring amateur gourmet that I am, one just can't cook like one desires each evening.  And one tires of carryout, fastfood, and microwave entrees.<br />Thus, my purchase of this book, being already an avid Cooking Light subscriber and fond user.<br />This book delivers what it references --- few ingredients and fast prep and cooking time.  It goes further to meet my demands that it also be innovative and attractive food!<br />Things like Fruited Moroccan Chicken with Curried Couscous with walnuts, or Creamy Chicken-Spinach Soup, Pork Chops with Dijon Cream Sauce, and the Lamb Chops with Minted Sour Cream Sauce are great recipes to try and put in one's standard repertoire.<br />The Mix and Match Recipe section with its salads and side dishes along with desserts is so neat and useful feature!<br />The layout with large format and color photos are helpful, but makes one salivate to cook more of these recipes. This is healthy, great, quick food which doesn't have to take back seat on appearance or taste.	2001-10-30

This truly is an enjoyable, well-done, interest captivating book by one of my and most of America's heroes.<br />He writes concisely and passionately like he delivered the news.  He evokes trust and enthusiasm for what he talks about, here his life and career in broadcasting, both of which I enjoyed immensely.<br />Amazing life and the stories that go with being around the news and newsmakers as they happen.  Especially enjoyed the story of what Walter describes as &quot;the world's first aerial hijacking&quot; which he plays a role in the capture of the perpetrator. Also memorable was the story in Holland of the people there having disassembled a teletyper prior to the German occupation, which they subsequently reassembled, allowing Cronkite to be back on-line quicker than others.<br />Especially was I touched with his childhoold experiences, both the incident with his father and the other drugstore delivery boy who was killed for racial reasons.  This shows the ugliness of our past, which we as Americans should be ashamed and help to rectify in our lifetime.<br />The story of the war started by whale flatulentions is fascinating, as well as the not publized comment by astronaut Wally Schirra perched upon the Mercury flight and thinking to himself:  &quot;Good God, just think, this thing was built by the lowest bidder.&quot;<br />His critique of television and news is fascinating reality of behind the scenes.  His honesty and passion for the purity of the news is admirable and why America trusted him like no other, except maybe for some of the upcoming Fox News reporters.<br />His career will be remembered for the Kennedy assasination, the moon landing and NASA early launces, the Vietnam war and other major news events.  Thank you Walter for all those precious moments that &quot;we were there&quot; with you.  Thank you for this great read!	2001-10-26

Too much is made out of etymology.  Sometimes it is useful, but more to the point is how it is utilized by the Biblical writers.<br />I find his textual criticism to be in line with what I learned and practice.  Although much of this might be cumbersome and discouraging to the layperson, a intro acquaintance with the subject has proven itself useful to my parishoners.<br />Seminarians/Pastors likely will gravitate on to more substantial works on the subject.  I would suggest calling the sem bookstores to check out what the profs are having the students read for Hermeneutics class:  old volumes we used included Mickelsen and Terry, and likely Voelz contribution &quot;What Does This Mean?&quot; will be instructive to the modern exegete as well.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-10-24

He correctly surmises that America has a powerful affect on the religions that immigrants brought with them.<br />Thus, the theme of this work is, in this transition from former Judaism to American Judaism, &quot;Why this, not that?&quot;<br />He then expands this thesis to analyze individual versus family versus synagouge.  How individuals and groups negotiate between what the books tell them and what they choose to believe and practice is the valuable contribution this small book makes.<br />He provides an analogy with American Catholics, who believe they are &quot;Good Roman Catholics&quot; yet do not adhere to all the Pope and their church officially states they should believe and practice.<br />Neusner finds many use the filter of relevancy and urgency used among American Judaism.<br />The ties passed down from generations passed through rites and rituals (especially Passover seder) are touched on at length and provide according to his analysis valuable and necessary identifying historical ties with their ancestors.<br />This is such a fascinating and valuable read for all who want to peer into American Judaism.  His conclusions are remarkable and telling about what American culture so persuasive to pattern all after some of its stronger components, e.g. &quot;In Judaism today, that magic does not work, and the whole is not more, but less, than the sum of the parts.  When holy Israel assembles in North America, a different Judaism takes over.&quot; ... &quot;Religion however is understood in Protestant North America as something private and interior, individual and subjective: how I feel all by myself, not what I do with other people.  Religion is something you believe, all by yourself, not something you do with other people.&quot;<br />How telling and unfortunate that Judaism as most other &quot;imported&quot; religious beliefs has lost its strength as a communal, unified body.  Much would be gained if this was gained again. Much will continue to be lost given this individualism et al continues.ined if this was gained again. Much will continue to be lost given this individualism et al continues.	2001-10-24

Tiger will not only be one of the game's greatest players, but also one of the game's greatest students!  From his coach to his competitors to observers, he is known as one so passionate about the sport that he studies, refines and experiments with what is best for him.<br />This is an exceptional production -- large in format, with wonderful photos and drawings and aids to communicate visually the teaching point Tiger is getting across.  It works!  For example, see the neat grip guesser visual on putting pressure.  Many of us amateurs don't even begin to think about grrip pressure, especially with the blade.<br />The section on the head game is superb!  Tiger's strength is here and there is such good advice and an abundance of it.<br />I'm just starting to mine this top-notch resource which we've all been excited to have from Tiger.  From that captivating, genuine smile on the cover through each page, we will find much to import into our golf games.<br />Play away!	2001-10-23

The note quoted from the Bible said: &quot;He that honors Me, I will honor.&quot;  This could be the epiphetat for Liddell's life and this great book.<br />Born of Scottish Missionaries to China, Liddell learns to live away from family at an early age.  He survives and thrives on athletics, humility, and his faith in Christ.  These all continue to grow and develop.  While most would claim his Olympic fame of resisting competition on the Sabbath, certainly Eric would always hold to his service as missionary to China, where his earthly life is taken.  As the confessional church body I am proud to serve within takes great interest in education of the young, so did Liddell, who said:  &quot;It is very hard to build up a church for people who have no literature, where 80% are illiterate.  The educationalist must follow on with the evangelist.&quot;<br />One of Eric's university profs said it well of him:  &quot;Eric never made you feel he was being holy or superior.  He just showed you the better thing to do, and everyone wanted to do it.&quot;<br />Super read of one of the churches and athletics great heroes.  Good reference to young!	2001-10-23

He does an inadequate job this reviewer feels of providing info to dialogue with Muslims in a winsome way.  To this end, see &quot;Answering Islam&quot; by N.

I am nuts about mangos, they are one of my favorites, besides pineapple, cashews, and all fruits.<br />I've been awaiting this offering from &quot;The Great&quot; series published by TenSpeed Press, who have to be one of the greatest culinary publishers of our times.  Their books are so well done, and this by Chef Susser is no exception.<br />It has fine photos of all the mango types, how to buy and store them, and recipes for their utilization.<br />Of special note from the recipes are such as: Mango Frappe (a delicious iced mango drink of Grand Mariner, lime, honey, ice cream and mangos), Crab and Mango Salad (pictured in gorgeous stack fashion), Lamb Chops with Dried Mango and Ginger, and one that is to die for:  Roast Pork Loin with Mango Mojo and Yellow Plantains.  His dessert creativity is exceptional, with such scrumptuous offerings as Mango, Banana and Pistachio Strudel, Mango Sour Cream Crumb Cake, and Country Mango Tarts.  This section certainly is strong, and many will turn to it as a sure source of raves from dessert partakers.<br />A section on all kinds of condiments, salsa to ketchup to vinegar,etc. all with mangos.  What an exceptional fruit, both in its fragrance, taste and visual appeal.  When balanced with hot, spicy, this is a gourmet building block that is substantial as Susser so ably provides in this wonderful addition to mango lovers everywhere.	2001-10-16

Such as Charles Ryrie try and deny this, saying that Darby's dispensational scheme has never really been adopted, e.g. by Scofield.  However, what is import here is not Darby's dispensational scheme, but rather his hermeneutic, that of literal Israel and the NT church as the &quot;great parenthesis.&quot;<br />Bass correctly shows how premill dispensationalism has followed Darby's lead in this system which pervades their Biblical interpretation.  Even one such as Ryrie, acknowledges that Bass' historical development is correct, he just doesn't agree with Bass' conclusions.<br />This is excellent little book.	2001-10-13

I believe this unfair, given the caliber of individuals who study and believe in this eschatology, e.g. Ryrie, Chafer, etc.  Although I personally do not buy into their eschatology nor hermeneutics, I cannot concur with Boyer by suggesting that only simple minded will buy into it.<br />Without this critique, this work would have been a five.  It is a valuable, well-documented source for end times history and currents within popular American culture.	2001-10-13

Begins with unique photos, which are series of culinary shots that tell a story.  They are delightful and so fun.<br />The recipes are powerful in their intense flavor, minimalist approach and creativity, both in new recipes and adaptations of famous, such as the Chicken Saltimbocca, which switches away from the veal, and adds cheese-egg-flour batter.<br />Also, knocked out by such as Grilled Lobster with Bruschetta Sauce and Indian &quot;Bouillabaisse.&quot;  For openers sure to hit the mark as favorites, try Suppli al Telefono, cheese filled rice balls or the Eggplant Meatballs.  Dessert which combines two of my fettishes so exquisitely, Blueberry-Lemon Meringue Pie.<br />This is what I would rate a medium complexity cookbook in terms of skill level, and the ingredients are not too exotic to find.  The book is supplemented with great instructions.  Would have enjoyed photos of serving suggestions, but this in no way detracts from this work of the highest class!  This one will continue to bless cooks who put its charm and class to use in their kitchens!	2001-10-09

It added some trepidation about a forecasted letdown.<br />The forecast appeared to be true for awhile, in fact for the first 99 pages.  Then, with the letter Father Tim wrote to Cynthia delivered by his dog, I was captivated again by this witty, wordsmith and creator of the Mitford life which so many have found refreshing reading.<br />Touching is the sentiments expressed here, the sudden shift of their jitters about marriage, shifting from Tim to Cynthia.  Further, her love of his being glad in his own skin is truly a characteristic more should seek in themselves, mates and friends.<br />The getting locked in the bathroom with the broken knob was a suprise twist (actually, this happened to me recently locked behind a second story stairwell, when the knob broke off in my wife's hand, and forced the door to be kicked down so I could attend the Voters' Meeting already late for.)<br />She is so apt and tying in on the preparation and thoughts of key Mitford characters before and during the wedding service.  Loved Uncle Billy thinking of whether to have his ham with or without mustard!<br />This again is superb literature in my estimation and is certainly up to the level and regard I'm use to from the author.  Looking forward to her future offerings.	2001-09-20

Each word and quote is well selected in a dense, tight-knit but easy flowing manner, illustrated with delightful snipits of all kinds of topics being discussed, from moles to mountain climbing to furniture to art.<br />The intent is to provide advise from five great thinkers (Socrates, Epicurus, Seneca, Nietzsche, Schopenhauer and Montaigne) on five common tensions: unpopularity, not having enough money, frustration, inadequacy, a broken heart and difficulties.<br />Interesting that the Christian Bible addresses these issues and more, and even addresses several of the philosophies addressed in this work (see 1 Corinthians 1:17;3:22,23; 4:3-5; 6:12; 7:3-5;and Proverbs 1.<br />Fascinating read for those searching for guidance, but this reviewer will trust more reliable and experienced source in the revelation of the One True God.	2001-09-19

Fields.<br />I have no problems as others with a hidden course being a possibility.  It fits perfectly with Jones' desire for privacy and Roberts' power.  Perfect place, on a military base, on ocean frontage.  Easily could be preserved by the games' best as their own private refuge.<br />The author's style is very comfortable, yet classy.  No foul language which litters much of the other golf fiction and leaves a foul taste in my mouth even for well written golf plots otherwise.<br />Besides a great read, there is I believe very good golf philosophy handed out, e.g. &quot;Ya' see, lad, it's not 'bout how ya' swing, but whre ya' put the ball.  That's what made Mr. Jones so great.  Ya' never heard anyone say that a particular course favored Mr. Jones or was well-suited for his game.  He studied every course he played to figure out the best way to play each hole.  Mr. Hogan was the same way.&quot;	2001-09-19

Schroeder has the ability to bring difficult concepts to words graspable.<br />However, after reading his theory of reconciling science with the Old Testament, it remains less than persuasive to me. I relate with this Kirkus Review comment: &quot;Though respectful of both science and faith, this book is unlikely to convince either scientist or theologian.&quot;<br />Far more able to speak on the theological level, I find many of his interpretations manipulated to his own cause, e.g. Gen. 1:12 which he interprets: &quot;and the earth brought forth life.&quot; A more reliable interpretation of the text renders: &quot;and the earth(or land) brought forth vegetation.&quot; Further, he cites no credible Hebrew scholar who agrees with his interpretation of day for order and night for chaos.  He relies much more for his case on the mystical kabbalah, especially Nahmanides, which can only be explained at best as &quot;opinion.&quot; This leaves him in positions which do not square with all of inspired Scripture.<br />Science as well will not accept all of Schroeder's thinking. With a fossil record so sparse and incomplete, it seems very tenuous to draw the conclusions that he makes with any assurance. As one writer put it, &quot;What we need are more compotent fossils. We have enough compotent anthopologists.&quot; When one realizes the move from a fragment of a jaw to what the skull and skeleton looked like, it decreases any confidence in the decisiveness which these scientists make. The press relays this as scientific fact, rather than the reality of opinion which it is in fact. There is no fossil or Biblical evidence for preadamites. This is only a modern version of the Gap Theory continuted to be played out cloaked with this physics idea of differing time.<br />For the exact opposite view of Schroeder's key thesis: clocks ticking faster at the center and slow at the edge of the cosmos--- see D. Russell Humphreys book &quot;Starlight and Time.&quot; Humphreys even contends he has communicated with Schroeder and other physicists and no one has refuted his scientific computations which seriously challenges Schroeder's.<br />However, I much appreciate the fact that a scientist finds the historical evolutionary argument to be untenable scientifically as well as Biblically.

I admired him much for the talent, but did not care for his behavior. Flay is the McEnroe of Gourmet. He has enormous talents for mixing sweet and sour, hot and cool, colors and textures and ingredients to make wonderful dishes. Another one of his talents is that the recipes are not the most complex nor involved, however they are of the essence and his techniques sure are solid and in some cases, innovative.<br />He is stuck on himself. However, I truly like his cooking and use his recipes from the Food Network often. That was the motivation for buying this book. I'm not disappointed. There are such a magnificent variety here: Turkey Burgers Filled with Brie and Grilled Granny Smith Apple Slices, he's a genius with Quesadillas, here Barbecued Chicken with Grilled tomato salsa and buttermilk dressing, and the Red Snapper Grilled with Corn Husks with Roasted Jalapeno-Lime Butter is just superb! Also, unbelievable combo is Grilled Sea Scallop Ceviche or the Tarragon-Marinated Lamb Chops with Pineapple-Pecan Relish.<br />Grilled Radichhio and Goat Cheese Salad with a Balsamic-Honey Glaze is fabulous side dish as well as the Toasted Israeli Couscous Salad with Grilled Summer Vegetables.<br />His desserts and drinks are wonderful section, you can't go wrong with these to make hit.

Such is Keegan and this fine book. Needing to have some more grounding in WW1, I selected this book. I was not let down. His informative style shows beyond doubt that he has researched and culled the data down into manageable chucks which then hedelivers with a smooth style which keeps your attention. Informed the reader will be after hearing how the gears of several nations and individuals within those nations started down the path to major conflict which could have been avoided. This of course escalates into the stalemate of trench warfare and attritrition. Particularly fascinating is the interplay between the use of technology of the times, leadership and morale. The decline of the French and Russian armies at the last and the entry of American troops as well is enlightening. This is a good read if one truly is interested in obtaining a background into the global taking of so many young lives. Provided are good bibliographies of interested areas and he certainly makes the case for follow-up on several interesting aspects and individuals.	2001-08-28

Besides is tried and true recipe and instructions for perfect margaritas.  Real margaritas are not the fluffed up fruity flavors that describe something more from the carnival than an authentic Mexican cocktail.<br />Included is interesting tidbits about the history of the drink as well as other tequilla based drinks as well.

The main culprits that have allowed community to be eroded out of the American scene are individualism, consumerism and isolationism/independence.<br />The solution they discovered from among &quot;community&quot; doers exhibited a given set of characteristics (fifteen in all) which can be organized into three central foci:  common purpose, common possessions and common place.<br />The stickler here is that this necessitates being countercultural.<br />Frazee outlines one way how this idea of Christian community could be played out in a congregational setting.  He must be credited with not being dogmatic about his ideas or thoughts on implementation, e.g. &quot;I openly confess that this is not an all-or-nothing proposition.  ...  In my estimation, the application of any of the characteristics of community will dynamically enhance the life of your congregation.&quot;  This is exceedingly well said and is the premium reading this book provides.<br />A Biblical study of NT fellowship and unity, i.e. koinonia will garner much more emphasis around the God given means of grace, Word and Sacraments.  As this is where the Lord is to call, nourish and lead His people, this should be far more the emphasis than programmatic organizational schemes.  For this to happen as the Good Shepherd proclaims, He gives the church &quot;the called and ordained servants of the Word&quot; which Frazee downplays severly (pg. 233).<br />Christ's body should rejoice as this reader for this fine work which addresses many of the inherent faults with church growth up till now.  His diagnosis of the need for more common creed, etc. are commendable.  Get's one truly thinking about what should be at the core of &quot;church,&quot; i.e. community.	2001-08-07

The opportunities along with the obstacles are well documented and discussed using many angles and viewpoints.<br />There are many nuggets to be mined and prayed over with Biblical discernment.  A random sample:  &quot;Americans face constant temptations to pass over the wisdom of the ancients in favor of the guru of the month.&quot;  &quot;The interest in spirituality in itself, ...  is not an unalloyed cuase for rejoicing.  But it provides a starting place for conversation.&quot;  &quot;God may be bringing a faitful remant into deeper levels of discipleship that will enable them to endure in a culture that for all its spirituality seems to become post- or even anti-Christian.&quot; &quot;More is needed than urgent words; postmoderns insist on authenticity; faith sharing must grow out of a larger life and witness.  Its claims to truth must be buttressed with a changed life, with an experienced and personally felt faith.&quot;<br />I found this read to be an important one is the continuing look at trends and movements.

Again, as it seems to be, not all Christian views are presented.<br />Certainly, we who hold the Lutheran confession would side with Nash, who easily out of the three represented does the most exemplary job of using God's Word correctly.  Nash is correct in his chastisement of his two opponents for not lack of good exegesis of the Bible.  It is truly sad but commonplace to find such poor, hurried exegeis as exemplified by Sanders and Fackre.<br />It would have been good to have one argue:  univesal grace, grace alone, the means of grace, and the mystery of why some saved and others not?  This would have given the complete Biblical picture.  This is not demonstrated by any of the three in this book.<br />However, as exemplary as Nash is with his defense of restrictivism by not only showing the proper exegesis and hermeneutic of the other two sides, he has some glaring weaknesses himself.  As those of the Reformed are bent to do, they always want to let logic and reason dominate, rather than letting God's Word suffice.<br />Or as Luther would say, &quot;What is not spoken of in God's Word must be left to the heavenly academy for resolution.&quot;  We do not have all the answers to all mysteries in God's Word!&quot;  As Moses said so profoundly on his deathbed, &quot;The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our sons forever.&quot;  (Deut. 29:29)<br />Nash suffers, as Sanders catches him, on Double Predestination.  Calvinists cannot say that Christ died for all, but only for the elect.  This is the classic error of Calvin.  As well, they hedge the truth of God's Scriptures of the Real Presence in the Sacrament.  Sanders does not confess the B.C. Means of Grace as St. Paul does in 1 Cor. 10:1-11, that Christ was present with them, but most did not have faith and were disallowed into Promised Land.  This typology extends throughout OT, allowing OT saints the same (Romans 4) as we NT saints, faith in Promised Messiah (Christ).<br />However, to deny infant sin (Age of Accountability) that Nash puts forth is unbiblical (Ps. 51:5)  Furthermore, Nash is wise to attack inclusivism on premise that grace is with all until rejection of Christ and Gospel, and he shows forth Biblical attack to destory this false teaching.<br />Nash certainly is far and away the more faithful Biblical presenter, aside from the errors already identified.  Further, he does not profess Christ's descent into hell as for what it was:  Christ's victorious announcement of victory over the demon angels, nor is he correct is declaring Luke 16:19ff as being a parable.  It does not necessarily have to be interpreted as parabolic, see Art Just's Commentary, Volume II, pg. 630ff.<br />Cudos to Nash for calling the other two's hand for not showing the Biblical evidence for their positions, while discounting his opponents Biblical proofs and offering restrictivist passages, Nash has provided the debate with the sure foundation of what God says about this controversial topic.ed into Promised Land.

Especially must they contend that God saves some by general revelation.  Their whole case hinges on that fact.  While never revealing what in general revelation God uses to save, Sanders errors greatly by finding two classes, one in the OT and the other NT to show how he believes those who trust in the God with the level of revelation given, they will be saved.  These are the examples of faulty exegesis on Sanders part.  The OT believers who are saved, e.g. Abraham, as Paul states believed not in the general revelation given by God to all sinners but to the special revelation (typology) promises of the Messiah.  This is the OT means of grace.<br />For further dialogue on this topic, check out &quot;What About Those Who Have Never Heard?&quot; by Gackre, Nash and Sanders, and see my review of this book.	2001-07-12

It does this by carefully challenging the previous conclusions of the churching of America, i.e. Ahlstrom et al.<br />Starting with Colonial times, it reviews the quantitative analysis and the qualitative conclusions as well.  It determined that much beginning from these times on has been distorted by bias and not using the best census material available.<br />They deduce that successful church movements base their focus on otherworldliness, starting out thus as sects which grow.  The tendency however is to eventually make minor concessions to the culture, thus shifting the emphasis away from what gave them success, high tension with their culture towards lowered levels.  This cyclical pattern they have found repeated over and over, the sects becoming churches thereby giving birth to new sects that revitalize the church and grow.<br />The pattern begins with the upstart Baptists and Methodists outgrowing the established Congregationalists, etc.  Then themselves, especially the Methodists losing their dominant position to new groups.<br />Their conclusions are fascinating, disputing much of the established findings of scholarly American Christian history.  Rather than finding the changes in churched American as attributable to sudden cultural/societal glitches, rather the authors find &quot;a long, slow and consistent increase in religious participation form 1776 to 1926--with the rate inching up slightly after 1926 and then hovering near 60 percent.  Second, they conclude that the primary factor is what they term &quot;the sect-church process&quot; (roughly sketched out above) in supporting the progress in America.<br />The future?  They place confidence in humans as &quot;rational beings, not puppets enslaved to the strings of history and always have the capacity to choose.&quot;  Their surveys and literature they use suggest that American will continue to want and find or start movements which maximize otherworld rewards sufficient to inspire sacrifice.<br />One must remember this is sociology speaking, not theology.  Theology of the best kind tells of God's unfolding plan of salvation (heilsgesitche) which will occur exactly as God has planned.  True faith, belief and membership in this salvation is His doing through His church, where His Word and Sacraments are truly spoken and distributed.nt to inspire sacrifice.<br />One must remember this is sociology speaking, not theology.

This is a compilation of his books spanning his career thus far on the topic of management.<br />Drucker is always tight in his style and words with thoughts that at first make one sit up and take notice.<br />The first chapter sets the tone for the rest.  This quote says it all:  &quot;Actually, waht is our business? is almost always a difficult question and the right answer is usually anything but obvious.  The answer to the question, What is our business? is the first responsibility of top management.  That business purpose and business mission are so rarely given adequate thought is perhaps the single most important cause of business frustration and business failure.&quot;<br />To his vast experience and knowledge, it is so refreshing to here him denounce profitability as a myth for the purpose of any business.  He calls it irrelevant.  Of the highest relevancy for Drucker are two basic functions: makerting and innovation.<br />Hurray, say all the marketing types!  Wish the top management could join in the understanding.<br />Drucker's views are wide open to reality searching with broad vision over the world panorama.  This book is exceptional collection of some of Drucker's best writing.  Well chosen for their punch and coverage of such a vital, modern topic as management, this book will serve practioners as well as those who desire an understanding of the topic.	2001-06-30

His passion for the game and his collection of data and its distribution is contagious.  He shares this regularly on the Golf Channel and his schools, and now here in book form.<br />Here is almost 400 pages which he admits is like giving the notebook of all his experience studying, analyzing, researching and compending what he has gleaned about this most vital part of the game.<br />Great stuff on grips and stance and swing and equipment.  Significant to golfers is his research on break.  What we see in our heads about break is not what is actually there.<br />The sections &quot;Develop Your Artistic Senses (Fee, Touch, Green-Reading)&quot; and &quot;Face Your Special Problems&quot; I find particularly revelatory for my game.<br />There is so much in this massive tome on the subject.

Reminiscing about these seven cats in her life all but transports the reader to GoWell (her home in the country) and the life she enjoys there with her dogs and cats and friends.<br />The heart she displays and articulates about her relationships with these seven are enjoyable to read, and the cat lover and/or owner can relate to the various emotions:  the pain of losing, the thrill of discovery and growth.<br />Howeve, I must admit that this book would have easily been a five if she left it as this&quot; &quot;Seven Cats.&quot;  She chose to allow this to become a commentary on living. That's where I humbly beg to differ, due to our different orientations of worldview.  What I believe in is that all wonderful creatures (cats included) come from The Magnificent Creator God.  I love his creatures and our cat Molly is one of our favorites.  However, much as we love Molly and our two Shelties, we love the One who made them and us, and regard our relationship with Him as more important.  God truly wants us to be good stewards of His creation, including cats and dogs.  (Sidenote: I also take exception with her preference for cats over dogs.  Dogs want to please their ownders far more than cats, and one can do much more activities with the dogs.)<br />Life brings with it many toils and troubles, as Jo relates.  So where do we turn for help and relief and understanding and hope? I don't think we'll find the answer in our cats, as much as we cat lovers love them passionately.  My suggestion is to turn to the One who gave us such remarkable gifts.  Psychology and all the self-help advice in the world will not fill the void that only our Creator-Redeemer God can.<br />Jesus warned us not to turn inward into self or to nature (Matthew 24:24-26) but to Him who loved us and gave Himself on the cross us.<br />For those who share Coudert's search for truth, or see every path the same to truth, then this part of this well=written book will not bother.  For those of the Christian-Judeo heritage who confess the First Commandment to be the highest, then this portion will not speak of the true art of living which we learn from in the Book of Life, the Holy Scriptures.

He didn't come from country club family. Italian immigrants, he changed his name&quot;Saraceni&quot; eventually to Sarazen.  Great story about initial caddy experience, where he didn't even know about the tee (which the caddy was supposed to take care of.)<br />From his infamous double eage at Augusta to his touching story with the elderly caddy Daniels and their win at The British, this book is jammed packed with golf told through the eyes of a man who played alongside the like of Vardon, Cotton, Armour, Snead, Hogan and Hagen, among others.<br />What a fascinating insight into not only this wonderful champion and his life and development, but the development of the game so many of us receive such great enjoyment from ourselves.<br />Golfing lost a true champion when Gene departed several years ago. Classy man.	2001-06-24

Finally, due to historical circumstances which Wengert documents and presents articulately, Luther introduced his own, which clarified the argument in Philip's favor with his infamous, &quot;we should fear, love and trust&quot; as well as focus on the Decalog and its significant place in the Word's proclamation.<br />Wengert is to be highly commended on this excellent down work.  It exhibits the highest in scholarship and research, presented in organized way to follow the debate's development with all its subtle sidebars and backgrounds.<br />Students of the Reformation will be well served by the study of this work.  There is a great deal of Latin and German which remains untranslated.  However, main points of his developing argument are not greatly affected.  It is questionable how the layperson who holds no knowledge of the Confessions nor their background material would have much interest or skill in following this fascinating historical chapter.	2001-06-22

Here, he takes a rather different path than his other writings, a short, consise presentation of the search and fulfillment of spiritual wanderings.<br />He begins with that emptiness, that meaninglessness that thrives in the soul of each human.  In essence, he begins with the natural knowledge of God, cf. Romans 1 and 2 (natural knowledge of God in creation and conscience) and then moves to supernatural knowledge of God through the Word Incarnate, Jesus Christ.<br />This book is beautifully done, with clean layout and sidebars of quotes, photos and artistic prints gracing the pages.<br />What McGrath chose to omit needs to be included.  How does this knowledge of Christ and all His benefits to be received by the individual?<br />While the Calvinist and others struggle with this answer, the Bible declares this saving knowledge of the crucified comes through the gospel in the Word and Holy Sacraments.  I resonate more to Senkbeil's excellent approach to this in the first forty pages of &quot;Dying to Live: The Power of Forgiveness,&quot; and in Gene Veith's &quot;The Spirituality of the Cross.&quot;  Both provide the one searching for spirituality to be confronted with the true knowedgle of God proclaimed to them in the church's holy means of grace.<br />McGrath's fine book, although lacking a clear step from the natural knowledge to supernatural without speaking of God's means, is still a fine work which will benefit its readers.	2001-06-20

He and his family have long been among golf's greatest teachers.<br />Here with four basic areas: ball striking, short game, mental game and physical conditioning, he gives any golfer wishing to improve four key areas to look into developing.<br />Many scoff at such suggestions, thinking it isn't detailed enough.  He not only provides the basics of the swing, but then what I think is excellent unique area of this is book is the section&quot; &quot;Harmon's Hints, or Just Do It!&quot;  To give but one example out of this excellent some twenty page suggestions (about 100 in all) is  &quot;Putting on Wet Greens&quot;  --- Allow for about half as much break.&quot;<br />Most high handicappers don't want to work on their game, i.e. mental and conditioning and strategy like Butch teaches here.

Pete is solid, off both sides of the groundies and of course the serve and volley.<br />What an outstanding young person whom other hopeful racket swinging youth can emulate --- the guy isn't about show but go. Especially his love of the Rocket and the inheritance those guys gave and their sacrifice is neat.  I grew up with the Chuck McKinley/Dennis Ralston era.<br />The book traces his record in the Majors, with the underlying background to the big matches and Pete's life.  Influenced greatly by his first coach, a pediatrician. Later, with one whom he truly bonded was taken suddenly.  What endurance and character.<br />This guy deserves his high spot in tennis annals.

Many find the &quot;locker room dialogue&quot; one of its attractions, but for those who would rather have golfers of honor and character choose to speak with more intelligent words to express their emotions, this feature of this outstanding piece of golf fiction takes away somewhat its attractiveness.<br />Still, a good read on a creative piece of writing.	2001-06-11

While other capitualte to the new spirit of American Christianity and give into all kinds of cultural pressures, Walther maintained his faith.  As he did in Germany, he came to this country to be able to freely worship and preach without governmental pressure.<br />Suelflow gives many insights into this man used so highly by God to Serve His Word.  Remarkable in its entirey is the sermon Walther preached at the dedication of the Seminary in St. Louis in 1883, here for the first time translated into English.  Much is still so pertinent and applcable for today:  &quot;In this house the doctrine of the Reformation is not to be reformed again, but guarded and defended.&quot;  &quot;In short, the so-called Lutheran church in our land was at that time dead, the laughing-stock of the sects who, similarly to hungry birds of the night, dividied the carcass among themselves.&quot;  &quot;When our Synod took to the field at that time with the unheard of watchword &quot;God's Word and Luther's doctrine pure shall to eternity endure,&quot; it was not only the anti-Christian papacy, not only the syncretistic, unionistic evangelical fellowship, not only the fanactical sects but especially all the elements of the so-called Lutheran church in this country which attacked our Synod with the greatest bitterness as a new &quot;old Lutheran&quot; sect, which would lead to ruin.&quot;<br />Wonderful section on (as Suelflow describes it) &quot;a favorite myth in synodical history is that the so-called &quot;autoonomu&quot; paragraph has been a part of the Synod's consititution ever since the founding of the Synod in 1847&quot; he shows to be just that, a myth.

Especially revealing to most in our times would likely be in area of science.  Kepler, Copernicus, etc. were all adamant Christians.  Contemporary writers like to portray the church as hostile to their scientific discoveries.  However, as Schmidt points out, not all of the church held this view.  That's the side of the story they don't tell, but Schmidt does.<br />Fascinating reading.  Well documented and written.  Reader will glean much insight from this worthy book.	2001-06-04

A die-hard Broncos fan from the days dying watching those ridiculous striped socks and watching Fran Tripuka get killed, what a job Shanahan did turning it around into two Super Bowls in a row.<br />Learning of his background and his principles makes me now not only a more avid Bronco fan, but also a Shanahan fan as well.  His perseverance from the days of his kidney injury to how he became part of Sooner coaching staff till today is truly one of principles of success through hard work, not gifts or who you know or any of the other myths most people who never get anywhere fall for and are unmotivated.  Most of them just don't ever want to work hard at anything, but have it handed to them. Shanahan disproves all that bunk and shows how it came to be. Unbelievable that when given the Raiders head-job, didn't even have the downpayment for a house.<br />This guy is very endearing to so many of us who never had the backgrounds for those connections, but wanting something bad enough, and always believing it, achieve it one goal at a time.<br />Great advice, especially appreciate his concern for balance.<br />Excellent read.  Thanks, Mike, from a new fan and admirer.	2001-05-25

Then he proceeds to show the wonderful landscape of biblical word pictures which convey what God has done for us in Christ crucified.<br />Importantly in this task, Preus affirms &quot;This Gospel stands over the church as the criterion of the church's authenticity.  It is the judge of what is truly the church and what is not.&quot;  And, also: &quot;The Gospel stands under the church as its only firm foundation.&quot;<br />It well relates how the failure to understand and utilize the fullness of every Gospel word, phrase and idea can and has led to errors concerning the doctrine of justification.  Thus, the book's goal:  &quot;not to reduce the Gospel to one of its words, but to proclaim it in its fulness, to use all of its ways of being said.&quot;<br />Two that especially enlightened and envigorated by desire to use Scripture's Gospel fullness were &quot;peace&quot; and &quot;adoption.&quot;  Writing on adoption:  &quot;His search ended, however, when he discovered that, through faith in Christ, he had been adopted by his loving heavenly Father.  Through Baptism, God has gathered His disparate creatures and brought them into His household.  He had adopted us, declared us to be His children.  Now we know who we are because we know whose we are.  Now we are cherished, wanted, desired, acknowledged by our Father.  Now we have the full rights of children.  No longer are we slaves of an evil taskmaster, objects of wrath.  Now we know that God loves us.  Because we know this, we may now live as children of God, as those born of God.&quot;<br />Using six main methaphor categories (creation, commerce, legal, personal, sacrifice, deliverance) Preus applies the variety of twenty-seven other metaphorical usages.<br />Well done, even that interested layperson can use this book to great advantage.erson can use this book to great advantage.	2001-05-25

Society we all know because of the revolution that was gaining momentum.<br />TV is growing and would play a major role in golf's history as well.  Along with three individuals, Hogan, Palmer and Nicklaus.<br />The &quot;y&quot; in the road is the televised Open at Cherry Creek, when Palmer made the celebrated charge.  Hogan tries but comes short, and Nicklaus, not knowing for sure his position, didn't really grind, or he likely would have tied.  Palmer wins, the sport grows, and as fate seemed to dictate, the game is on the way to the marvelous heights we now see it occupy.<br />Reading this wonderful book, it gives one more insight and compassion into those early pioneers who made it what it is.  Today's pros seemed so pampered, however, the stress is large and looming larger.<br />Sampson is articulate writer and delivers great insights:  Hagen's saying to Sarazen before the shot heard round the world at Augusta:  &quot;Come on, hurry up, I've got a date tonight.&quot;; and Gary Player calls up Hogan for some advice on his swing, so Hogan asks, whose clubs do you play?  When Player answers Dunlop, Hogan responds, &quot;Ask Mr. Dunlop.&quot;<br />Empathy for those like Sampson who wrote passionately about the game and didn't really make a living, let alone get rich.  Loved the story about Bob Drum being snubbed by his paper until they hear Palmer is leading The Open, then cable him to send a story.  Upon receipt of telegram, Drum crumbles it into ball, and said:  &quot;Hope to hell you get it.&quot;<br />This is a must for any serious golf collection of books on the game.	2001-05-24

Short in words and promising success if only the reader does this and that.  Turns biblical prayer on its ear.<br />Purely this is dangerous teaching for only the fact that it seeks to turn our attention away from Christ and upon our own relentless seeking what we want.<br />Scripture is replete with examples against such &quot;name it and claim it&quot; theology.  Further, the English translation here of 1 Chronicles 4:9 &quot;and Jabez was more honorable&quot; is faulty and misleading.  The preferable Hebrew trnalslation here would be &quot;more honored.&quot;  See a reliable source such as Keil-Delitzsch, Volume 8, pg. 88.<br />This coupled with the interpretative guideline of scripture interprets scripture will not permit this incorrect application as the book suggests.  What about taking up our crosses and following Jesus?  What about he who exalts himself I will humble and he who humbles himself I will exalt?<br />Prayer disconnected from our relationship to Christ crucified is what is critical, and is avoided in this book.  Further to its false teaching, the author exhibits Pelgiansism (look it up to find out what's involved) on pg. 85 --  speaking of what to do about sin, he writes &quot;I encourage you to rush back into God's presence and make things right, whatever it takes.&quot;  What about giving it to the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world?<br />This is certainly commendable that Christ's people pray and strengthen their walk of faith, but putting people under the law in his human-centered way and not the way of Christ's cross is unbiblical and dangerous to faith, no matter how high it is on the best-seller's list.<br />For biblical teaching on prayer and life of faith, see either Harold Senkbeil's excellent book &quot;Dying to Live: The Power of Forgiveness,&quot;  Chapter 8 and Gene Veith's &quot;Spirituality of the Cross.&quot;	2001-05-21

In this volume he seeks to answer the hypothesis if Jesus and Paul believe that the apocalyptic kingdom was to appear very soon.<br />He is conservative in his approach and conclusions, and exhaustive in his consideration of others' conclusions as well.<br />I agree that Paul walked a tightrope between realized and unrealized eschatology, or the now but not yet tension. He considers the important topic of the kingdom of God, one of Jesus' favorite sermon topics.<br />He correctly concludes that the intermediate state (what is going on with the departed between the Ascension and Return of Christ) is silent in Scripture.<br />He is afterall a academic exegete, so he is careful with his conclusions, and meticulous in his exegesis.  He turns to no hyper millenial speculation.<br />Only serious NT students and those interested in eschatology will enjoy this study.  Not a place to begin.	2001-05-15

His background in Mormonism provides a firsthand testimony of their beliefs and culture, insights which are so valuable in reaching our Mormon friends.  All this in an attitude which is convincingly winsome, with the love of Christ and the truth which we can offer them in the crucified and resurrected Christ.<br />Experience has shown me that when dealing with Mormons we have to expose their dependence on the Law, which will never save not one person, Gal. 3:11.  Faith in Christ will never disappoint any who believe in Him who loved us and gave himself for us.<br />Cares book is truly a most valuable aid to our outreach to our Mormon neighbors and contacts.	2001-05-15

He endorsed this book, writing:  &quot;The God Makers is an accurate account of the theology, goals, and secrets of Mormonism.  It is told in a popular, readable style with an eye to evangelism and apologetics.  The facts are all here; it is a most useful and informative volume, valuable for both pastors and laymen.&quot;<br />I would be embarrassed to be an LDS member and have this exposed.  It doesn't matter what any individual LDS member says about what their church teaches, confesses and practices.  Just as it doesn't matter what any individual member of my church says.  What matters in both cases is what the church officially teaches.<br />Dr. Martin offered a large sum of money to the LDS church, if they would only declare their belief in the Trinity, that ancient Christian belief in the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.  They wouldn't.  They can't.  They are deceived and The God Makers exposes this.<br />Smith's frustration with true Biblical doctrine shows forth so easily in his made up doctrines, and copying of KJV errors in their entirety.<br />For all those who want a faith in what they have to do rather than what Christ did for each of us on the cross of Calvary, LDS is as good as any others: they all do lead to the same end result.<br />Study for the final exam: read the Book --- the Bible and try an English translation like the NIV or NASB.	2001-05-15

I especially have grown fond of two paintings that this marvelous book acquainted me with, Titian's &quot;Vendramin Family&quot; and Lippi's &quot;The Annunciation.&quot;  Drury's comments here are very useful.<br />I would like to give this five stars, but withheld this because of my disagreement theologically with Drury.

For that honor, I don't think you can beat the New Basics Cookbook.<br />However, this one is very good at what it does: gives basics of techniques and all with the view of healthy, low-fat cooking with a sophisticated, rich gourmet type result.<br />Others have more variety and even categories, but this one has lots of creative, well-done dishes which one would do well to pursue before moving on to other specialty cookbooks, and there are some in here that are rare, wonderful finds, e.g. Curried Lamb and Lentil Stew, Chicken Enchilada Casserole, Eggs Sardou,Orzo and Portobello Casserole, and my favorite:  Brown Sugar Bread Pudding with Creme Anglaise.<br />This is well worth the money and time cooking from.	2001-05-12

We are told that this civil society is the &quot;seedbed of virute.&quot;  It mediates between extreme individualism and the all-powerful state.<br />The downgrading of heros and history and good works causing the moral dilemma we are in, but there are glimpses of working together to shape a new cultural ethic, a new civil society.<br />The dissident culture overtook the majority culture in the '60s and has prevailed against a somewhat diverse and apathetic, content, passive majority turned minority culture, now the dissident culture.<br />Wisely, Himmelfarb concludes that government intervention with the legislative/judicial solutions to cultural problems will not succeed.<br />Her prediction?  Revival and expansion will occur for the dissident culture, however they will not regain the majority, nor will religion play the large role of influence they once enjoyed but rather moral grounds will replace them.  Counterrevolutions are more difficult to achieve and maintain.<br />Well worth the read.	2001-05-09

But an overdose of popular television is detrimental to most viewers ability to grow intellectually and their ability to think in a discerning, informed manner.<br />Because it is so visual, it by nature can cause one's brain to be placed in neutral, and then message after message is fed into one's psyche.<br />For too many in our culture, TV is now the gospel truth. Whatever they hear or see is their touch with reality, in their mind.  They are thus closed minded and limited.<br />Oh, those will respond how about all the good stuff?  Discover and A&amp;E documentaries and such.  These are the good stuff, truly, which if chosen discriminately will provide much for the chranium to chew on.  But this isn't the popular channels of choice.<br />Postman demystifies this medium by showing how it rather seeks to recreate and degrade our concepts of news, politics and religion.  Most our unaware of this manipulation and so are the prime candidates for its persuasion.<br />Let the viewer beware.  This is a classic.  Turn off the tv and read a book.  Or watch a TV special on a subject, then buy a good book on the topic.	2001-05-09

Raved about by his buddy, Charlie Trotter.<br />First, the design and production of this book is rich and exquisite, as most are by Ten Speed Press.  The paper has an transluscence to it, and the style and photography are so well done and stylish.  Even the bookjacket is folded uniquely.<br />The ingredients are very Aussie influenced, with seafood, veal and lamb dominant, with French and Asian ingredients and techniques thrown in.<br />Tastes are clean and pure and sparkling, very refreshing to consume.  Tried so far but a few, and excited when time permits to delve into the rest.  So far, tried several of the appetizers such as Marinated Trevally with Preserved Lemon is outstanding, but so many of fish dishes are dependent on having an excellent fishmonger, which we are fortunate to have one here.<br />Main dishes completed so far with outstanding results are the Roasted Scampi Seasoned with Tea and Scampi Oil, and the Breast of Duck with Apple and Ginger Dipping Sauce.<br />At first, this book will intimidate many with its Oriental ingedients but most major cities and with internet sources one can come up with these.  Techniques are not overly difficult and the color photos show artistic plating suggestions as well as two or three wine suggestions per entree.<br />New, exquisite menu to cook and serve to my guests.  Try this one, it will pleasantly surprise and grow with you.	2001-05-09

There are too many other good books out there on these subjects.<br />However, he does give some good advice.  I especially appreciated his idea of treating the par 3's like par 4 approach shots.  This is neat idea mentally.<br />Much of what he says about prepartation and practice is good for us amateurs to hear.  Lay down clubs when practicing.  This really pays off benefits.  Doesn't compare in looks to the guys just pounding ball after ball, but when they are out spraying them, alignment practice will pay off.<br />Could have cut this book down by 1/2 to 1/3 and gotten good stuff in.  Expected more stories of his caddying experience, not rehash of what other instructional books provide. More actual experience stories making the point would have been more effective and kept ones attention.	2001-05-02

In this most fascinating book, Neusner, who is a prolific writer and teacher of Judaism, states that if he were around at the time of Jesus, he would have dissented from following him.<br />The Bible is replete with the same reaction, Jews who could not accept His Messiahship.<br />What is so fascinating here is a matter of heremeutics, how one interprets the Scriptures.  Many Christians do not have much of an understanding of the Bible of Jesus, the apostles and Neusner.  The Old Testament is very foreign to many, because it takes much preparatory work to be able to gain its precious gifts.<br />Neusner claims the Torah (first five books, the books of Moses) contradicts what Jesus taught about them.  He is right!  Jesus simply and clearly teaches that the Jews of His day and Neusner misinterpret, misunderstand and misapply them to their detriment.  Another Jew, a Jew of distinguished pedigree, Saul of Tarsus (see Philippians 3:4-6) would not and could not follow Jesus either until converted.  Conversion for Saul is described in Acts 9.  Then, Paul began to understand that it is impossible to understand the Scriptures correctly, &quot;But to this day whenver Moses is read, a veil lies over their heart; but whenever a man turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.&quot;  2 Corinthians 3:15.<br />Neusner is so close, yet so far away.  He understands the unbelievable claim that Jesus made that He represents Israel, He is the Servant of Israel of Isaiah and that real true Israel (as Jesus states which confuses and angers Neusner) are those of faith in the promises Jesus fulilled, fulfills and will fulfills, not in an ethnic inheritance.  See Romans 9.	2001-05-02

The arts definitely need to be restored as a vital part of the life of Christ's kids.<br />Schaeffer provides his views on the necessary discernmnet for this restoration of all the arts: music, painting, sculpture, poetry, etc.<br />He rightly contends that the impetus for this is Biblical.  From the specifications to the OT temple to the adornment in the city of God with jewels, God certainly appreciates and recommendends that His church adorn itself with such.<br />The author provides counter suggestions to those who do not wish to confess the Christian world-view, nor would want their art to have any message.<br />Especially appreciated his encouragement to appreciate the great artistic talents and expertise of those who do not wxhibit the Christian world-view.<br />This is very well balanced biblical exhortation to recover the promote the arts within Christianity.

Dulles begins with apologetic motifs in the NT, then continues on to the patristic era, rich in apologetics classics.<br />Each section in ended with the author's concluding analysis.  He then moves to the middle ages which focused primarily on Aquinas.  Then to the Reformation era, 16-18th.  Ends with a chapter each on the 19th and 20th centuries.<br />I appreciate his splitting his historical sweep beginning with the 16th C. forward into Catholic and Protestant.  Lacking in my mind is the apologists of my era, the Craig's, Geisler's,Montgomery's, etc., but I didn't really buy nor use this to get a historical fix on them.  What Dulles provides so succinctly in this work is so useful to gaining an overall timeframe on the apologetic topic.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-04-18

This work on Deuteronomy is among the best.  Having translated this book word for word from the Hebrew, I can assure you that Craigie hits at major themes and continuity of the book.<br />His historical section on covenant is particularly good.  The sainted F.F. Bruce said of this work:  &quot;not only a monumnet of Hebrew literature but a permanent part of Christian Scripture.&quot;<br />Craigie believes that this is a series of sermons given by Moses as they were perched on edge of promised land. In author's words: &quot;Provides a paradigm for the kingdom of God in the modern world.&quot;<br />Does an excellent job with commandments, promises of curses and blessings.  Must have for the serious student of Deuteronomy who believes as Craigie in the Word of God not the product of human imagination.	2001-04-18

The work really requires a working knowledge of the Hebrew to appreciate its depth of research and scholarship.<br />This was used as one of the textbooks for my sem class in Hosea which we translated each word from Hebrew.

Complexity is added through possible divesture of the sem, concern about treasured art and mysterious papyrus from Pontius Pilate era all add to the intrigue.<br />If this is indicative of Ms.James work, she is truly gifted.

It begins at baptism, with water and Word of God and the gift of the Spirit and faith.<br />Holy Spirit does not want to draw attention to itself, but always to Christ our Savior.

As a Lutheran, he doesn't fail but to let this talk of community revolve around anything else but the body and blood of Christ, given and shed for the forgiveness of sins.<br />This for Bonhoeffer is the beginning and end of fellowship.  This must be revolting and new for many who would call themselves Christians today, due to our wanting to be individuals who agree to unite around our diversities, rather than what Bonhoeffer writes from the Bible, our unity in Christ crucified. To call any other kind of intimacy close to this is unbiblical and un-Bonhoeffer.  Evidence this quote:  &quot;It is by the grace of God that a congregation is permitted to gather visibly in this world to share God's Word and sacrament.&quot;  Also, &quot;All we can say, therefore, is:  the community of Christians springs solely from the Biblical and Reformation message of the justification of man through grace alone; this alone is the basis of the longing of Christians for one another.&quot;  &quot;Without Christ there is discord between God and man and between man and man.&quot;<br />Probably my favorite quote which will bring huge rewards for those that discern its truths:  &quot;We must center our attention on the Word alone and leave consequences to its action.  For may it not be that God HImslef sends kus these hours of reproof and dryness that we may be brought again to expect everything from His Word?  &quot;Seek God, not happiness&quot;--this is the fundamental rule of all meditation.&quot;	2001-04-12

He saw himself taking on Isaiah's prophecy of Israel's representative suffering servant.  Especially does all this tie in his title &quot;son of man.&quot;  When he comes to the question of deity, he hedges and waffles a bit.<br />Interesting read in the continuing search for the historical Jesus.	2001-04-12

While boldy proclaiming they are about the Word, these modern day gnostics in America do not let God's Word have the preeminence that God intends.  Lee even acknowledges that Lutheran doctrine is anti-individual and pro-the action of God in the midst of His people.<br />Our world today seems only willing to accept a church that will let them have their &quot;me and my Jesus&quot; beliefs and practices, which in turn tickle so many other worldly ears who think they become spiritual on their terms.<br />One neat tie that he makes between Irenaeus and today is:  &quot;it is accepted that a born again Christian is a Protestant who has had an experience of some sort and who takes his or her religion seriously, unlike the ordinary folk who have merely been baptized, attend Sunday services and call themselves Methodists, Episcopalians, Lutherans or Baptists.  ...  &quot;They call us,&quot; said Irenaeus, &quot;'unspiritual,' 'common,' and 'ecclesiastic.'&quot;<br />Worthy read and library addition.	2001-04-12

The exegetical papers included here do not solve the issues.  But to just raise many questions for others to answer does not make the case suddenly shift in the other direction.<br />What is at the core is one's view of the authority of Scripture.  Pinnock, himself no supporter of inerrancy, has to me the best take of this entire colloquium. He took two feminist books and two nonfeminist books and he concluded:  &quot;If this is a war of ideas, biblical feminists face not only traditionalist but also radical feminist exegetes on this crucial question.  These four authors press the same point:  unless the Bible is edited along feminist lines, it cannot be made to support feminism.&quot;<br />Gundry's response to Pinnock is weak and founded upon a typical begging the question of the authority of scripture.  Harmonization of the Scriptures cannot be sidestepped with some fancy legwork about presuppositions to exegesis.<br />Pinnock's determination in my thinking is still pervasive.	2001-04-12

What he discovered upon an exhaustive search of Scripture as well as Lutheran writings and current, popular Evangelical views, was that the old way was the biblical way.<br />Sanctification is painful, for it is a killing of the old Adam in each of us.  We die to ourselves, which is the toughest thing to do.  We live to Christ and in Him who is given into our very beings through His Word and Sacraments.<br />Senkbeil argues here convincingly that such popular sanctification writers as Swindoll ignore the saint and sinner in each believer.  We are consumed with ourselves and especially our emotions, how we feel.  We little concern ourselves with God and the world and what the cross means for all of this.<br />Senkbeil's work will be a necessary correction to those who will honestly evaluate their stance under the sole guidance of the Scriptures.  He's an eloquent writer, e.g. &quot;The faithful church will always see that the flock is fed, not with junk food, but with the solid nourishment of the Word and sacrament.  What people mean when they say they're not being fed, however, usually has less to do with spiritual nourishment than it does with spiritual taste buds.&quot;	2001-04-12

The need to engage the educated about the faith is here presented in wonderful, thoughtful ways.<br />He does this by providing profiles of these people, usually of the autonomous, free-thinking classifications.  Dominated by other worldviews than Christian, Deffner helps with conversational bridges which can be used to engage with them about theology.  They will listen and ask probing questions.  THis is the fun and challenge in this.<br />Offers much in the way of books and such that can be utilized in this outreach.  Best advice though is when he suggests that we find out what our educated friends are reading, read it ourselves, then relate the good news to it.  Super approach.

It is very conversational and relaxed and makes you feel like you're sitting around in the Grill Room of your club or around the fireplace, listening to this wonderful person who is a prominent, successful golfer.<br />The editor did a marvelous job letting this book sound like Ben wrote it.  His passion for the game, for the people who are important in his life --- they come out in this great read.<br />His love of the history and sportsmanship and honor of the game is overarching as the book begins and continues.  The fate of his amateur days with the Country Club with Francis Ouiment and later Ryder Cup glory is chilling and superb.<br />This guy is what the game is all about.  He admits to not being the best player ever nor at times, but one can easily see by his life and style why so many pulled for him to win.<br />His association and passion for Jones and Pennick and his wife and fellow pros is very moving.<br />I appreciated so much his honest comments on the Ryder Cup at Brookline and the behind the scenes events.  Having read James' book on the incident, I'm now more convinced than ever this was just sour grapes on the European captain's part.<br />This is just an outstanding read.

As Horton correctly quotes Avery Dulles in Rome's continued holding to the anathemas of Trent as still prevailing now in Vatican II times, this is absolutely Rome's position.<br />My own church speaks in detail about this.

The complex social structure of a group hierachy that has sustained their species for thousands of years deserves to be respected and upheld.  And if they are going to live with us, it is we who must sustain the hiearchy.&quot;<br />This book isn't exactly (although there is some of it) how to do this or that of training.

From the historical critics to the charismatics to the fundamentalists, it's the same problem:  did God really say?  do you really think God would say that?<br /><br />Careful attention to the Bible, as MacArthur points out, will occupy itself around the central question: how can a person be saved?

The NT documents themselves are very historically reliable.  More so, as Bruce points out, than many every learned person would not fail to believe in, such as Julius Caesar, etc.  Using these same historicity standards, Bruce debunks such myths and presupposed opposition.<br />Believing them as personal truth is one thing; to deny or change their historicity, low down scholarly dishonesty.

A God in this case who would allow such a brutal, unhuman event to occur to His people, the Jews, is no God to them.<br />Seen through this tragic happening in man's history, a God who stands by idly and permits such cruelties has no claim to be their God.  His abandonment of His own people when they were so unjustly and brutally murdered and tortured brings about a complete stoppage of any attempts at further communion with God.<br />One cannot but feel pain and embarassment for the terrible inhumanities that the Jews endured at the hands of the Nazis.  Wiesel powerfully brings these emotions out of the reader through his short,tight, intense writing style.  Interspersed is this penetration recollection is Wiesel's reactions to what was occuring, and most importantly to the issue of God's existence is his reaction to God as the ordeal progresses.<br />He but gives brief glimpses of what God has meant to him, e.g. his interest in the Jewish mystical book of the cabbala.  This is key for understanding his sentiments now concerning God.  He states:  &quot;Man raises himself toward God by the questions he asks Him . . . that is true dialogue.  Man questions God and God answers.&quot;  Further, he shows the belief that the Messiah would be a political Christ who would free the Jews and return them to a worldly power.<br />Thus, when the reality of the concentration camp and the deaths occuring around him appear, Elie is quick to see God as letting down His part of the deal.  Wiesel's concept of God is a &quot;this world&quot; God, to deliver Israel only from any harm.  Further, he equates evil that man precipitates upon man as God's fault and responsibility.<br />To be sure, Wiesel rejects (if aware) of the Christian view that differs with his concept.  God is not source and fault of sin and has accomplished victory in dealing with all injustice and will publicly display this victory and rid saved humanity once and for all.  All this God did through a Jew, Jesus the Christ (Messiah).<br />This book is valuable in that it not only powerfully describes the full rage of man's sinful nature expressed through the Nazi regime but it points out one man's changing views of a God which to a great extent is limited to his own questioning/reasoning ability.  Left to our abilities, we do create gods which will not stand the test of time, nor do they provide what we really need, salvation for eternity, not from a cruel Roman government in the first century or from a cruel government in the twentieth, to save us from ourselves.

There was trepidation before beginning if I could find any logical loopholes in their reasoning against any belief in God.<br />To my surprise, I found many such loopholes.  There cases are certainly intelligent and persuasive, but there are surely intelligent and persuasive responses and counterarguments to theirs.  The faith doesn't have to roll over and play dead in the face of such critique.<br />Permit me to examine two of this collection:  &quot;God and Evil&quot; by H.J. McCloskey and &quot;Divine Omnipotence and Human Freedom&quot; by Antony Flew.<br />Both use traditional arguments against God.  Flew uses the classic Hibbert argument that either God can do away with evil or he will not; therefore, he cannot be all-powerful or all-good because evil continues; thus, God doesn't exist.<br />McCloskey claims there is a 'prima facie' case that evil and God are incompatible, and the theist solutions are unacceptable.  However, he can be refuted at his very beginning point: i.e. that God and evil, if real, are incompatible. Historic Christianity and we Lutherans specifically, deny that God is the author of evil, from our Confessions:  &quot;The source and cause of evil is not God's foreknowledge (since God neither creates nor works evil, nor does he help it along and promote it, but rather the wicked and perverse will of the devil and of men.&quot;  Secondly, McCloskey forces an &quot;implied time limit&quot; upon God, declaring that just because God hasn't destroyed evil &quot;yet,&quot; He is incapable.  This is an arrogant, self-assumption.<br />Flew falsely makes a huge mistake in assuming that all Christians follow Calvin's mistake of double predestination, which we Lutherans do not.  He believes this to be a vital component of a freewill defense.  For those who believe God predestines those who will be saved, but those who reject God's salvation damn themselves to separation from God.  Likewise with McCloskey's presumptive error, Flew limits God's timetable to one of his own choosing.<br />Given eternity, how can ones living as we do in the 20th-21st centuries assume God &quot;must&quot; have to act before now?  They also assume perfect worlds, which the Christian Bible refutes as not reality after the Fall into sin.<br />Both these arguments fail to deal with the Scriptural teaching of maintaining the tension between God's soverignty and man's personal responsibility with solving this antinomy.<br />God has overcome evil and sin on Good Friday, and will reveal this and eliminate evil once and for all on Judment Day.key's presumptive error, Flew limits God's timetable to one of his own choosing.  <br />Given eternity, how can ones living as we do in the 20th-21st centuries assume God &quot;must&quot; have to act before now?

Slow down, stop and ponder what is being said.<br />This book aids in helping us do this.  His views on advertising and insurance in the &quot;economic freedom&quot; section are naive.  Advertising can not be charged as he tries with adding to the cost of items, rather it keeps products and service costs down.  Consider a Christian congregation as but one small example:  say that on the average, each member contributes $500/per year, and the average life membership is ten years.  Thus, the average contributions the congregation receives per member is 10 years X $500, or $5,000.  So, let's say that for one year the congregation spends $2,500 on advertising, and they know for fact that as a result of that effort, one new member was received, who subsequently brought four of the family members into active membership as well that year.  Thus, the $2,500 brought in revenue of (using averages) 5 members X $500/year X 10 years, or total average contributions of $25,000.  All of this, $25,000 for an expenditure of $2,500.  And any marketing executive will tell you the exposure value is there too, and some of it will stretch out for years.  Thus, to say simply that each members of the congregation had to pay for $2,500 using some forumula of Number of members divided by Advertising Budget, is non-sense.<br />Apply this to consumer/industrial markets, and you will find that advertising brings customers/producers together, thus spreading some significant costs over larger customer base, thus reducting cost per unit.  Take away advertising, cost per unit will go up. It's supply and demand, which Blamires doesn't seem to consider at all.<br />His insurance argument about robbers increasing theft is bogus.  I would assume insurance industry experts could easily refute his argument, since the drug crisis causes much theft, not the fact that insurance coverage allows thieves some peace of mind that their victims will be covered.<br />Otherwise, I enjoyed this read and found ample advice.  On this same theme of abuse of words, see on pro-life &quot;Who Broke the Baby?&quot; and more profound survey of post-modern mindset, the excellent primer:  Postmodern Times by Gene Veith.insurance argument about robbers increasing theft is bogus.

Having read other works of his on culture and religion and law, this is yet another which shows us this talented man's ability to present a lucid, well thought out opinion.<br />Many points put forth in this work caused me to seriously ponder my views, and my culture's.  My sensisitivity has been heightened, my horizons have been stretched and broadened.  Admittedly so, I have not had enough exposure to all the voices Carter provides besides his own.  This is of tremendous value to me.<br />Still horrifying and repugnant to me personally to know the reality of racism and all of its trump cards that both sides play.  Carter seeks to expose them all for what they're worth.

Here, scientists of various disciplines engage in scientific speculation whether this model would be possible.

He proceeds by investigating churches that have made a turn-around what they did.<br />The answer is become more market oriented: people oriented rather than God oriented.  As Paul addresses in Galatians 1:6-10, the Apostle was not marketing oriented, no matter what Barna claims.  All he ever provides with Biblical support for this is I Cor. 9:19-22.  However, his application to the message is not what this text teaches.  Good, solid commentators on this, e.g. see Lockwood or Fee, disagree. Paul accomodates his life, not his message.<br />Gathering and presenting the data of what churches and preachers did to turn-around congregations doesn't show at all that the Lord is behind such growth.  Way too much is assumed by Barna and this cases he sights.  With all the principles, obtacles and wisdom he cites, unless the truth is preached and taught and believed there is no growth, there is no turn-around.<br />Why are we so enamored with change?  Because many have never and likely will never confess and adore the truth's handed down to them from the believers from the past, who contended for the faith so valliantly against opponents too who sided with the people rather than the Lord.<br />Do we norm our faith on pragmatism or Scripture?  Although I have great respect for marketing, let it stay where it belongs in the world of business and corporate life.  Until I am shown clearly from God's Word that marketing is of His blessing, I cannot change, I will stand on the Word and speak out against turn-arounds which ignore its admonitions and warnings as Barna and these practioners do.<br />&quot;A time will come when people will not listen to sound teachng but, craving to hear something different, will get more and more teachers whom they like.&quot;  2 Timothy 4:3	2001-02-27

Especially my own confession, the Lutherans were not given a fair hearing.  As one reviewer of the book said:  &quot;The Lutheran insights regarding Law and Gospel are caricatured, sometimes distorted, often ignored, but never truly given a fair hearing.&quot;<br />How can this be a fair and accurate representation, when the Lutheran position has this quick disclaimer &quot;modified Lutheran&quot; from a non-Lutheran?  How can one then proceed to represent even a modified-Lutheran presentation and only cite Luther three times out of 129, and none from Walther?  Three from Calvin?<br />This is like a Lutheran dominated book which has all Lutheran authors, then letting a Lutheran present the Calvinist position, but with the disclaimer &quot;modifed Calvinist position.&quot;<br />For the Lutheran view, see C.F.W. Walther's, Law and Gospel.  For a faith body that majors in distinguishing and not intermingling law and gospel, this interaction would have been interesting.  Unfortunately, this is an interesting but nonetheless impoverished view.	2001-02-26

Bob Jones wrote of him in the preface:  &quot;all his courses that I have played have been interesting; in every instance he has placed interest and enjoyment ahead of difficulty.&quot;<br />Oh, that more modern designers would learn the lesson!  He states that even the most emphatic golfer who says he's not interested in beauty is &quot;subconsciously influenced by his surroundings.&quot;  Easily the designer of some of golf's most influential hole scenes, this guy gives definite hints, e.g. Playing down fairways bordered by straight lines of trees is not only unartistic but makes tedious and uninteresting golf.  Many green committees ruin one's handiwork by planting trees like rows of soldiers along the borders of the fairways.&quot;<br />Love the poem he quotes on the analysis of paralysis:  The Centipede was happy quite until a toad in fun said &quot;Pray which leg goes over which?&quot;  This put his mind in such a pitch he lay distracted in a ditch considering how to run.&quot;	2001-02-19

Not only for Canadians, but because of the closeness to America both in distance and in thinking, this book is equally equatable and applicable to Canada's southern neighbor.<br />From surveys and demographics and interviews, Bibby paints a picture of culture leading and religion following.  Not a pretty picture for the future.  Of the world but in the world flys right out of the window.  Terrifying is his conclusion:  &quot;In this country, religion gives every indication of being something we create rather than something with a non-human dimension.<br />Fragmentation happens and will accelerate, Bibby portends, due to increase in innovation and information resulting in increased numbers who tend to have no indentifiable commitment --- constantly changing.  Regular attendance and loyalty to a confession will continue their downslide.<br />His recommendation?  Reconnect God to self to society. Tough order, if faithful to God and not linking with the culture.  &quot;If religion is to interact effectively  with culture, then it has to be able to transcend culture, so that it has something to bring, and be responsive to culture, so that it knows how to bring it.&quot;	2001-02-19

Good sections on church history, OT and NT.<br />Relevance of this in our cultural setting is obvious.  What must be thought out carefully letting Scriptures be our only norm is the exception clauses concerning this topic.  Our Lord addresses differing situations in which one would be adulterous, and in violation of the Lord's divine principle that marriage is to be a lifelong union of one man and one woman.  While reconciliaton is always the goal, abandonment and sexual unfaithfulness are legitimate grounds for divorce in Jesus' sight.  Mindful of the forgiveness that Christ gives for all sins, all reconciling efforts of offended spouse which fail should not burden this one with command against consideration of remarriage.<br />This however should never be taken or seen as license to get out from under one's marital obligation, but only the recognition that when there has been clear Scriptural breaking of the marital union by human beings, such as willful and sustained abandonment, remarriage of the deserted spouse remains permissible.  Not as a liberty that must be utilized, but as a freedom under the kingdom of grace.<br />It should go without saying, but must be nonetheless that one who divorces for unscriptural reasons and remarries certainly commits adultery.	2001-02-16

Sasse is important not only because he is a famous Lutheran theologian who was around during Nazi Germany.  More important, as this book demonstrates, the residual influence this man had upon his students and their students with the adapt theology of this great Christian.<br />Sasse was such an astute man of the history of the Christian church, and at the same time, an excellent exegete.  His thought process is profound and succinct.  Almost at times like the apostle John, appearing simple in sentence structure and vocabulary, yet profound when you begin to unpack each word with its depth and richness of meaning.<br />In this volume are the speeches of the Sasse conference by his students, i.e. Nagel, Feuerhahan, Kleinig, Marquart, Hardt.  Also, other contributors influenced by Sasse contribute to this volume.<br />The contents are rich and vibrant with the substance of theology.  Besides commentary of Sasse's life and writings, articles include:  his relationship with the Third Reich, on worship, the confessing apostolic and catholic church, his reaction and interaction with Barth and natural theology, the mystery of sacred scripture, and his relationship with Rome.<br />From Sasse's own words come this admonition to the church: &quot;When does the church exert its greatest influence in the world?  When it is the church, wholly church and nothing else!  When it brings its message which is alien to this world, to a world which wants to know nothing of it.&quot;	2001-02-16

Discussing Omnipotence he challenges the normal straitjacket of God can do anything, by saying that it should be understood withing limitations.  Better to speak of it as God's will, that He does what He wills, when He wills, how He wills.  As an example, here Nash cites that God cannot lie.  Descartes and others found this illogical.  The problem we see is that Descartes and others want to set the boundaries, while God defines His own boundaries.  God's own nature is not lying.<br />Also, what gets one in trouble talking about God's attributes is to individually separate them, compare them, contrast them, etc.  God is one, he is not more omnipotent than omniscient than loving than holy than truth.  He is all these things at once, in totality, in harmony.<br />This is a lively look at thinking at the time of this writing and a quick reaction thereto.  Helpful little book to engage thinkers of all levels and classes.  Engaging.	2001-02-13

He  begins with medieval thinkers, which set the pattern for so much of the thought that followed and still has its affect today.  Covering Augustine to Aquinas, it is Augustine who sets the framework for the successors.  Brown stresses a good point here, that the Middle Ages were focused not on the physical universe for its sake, but for the sake of the reality behind it.  A strange mixture of Christinaity, pagan philosophy and a great portion of Greek philosophy.  At the end, comes the major thinker Aquinas with his arguments that natural theology forms the intellectual basis for the philosophical arguments of the church.<br />Moving to the 16th-18th centuries, Brown shows that this was the cradle for modern thought.  Recovery here of world and man for their own sakes, and the Reformation turns away from natural theology to revealed theology.  Thus, the development of the rationalists, empiricists, deists and to Kant, this is time of major turning in philosophy.  Major directive to modern man's power of reason to understand his world.<br />Creatively taking tagents off of this is the 19th century world of Schleiermacher, Hegel and Kierkegaard, spurning on the prominent 20th world of Barth, Tillich, Bultmann, etc.<br />This is a great, general intro to philosophy and its relationship to Christianity.  Brown warns against alignment with any particular philosophy too closely, but does see the need and value of the stimulus philosophy provides for Christian thinkers to rethink their position.<br />Bibliography leans toward British publishing.  Great reference is the five-volume &quot;A History of Western Philosophy&quot; by W.T. Jones.	2001-02-13

A person of my own taste, he took a piece of liver and dropped it into the honey pot.  This ghost knows cuisine!<br />Well worth the read!	2001-02-12

In a wonderful, large, bookstore, we inquired, what book if you want to learn more about the history.  This is it, the local experts said.<br />It is, well written from the beginnings of Charles Town up to Hurrican Hugo, the prose is lively and attention keeping.<br />Especially to be enjoyed is the side-bar entries of primarily people and architecture which add much to the verbal discussion going on the page.<br />To go further in study, the author provides this wisdom: &quot;there appear to me to be more bad books written about Charleston than just about any subject I know.&quot;  So he lists those he knows are worthy and recommended on each time period.

Outstanding is the Baked Whole Snapper with Coconut Milk and the Chicken Hekka, a standard Hawaiian party dish.<br />For dessert the Pineapple Coconut Yum Yum was aptly named.

This is easily relayed on to us simpletrons with &quot;Two turns and a swish of the club.&quot;<br />He then gives this applied to stance, grip, aim, then proceeds to backswing, etc.  The illustrations are by the famous Anthony Favielli of Ben Hogan's Five Fundamentals fame.

Now that we have court tv and have witnessed some amazing trials, we understand more how what is allowed in as evidence is critical to a trial.<br />Here in this work this jurist expert analyzes the Gospels as being admissable.  Think about it for a moment.  In any given historical situation, if four different individuals were asked some time after the event common to all of their attendance to write an accurate report, the same result would happen as we find in the gospels.  Stress on different events with highlights of differing focus on common happenings by multiple witnesses would occur.<br />Alledged contradictions thus fall aside given that each of us admits that this is just the way it commonly happens.  We would be much more suspect if each of four witness accounts matched up exactly word for word.  Collusion would be charged!  Here though God gives four different slants through four Evangelists who do this very thing:  they give different emphases and differing slants on the same event.<br />Bonus attachment is Dupin's &quot;Trial of Jesus Before Caiaphas and Pilate.&quot;  Interested parties might also check out Paul Maier's &quot;Pontius Pilate&quot; and &quot;Flames of Rome.&quot;	2001-02-09

Interesting here that all except Christianity are named after a famous thinker.<br />Presentation of Christianity is difficult due to which confessional's bodies view does one use?  Seems to gravitate towards the modernistic one which critiques the historical faith given to the patriarchs and prophets and handed down to the church of the apostles by the Incarnate Word and His appointed apostles.  Creation and original sin are put over as unreasonable accounts to be thought of as historical.  However, much to the author's credit he admits that essential to this view is the prescription which finds its cure to original sin and the breaking of the relationship between holy God and sinful human to be God's doing--incarnation and atonement.  These he scoffs as being unrational, but also outside skepticism since the revelation states them as so.  Oh so close!<br />Freedom of the will is still major stumbling block.  Statements that rational people still believe in this despite all its glowing problems as people still like the culture it produces.  Fact is, many very rational thinkers believe that God's thoughts are higher than our thoughts, and the way to think is to let God metamorphosize our thinking by His Word.<br />Arrogantly and presumptively assumes in many places (e.g. in Lorenz' section especially) that the fossil collection in possession is certain factual evidence for evolution.  Notice that the years have not been kind to such as these who want to jump to conclusions when all the judging of the evidence is not in.<br />Enjoyed his analysis overall much.  Doesn't profess to even begin to get into the details, just an excellent overall sketch about the diagnosis, prescription for each of the seven.  Wish he would have represented historical, orthodox Christianity better.  See &quot;Not the Way It's Supposed to Be&quot; by Plantinga as a corrective starting point.a as a corrective starting point.	2001-02-09

What I really enjoy and use is the first section, 40 pages of menus using recipes from the book. This is unique and very well done.  This section gives one not only ideas for complete meals from the book, but just plain ideas on how to combine dishes for wonderful meals.<br />The recipes themselves show great variety, and care to do just what he setted out:  elegance for reasonable health.  As an example, this menu is entitled:  The light side of Classic Cuisine:  Grilled Swordfish with Spicy Yogurt Sauce, Poached Turkey in Vegetable Consomme' Salad, Creamy Rice Pudding with Fruit Sauce.

Showing clearly that Liberation Theology excessively focuses on social revolution, Nunez shows that the classic usage of the OT Exodus by the likes of Gutierrez is not true to the NT interpretation of this event.<br />He takes us through the two over=riding themes of the need for liberation from any form of oppression, be it religious, political, economic, social.  The second theme is that this theology comes from the oppressed and is focused on relief from this oppression.<br />Such views reduces sin to an inherent evil within society, not a society composed of individual sinners.  While Christianity surely does and must aid those who are poor and help the structuring of soceity so that justice is for all, the starting point for all theology must be the inspired Word of God.<br />Rather than the oppressed reflecting on their situation, the Word of God must be brought not to the the oppressed situation but to those oppressed and oppressive as well.'<br />Excellent intro to the field.	2001-02-04

Things taken out of context, paraphrased, others overlooked paints an unrealistic, unhistorical view of what they say is &quot;the golden age of American Christianity.&quot;<br />These three prominent Christian historians in this book give great summary of this historical evidence in this book.  What harm is done you ask?  This book so aptly demonstrates that this distorts our dialogue over current public issues by incorrectly presenting American history.<br />They carefully expound the dangers of treating the naturalistic ideals of the founders on par with Scipture and likewise a lack of discernment between God's people and worldly culture.<br />This book is a short, precise and articulate presentation against the overdramatization of our founding history which zealouts then use to bully both those inside and outside the faith for Godly purposes.  Higly recommended.	2001-02-02

The winner of this debate will be announced at a later date: judgment day.<br />This is the second debate involving Craig, the first being a debate with an evolutionist, a Nobel prize winning biochemist.  There too, Craig outdebated this gentleman as he does here with Crossan.  He puts forth arguments which the other side ignores to contend with.  He also challenges the other side to put forth evidence which they say they have and will and yet don't.<br />It seems to me that this is typical.  The liberal element is so creative and imagnitive.  It's like the mysterious &quot;Q&quot; of gospel fame, who supposedly has so much formative influence on the gospels.  Where is this evidence?  Anyone can dream up some scenario or another of what happened, but to stick with what we have is Craig's brilliance.<br />I also enjoyed Bukckley's contribution and moderatorship.  It contributed to to the flavor and fabric of this well done debate.<br />This is excellent taste of what it's like to debate historical-critical methodology.  It's like trying to nail down jello.

What kind of Lutheran and what kind of Roman Catholic?  Those who follow there official, historical, published beliefs.<br />Preus carefully shows that the recent announced settling of the theological differences through the publishing of &quot;The Joint Declaration of Justification&quot; is premature and not honest in its conclusions.<br />For centuries and still today, the major difference which separates confessions in Christianity is this doctrine of justification.  Here Preus offers evidence from Scripture, the Lutheran Confessions and from church history that unless there is true agreement in all doctrine, there is no true theological settlement, only a false ornamentation of external unity.<br />Such is our ecumenical times, and as always, confessors of the truth have such to contend with.  Dr. Preus will go down in history as one fine and valiant contender for the faith handed down.  May we who inherit such fine examples continue in his stead, and contend for the three Reformational solas without being contenious.<br />This is a major work of first class.

More so likely though is the love of power and wealth that comes from being in a good ole boys club that takes care of its own.<br />We always get nailed by someone asking about all the good they do: the Shriner's hospitals, etc.  Again, Christians will run it through the Bible to see if it will stand the test of God's Word:  &quot;Without faith it is impossible to please God.&quot;  &quot;Apart from me (attached to Jesus and His salvation by faith) you can do nothing.&quot;  (John 15:5)  This is the judgment that all good works oriented souls without saving faith in Christ Jesus alone will bring upon them for eternity unless they repent of this mistakenness and turn to Christ for forgiveness.<br />Ankerberg's book aids this by being a strong apologetic showing the unchristian nature of this religion.	2001-01-30

Hence there are no deficiencies in the Bible to be supplied by Girzone or anyone.<br />This wonderful sufficiency of Scripture applied to Girzone's opinions of Jesus' reaction to our modern spiritual situation thus justly allows us to critique his conclusions concerning this by seeing how well they stack up against the Biblical record, especially that of the Gospels.<br />A careful examination and comparison of this book to that of what the Bible teaches about Jesus notices an astonishing lack of any clear statement of the Gospel, the fundamental and only reason God became incarnate as a human!  Joshua makes no such proclamation of His coming &quot;to serve and to give His life a ransom for many&quot;  (Matt.20:28).  Also, glaringly void is any mention of Himself in His favorite way as either the Son of Man of the Son of God.  Here, Joshua speaks in generalities which suggest more of moral flavor than Jesus' concentration on the kingdom of heaven and forgiveness of sins.  Also disheartening is Girzone's total vacuum of Scripture coming from the Lord's mouth.<br />In fairness, it must be commended to Girzone for his sensitivity to aiding the poor and unfortunate of this world, and his exposure of his own church body's concentration on works righteousness and spiritual hierachy.  However, having said this, one needs to be reminded that all of these on their own, without true saving faith in the crucified Christ for sin, are worthless before the Creator/Judge of all things.<br />Therefore, this book exemplifies and attracts those who are not firm in their Biblical knowledge.  I would stronly not recommend this or any of the other Joshua series.rm in their Biblical knowledge.  I would stronly not recommend this or any of the other Joshua series.	2001-01-26

The title itself is a foretaste of what is to come, i.e. good advice on how to be more &quot;effective,&quot; such as people techniques, organization, etc., but why not concentrate on the more biblical concept: &quot;faithful.&quot;<br />Consider the Pastor Paul writing advice to Pastors Tim and Titus.  Never does he talk about this quality and effectiveness and efficiency that most books deal with on pastors who want success.  Teach the word purely.  Be a bondslave to the gospel of Christ.

Here in this book, McGrath is trying to show that popular evangelicalism has sound theology (but needs more) coherence and contact with academic theology.<br />This sits well with us, his showing both the elitism and the benefits derived from academic theologians.  However, his plug that a vacuum exists between an intellectual theology that will hold water and yet at the same time is able to survive among the ordinary believers is even more pertinent.<br />We in Lutheran circles need to heed this advice as well.

Over 78 entries alone on Amazon.com.  This book's thesis is yet another extension of the modernist mindset, that just as science has learned that truth develops and matures as it progresses, so should theology.  He interestingly hypothesizes that the real turning point in history was Luther succeeding in his arugument with Erasmus over original sin.  For one who doesn't confess the inerrancy of Scripture, Kung easily feels the mistake lies with the church going with Luther.  That's the prevailing case in his argument, shift the paradigm to reflect where current critical scholarship is on Scripture.  Interesting account, but didn't sell with this believer.	2001-01-24

This is a wakeup call for our country, but especially for the church!	2001-01-24

The church is where believers in Christ is!  So the unchurched are not part of this believing group and they cannot participate in the church's worship since it is only possible for a believer to worship God. Without faith in the true God, it is impossible to do anything pleasing to Him.<br />This unmasks the severe decline of Biblical sensitivity and discernment in Christianity today, to follow one as Hunter who puts forward congregations which do not confess the doctrines of the apostles, but in Hunter's mind, evangelize in the apostles' way.  This is not true either, e.g. see Galatians 1:6-10, and chapter 2, or John 6:52-68.  The early church believed that only those churches which followed the apostles' teachings, not just building number of followers was holding to the apostles'.<br />For those serious about this, research &quot;Eucharist and Church Fellowship in the first four centuries&quot; by W. Elert.  Hunter's book, although meaning well to grow the church, does not adhere to letting the whole counsel of God's Word be taught, believed and confess in its purity and entirety.  A false teacher.	2001-01-24

From education to media to technology, Postman is impressive in his insight into the trends and movements that pervades our times.<br />This volume focuses on science and technology taking over much of culture.  It's an easy transition of our times to assume that someone that is brilliant enough to make a rocket engine is capable of rendering educational decisions and spiritual ones.  Postman thus becomes as he states: &quot;a dissenting voice .. to moderate the din made by enthusiastic multitudes.&quot;  This will lead many on to further thought and investigation on a key aspect of our times which should not be overlooked.	2001-01-24

In a well structured search for self-esteem, Matzat shows how this can only be found in Christ crucified.  With all the time and energy spent on finding peace and rest for weary souls, Matzat offers the only solution here.  I found one particular quotation so relevant to this searching:  &quot;Are you hurting enough to give up on yourself?  Are you unhappy enough and miserable enough to turn away from yourself with all your problems and failures and seek relief in a relationship with the person of Jesus Christ?&quot;  page 82.	2001-01-24

Unassuming, hardworking golfer who until I read this book, I hadn't heard of.  Selected this book on a whim, but really enjoyed it.  Believe all golfers would, as it shows what it's like to be a golfer of Carl's caliber and how competitive it really is out there.  The narrowness at the top, and how illusive it is to stay there.	2001-01-13

Having decided how I would review this cookbook, I then read the other three reviews already here.  Amazing that we all came away with the same impression:  marvelous stuff here, not easy but delicious.  I first tried the Fall Squash Soup with Chorizo and Spicy Cinammon Croutons, and it was a knockout dish.  Everyone just marveled at its layers of flavor, so well blended.  This is truly a beautiful book, and the regulars at her restaurant for lunch are blessed.	2001-01-13

Wish there was something like this for various major metro areas -- like where to find those tough to get items locally.  However, what with the phone and web connections these days, its so quick to get them via ups and fedex.  Hats off to the Engels for such a neat find for us food junkies.	2001-01-13

Truly shows not only their Biblical illiteracy but also and more important the hate and subervisive spirit which the TV renown leaders show in reaction of this book.  Suggest one also checks out the fine books by Don Matzat which corrects some minor theological problems of MacArthur.

Koivisto has spent time looking into this difficult topic of Christian fellowship.  Sounds so modern to look for a core, a common denominator to sort out all the multitudes of Christian voices on this doctrine and that.  Although he unsuccessfully attempts to refute Sasse's valid historical view that there never has been a golden time of unity in the church, he proceeds to find a core orthodoxy which achieves this minimal threshold of God-pleasing belief.  Returning to Vincent of Lerins and others, he feels this is it.  However, he makes no effort to refute the Bibical admonition to find such unity in all of God's words, e.g. John 17 and Mt. 28:20.  To read another opinion, try The Church, by Kurt Marquart.	2001-01-12

His love for this work and its complications meld well together in his years of teaching, research and preaching from Revelation.

Books	2	16	57	N	N	Not what church is about	Yancey fills a necessary niche with those who have had experience with church which causes them to fall away and then fill a void that needs filling.  However, his bottom line perspective of worship being God has an audience watching worshippers seeking His presence in their hearts is not what God seeks at all.  God seeks those who worship Him in spirit and in truth.  Thus, where is God in worship?  In our heart?  What would He want with that sin-filled, darkened, old thing?  What He wants is &quot;chesed,&quot; Hebrew word for &quot;covenant faithfulness.&quot; Our inability totally to do &quot;chesed&quot; caused God to do it for us, incarnate, sacramentally in Christ.  Thus, where is God for us?  In the Gospel preached in its purity and distributed in the sacraments distributed according to His Testament.  Yancey is yet to discover this.  Maybe his void will lead him to this.  Suggest Yancey and others still seeking God would read Gene Vieth's terrific spiritual journey: &quot;The Spirituality of the Cross.&quot;	2001-01-12

Organized well, this volume will aid the Christian to understand Islam, and the Muslim reading to understand Christianity's response.  Of major significance is their consistent emphasis on Islam's uncertainty of salvation contrasted with the Christian's full assurance that in the Gospel of Christ no believer will ever be disappointed.

Flew throughout dodges the argument which Meithe presents: the analogy of being.  All Flew really does, Meithe catches him on it:  &quot;Flew has simply made a statement here.&quot;  pg. 162.  Flew's continuing discussion about the many different notions of God is irrelevant to this debate as Meithe scolds him.  Typical is the irritation that continues in never truly debating what Meithe puts forward, i.e. that God is the &quot;merciful Creator and Sustainer of all that exists.&quot;  Fascinating appendices by Ayer, Swinburne and Kung.

Probably most striking and true is his conclusion that American religion is more closer to gnosticism than Christianity.

Such an outstanding historian as Noll would do well to give us a major tome on the history of the church from the perspective of its reaction to clear thinking and education.  The church of emotional seems to have been surging and popular these days, so aptly titled by Packer &quot;Hot Tub Christianity.&quot;  An insight many are already aware of and trying to turn around in the church, Noll puts in such a marvelous word construct: &quot;should help evangelicals realize that much of what is distinctive about American evangelicalism is not essential to Christianity.&quot;  This says much of where we're at and where we need reform.	2001-01-11

Books	5	9	10	N	N	A Voice Crying in this wilderness we call America	Horton certainly is well-read and knows from whence he speaks.  The church is not into culture wars, but in the proclamation of the Gospel.  This admonition challenges the church to be the church, to be about its Father's business and will here on earth: &quot;We have turned the one true God of history and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ into a tribal deity of the American experience -- we who are supposed to be the guardians of absolute truth.&quot;  He so righty puts forward the message that spiritual warfare is what is at hand and gives frank suggestions for turning towards the real battlefront.  Only the Calvinistic leaning towards soverignty rather the cross of Christ detracted from an outstanding, bold message.	2001-01-11

(see 2 Timothy 4)  Packer does a great analytical job, but his Reformed theology is not the answer:  we don't need just the soverignty of God, we need the cross and its cleansing us of our sins.  We don't need to try harder, we need forgiveness for our failing to pull trying harder off.  Whenever one begins with what we have to do (law), there is never enough one can do.  The law measures and qunatifies.  The gospel hands out what God did in Christ and Him crucified for our sins.  Nonetheless, Packer is an excellent writer and this book is right on with his diagnosis.	2001-01-11

Trotter's cookbooks are wonderful to read, but on the insane side for the average home gourmet to attempt, what with all those exotic ingredients and multiple techniques.  Most of us save those for that out of the ordinary culinary adventure.  Here, however, is one that presents gourmet dishes one won't find just anywhere, but with toned down hard to find ingredients and streamlined steps.  I made his Chocholate Praline Bread Pudding as one of four Christmas desserts and the guests just kept marveling over how good it was.

Rather than trust exclusively in what the media filters out for us on a topic such as Near Death Experiences, Rawlings invites all to turn to the real source: God's Word.  Although many might want to discern the reality of such experiences from reported incidents, we all would do well to understand our own reality in Biblical terms.  Additionally, Rawlings has a fine section on other &quot;out-of-body experiences.	2001-01-09

Kraus studies the Psalter thematically, which is a bit tiresome when studying a single Psalm, but nonetheless, so valuable in his grouping together of concepts, words, phrases, etc.  Although there surface periodically (but not frequently) touches of historicial-critical methodology and findings, this volume represents some of the finest theology work on the OT Hymnal.  He even includes a fine expose on the NT use of Psalms.  Not sure how the average layperson without any Hebrew knowledge would find this work, but certainly, there is meat here for them to find and devour smilingly.	2001-01-07

Presents realistic insight into the dream, conception, and final reality of a golf course. This is similar to grinding it out that all of us hackers and pros must go through to get to that stage in our round or game where it all comes together. The bird lady story is illustrative of my fascination with this book.  It so kept my attention because it seemed so realistic to what real life in golf course architecture must entail.

These jurists have well researched and well presented the case for contemporary jurisprudence to return to its founding roots concerning the separation and establishment clauses.  Particulary ringing in my reading will be this quote: &quot;The Constitution, the nation's fundamental law, cannot be legimately be construed to afford redress to every citizen who takes offense at public expressions, whether religious or secular in content.

The analogy to keeping grass green is so useful in this case.  Whatever the relationship, if attention and effort are not applied, only decay and defoilaging can occur.  Thus, the phenomenon we see in society:  individuals moving from one relationship to another, the grass always looking more attractive anywhere else but the one which has been deprived the proper attention.

Carson as a conservative exegete wraps all of his understanding up in heremeneutics, which is a great place for any of us to begin. Of course, most lay Christians will not understand where this is coming from, but I don't think this is the audience Carson has in mind.<br />Most productive from my reading were the number of instances where Carson actually engaged in dialogue with people who believed there are many paths to God outside of Christ.<br />Good command of many topics, including history, philosophy, etc.  I find this volume useful in also returning to it as reference when dealing with pluralism in the modern church.	2000-12-29

We've now seen this come to the fruitful realization by the Florida Supreme Court's day in the media spotlight recently.<br />Bork presents argument after argument for liberalism spilling its way into cultural segments by presenting substantial data to back up his hypotheses.

Especially valuable is the admonition for leaders to trust in a creed, a guiding set of principles, a high calling and purpose for their existence and effort.  Troubling however, but did not totally negate the gems of this book, is the author's enthusisam for listening to the sheep and making them the thrust and not the Good Shepherd.  Biblically, this is non-existant, but is read into Scripture from a marketing oriented culture.	2000-12-01

Wells is right on with his analysis and diagnostics.  While the postmodern, contemporary church will not particularly like his suggestion for change, certainly it has God's mark of approval.  Wells sums it up on page 207: &quot;The Church's problem today is simply that it does not believe that, without tinkering, the Gospel will be all that interesting to modern people.&quot; Let modern people do whatever, I'm with Wells and the Gospel.	2000-12-01

This book was similar to any par four played: average drive down the middle, with an average approach shot thirty feet from the pin.  The birdie putt slid by two inches on the left. Putted in for par. An adamant Couples fan, I probably had higher expectations about a really good read about my favorite player.  Learned alot about him, but style left me weary.  Shot after shot description of each tournament left me tired.  Not bad though overall.  Anything on Freddie is appreciated!	2000-11-30

Where else can one get a cookbook which has so many recipes from the world's greatest chefs and at the same time contribute to such a worthy cause? This is such a neat concept!  I've made several of these recipes for entertaining.  Patrick's recipes have sophistication and comfort all rolled up in one.  Diners at my table have raved about the food prepared from his recipes.<br />This is a keeper!  Buy one for yourself and give many to all those who love food and cooks!	2000-11-28

I've cooked three recipes from this, and each was just spectacular in both taste and presentation.  The difficulty in prep was medium, and he provides some alternative ingredients as well which really helps.<br />His balance between heat and sweet is sophisticated.  Use of buffalo and antelope is remarkable.  Takes me back to my western upbringing now that I reside in the midwest.<br />His anthropology background makes the surrounding test fascinating.  Well researched and presented.  Great read! Will become a favorite in my collection.	2000-11-28

When will we ever learn?  How many times in the Scriptures did God's people turn to everything else but to Him?<br />So with Schaller.  Turn to keeping up with changing cultural landscapes and God might give your church a chance to survive.  We've stopped trusting in God's means to counter Anti-Christian culture: Christ crucified.<br />Sure, you answer.  Preach and teach that and people will repel so quickly.  They won't be attracted nor put up with that.  And there we have it.  Apostacy is where we're at.<br />What about a real reformation of those who want the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?  We've given up on truth, we're tired of fighting for and fighting to find and remain in it as a culture.  But the church, the remanant of Christ, will always be built on the truth of God's Word, which frees them and offends many.<br />Schaller is good on trends, very poor on truth!	2000-11-07

As other readers have testified, this book is hard to put down until one has devoured every word.  Captivating subject matter from the beginning without a clear, stated thesis for the book until the end.<br />The three contrasting chef experiences captured different facets of the trend towards American culinary excellence.  Having personally only eaten at one of the three, the author actually made me feel as though I'd already supped at the others as well.<br />This drive for perfection with different motives is revealing.  Hope he writes more such penetrating and persuasively presented books on a topic many of us are fascinated by as many different levels of engagement.	2000-10-05

Not a waste of the money at all.	2000-07-12

Second, in the commentary section he clearly sets forward the  meaning of the text in light of the historical understanding and recent  scholastic views.<br />This is a marvelously useful set to guide the Christian  who wants the most out of Luke.  He will find Christ here on every page.	2000-01-31

My heart did burn with God's Spirit as I read Prof. Marquart's  wonderful dogma on the church and its fellowship.  Since fellowship in this  era of ecumenism is so widely discussed, this book is vital in the church's  consideration of moving to the oneness the Bible admonishes us towards  strongly.  As Marquart shows, it is Christ's body built and founded on His  Word and it will always be!  What is disagreed on is what is and is not  God's Holy Word.  Thus, this unforutnate presupposition is critical to  answering the questions this dogma teaches.  Marquart eloquently and  clearly shows that the Bible puts forth the truth of the pure Gospel and  Sacraments of the Lord which deliver the forgiveness of sins for the sake  of Christ crucified is the heart and core of the church and its fellowship.<br />Refutation of this on the basis of Scriptures would be difficult.  I  haven't seen anything which even addresses this as well.	1998-11-09

This is a phenomenal work!  To those of the pastoral/theological bent, this is must reading.  However, anyone would be fascinated with this topic, as it is universal.<br />Groopman depicts life/death in a passionate, attached way that we all desire in our physician.  This subject encompasses all of life, as the wisest human wrote in his diary: &quot;A good name is better than a good oinment.  And the day of one's death is better than the day of one's birth.  It is better to go to ahouse of mourning than to go to a house of feasting, because that is the end of every man, and the living takes it to heart.&quot;  Ecclesiastes 7:1,2.<br />Groopman helps us take this to heart in this excellent read.	1998-06-05
