Imagine no Pippen or Phil Jackson,Horace Grant,Dennis Rodman to enhance His Skills&Depth as a Player? Jordan's Career in DC as a Player was Hit&Miss at best.He had some Great moments, but He also dealt with Reality such as Father time,making some suspect Moves for Players&also a interesting choice for a Coach in Doug Collins who pretty much was seen as Jordan's Puppet&treated as such by other players.the Book didn't shed much light apart from what I had already gathered about what the glaring problems were. a Good friend of Mine said it best abotu Jordan's time in DC: He was basically getting with Buddys&wanted to have fun as to Winning or improving anything.I wish Kobe Bryant had have taken heed to what Michael Jordan went through those two years in DC with the Wizards because that could happen to Him as well with playing with so-so Talent&Undersized Mentally&Physically. this is a Good read though.	2004-11-07
