Now IN THE WAKE OF THE JOMON, we follow a specific route historians say an ancient people in pre-historic Japan took in open rafts or canoes, over the course of generations around the northern Pacific Rim, up modernday Russia, over the Bering Sea, along the Alaskan archipelago & south into America. <br /> <br />Always filled with intimate details of the characteristics of the sea, the absurdity & frustrations of world bureaucracies, the meeting of cultures, as well as the effort to undertake the kinds of expeditions Jon Turk favors, IN THE WAKE OF THE JOMON will cast you adrift in both history & philosophy, as well as drenching you with the thrills & spills of a dangerous & beautiful journey. <br /> <br />For all Readers who yearn to go down to the sea & muck about in boats, in far away places.	2005-10-01

I & PURGATORY, Archer continues his scathing attack against prison conditions & atrocities, stating, at the same time that prison reform is the need of the hour, & has plenty of suggestions to offer, as one who has experienced it all. <br /> <br />Unlike the first two, HEAVEN is more voluminous & poignant.

The Ipps, as they were known then, relocated to Richmond following their liberation and later changed their name to Ipson. Their story has been re-created at the Virginia Holocaust Museum in Richmond, Virginia.  <br /> <br />IZZY'S FIRE is Eta's answer to those who say the Holocaust never happened, & is a tribute to personal bravery & the unquenchable resources of compassion, quick-wittedness & sheer determination to live, with a lot of luck thrown in. <br /> <br />Complete with maps & photos, IZZY'S FIRE is a story for all time. <br />	2005-08-10

It is about the memories & the ever-present fear, the motives & the relationships, the hate-warped lives & the soul-killing madness survivors must live with. It is also about generations doing what was done unto them, & about the doctors whose lies make a person crazy & taint all they touch. It is also a tale of a passage through the hell of war, power & victimhood into action, truth & redemption. It is, ultimately, about giving in to evil or doing what is good. <br /> <br />Outstanding!	2005-07-26

He really hasn't paid any attention to the fact that his Dad recently lost his job, so when his parents don't give him the mountain bike he wanted for his tenth birthday, Robbie's really mad. <br /> <br />That night, bitterly disappointed he watches a meteor shower & decides to make a wish on one of the falling stars. The next morning, as far as Robbie's concerned, nothing has happened so he sulks off to school. When he gets home his Dad has been rehired & takes him to buy that mountain bike.

Rebeccasreads highly recommends EMPIRES OF THE WORD as a dense, fascinating, informative & accessible read. <br /> <br />At 640 pages with Notes, Bibliography & Index, it will certainly get the world of words talking, in all their various tongues.  <br /> <br />What were the origins of language, & where & when did they start? <br />Why did Latin die when the Roman Empire collapsed & Greek survive? <br />Outside of the Middle East why is Arabic primarily the language of liturgy? <br />How did Chinese thrive even after millenia of conquests from outsiders? <br />How far from home did Sanskrit roam? <br />What languages did the Spanish conquistadors kill off? <br />How did European languages stay alive despite constant oppression? <br />What is the real career of English? <br />What are the Current Top Twenty languages of the world today, & is their future secured? <br /> <br />EMPIRES OF THE WORD is the way I love to learn history, telling the stories of our mother tongues. Sure there are armies marching across the globe bringing with them, besides war & pestilence, commerce, language & interpreters. There are explorers sailing the seven seas making landfall in strange places among stranger peoples, taking home unknown commodities & new words for them. There were also merchants who travelled overland, exchanging goods, customs & translations. All took their languages with them, becoming multi-lingual & creating new ones with which to barter & carry on diplomacy. <br /> <br />Just one question: were the Fertile Crescent writers predominantly left-handed, & when & where did we start writing left to right? <br /> <br />Outstanding!	2005-07-25

The two lives of a lawyer -- the personal & the professional are also craftily highlighted.

Sandra Scoppettone has breathed life into an historic New York era when good women didn't smoke on the streets, food was bought with ration books, girls danced with GIs at the USOs, people listened to the world on their radios, male chauvinism was alive & rampant, & certain skirts gave as good as they got! <br /> <br />Faye Quick didn't start out a private dick, she was hired by Woody Mason to be his secretary until, a couple of years later, he signed up for the duration & insisted she keep his home fire burning. So now she's doing her bit for the war effort, carrying a gat which Woody insisted she learn how to shoot. She's hired by a high-class husband & wife to find out why their daughter got herself killed. & what her parents haven't told Faye sets her after a philandering NYU professor & a shady character with a horrible side business.

It gives practical advice about navigating today's medical establishment, as well as useful Internet links & tips for patient advocates. <br /> <br />The courage of both mother & daughter, who refused to give in to defeat, is the backbone of the book. It should bring encouragement to everyone who suffers from \\"undiagnosable\\" pain. Rebecca's \\"mystery illness\\" affects over 86,000 American children every year. Up to date information about treatment for such cases is given. If it saves even one child from enduring the year of horror & agony that Rebecca & her family lived through, KILLING EARL was well worth writing.	2005-07-01

Gagin's debut novel, in which he lays out a rollicking tale of adventure of deals & double-crosses, plumbing the depths of human depravity, & climbing to the summit of honor & dignity. <br /> <br />With his CODE ALPHA this author has gotten better.	2005-06-17

Eventually he reaches them after he tells them the Indian legend of how the multi-colored Crow became soot black, & when he creates the secret club for outcasts, he starts them thinking about what they have survived & who they really are. <br /> <br />As at all summer camps romance blossoms, & Russel falls for \\"bad boy\\" Web, a handsome counselor who is playing the field, which includes Min, & trouble brews between them. Meanwhile, he's playing matchmaker for Gunnar... & then there's deeply scarred Otto who plays a guitar & sings beautiful songs. <br /> <br />When a forest fire threatens & the camp has to evacuate, everyone's mettle is tested, & things shake down into real relationships. <br /> <br />Some readers may balk at equating the disfigurement of burn scars with the tribulations of being gay in a straight world, however, THE ORDER OF THE POISON OAK, like THE GEOGRAPHY CLASS, is told from Russel's point of view & is, therefore, full of his teenage angst, philosophies & humor.	2005-06-17

Set as WII starts, Sidney is in New York to be a singer. There she meets & falls in love with Laurus Moss, a Danish pianist. After they marry & she becomes pregnant, Laurus realizes he has to go back & help his family in Denmark to escape. He makes it to London & joins the Resistance there, keeping in contact with his brother & sister at home, trying to get his parents out to Sweden.  <br /> <br />LEEWWAY COTTAGE is worth the read, about a remarkable saga of family life on both sides of the Atlantic during & after WWII, especially the research into the Nazi invasion of Denmark, the Resistance movement, & its survivors.	2005-06-05

This time Dee brings to book a gang involved in embezzlement of government funds. Side by side he also investigates the murder of a girl who dies on her wedding night. <br /> <br />Judge Dee-Jen Dijeh (630-700 A.D.) was a Magistrate known for his wisdom & wit in China, & his stories were a part of the local folklore. Robert Van Gulik, who had a historian's interest in China in the early 1950s, was fascinated by the tales of this judge, & finally collected & fictionalized them into four volumes. <br /> <br />The wit, ingenuity, & genius of Judge Dee is well reflected. Remember the old tales of King Solomon the Just -- well, give them an Asian flavor, a touch of Old China -- & you get Judge Dee. <br /> <br />All of Judge Dee's books are most pleasurable - - worthy of 10 stars!	2005-06-05

Rebeccasreads highly recommends BUDDHA'S WARRIORS as an enthralling account of a fabled brotherhood of freedom fighters as their nation came under seige 60 years ago. From unmapped Himalayan valleys to Beijing back doors to Colorado training camps, we follow the fierce few who would rather die than live enslaved by an alien culture. <br /> <br />Most of us in the Western world have a romantic & confused image of Tibet, fueled, of course, by our vision of Shangri-La. BUDDHA'S WARRIORS is no fairy tale, & no movie with a happy ending. The devastation of the Tibetan people & their culture is still going on. <br /> <br />Mikel Dunham, author of an exquisite photo album SAMYE: A Prilgimage to the Birthplace of Tibetan Buddhism, has set the narrative of BUDDHA'S WARRIORS around the oral transcripts of the Tibetan men he interviewed, the ones who actually fought the Chinese, telling the inside story of this historic modern fight against conquest which, for many \\"reasons\\" the rest of the world has largely ignored. <br /> <br />BUDDHA'S WARRIORS gives a vivid picture of Tibetan life before, during, & after Mao's takeover. It is a saga of brave soldiers & cowardly traitors; hope against desolation, courage against repression, atheism against Buddhism -- the real-life fight between good & the evil empire.	2005-06-05

Then Captain Diggs has a birthday out on desert patrol with the Taliban making life dangerous, & many more months to go before he heads for Home Sweet Home.  <br /> <br />YOUR NEIGHBOR WENT TO WAR is an inspirational glimpse of what our soldiers are doing on our behalf, & how our voices make the duty easier. It is a unique & much-needed album of insights & outpourings from strangers & friends.	2005-05-22

Then they come to a standstill, growing in one place until they finish school. <br /> <br />Then it's on to college, to love, to other states, to marriages & babies. Back & forth the stories of hard choices, sad choices unfold along with the 1960s. <br /> <br />RIDING ON A RAINBOW starts out strong, & then settles into a dirge of misery as the three nomads try to cope with stability. As pungent as her first book ON INDIAN TIME.	2005-05-22

There's a fantastic journey & conflict about good & evil, lost & rediscovered identities. It is rich with humor & heart, & filled with quirky characters & magykal charms, kind ghosts & frightening towers. <br /> <br />A gladsome & grand fantasy with lots of goosebumps & giggles, & a serious theme. Angie Sage hails from London, England & is now living in darkest Cornwall. She has infused this first book about a boy who grew up without a name, with both the light & dark side of life. For those of us who remember learning about the English civil war of the 1600s when the colorful Cavaliers & dour Roundheads battled for the throne (as too for anyone who's read anything about Communism), the life of SEPTIMUS HEAP, until he is found by his family, will ring many alarms bells. <br /> <br />SEPTIMUS HEAP: Magyk is a tale about taken & found children, lost happier times & oppressive rules written in a refreshing & enchanting way. A fine beginning to a new series.	2005-05-22

Joe is a rarity: an honest out-of-work lawyer, who comes from a Mafia  family background. <br /> <br />Besides the gripping suspense there is much wit to be had in THE INSIDE RING. I look forward to Joe DeMarco's next case.	2005-05-22

It's manly & amusing, emotional & instructive, about a young man who survived to tell the tale, about another young man who survived war to give guidance to a life of peace. <br /> <br />Quinn, a clever & cynical high school senior, & his huge, Letterman classmate Winnie are out exploring the mountains around Boulder, Colorado after school one day. Quinn is there to satisfy his photography addiction, & Winnie because he likes to think of other things beside football. When they come upon a lone, old man on the shore of a hidden lake, painting the scene in oils, they surprise him. Before anyone can stop it, there's a bit of a fight in which Quinn puts his foot through the painting, & while trying to free himself from the old man's attack, gets whacked on the cheekbone by one of his cameras. <br /> <br />After peace is restored & the old man gives Quinn his business card, & the boys hightail it for home. Unfortunately, home is where the real battle is raging. Quinn is failing all his classes, except photography, & his parents expectations. Then he finds out not only has he been caught plagiarizing a history report, he's been given Fs in everything, & his parents crack down:  no car keys, no computer, no music & worse... no more cameras. <br /> <br />Quinn's life is out of control. For two months he's been holding a self-righteous siege in his dirty room, purposefully keeping his hair long & unwashed, & testing just how far he can push both at home & at school. He's been kind of happy in his misery, until the day he meets the man whose picture he took & whose painting he stomped, in a cafe, & they start talking. <br /> <br />Lots of everyday taboo subjects get raised: healthy & unhealthy habits; laziness vs passion, honor vs skating around the truth, what education really is & what grades really mean.	2005-05-22

You kind of get the picture of a ferocious little terrier dog, barking at an elephant's heels. <br /> <br />Then JJ's father tells him a story about how he too was a bully & what happened to the boy he tormented. Impressed, JJ goes off to Patrick's home to sort things out, only to discover how alike they are, especially in their passion for arm wrestling.  <br /> <br />Pretty soon, they come up with a way to win friends & influence everyone at school, JJ is going to be Patrick's, the \\"Hammer Hand\\", manager.	2005-05-22

Steve Jordan is on a flight from California to Denver, when a sudden mid-air near-collision sends him spiraling into thin air.  Miraculously, he lands on a snow-covered mountain, where he struggles for survival, until rescue arrives. <br /> <br />The media soon make him a household name, & a national hero. One of the interviews he gives is to a religious magazine.

It is based upon the author's family letters, diaries & tales told by his grandmother who lived during those turbulent times. It is unabashedly passionate & a larger-than-life dramatic recreation of the glory & tragedy of time when horsepower & pageantry dominated. Where the royalty & the military were inextricably entwined, & when courage & honor were beset by subterfuge & alliances. <br /> <br />Better than a history text book, twice as lively, if a bit unedited!	2005-05-06

Everyone mostly comes off as the genuine article, with all the flaws of greed, deception, arrogance, neediness, stupidity, stubbornness & faint-heartedness, along with the pathos of people learning to trust, love & make whole lives out of their fragmented hearts. <br /> <br />A satisfying evening's read! I certainly want to catch up with her first legal thriller HOSTILE WITNESS.	2005-05-06

It follows a group of men & women attending university, as they foment unrest, connect with other colleges, create angst out of thin air, worry about the draft, utter platitudes about social issues, & practice rank chauvinism within their group. It is a montage of faculty meetings & political conferences, private conversations & public encounters, moments of peer pressure, manipulation, cowardice & conspiracy. <br /> <br />If you have any doubt about the direction of THE RAPE OF ALMA MATER, the final chapter raises the sinister specter of misplaced ethics, misappropriated morals & misused polemics. A creepy indictment of the artifice in academia.	2005-04-26

The contrast from his earlier years with the later ones is all the more poignant because of his own maturity & standing. <br /> <br />While Seth Faison tells much of the inner machinations of the Communist Party, its leaders & internecine power plays, as well as the hierarchies of journalism -- all of which is fascinating, neither is as interesting as the everyday complexities of social rituals, & the people he meets, loves, & leaves. <br /> <br />He is there when Mikhail Gorbachev visits; for the death of Hu Yaobang; the leadership battle between Zhao Ziyang & Deng Xiaoping; the Tiananman Square uprising; the opening up of Shanghai, & for when Falun Gong spread like wild fire. <br /> <br />In SOUTH OF THE CLOUDS we are gifted with glimpses of the way China thinks -- politically & ideologically; the philosophy behind its ineluctable conformity; its implacable bureaucratic state of mind; its beliefs, religion, & identity. We also learn how complex & poetic is its language; how multi-layered its mores; how to find the \\"back door\\" to just about anything, & how to think with two hearts. <br /> <br />Outstanding!	2005-04-22

Life After Pedophilia, Abuse and Neglect	Books	4	4	4	N	N	the dark side of single family homes	Rebeccasreads highly recommends SO, WHAT'S NORMAL? as a brave & determined effort at calling parental abuse & sexual predation by its name, seeing how it damages, & continues to control adult behavior, & then getting on with life, & helping others set themselves free. <br /> <br />SO, WHAT'S NORMAL? is an astonishing & difficult narrative of one woman's journey through a traumatic childhood, & how it tainted her adult life, until, one particular Christmas, she suddenly understands why her life keeps spiraling out of control. Threatened with the loss of the one man she's ever truly loved, & who truly loves her, Rhonnie must face her past, or lose everything she's struggled for, as old & abusive patterns of behavior destroy her safety, sanity & happiness. <br /> <br />Part of turning to look at her demons, is to go back & examine, from her adult perspective, what happened behind the closed front door of her father & mother's home. To walk through the valley of despair that was her childhood. To name her father's sexual predation, & her mother's complicity. You are left with no doubt that both her parents were erratic & intentionally violent, intimidating tyrants. <br /> <br />Having told the past in depth, all the way up to the present, I was waiting for something about the therapy Rhonnie must have gone through. I'd have preferred far fewer details about the state of the many offspring her third husband & she brought to their marriage, & all the repetitive marital & domestic dysfunctions. Nonetheless, by recording the dramas that beset her which came in predictable cycles, Rhonnie offers hope for those who haven't remembered yet, or are on the cusp of disclosure. <br /> <br />I wanted much, much more about the therapy sessions that guided her from victim into freedom, & how Rhonnie learnt the language of healing & transformation, particularly as this author founded LEAPS & BOUNDS, a non-profit organization whose mission is to extend hope & help to others, by fundingrehabilitative therapy.	2005-03-28

Charlie Donnell Adams on the beachhead of Normandy D-Day+36.  <br /> <br />As a primer of those times, THE MEETING OF ANNI ADAMS is actually quite good.

From out of the dark, a figure comes flying into the fray, scattering dogs & boys. It's old man Draeger, who takes him home, mops him up & serves him tea. <br /> <br />All Draeger wants to do is be left alone to drink, & remember the good old days in the Dutch East Indies, before the War. All Paul wants is to learn how to do what he saw Draeger do that evening. In time he wears the old man down, & so start the years of grueling instruction in the old-world martial art of Pentjak Silat. <br /> <br />After graduation, & a seduction into a life of crime, the only place Paul can go is into military, where he handily survives basic training. Then he chooses to try out for the Green Berets before shipping out to Vietnam.  <br /> <br />AMERICAN WARRIOR is packed with action & choices, deceit & loyalty, remorseless games of power, & fighting the enemy. It immerses you in a rich & violent tale of courage, skill & becoming.	2005-03-28

Together they become disciples to a guru & his religious movement. This is an important aspect of that era: when gurus, of all stripes, came out of India, drawing to themselves eager & naive searchers for the way to godliness. They brought their own brands of mind-control, dominance & rewards, all exotically wrapped up in 100% devotion, pure living through meditation, community activism & evangelizing.  <br /> <br />Deborah Santana brilliantly describes the euphoria, the magical attraction of someone so revered, & the gladsome sense of belonging & achievement. She also bluntly records the descent from favored disciples into disillusionment, excommunication & separation. <br /> <br />On into the world of Carlos Santana, his family, his music & their marriage. When they decide to start a family, Deborah Santana's memories are bright with ardor, insights & a growing maturity. & then, the evil of infidelity sneaks in, & more lessons are to be learnt. <br /> <br />SPACE BETWEEN THE STARS is engrossing, evocative & memorable.	2005-03-07

Settle down with this big, big book & relive the ideas that inspired us, & get a rare glimpse of the heroes from another time & another place.<br /><br />Because these are public speeches, there will be repetition - relax & let the words flow over you. & while most of us won't notice it, what we read from the book in no way indicates the timbre, cadence & nuances of the spoken word, so it would have been a wonderful completion had a DVD sound recording of one or two of Nelson Mandela's speeches been included.<br /><br />The extraordinary power of IN HIS OWN WORDS is in, once again, hearing legend's way of expressing himself, who, along with Mahatma Gandhi & Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., is one of the most articulate, courageous, & respected men of our time. The list of people who contributed their impressions is extraordinary, & illustrates how deeply Nelson Mandela changed our lives & our world.	2005-02-28

Through her ebullient & articulate voice, we discover some slightly warped wisdom & a mess of good cheer. <br /> <br />THE CHOPSTICKS-FORK PRINCIPLE is a memoir about how to reconcile the expectations of families & society at large, & how to raise a child in a respectful context while also choosing the \\"path less traveled\\". Race, class, & gender issues interweave seamlessly in her wry & sly narrative, all spiced with the sweet & sour, the serious & hilarious.	2005-02-28

This time, however, the spectacular wilderness gets the better of him. <br /> <br />Or perhaps that's what vision quests are all about: to walk through the valley of your own death to come out the other side, pounds lighter, with a clearer focus on who you are, where you came from & where you're going. <br /> <br />Craig Childs writes like Georgia O'Keeffe paints -- spare, brilliant & memorable. <br />	2005-02-28

In the process she figures out what sorrow means, & comes to terms with her male-dominated faith.	2005-02-28

Franklin & Dr. Wells ramp up their investigation. <br /> <br />MURDER ON THE STREETCAR is another satisfying mystery, with a different pace & language from the dime-a-dozen ones on the shelves. It offers far more in the way of thinking things through. <br /> <br />Dr. Bond infuses this mystery with as many fascinating insights into the minds of the suspects & their motives, as she did in THE DEADLY JIGSAW PUZZLE.	2005-02-15

Deeply intuitive, throat-clenching in the sorrow & pain of a wounded heart & a desperate soul, crying out for purpose & courage, even as his mother asks him for one final promise: that he not let her suffer longer than she can bear. <br /> <br />We've come a long way in family & grief counseling since Larry Cuocci was seventeen, & had to walk through the valley of his mother's death. While drama & tragedy thunder from every page like an Italian opera, & a young man's sexual yearnings & adventures tickle you into giggles, it is Larry Cuocci's lambent language that illumines his memories of administering to his tortured mom, & grasping life with both hands, & doing it his way. <br />--------------------------------- <br />	2005-02-13

Luke, the liberal optimist, has a streak of naivete a mile wide. TC, the impoverished pessimist, has all the charm of a 'gator & has discovered not only can he make people believe him, he starts to believe himself. <br /> <br />BLOOD BROTHERS is also a study in race relations & social mores: how they once were, & how they still are, underneath all the modern PCness. & about the bigotry of Blacks & Whites; Jews & Christians; the wealthy & the poor; the powerful & the powerless. <br /> <br />Absolutely spellbinding, with one helluva twist toward the end.	2005-02-13

While visiting war memorials in England & the Continent, Cory Kilvert began the search for the stories behind the medals he'd been collecting most of his life. <br /> <br />ECHOES OF ARMAGEDDON 1914-1918 are those stories as well as the twists & turns the author's search took to find living relatives who remembered the eight British soldiers consumed in the fires of the Great War. As you read these eight men who never came home come again come alive again, especially when you see the photos. <br /> <br />Cory Kilvert lets us be flies on the wall as the blunders of the War to End All Wars tragically unfold, clearly showing how few of the movers & shakers of the time understood what was happening, & how even fewer knew when it was all over.  <br /> <br />ECHOES OF ARMAGEDDON 1914-1918 could have been dreary & lifeless instead, with the deftness of a born story-teller, Cory Kilvert has breathed life back into these long-ago warriors so we may meet them, their families & legacies, & occasionally their surviving relatives, as well as their commanding officers & brothers-in-arms. <br /> <br />Rebeccasreads  highly recommends ECHOES OF ARMAGEDDON 1914-1918 as a worthy addition to your war library.	2005-01-23

Through the reflections of the 28 Veterans in WE WERE THERE, we see how racism affected Americans who willingly served their country which only gave lip service to the words: \\"freedom and justice for all\\". These men & women signed up during times of war often eagerly, sometimes as the only way to get out of trouble. Even as they served in a community that belittled them, they were willing to give their all. <br /> <br />It's as if going to war against our enemies wasn't enough, to be an African American, you had to survive, as these Veterans' stories ably show, soul-crushing racism within the military. Executive Order 9981 signed in 1948 was supposed to have changed all of that. As these reminiscents show, it took decades to defeat racism within the armed services so they could become truly integrated. <br /> <br />RebeccasReads highly recommends WE WERE THERE as a unique & exceptional glimpse into what it was like to be an African American in the armed forces since World War II. <br /> <br />Could have had 50 voices & not been repetitive. Could not put it down!	2004-11-07

Often intensely lyrical, gigglingly funny & always magical -- with sea creatures galore, Humpback Whales, Porpoises & Turtles, oh my..! <br /> <br />One of the endearing aspects of THE CITY OF THE GOLDEN SUN is how the boys see Wiley's world & learn how to adjust to it. They haven't quite figured out how much time has elapsed since their lives under the sea & now on top of the Earth. <br /> <br />A fine sequel to THE FISHERMAN'S SON.	2004-11-07

She's got a wry Los Angeles sense of humor, a naive sense of danger & some unique ways of getting out of it. <br /> <br />FALSE PROFITS is a well written pulp mystery -- good for a commute or two. <br />	2004-10-25

Entirely Tommy Franks' homespun voice: clear, concise & detailed, all the time lightly flavored with scenes from his domestic life & spiced with his charming & everso lame humor. This is a rough-hewn, self-deprecating tall Texan who writes poetry & who, working 24/7 on behalf of his men & his country, commands respect & loyalty. A no-nonsense tactician with a vision for the new military, who never forgot the troops he sent into harm's way, nor the politicians he had to work with. <br /> <br />While not controversial by today's standards of tell-all, back-biting memoirs, AMERICAN SOLDIER contains many nuggets which set the record straight about life in the military, both past & present: from the Vietnam War era & the post-action anti-military disarray & dishevelment; through the Cold War fields in Germany; to the years leading up to the Gulf War & its \\"CNN events\\"; into the most dangerous area of the world -- the Middle East. & then, when Gen. Tommy Franks was on Cyprus, the attacks of 9/11 & their aftermath; the months leading up to Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, & the intel on WMD threats & the reasons for Operation Iraqi Freedom, & its engagement. All make for an informative & insightful memoir. <br /> <br />Rebeccasreads highly recommends AMERICAN SOLDIER as absolutely outstanding. Could not put it down! At 590 pages, it's rich with details of command & how a modern American general, his President & Cabinet prepare for & engage in war.	2004-10-25

Rebeccasreads highly recommends LOST IN TIBET as a fascinating recollection of a WWII drama when five American airmen were flying their C87 over The Hump, got blown off course & had to bail out onto The Roof of the World. <br /> <br />In 1943, Robert Crozier, Harold McCallum, Kenneth Spencer, John Huffman & William Perram were out of fuel & lost in the clouds & the Himalayas. With no time for their parachutes to open the five airmen landed in the snow on the same mountain, all but one within hailing distance. After sleeping the night in their niches, they made their way down to a settlement in the valley where they were received by the village leader & met their first Tibetans, who were fascinated by these men who fell from the sky. <br /> <br />Summoned to Lhasa by the Tibetan government, the five airmen, following their guides & riding little ponies, trekked up & down mountains to The Forbidden City where they met with unrelenting hostility from the citizens, a feast by the Chinese mission commander, & eventually, the sanctuary of the British delegation. <br /> <br />How they got back to India, how they were received in America, what happened in Tibet after they left, an Afterword about the five American airmen, & the key players who helped them, plus a Notes section round out a tale very well told. <br /> <br />Could not put LOST IN TIBET down!

Even though anti-Semitism has been rife for hundreds of years, an uneasy social peace has developed within strictly adhered to communities - shtetls. Here, in 1939, when the alliance between Soviet Russia & Hitler's Germany is broken & the Nazi army invades Poland, this country boy, with a keen mind for history & commerce, must choose to flee or fight. <br /> <br />Leon chooses to fight, & leaves his little country town & his beloved family on a train headed to a Red Army training camp. He will only meet five years later, one other relative who survived the Ozeryany massacre. <br /> <br />Far from being a Communist, Leon has a cosmopolitan flair, speaks five languages (none of them English), has studied at university & started his own business. Now he must learn the military ropes to survive on the Front against the Germans, eventually being sent in 1942, to the siege of Stalingrad. Afterwards, as one of the last officers standing, the dreaded NKVD secret police accuse him of being a Nazi spy & send him to a gulag in Uzbekistan. When he does not confess after months of torture, they set him free. With his village still held by the Germans, Leon returns to his army unit & continues to force the invaders out of his homeland, only to stumble upon the unimaginable horror of a Majdanek, a Jewish death camp in his beloved homeland. & then his orders are to take Berlin. <br /> <br />After the war, now in the Polish army, he is part of the reconstruction of that war-torn land & works in the confused world of Displaced Persons. From there, the idea grows of breaking through the Iron Curtain to the New World where his only remaining relatives are thriving. As a high ranking Red Army officer with a chestful of medals, Leon Ajces is far from the poor & helpless masses America so enjoys embracing. & as the Cold War is heating up, Songa's only way to make a new life, is to juggle an attache's visa & once on American soil, defect. <br /> <br />Could not put it down!

His insights into the despair of our souls which can take no comfort from material things, only from the embrace of the light of spirit, purpose & affection, are heartwarming. <br /> <br />Lynn Anderson weaves stories & journal entries of his search into a blanket of comfort & direction. He is a fine storyteller with a light touch, a humor & a perspicacity, that is gentle, lyrical & charming.

When the fisherman finds body parts on the beach, everyone is under suspicion. <br /> <br />Rebeccasreads recommends GOOD MORNING, DARKNESS for one hellatiously hair-raising tale.

The life of a divorcee, single mother & aspiring Berkeley artist is always frantic. For Rakhi it is even more so after her mother is killed in an auto accident.  <br /> <br />Rakhi had been only vaguely aware of her mother's gift for interpreting dreams. Now she is gone & Rakhi yearns to understand her better, to know about her parents' Indian past. With her father's help, Rakhi sets out to decipher her mother's dream journals, only to find a mystery from the past that reaches out to the present. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, she battles with her ex, her livelihood from the tea shop she founded with her friend is threatened, & when the after-effects of 9/11 ripple out to the West Coast, everything Rakhi assumed about her innate American citizenship, is put in doubt. <br /> <br />Could not put it down!

Imagine what life might be like if you were male & you'd landed in a nation where your gender is not only despised, it is proscribed: from the way you look, what you eat, where you go, how you walk & talk. N. Lee Wood has created such a world & we watch as Nathan must learn his place in the scheme of things, or meet a fate worse than death. <br /> <br />Underneath this seemingly perfect female-friendly society on the planet Vanar, something is brewing & Nathan's skill in botany turns out to be the reason why he was enticed there ... if he can make anyone listen to him. & that's the problem: this is a society who distrust anything males have to say. How can he make them listen to the news of their impending doom? <br /> <br />MASTER OF NONE is all about relationships, power plays & saving the world. You will have to learn another language & another world view.	2004-08-29

Susanna Reyto's family did, suddenly & surprisingly in 1957: first to Austria, & then to Italy where they boarded a ship for Australia, to new names & new lives. The best form of revenge is to live well & prosper while those who made you their enemy, perish. <br /> <br />Rebeccasreads highly recommends PURSUIT OF FREEDOM as an enthralling, if occasionally repetitive, tapestry of family memories. The surviving black & white snapshots tell a thousand stories. What Susanna's family lived through: the invasion of by Hitler's army &amp; its determination to exterminate Hungarian Jews; then the victorious Soviet Army, after which the Communist Party's tyranny destroying a prosperous post-WWII society, is an ugly era in our global story. One which has much bearing on this time of terrorism & religious tyranny in such societies as Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran & North Korea. It also serves to remind us that we forget the stories of our past at our peril. It gripped me from page one & didn't let go until its final pages. <br /> <br />Outstanding! & elegantly presented with a lovely red ribbon bookmark.	2004-08-29

In this post 9/11 & Operation Iraqi Freedom world, & while we're contemplating changing political horses mid-stream through a war against terrorism, Sean Hannity, commentator for FOX TVNews, has an axe to grind & a perspective that is undeniable.  <br /> <br />Sean Hannity has no doubt evil exists, in black & white. Any grey areas, he believes, are the product of \\"liberal elitist\\" imagination. In these PC times when we're frowned upon for not calling a spade a digging tool, it's easier to back track into an apologist stance than to step forward & do battle with evil. Sean Hannity is no apologist! <br /> <br />In order to DELIVER US FROM EVIL, he avers we must first allow that it exists & then remember just what it is. To that end he revisits Evil on the Record: The Holocaust; Fighting Communism: The Reagan Way; Iraq I: War and Appeasement; Axis Iraq: The New Appeasement; The Gathering Storm; the reign of Hillary and Bill Clinton; Playing Politics at the Water's Edge, & then he takes a look at The Candidates. <br /> <br />Rebeccasreads recommends DELIVER US FROM EVIL as a diatribe of the first order! Sometimes succinct & vitally to the point, & sometimes the mutterings of one man against weak-wristed liberals. In total, it's a lively, informative & thought-provoking read.	2004-08-29

J. D. Robb has extrapolated the trends she sees today into a world where the chasm between the \\"haves\\" & \\"have-nots\\" is the difference between real coffee & the slop offered by Auto-Chefs.

It might come as a surprise to you that HRH Queen Elizabeth II of the UK has used Homeopathy.

When nothing in the normal medical world helped regain her son's wellbeing, &amp; everyone was telling her that autism was untreatable, Amy Lansky, a graduate from the University of Rochester with degrees in mathematics &amp; computer science, refused to believe it. <br />When she found a Homeopathic doctor &amp; saw the miraculous results of her son's response, over a period of a few months, Amy Lansky decided to explore this little known healing system.

Philippe Spent Christmas Eve; Cat's Christmas; The Attic Creche; The Baker's Dog; A Christmas Tree for All Seasons.<br />What I have always liked about this author's writing is its evocative,  old-fashioned fantasy telling. Animals talk, trees have feelings, people think new thoughts. You will learn a little history, a little culture, as well as something about emotions -- amusement & worry. You will also have to think about \\"What if the same thing happened to me?\\"... & Ethel Pochocki will give you some ideas, in her inimitable style.<br />RebeccasReads recommends THE MISTLETOE GIRL & OTHER CHRISTMAS STORIES.

It is steeped in our species' unwritten story &amp; spiced with unbridled adoration &amp; everyday epiphanies. To be a mother, regardless of biology or birth, is to accept an ancient mantle of compassion, responsibility &amp; transformation. To mothers our children are gods incarnate, showing us the world anew, &amp; to travel with them, because of them, for them, is indeed an enlightening journey. <br />Rebeccasreads highly recommends A MOTHER'S WORLD, for the Reader will find something wonderful, heartbreaking, infuriating, inspiring, hilarious &amp; everso genuine in this celebration, to be reread many times.	2003-10-28

Recommended by RebeccasReads for all parents responsible for teenagers, if for no other reason than to get a glimpse of the hell into which they will be cast when they let their children drink &amp; get behind the wheel of a car, even when the crash is NOT their fault!

Even after her daughter is born the battering continues, &amp; so Opal becomes &quot;there but not there, lurking around the edges of my daughter's life&quot; (Page 10) for 20 long years. &amp; if she thought that was tough, then the divorce lawyer gets his digs in too. <br />It takes quite a while before Opal finds she has the soul of an artist, before she develops the irreverence of a stand-up Feminist, &amp; her mind begins to work again. Before she knows it she's become an inquisitive, earthy being. Oh, &amp; by the way, Opal is African-American.<br />THE SHADE OF MY OWN TREE is one of the best stories about domestic violence, its appalling cost &amp; how one woman got out from under it. <br />RebeccasReads hopes it becomes a &quot;must read&quot; for Reading Groups everywhere because it is dangerous, exciting, funny, filled with redemption &amp; well written.	2003-10-06

It ALWAYS does.<br />Dorothy M. Neddermeyer has put together a good primer on what sexual abuse is, how & how much it happens, what to look for, what to do when it happens, how to teach your children to watch out for themselves & how to build a bridge of trust upon which your children can report unwanted behavior.<br />IF I'D ONLY KNOWN... is an excellent handbook which everyone living & working with children needs to read & put into practice because it is a dangerous world out there & our children cannot protect themselves from older figures of \\"authority.\\" & because the damage done by ignoring or pretending everything is ok has repercussions that bind child & adult into the dreadful cycle of doing unto others what has been done unto them.	2003-04-26

That one assigned Afghani's as the perpetrators of that infamous assault, curdled my blood. I can only hope that clarifying discussions were held later on.<br />The ideas the children thought to write about should arouse any adult to think about their own place in the scheme of things...about what freedom & democracy means; of the love of mothers & family; of expressions of grief for children left without parents; of a new fear of flying; of contemplating the meaning of one's own life; of who Osama bin Laden is & where the training camps are; of firemen & police men & what makes a hero; of Ground Zero, missing someone who didn't come home.<br />All in all, the pictures, poems & thoughts, especially of the teenagers, are fascinating, thought-provoking &, in a strange way, comforting.	2003-03-11

One man's story of survival, as told to Mildred Allen. A teenage American GI recounts his years (1941-1945) of starvation, torture & germ warfare as a prisoner of war of the Japanese Empire in the Philippines & Manchuria.<br />ABANDONED ON BATAAN isn't about great generals or mighty battles, it is much, much more important, for it is about the survival of human dignity, compassion & hope against all odds. Yes, Red Allen ponders on the differences between cultures. Yes, his perspective of his captors is all-American, his point-of-view, however, is both prosaic & honest.<br />Yearning to become a pilot, teenager Oliver Allen answers the call to duty as the storms of war rumble over Europe & China. Unable to attain his dream of flying planes, he enlists anyway & is immediately shipped to the West Coast, on to Hawaii & then across the Pacific to the Philippine Islands into the maw of the Japanese advance.<br />That Red Allen survives is due as much to the simplicity & hardscrabble of his Texas childhood during the Great Depression as to the ebullience of his youth, not to mention pure damn luck!<br />Embedded in this memoir is history as well as a mystery. What were the reasons the world went to war in Europe & in Asia, & what were the feathers the POWs found in their Red Cross packages & parcels from home?<br />ABANDONED ON BATAAN is an astonishing read. Profoundly modest, detailed & authentic. Time & time again, this prototypical survivor has the opportunity to dwell on self-pity & whine about horrific injustices visited upon him & his fellow POWs, however, he rarely does so, to his credit. It's the story that counts & the Allens have written a riveting memoir.	2003-03-03

It's far more important than a promotion at work, or any personal achievement you may seek for yourself.

He expects the characters who populate his worlds to recognize treachery & deceit, & in the face of overwhelming odds, display an almost mythical, stereotypical sense of honor.<br />Here is a haughty, privileged prince who has to grow up fast or die, while he also has to watch those sworn to protect him die. It's a good read & Moms & Dads, whatever you feel about war & those who wage it, if you have teenage boys to whom you want to show what honor & growing up is all about, buy them copies of MARCH UPCOUNTRY & its sequels MARCH TO THE SEA & MARCH TO THE STARS.<br />This is a worthy read, the authors have not lost their touch, if anything they've gotten better!	2003-01-31

It is a litmus test to learn what separates the ho-hum from the memorable; the bland from the interesting.<br />Discover just how original, or not, is your writing.

Apart from the in-your-face writing style, this little book is all about who Joy Boy encounters in New York - his roommates, the girls his libido latches on to, the booze he imbibes, the cuisine he obsesses with, the drugs he narrowly misses, the mayhem he causes & the misadventures he gallops into.<br />Did I like ON THE ORIGINS OF JOY BOY'S CHASM? Not exactly. It is witty, & I found myself chuckling here & there. It is rather like an endlessly looping rerun of some snortingly amusing New York sitcom. It is also a catalog of brand names - I can't remember a novel with so many. <br />If you're young, you talk a-mile-a-minute & like your characters to do the same; if you yearn for the zany - then this one's for you!

He also recounts the stories of the many inmates he cared for, where ruthlessness was the norm, both in the colorless, hopeless daily grind &amp; in the unfettered behavior of the guards<br />I can't say that ALCATRAZ ISLAND is a good read. It is too full of dire, irreparable damage, offering not an iota of redemption. It is a suffocating read, so much so, that I had to do it in small doses, although once I was immersed in its narration, I was enthralled.<br />If history of prison life interests you, if how the doctors of that time treated their captive patients fascinates you, then ALCATRAZ ISLAND will be a good read for you. It is a thought-provoking book that will linger long in your mind.	2003-01-20

Travel back to a time before the laws about what a parent could do to his children were common knowledge. Before domestic violence prevention programs were around.<br />Travel back into Donald D'Haene's world where his immigrant parents arrive in rural Canada to live in isolated poverty, constantly moving from one rented house to another. Where the religion of the father curdles into a cult at home. A cult of unfettered temper, wife subjugation & the The Game he plays with his children.<br />Donald's father rules his little fiefdom with a fist of fear & sexual abuse until the youngest child refuses to play The Game. When Donald's mother takes her family before their religious elders, instead of the abuse being stopped, she is chastised for not reporting it earlier & the family, while being allowed to continue to attend services, is shunned, & life at home returns to \\"normal.\\"<br />It isn't until Donald, now in his teens, reads a letter in the advice column of a newspaper, that he realizes what his father is doing is illegal. It takes a while for that information to make sense in his life, & when it does, he begins the rescue of his mother & siblings.<br />Donald D'Haene is the first author I've read who recounts his transformation with sessions of mental therapy.

It came into my adopted family's home in London, England, when I was 15, & my father died after a long illness, at home in his bed. While my mother told me I was too young to participate, I thought much about dying & death. I learnt it was a taboo subject, as if dying was like getting an F in life.<br />In the early 1990s on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State, I married a man who had promised his father that he would take care of him for the rest of his life. As we homesteaded in the rainforest, I felt I was being given a second chance at both having a father in my life again, & being gifted with participating in Standing The Watch for a loved-one.<br />STANDING THE WATCH takes you gently into my world as my elder lies dying. You will read about my fears & joys, anger & affection, as well as precious funny moments.  Day by day, memory after memory, you will be at my side during one of the most difficult & thrilling times in the life of a family.<br />\\"Soon more people will have matured into eldership than ever before. No matter our ethnic roots, our age will make us a majority.

If you are undecided about taking care of them. If the idea of dying worries you - then reading STANDING THE WATCH will give you some comfort & some idea of what you will face in the future. It will answer many of your questions about death, dying and what a home death is like.<br />While STANDING THE WATCH is about Poppa's final thirteen days, it is also my tribute to all parents. I hope it brings you tears, laughter & comfort when your time comes to step forward & Stand The Watch for your parents.	2002-07-25

Where do you go? Into the great, green forest to the South where the snow ends & monsters dwell?<br />Mitchell Smith has created a whole new future, with particular attention to the anthropological aspects of how we might have made it, what things & thoughts might have survived from the Warm Time.<br />I particularly enjoyed the fully realized heroines & heroes, those who die & those who survive. They have keen insights & eyesights that we, today in our citified lethargy, have long since discarded. Each person could have walked in today's world & felt a glimmer of recognition for us modern folks & our modern nation, except...<br />SNOWFALL is a marvelous, richly-textured adventure that allows us a glimpse of what really might happen when our descendants have to grapple with the inevitable change in the Earth's climate. What will happen to Chicago, for instance, when thousands of feet of snow bury the city? What will happen to our store of knowledge, once electricity is no more? What will happen to our society? Who then will be the readers of what books? What will the doctors know? Who will be our leaders? What kinds of relationships will we have?<br />If you read only one science-fiction/anthropology book this year, read SNOWFALL! Mitchell Smith has written a superb survivalist saga, that lingers in your mind everafter, wondering. It certainly deserves a sequel, for I would dearly love to know how Catania makes it to the Sierras & the snow-bound warrior/hunters who live there.	2002-06-11

Then we imagine these sons going back to their homes, back to their jobs, back, unchanged, to the lives they'd lived before. It's rarely so...\\"<br />The first part is about the impact of losing one's father, focusing on the variations of men's reactions to the death of their fathers.<br />The second part, Rebounding from Father-Loss, focuses on the ways in which sons have adapted to the absence of their fathers. <br />In part three, Lessons of Father-Loss, Neil Chethik shares what he has learnt about being a father, based on the researching & writing of this book.<BR> <BR>Neil Chethik's FATHER-LOSS is a moving & informative read for everyone in the family, about a deeply felt event in our lives.

In time, as his assignments for the newly-formed Los Angeles Times, took him deeper into the Southwest which would capture his heart & soul, & closer to the American Indians for whom he would advocate mightily, he caught the ear of a President. Theodore Roosevelt came to consider Lummis a vital part of his \\"cowboy cabinet,\\" & often invited him to Washington. Lummis enjoyed a life-long influence, via his editorials & many books, on the way Americans thought of themselves.<br />In this era of bland plasticity, AMERICAN CHARACTER, reminds us of how individualistic, passionate, offensive & charming our forefathers were. It also reminds us of how devastating was our impact upon the people & the land in a time when a man could bemoan the wholesale slaughter of buffalo & Indians, while not batting an eye as he shot other critters just for the thrill of it!<br />In the light of today's political correctness, Charles Fletcher Lummis' love life was as gilded with misogyny as you would expect from a man of his time - he kept his first marriage secret all through his Harvard years. As in every other aspect of his life, his thirst for affection & companionship was both utilitarian & fascinatingly eccentric.<br />AMERICAN CHARACTER: Charles Fletcher Lummis & the Rediscovery of the Southwest, has been named by the Western Writers of America as Winner of the 2002 Spur Award in the biography category.	2002-05-28

BYSTANDER embraces the social & cultural history of street photography. It touches upon the works of master photographers, yet leaves out so much about the actual photographs. <br />Trying to follow Meyerowitz's & Westerbeck's conversation, both obviously deeply emotional about the subject of street photography, simply went over my head in a rush of technical details & passionate positing as to why which photographer did what.<br />It is, however, the photographs in BYSTANDER that draw you back, again & again. The earliest ones that beg to have been enlarged, so rich in texture & composition; the later ones with their implicit social commentaries.<br />When we say that a picture is worth a thousand words, we're not kidding! Each & every photograph, even those that I couldn't make head nor tail, tell stories of our predecessors' lives & times, letting social history unravel before our eyes.<br />BYSTANDER is for everyone who loves to look at the past - the everyday, angular, shadow & light city past, through the window of a camera.	2002-05-22

I don't like characters cut from whole cloth, because when I read I want to lay my eyes upon the patched quilt that makes up a character's life, that way I truly feel like I know them.<br />The social content deals with some very real probelms that are ongoing in today's society, & raises questions about just where one should place one's feet when straddling the fence. It also makes it very clear that fence straddling can be a dangerous occupation.	2002-05-03

In most other versions, the father loves her to pieces, & then dies. Thus he is unable to save Cinderella from her nasty step-mother. In this telling, the father does not die, he keeps his mouth shut about the way his daughter is treated, for fear of his new wife's anger.

A life & death struggle to survive the mental illness of manic/depression.<br />Reviewing a memoir about a manic/depressive's story is a challenge. Be forewarned this book is one helluva fast-forward ride! <br />I guarantee during the time it takes you to read A PROPHET OPERATING AT A LOSS, you will not see your life in the same way, & perhaps, never the same way again!<br />For the most part, Zane Bond is coherent & articulate - until you think about what he has written & then you get a whiff of seething synapses & the taste of burnt brain cells. <br />Zane Bond has a way with words & has been considerate of his readers by keeping his paragraphs short, even though the leaps between them sometimes seem like black holes. His chapters range through a forest of memories, philosophies & insights. <br />While I occasionally became lost or overcome, A PROPHET OPERATING AT A LOSS is a remarkable effort that will leave you breathless & thinking! What more do you want from a book?	2002-03-26

No one was ever convicted & no white man's justice ever meted out. <br />Lydia had been a beautiful girl on the edge of womanhood. Loved by two powerful boys, she already had a secret. She was also the target of the headmistress' upbraiding for falling short of her potential.<br />Told in a fierce chorus of voices, SCHOOL FOR HAWAIIAN GIRLS speaks of memories of a dreadful past & prayers for a hopeful future. There are two terribly warped boys, one the son of the preacher man & the other, caught between the death of his parents' culture & a future in the white man's world; a grandniece of the slain Lydia, a woman now in her thirties with a thriving tourist canoe business & a curiosity to purchase the abandoned school house & make a hotel out of it; & the acid memories & jaundiced nostalgia of the preacher's other child, his daughter, who was once the respected headmistress of the long defunct school.<br />Everyone has secrets they'd rather not have exposed & everyone feels impelled to do something about keeping those secrets silent. <br />SCHOOL FOR HAWAIIAN GIRLS is a haunting, fierce & vivid parable about what happens when one culture conquers another & by fair means & foul, sets about humiliating & eradicating their way of life. When Westerners came into Paradise carting their self-righteous mores & their own personal demons, they expected the native population to be grateful for its re-education. What they got was a living hell of suspicions, superstitions & soul-destroying tragedy.<br />A stunning, satisfying mystery, well written & finely tuned with a glimpse of the lush paradise islands & the dark impulses that drive us humans into our misery!<br />A taut thriller with liberal doses of redemption - a super read!	2002-03-18

An aged doctor in a German pharmaceutical company announces a cure for AIDS, & sends Dr. Isaiah Slesinger, America's preeminent protein biochemist, a message just before he's killed - or is he?<br />When Izzy receives Dr. Heneke's warning he is catapulted into a dangerous & desparate hunt among competing scientists, company men with murky pasts & modern-day agents still intent on racial purity. Izzy already knows that the old story about how the HIV virus leapt from monkey to man isn't true, & when he learns that Heneke worked with the Nazi doctor Joseph Mengele as a young man, Izzy is even more sure that something else spawned the dread disease.<br />Dr. Heneke insists that Mengele's research papers have survived & urges Izzy to follow their trail. Somewhere in those notes Heneke is sure Izzy will find a way to backtrack the path of the disease & perhaps find a way to halt its devastation. Except, Dr. Heneke warns Izzy, there's something even worse going on & that AIDS is actually a cover up.<br />MENGELE'S LEGACY is David Weinberg's first novel. It's a bit raw & complicated - lots of scientific discussions & staged deaths, killers coming out of the woodwork & ghosts around every corner, yet as a reflection on the obsessions we have about racial purity & the dread of disease, it makes for a fascinating, scary read!	2002-03-18

For most of his life Andy has hidden his raging mania under a larger-than-life personality until he turns to art forgery. Then he became the subject of a New York scandal, jail & house arrest until, finally, when he knows he can no longer control himself, he opts for electroconvulsive therapy.<br />Andy Behrman, inspite of his mental illness, has written an engaging & exhausting, hilarious & horrifying memoir of where he came from, how it all started & what happened. How he moved from authentic into full throttle forgery - both in the field of his art dealing &, as the disease overwhelms him, in his life.<br />His monumental To Do List is a sign of things to come!<br />ELECTROBOY is a bit longer than it needed to be, with no excuses for the turmoil tumbling out. You will find yourself holding your breath & then squeaking with relief tinged with chuckles. On & on he goes, round & round he swirls on highs so high he's looking down at the sky & then, in a blink, he's so at the bottom of the Grand Canyon, he can't see daylight.<br />Extra-ordinary & a thought-provoking, memorable read!

Before I left London & it has always been my favorite Nevil Shute story.<br />In this age of in-your-face language & novels saturated with every evil event a human's mind can plausibly conjure up, this master storyteller's quiet & lean prose about real, ordinary people & their choices, entices you into one man's little life of miniature models, hardworking wives & honoring one's vows.<br />From an unpeturbed basement workshop to the paradise of the broad Pacific ocean, a middle-aged man, more comfotable at his workbench than jetting across the world, takes on a mission to retrieve a treasure he himself hid in the ballast of his sister & brother-in-law's wrecked sail boat.<br />For the sake of his niece, he leaves the safety of his suburban routine to travel far & wide to bring her inheritance back. <br />A deeply satisfying & redemptive read, of a time long ago, when things were a lot more simple & simple honor was a lot more evident.<br />Warms your heart, soothes your soul & tells a good story as well!	2002-03-16

Immediate, poetic & bright this big book brings you up close & personal with children's feet, hands, eyes, backs, hair, elbows in award-winning Wendy Ewald's magical photos.<br />The poems penned by these 15 youngsters are funny & eloquent, touching & proud. As is usual with children, it's more about what they don't say as much as it is about what they do.<br />Bound to get kids thinking about what they like about their bodies, might even get them writing little ditties about it too!

Jack Reacher is hitching a ride through the heat of West Texas when a Latina woman invites him into her air-conditioned white Cadillac. As they head south to Pecos she proposes a dire scheme involving motherhood, marriage & murder.<br />I've not met Jack Reacher before, although Lee Child has written four previous books about him. Reacher's a huge, unkempt & unlikely hero. Reminiscent of the Lone Ranger except he wears no white hat, nor clean clothes for that matter.<br />An army brat, dragged from base to base by his parents, he then enlisted as an investigator in the Military Police. Let go after thirteen years of service, during the downsizing of the military, he's been bumming around the country looking for some peace, & getting into trouble & out of motel bathroom windows.<br />This young wife's story piques his curiosity although what she asks of him butts him up against his principles. Still, the Cadillac is a cool haven, the woman is beautiful & Reacher goes along for the ride.<br />Where it takes him is into a viper nest of oil wealth, racial hatred, domestic violence, tax evasion, a husband's return from jail, & lying lawmen.<br />I liked ECHO BURNING - a well-written story with probable people, intense action & a view of life that makes you think!	2002-03-07

In the search for her father, a pilot missing since the Korean War, Liv travels to Polynesia his last known whereabouts, & winds up behind bars on a trumped-up murder charge.<br />It is that long-forgotten child's note, received while in jail, that brings up Liv's childhood memories. HENDERSON'S SPEAR is a love letter from a woman who never thought of herself as a mother, to her now 20 year old daughter.<br />Ronald Wright tells of the history of the end of the Korean War & the French & American atomic bomb testing on the atolls of that vast ocean. He keenly describes the affects of the fallout, the use of pilots to photograph the explosions, & the islanders' memories of being guinea pigs; uncovering an era we would all rather forget - what hell we brought to paradise!...<br />This novel is like a treasure chest found on a desert island, in which you will uncover all sorts of histories; Herman Melville's meanderings before he wrote MOBY DICK; South Sea Island cultures - past & present; how Darwin's theory of evolution affected his contemporaries; how Queen Victoria's grandsons were groomed for public life; how one man's memories of a life in the service of his country affects another's two generations later & so much more!<br />Normally such yarns have a male protagonist & this one is refreshing & unusual as the Reader listens to what a woman has to say about the affairs of the heart & our ancestors. Ronald Wright has woven out of the threads of history, a compelling story of the ghosts people carry with them. HENDERSON'S SPEAR is a tapestry of depth & intrigue, affection & redemption.	2002-03-07

I wasn't exactly thrilled to be reading a book called the The Wonder of Girls - especially as it's written by a chap - novelist, poet, neurobiological researcher, psychologist, husband & father of two girls notwithstanding! I was dreading it would be either incomprehensibly technical or a sappy, feel-good read. I should have known better because I had already reviewed Michael Gurian's A Fine Young Man & had found this author to be personable, charmingly thoughtful & invaluably informative.<br />Through research, memories, poems, letters, family moments & professional cases Michael Gurian sets out to inform us Why Girls Are the Way They Are. In his simple, direct & pleasant way he starts at the beginning of the search for A New Logic of Girls' Lives. He presents precisely & calmly that it is time for Feminists to grow up & become Womanists. <br />As an erstwhile rabid Feminist, I have long since outgrown its angst. In Looking Beyond Feminism: Old Myths and New Theories, Michael Gurian catches up to me & explains how Feminism might now be what's keeping us back. Biology, Feminist ideals notwithstanding, still rules supreme & if we don't know how we work, then we don't know why we're doing what we're doing.<br />One vital passage: Girls' Stress Responses needs to be read by everyone: \\"When a child is under inordinate stress for a prolonged period...her brain development will definitely be affected. She will be \\"rewired\\" neurologically...The stress hormone, cortisol,(as well as adrenal and other \\"lower\\" brain functions) have dominated brain growth...and this affects normal brain growth patterns.\\" Why then, are we surprised by the depression in all our early adolescent girls?<br />In Part II: What Girls Need, we explore The Artful Mother: What Girls Need from Mom. \\"There are natural stages to a woman's life, and every daughter wants to know what they are...The womanist philosophy, concerned heavily with the natural stages of a woman's life, is useful...because it is a path to freedom, not social constriction...It is a middle ground between the old view: a woman must stay home - and the feminist view: a woman must conquer the workplace.\\" In this section we think about Providing Childcare; Discipline; Spanking; Teaching Manners; The Importance of Chores; The Beginnings of Spiritual Life; Media Use; Holding Clear Authority; Dealing With Whining; Teaching Your Girls to Enjoy Their Noble Failures; Handling An Angry Girl; Your Daughter's Sadness; Her Pulls to Autonomy; The Issue of Privacy; The Battle Over Clothing; Rites of Passage. There is even a section on How to be an Artful Stepmother!<br />On to The Gifts of The Father: What Girls Need from Dad. A Father's Love \\"can make or break a girl.\\" Father-Attachment; Our Fatherless Daughters; The Gift of Presence; of Independence; of Adventure and Laughter; of Affection; of Discipline and Self-Restraint; Helping a Daughter Manage Peer Relationships. In Fathers, Daughters, and Divorce we think about the gifts separated fathers can give. Given how many marriages end up in divorce courts - this is a vital segment!  In The Stages of \\"Dad\\" we watch a hero become a dolt become a mentor! Heady stuff! <br />While we all know of the hero's journey to Self, Michael Gurian explains The Goal of the Journey for girls. While boys are more interested in autonomy & morality, girls are more drawn to identity & intimacy. Ergo The Intimacy Imperative & The Future of Femininity.<br />Knowing how we're wired is half the battle; the other half is sifting through what people think we ought to be & do with our lives. Biology is older than Religion & Feminism by a few millions years & until we truly get that, then we're setting our girls up for a lifelong battle with their inner natural inclinations. Politically correct folks want girls to surmount biology, as if it's a recent discomfort imposed by thoughtless fools - it isn't - it's the biggest thing around!<br />There is so much to think about in The Wonder of Girls that I regret the limitations of a review. I've come away knowing more about why I am than ever before, a profound read indeed!<br />The Wonder of Girls is a book for a lifetime & I heartily recommend it.	2002-01-21

The book combines his exhaustive &amp; superb scholarship with a gripping narrative that will forever alter our perception of America's royal family.<br />The Kennedy Women is a virtual feast for Kennedy lovers. The book could serve as a university course on the life of the family, chronicling five matrilineal generations in our nation's foremost political dynasty. It provides a poetic panorama of the history of American womanhood, as we are taken from the life of Bridget Murphy Kennedy, who arrived steerage class on an immigrant vessel to work as a servant in the slums of Boston, to the presentation of Joseph Kennedy's daughters to the Queen of England, to John F. Kennedy's White House, through discussions of the future Kennedy matriarchs Caroline Kennedy Scholossberg, Maria Shriver Schwartzenegger, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, &amp; Rory Kennedy.<br />Wonderful, in-depth portraits with much new material are given of all the Kennedy women, particularly the ubiquitous Jackie, Ethel, &amp; Eunice, &amp; the mentally challenged Rosemary, whose story in all its horror &amp; duplicity is revealed in detail.<br />It isn't often that one mourns coming to the end of a book. Although The Kennedy Women covers 933 pages, I was saddened to find myself on the last page.	2002-01-13

I would have to say that since my years of reading Robert Heinlein I have yet to find an author that has drawn my attention more than Michael Flynn. He takes a very messy world view, scrambles it up with a host of characters &amp; their very messy lives &amp; brings a clarity to the struggle. I really like that!<br />Falling Stars is the final book in his Stars Series which brings together a dream for the human race &amp; its stepping out of the cradle with the hard realities &amp; political necessities such dreams must really face. Anyone with children knows those first steps bring bloody noses &amp; so it is brought to life in vivid color in Flynn's writings.<br />Great Space Opera!	2002-01-04

Well written, amusing &amp; informative about a world within a world filled with intrigue, humor &amp; thoughts about the preservation of this bag of bones in which we walk our lives &amp; the records, myths &amp; stories of why we do it.<br />Funnily enough, after traipsing all around the world on the heels of the mummy archaeologists, soaking up their stories &amp; their passions, Heather Pringle learned that when they were asked if they would choose to be mummified, most said no, with quaint sincerity, because they wouldn't want to be stared at in museums or examined by curious scientists.<br />Fascinating! Changed my mind about eternity, anorexia, grief &amp; where the soul might really dwell!	2002-01-04

This newly released omnibus contains two full-length novels that have become so ubiquitous as to be part of our psyche.<br />The City and The Stars made such an impression on me that I can remember exactly where I was when I read it for the very first time - seventh grade in Bright, California at one of the meanest junior highs I ever did attend. It was an escape, it was fantastical without being fantasy. It was hard science fiction, set in the future. At that age, I couldn't comprehend how far in the future but I knew it was a place I would have liked to see, doing things that Alvin did. Living that Grand Adventure with him! <br />I would encourage anyone who hasn't read an early Arthur C. Clarke or knows of any young science fiction fans to buy this omnibus & introduce them to the universe of Arthur C. Clarke. He did write more than 2001: A Space Odyssey - you know!	2001-12-20

If we think that America has never known an infectious epidemic other than the Great Influenza after World War I, we'd be wise to consider the smallpox pandemic that swept the length &amp; breadth of the North American continent just as the Revolutionary fever did.<br />Pox American: The Great Smallpox Epidemic of 1775-82 is a fascinating way to learn about the early years of our nation when cultures collided on this continent. Each chapter starts with a story of one man - a ship's captain exploring the Straits of Juan de Fuca or a New England volunteer in the Continental Army or a missionary riding the dusty Southwest trails. From these individual's stories we can see scope of  the virus' reach. With pictographs, maps, charts &amp; photographs, this author brings this contagion close to home!<br />Sometimes the dread disease was an invisible passenger upon an unsuspecting carrier that would arrive in a tribe of otherwise healthy people &amp; within weeks, the entire community would be dead. Sometimes it was intentionally sent forth by our wily forefathers to do their deadly work. <br />Smallpox haunted our ancestors from coast to coast; from Russian promyshlenniki (hunters &amp; traders) who first explored &amp; then enslaved the residents of Alaska to America's breadbasket, where entire native communities of farmers &amp; hunter-gatherers were wiped out in weeks to Hudson Bay, New Orleans, The South as well as Mexico City.<br />Elizabeth Fenn writes: &quot;The pestilence can teach us the ways in which other upheavels - native warfare, missionization, the fur trade, and the acquisition of horses and guns...reshaped human life on the North American continent. The movement of the virus from one human being to another shows us how people actually lived in the late eighteenth century. For despite the political, social, and racial boundaries of the day, people rubbed elbows.&quot;<br />I cannot do justice to the scope &amp; breadth of this author's research. Pox Americana is a compelling read, a dread-filled chronicle of another aspect of our story &amp; Professor Elizabeth Fenn has written a rich &amp; interesting story with a huge Notes Section, as befits a teacher of history!	2001-12-13

Nothing comes of it until, seemingly randomly, he becomes accident-prone. It's only when his ex-wife &amp; her lover are killed while driving his car that it dawns on him  he just might have been the target.<br />I felt the author really understood the subject &amp; found myself not only enjoying, but wanting to participate in the flying scenes. I like the imperfections of his characters &amp; the growth he allowed his characters to have as the story progressed.<br />When I finished the The Trojan Sea I shut the cover with a thump &amp; said: &quot;Yeah!

He has spent nearly three decades studying, learning from, crusading for, & thinking about hunter-gatherers, who survive at the margins of the vast, fertile lands occupied by farming peoples & their descendants, now the great majority of the world's population.<br />That said be ready to take off for faraway places, ideas & behaviors! <br />The hunters have been all but vanquished, yet in this profound and passionate book, Brody dispels the notion that theirs is a lesser way of life, & reveals the systems of thought, belief, & practice that distinguish them from the farmers. <br />The hunters' deep attachment to the places & ways of their ancestors stems from an enviable sense that they are part of a web of relationships in the natural & spiritual worlds. Brody's aim is not to elevate one mode of being over another, but to suggest that we move beyond dichotomies & accept that there are various ways of being fully human.  <br />\\"The Other Side of Eden\\" is an exciting, generally well-written saga of the dreams & accomplishments of a dying culture, & as such should be part of everyone's education.	2001-12-05

The Colluzis want revenge &amp; its up to this gutsy lawyer to secure justice, risking everything, including her life.<br />Lisa Scottoline has written a legal thriller that goes beyond the definition of a courtroom drama. It's a work that defines &amp; distinguishes two almost similar words, &quot;killing&quot; &amp; &quot;murder&quot;, &amp; it is in this background the novel is set. This work once again reaffirms Scottoline's position as the &quot;Female Grisham.&quot;<br />The Vendetta Defense is a gripping page-turner in the truest sense of the term. Highly recommended!	2001-11-15

It is interesting largely because it takes readers into a relatively recent time &amp; society with which most of us are unacquainted. <br />McBee examined the workers' relationships with their parents, living conditions, longings, intense friendships, romances &amp; marriages, &amp; numbingly boring jobs, &amp; carefully researched the importance of class, generation, gender, &amp; community in the formation of American character. <br />Commercial recreation was just coming into existence at the time, &amp; it is fascinating to observe the differences between the heterosocial relationships of adolescents of the early twentieth century &amp; those of today. The former amused themselves not only in dance halls &amp; amusement parks, but at picnics, religious festivals, &amp; men's social clubs, a far cry from the ubiquitous discos &amp; rock concerts of our day. <br />The book is not particularly well written, &amp; there is a great deal of repetition. Nevertheless, unlike many works of its ilk, it is easy to read, &amp; always interesting. In addition, it is a historical &amp; social record which could be useful to students of American gender relations for many years to come.	2001-11-08

At first I was a bit put off by how everywoman sounded as if she were whining at the loss of something she'd never had, as if her coming to America was by default(most had arrived as children), rather than a delirious desire, as it had been for me in my 20s. Still, I read on, fascinated by each woman's unique story - until I hit the motherlode in their essays where they began to spin their broken straws into the golden fiber of their new lives.<br />Curious &amp; remarkable what women from the East &amp; from Africa thought important &amp; what women from the Old World thought vital to their welfare. Some women ached in exactly the same way I had - wanting so much to be the daughter of which our mothers would have been proud.<br />Do not look for patriotism in these pages - that sort of thing doesn't matter to women nearly as much as which identity we will be expected to wear in which place in our lives: our families' homes &amp; churches; our schools &amp; our parents' relatives from the Old Country. <br />Becoming American is an absorbing, serious tea party where 24 women who started in every corner of the world have come to adulthood in America &amp;, under Meri Nana-Ama Danquah's able editorship, have shared their stories.<br />What of our past must we relinquish &amp; what of America need we assimilate?<br />Well worth the read!

Try as she might, her \\"secrets\\"  verbal croaks, groans, & physical spasms  keep afflicting her. Only as an adult will she find out she has Tourette's Syndrome, a rare neurological disorder, but for years her behavior is the source of mystery, confusion, & deep humiliation. <BR>  <BR>The author made me feel as though I was right beside Icy as she tells her own story. I can only begin to understand how the tormenting must have hurt not to mention just not knowing what is wrong with her. In the 1950s Tourettes Syndrome was not a known disorder. The ignorance & unacceptance of everyone from the children to the teachers was unbelievable. Even now people are not that accepting of \\"differences.\\"   <br />I thoroughly enjoyed reading this story until its end. Where are the details on how Icy was diagnosed?

Joe sets out to disabuse ourselves of the notion that we Baby Boomers actually did anything earth-shaking back then. With a dig in our ribs &amp; a coy turn of phrase, he reminds us of what from that era, holds particular reverence &amp; reference in today's middle age. Of course his perspective is mawkishly masculine, how else would it be for an unreconstructed chauvinist? You should read his tirade about our children! In his chapter Good Lovin' Gone Bad he concocts a recipe for what America might have become had Baby Boomers &quot;stuck to their idealistic guns&quot; - would &quot;peace, love &amp; understanding&quot; have swept away the gun lobby? A mind boggling concept. American History: the B-side is knee-slapping, teeth-rattling funny! All-in-all, jivin' Joe has painted a pretty patchouli picture of us BBs. His vitamin-enriched jeremiad owes everything to the vitality &amp; naivete of those long-ago idealists &amp; nothing to his 20/20 hindsight. I get the feeling Joe Queenan thinks the BBs haven't figured something out yet &amp; have co-opted into a monetary-enhanced facsimile of our parents' lifestyles. Oh, Balsamic Dreams is amusing, as Joe Queenan mocks himself as well as his generation, it does, however, get old, as he obviously is. About as palatable as a salad soaked in balsamic vinegar - some like it sour, some do not. Balsamic Dreams is an interesting look back on an age with all its oxymorons &amp; hippy-dippy-ness.	2001-08-28

When a headless corpse is uncovered by a prison work gang on a windy Tibetan mountain, veteran Beijing police inspector Shan Tao Yin would seem the perfect man to solve the crime - except Shan himself has been a prisoner there for years. More at ease with his fellow Tibetan inmate monks than with the Chinese officials who run the work camp.<br />Eliot Pattison has taken us into the highest reaches of this world, into the rarified realm of petty, absolute bean-counter tyrants with pasts to hide &amp; greed to satisfy.

Hidden tunnels &amp; monasteries; helicopters &amp; Chinese armed forces; faxes &amp; demons &amp; a lot about the influence of Communism as practiced by Chinese bureaucrats &amp; Buddhism as practiced by Tibetan adepts. The more things change the more they stay the same! Amazing!<br />The story of how both Westerners &amp; Chinese have incised the mystical, magical &amp; spiritual from the Land of Snows is a sorry one.

Culled from the diaries, letters, advertisements, newsreels &amp; newspapers of those years, you will read what it was like growing up in the 1940s in a world at war &amp; what the family &amp; the nation did to ensure there was enough to eat &amp; enough to fight with. <br />I was a little girl &quot;over there&quot; during these years, so I picked up this bright history book with a certain degree of remembrances of things past. <br />This is an interesting way of looking at history - from a girl's point of view of how a world war affected her childhood. While Molly is a fictional character, there are enough women still alive who can attest to the veracity of Molly's experiences because the places &amp; the times of her story are real.<br />One glaring omission is any reference to the daughters of Japanese-American families incarcerated in camps in the wilds of the American West for the duration.<br />Molly's World of 1944 is filled with nostalgic icons &amp; while it contains magazine-like sidebars, photos &amp; articles on everything from clothes to factory work to dogs to changing from war time to peace, it is couched in bland, politically correct language.<br />Notwithstanding the squeaky-cleanliness &amp; disturbingly superficial information, this is a worthy bridge to a time that was. A way to connect today's girls with their grandmothers' girlhood.	2001-07-25

Judit Bodnar's rollicking tale of tables turned &amp; turned again, in a funny &amp; Aesopian tall tale, is wonderfully endowed by John Sandford's awesome artistry of life in an amazingly enchanted forest!<br />Fox is a quick witted creature &amp; soon catches himself a basketful of trout. Just as he's about to dig in to his huge supper, he hears a knocking at his door. It's Bear, drawn to his friend's home by the lovely fishy smell.<br />Fox is not a polite neighbor &amp; tells Bear to take a hike &amp; when Bear persists, Fox thinks to give him a hard time by telling him how to fish for his own supper.<br />Bear, being a bit of a bumbler, takes Fox's lesson to heart &amp; sits for one miserably cold winter night with his tale stuck in a lake.<br />In the morning, without catching one fish, Bear decides to go home. When he stands up he finds his tale frozen to the lake. With a mighty heave Bear pulls the whole lake out &amp; staggers away, muttering at his Foxy friend.<br />Naturally, the lake melts &amp; Bear gets his own feast, beyond Fox's imaginings!<br />A wonderful book to be read &amp; re-read for the story &amp; for the pictures!	2001-07-25

Waiting on the Redds across the road at Roseberry or for a child to be born or a son to come back or, as now, for death, starting each day with the question: &quot;Is this the day, Lord?&quot;<br />In 1861, China Redd's family matriarch, Cally, gives birth to the son of two endangered marriages. In less years than a boyhood can be lived, one son dooms the other all because he took his mother's glowing earrings. One mother's heart is mortally wounded &amp; a deep, abiding separation between master &amp; slaves settles in. <br />100 years later, China waits for death with her own story to add to the generations buried in the slave graveyard up the hill from Roseberry.<br />Nancy Peacock has brought the kitchen window to life. Has breathed, for a bright moment, Technicolor into sepia-hued photographs. Of men ravaged by slavery &amp; women savaged by loss. Of a son who took a pair of abalone shell earrings &amp; for that another son is sold. One dark night the earrings are stolen, cursed &amp; hidden away.<br />100 years later, the earrings come back to China as her grand daughter adds her story &amp; Roseberry molders into ruin.<br />This storyteller, with her profound &amp; lilting language, surprisingly spare &amp; intensely evocative, has given us a read that's like the bursting of summer's first raspberry upon your palette.<br />A different kind of morality. Set aside your stuff &amp; come Home Across The Road to step into a whole other world where women wait to see what life brings them. A madness I understand. A rage I have known &amp; a passivity that has my daughter snarling at every word spoken. Fascinating!	2001-07-18

Just like the seven deadly sins, the seven memory sins appear routinely in everyday life. How does transcience reflect a weakening of memory over time, how does absent-mindedness occur when failure of attention sabotages memory &amp; how blocking happens when we can't retrieve a name we know well.<br />What startled me about Daniel L. Schacter's point of view is his re-casting of the mold of sin. We all have it that sins are dreadful things that lurk around every corner just waiting to mug us. This researcher-cum-author posits otherwise. You will learn about the biology of memory, the difference between brain &amp; mind, forgetfulness &amp; remembering &amp;, which is perhaps the most novel aspect of this book: discover another way of perceiving &quot;sin&quot;.<br />There are The Three Sins of Omission: 1) transcience - here today/gone tomorrow. 2) absent-mindedness - if my head wasn't attached to my neck I'd lose it. 3) blocking - ah, this one is hellatious, especially for a writer!<br />Then there are the Four Sins of Commission: 4) misattribution - you never really said that! 5) suggestibility - like the 'flu, these can be pernicious &amp; withering.  6) bias - how our current knowledge &amp; beliefs color how we remember.  7) persistence - recalling disturbing events or information we wish we wouldn't. <br />Oh, before I forget, this author game me a fascinating &amp; humorous eInterview. What a mind-boggling read! Delightful? Yes, indeed. Well written? Certainly! Interesting? Definitely! Understandable? Readable? Memorable? Eminently so!	2001-07-11

In the beginning, naturally, was the Umayyad Architecture, in that melting pot we now call the Middle East where three religions built upon each other over centuries of surges in populations, wars &amp; economics.<br />From Spain to India, Islamic architecture is represented by both the exotic &amp; the simple.

When I took this tome out of its mailer &amp; began to turn its pages, I suddenly remembered my own set of formal white cotton gloves - long since discarded - so reverential was the aura emanating from this glossy artbook.<br />Jacqueline Kennedy kept it simple - most of her clothes were in solid colors with only huge buttons, cockades or discreet stylized bows, scarves, shawls or frogs for detail. In the Travel Chapter we see the simplicity of her wardrobe &amp; her passion for colors.   <br />Combining original &amp; new photographs, this volume presents images we have rarely seen, as well as photos that have become a part of our national consciouness. The final one of the President &amp; First Lady together in the open touring auto needs no words - we all know what happened next.<br />Certainly a treasure of memories - where we were, what we wore, what we wished we could wear.

He almost completes basic training when the love of his life does a long-distant rejection that sends him into a tailspin out of which he makes a fateful decision.<br />It has taken this writer 30 years to come to terms with the guilt &amp; shame of his desertion, to break his silence &amp; tell his controversial, important &amp; profoundly American story.

This year, we will honor fathers by making them more visible. We will not give them a day off but rather a day on, a day at the center of things....&quot;<br />It is a given that most of our children are fatherless in the strictest sense of that word - we are plagued with an absence of fathers in our children's lives, for whatever reason - be they unmarried, divorced or workaholics. Practically the only use for fathers, is their ability to provide &amp; that does not make for a caring, nurturing relationship that will raise healthy children.<br />How did fatherhood get this way? Professor Dowd explores, with impressive research, the state of fatherhood in America today - its historical context within in the family, the community &amp; the law; on constitutional, biological &amp; economic levels. <br />It is ironic that the very system of laws that were founded by &amp; for men living within our erstwhile patriarchy, is now the very instrument by which men are dispossessed &amp; vilified as fathers. Time for a change!<br />It's not so much that the Civil Rights' or Women's Movements changed the direction in which the evolution of our laws &amp; ideas were going, so much as they sprang open the manacles that bound us to a system that was no longer working.<br />First the Industrial Revolution altered forever fathers' places within families, then the availability of divorce promoted father-absent families - thus setting the scene for the abandonment of fatherhood. With so many laws against a man who could not or would not fit the marriage pigeonhole, it is no wonder modern fathers have been more distant from their offspring than their patriarchal forefathers.<br />This is not an erudite book about trashing deadbeat dads nor a face-saving diatribe in favor of mealy-mouth moms - it is about men as nurturers, as caregivers to the children of our society. It is about redefining men's places in our children's lives - creatinga new kind of fatherhood.<br />There is only one nation in the world today that has set its constitution &amp; its economy toward a more gender-neutral, gender-equal fatherhood model &amp; that is Sweden. We Americans have a lot to learn!<br />What a read - what a challenge! If you are at all interested in how fatherhood got the way it is &amp; where it might be going; if you are wondering how the laws of our land have proscribed parenthood &amp; marriage; if you're trapped in an unhappy, meaningless role model &amp; want some new direction - then I suggest you read Redefining Fatherhood &amp; take a look around you. We have much to do &amp; Professor Dowd has given us an abundance of ideas &amp; strategies.	2001-06-14

This chess-playing, math-loving whiz of a kid wishes to be the thinnest girl at school, maybe even the planet! <br />Lori is a brainy kid used to being cute to the adults in her life, except now they're calling her &quot;different&quot; &amp; &quot;unique&quot;. Now her school friends have turned their minds to the mush of makeup &amp; boyfriends, what's a girl to do? Out shopping with her mother, Lori comes across a diary &amp; starts on the journey of her life. <br />In three seasons this healthy youngster starves herself to the very brink &amp; through her admissions &amp; omissions in her diary, the reader will also be drawn toward that edge.<br />A lively, furious read! Fast, funny, fatuous &amp; fearful by turns, Stick Figure is worth hunting up &amp; grabbing. Not only is it a paean to journal writing(&amp; I'm an evangelist for the examined life!), it is an engrossing exploration of the makings of an eating disorder which, back then, didn't have a name. NB. this diary has been expanded by the woman Lori did survive to become.<br />This would make an excellent book for any girl around the age of 12 &amp; for anyone older who has taken up dieting as a lifestyle. May I suggest you give a journal as well, it could save their life! Do check out my eInterview with this lively author.	2001-05-06

I was hunting for a recipe of Indian Frybread because we'd eaten it up at the Makah Nation's summer celebration &amp; wanted some at home. I found Native American Cooking: Foods of the Southwest Indian Nations &amp; gave my Southwest-raised Webmaster a palatable surprise.<br />I also tried Pozole because hominy has such a primal aroma &amp; flavor - incredible &amp; so simple! We do not, of course, eat anywhere near as elegantly as the photos which present Cornsicles, Arrowheads of Blue Cornmeal Gnocchi or Lamb Stuffed Chiles or Cactus Pad Salad with Fiery Jalapeno Dressing. However, Hohoise Ice or Prickly Pear Ice refresh us up here in our plain bowls just as well!<br />The Adobe Bread was heavenly, the Dandelion Salad with Mustard Greens Vinaigrette was energizing &amp; the Picuris Indian Bread Pudding with Apricot Sauce - dreamy! What I liked the most was bringing home the sights, smells, tastes &amp; textures of a sunburned country &amp; its people - both in the ingredients I hunted up &amp; Lois Ellen Frank's book.<br />For a taste of the American Southwest &amp; a glimpse into what has sustained healthy &amp; contented generations, I heartily recommend this one - the recipes work &amp; can easily be adapted to wherever you happen to have settled.	2001-05-06

The Sinking of the USS Indianapolis &amp; the Extraordinary Story of Its Survivors. In July of 1945, the cruiser USS Indianapolis set out from San Francisco with a secret &amp; dangerous cargo, headed for Tinian, a distant South Pacific island. With a record-breaking run to Hawaii &amp; then on to Guam for fuel &amp; fresh supplies, she delivered her load with no notable incidents. <br />This is an astonishing read - which starts with the end of an old tar's life &amp; then tells the story of one venerable ship upon which President Franklin Roosevelt had sailed to South America; of her mostly young crew with a sprinkling of seasoned hands &amp; her captain, a scion from a naval tradition &amp; her most secret mission. Through the memories of three particular crew members &amp; the researching of hundreds of documents, this author unearths the accidents &amp; snafus that cast the Indy's fate as she island-hopped across the Pacific.<br />There were 1,196 souls aboard the USS Indianapolis, many sleeping on deck, a handful incarcerated in the brig, a few in the infirmary. The cooks &amp; dishwashers had finished their work &amp; were at last also off duty. Captain Butler McVay went through his usual routine &amp; headed for his watch bunk.<br />Unbeknownst to the US Navy &amp; the high-level secret agents that covered the Pacific war zone, young Lieutenant Commander Hashimoto, captain of the I-58 submarine, was prowling the same waters looking for trouble. Early one evening, his sonar man picked up a noise that was coming closer. Hashimoto ordered his submarine to surface &amp; couldn't believe his luck when they caught a bearing on a possible enemy ship. <br />At 12:05 A.M. on July 30, 1945 all hell broke loose aboard the USS Indianapolis. <br />Interweaving the stories of three survivors - the captain, the ship's doctor, &amp; a young marine - journalist Doug Stanton has brought this astonishing human drama to life in a narrative that is both immediate &amp; timeless.As the definitive account of a little-known chapter in World War II history, In Harm's Way is destined to become a classic tale of war, survival &amp; extraordinary courage.<br />I learnt so much about the war in the Pacific - how it was fought, survived, its final submission &amp; the attitude of a nation eager to be done with war. A remarkably lively, respectful &amp; detailed read that breathes life back into a dusty tragedy of naval snafus, bureaucratic complacency &amp; eventual punitive actions.<br />It is, however, the valor &amp; tenacity of every one of those souls who died &amp; survived that earns the respect of this child of war!	2001-05-03

From Antiquity, tuberculosis has been a killer on a huge scale, ever-present yet lurking rather than epidemic; its explosion in the 1800s went hand-in-hand with industrialization, abetted by bad housing, endless work hours &amp; poverty.<br />For the Victorians, who elevated illness to art forms, the victims of TB were the ultimate in pale &amp; interesting; the roll call of tuberculous genius reads like who's who of artists &amp; writers: Keats, Chopin, the Brontes; Robert Louis Stevenson, Chekhov, Orwell, to name only a few. <br />Thomas Dormandy has written an engrossing account of the amazingly complex social, artistic &amp; natural history of this ubiquitous disease as well as a telling chronicle of the medical profession at its worst &amp; best.<br />This is one vitally informative, compelling &amp; erudite volume on an affliction that has been with us since we began burying our dead, drawing on walls &amp; writing. Make no mistake, TB is with us still! It is now mutating upon the new vectors of HIV, prisons, orphanages &amp; multidrug resistancy.<br />The White Death is an impressive &amp; eminently readable history!

Editors &amp; writers for The New York Times asked one central question: &quot;What are race relations like today?&quot; These are the raw stories &amp; candid observations they found just below the surface of this country's private &amp; public discourse on race relations.<br />That said hold onto you seat for a bumpy read about a subject that upsets most of us &amp; still fills us with dread &amp; hope.<br />There are 15 articles written by 15 very different reporters - each focusing on an aspect of race relations that speaks particularly to them. I cannot separate them here for you - suffice to write that each article will put you through your complacency paces, set your nerves ajangling &amp; raise a host of old ghosts most of us wish would lay low.<br />How are race relations lived today? Very, very carefully &amp; rather schizophrenically for the most part &amp; for other parts? Pure, teeth-grinding swallowings of crow food, blundering inconsiderations - hell, they treat their dogs better! &amp; hope - what a faint &amp; fragile zephyr is hope! <br />While we may no longer have to storm into Cicero to demand equal rights to live in equally pleasant homes - we sure are determined to judge each other for the way we talk, about what we talk, the way we walk &amp; to where we walk, even the way we say hello - the color of our skin may be the least of it!<br />In the end both photographers &amp; reporters speak their piece about their piece &amp; make peace with the process - their stories are as vital as the previous ones &amp; just as telling as they tell about their own prejudices, foregone assumptions &amp; epiphanies. <br />How Race Is Lived in America touches each &amp; every one of us: from the farmer in the field watching Indians drive by on their way to a hunt he is no longer allowed to make to the dainty dames in Southern places who simply can't understand what all the fuss is about; to athletes whose prowess on the field is less than their will to survive; to best friends torn apart by the pressures of their cultures to laborers in bloody jobs whose blood all runs red &amp; to anyone who sees others shrink away because of their skin color &amp; what it symbolizes. <br />This is a keeper for it will take quite a while to think through the dust these reporters have raised! It is appropriate that a Pulitzer Prize has been awarded for this moving &amp; troubling effort.	2001-04-30

Webmaster &amp; I always eagerly grab Author Burke's latest off the library shelf &amp; hurry home to return to Dave Robichaux's world of swamps &amp; sunsets, boogie players &amp; lowlifes, an ordinary man with an extraordinary sense of honor &amp; compassion with a recovering wife he adores, a teenage daughter on the verge of rebellion &amp; a home &amp; fishing business his father built with his bare hands.<br />Dave Robicheaux is a Vietnam Veteran &amp; a New Iberia Parish police detective who has only recently dragged himself out of the bottle. When he gets a call to check out an isolated house he finds his long time friend Clete Purcel throwing lowlifes off the roof into an ancient oak tree. While Dave attempts to sort out the fracas, Zipper Clum, a well-known pimp, squints at him &amp; utters a horrifying statement that sends Dave into a swamp of pain &amp; into the past of New Orleans law enforcement, a hive of corruption no one wants to disturb. <br />A James Lee Burke book is always a maze of stories where past &amp; present melt into each other &amp; where the Louisiana land is as much a player in the story as are the people. The bayous come alive with colors, sounds, scents &amp; seasons.<br />Fascinating reading - as are all Burke's books.	2001-04-22

An ordinary woman with low self-esteem has an encounter in New Mexico with  aliens who hire her to transmit their message of peace to the powers that be in Washington. Benita Alvarez-Shipton is a book store manager with grown children in college, a bully of a husband at home &amp; nothing to go back to.<br />With more money than she's ever seen, as payment for her messenger service &amp; the vibrating box the aliens gave her to deliver which squeaks like a two-year old having a tantrum when left alone, Benita starts a new life with a new purpose &amp; courage. Somehow, with the advent of the aliens, Benita's faculties have sharpened &amp; the battered, belittled spouse has sloughed away.<br />I have read several Sheri S. Tepper books &amp; although some of her stories did not click with me, they always held my attention. The worlds she creates are always different &amp; she makes you reach to understand them. The Fresco is more of the same &amp; while the setting is not as far out as most of her destinations, she still makes you feel as if you're living in it.<br />A lot has been said about alien contact. When one stops to truly visualize how we humans have polluted the space around us, I for one, am beginning to wonder who's listening. As a member of this human race, there are times when I can feel the collar of the goat around my own neck &amp; think I can smell the tiger.<br />Thinking hard about what you're reading is Sheri S. Tepper's tour de force. This book will raise lots of questions about all of your life's experiences.	2001-04-22

D., is a woman in control of her life &amp; at the top of her profession, which is 17th century metaphysical poetry - a brilliantly difficult cerebral vocation. She is proud of her razor sharp deductive mind &amp; her single-minded dedication to this arcane subject which has kept her far above the madding crowd &amp; a spinster without family.<br />Being a woman of words, she muses upon every one that is tossed her way by her oncologist, his avid pupil &amp; attending technicians. While they are telling her what their textbooks infer, she is listening to what their language implies. Therein lies the humor &amp; the pathos!<br />Even as she endures the impersonal gawking of research doctors &amp; their students she evaluates their teaching methods &amp; their students' efforts, remembering her own method of teaching &amp; her own attitude toward students. Yet to this woman of words, whenever she is asked how she feels, she is immoderately polite &amp; reticent only uttering that fatuous monosyllable: &quot;Fine!&quot;<br />W;t has been made into a film for HBO &amp; will be aired in April 2001.

Made me think long on how we learn is how we teach; what would I do &amp; be like were I to face this form of exit &amp; keeping my wits about me.<br />I recommend you experience Wit - it will surely change your life!

I read this one just before I emigrated to America &amp; kept my copy for years until, one day I realized I'd lost it. <br />Now I have a well-worn paperback again &amp; re-read this simple, hopeful story at least once a year.<br />It's about a young English woman in Poland during the long, phoney-war summer of 1939. When she finally decides to leave for the safety of England, she can't go, she's half in love with Poland &amp; curious about why so many people seem to know her.<br />When Hitler's planes &amp; army invade Poland, she is cast into the dangers &amp; intrigues of the Polish underground. There she finds courage &amp; love &amp; must prove herself.<br />Originally published in 1944, it was quite a daring book for its day. We modern readers, used to coarse, repetitive language &amp; explicit sex &amp; violence, must sit back &amp; become familiar with a different time with different priorities.<br />I've always enjoyed Helen MacInnes' books - they are well written, thought-provoking &amp; well-researched.	2001-04-01

Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys co-authored by Teresa Barker. Two of the country's leading child psychologists share their experiences of working with boys &amp; their families. They reveal a nation of boys who are hurting - sad, afraid, angry &amp; silent. Statistics point to an alarming number of boys at risk for suicide, alcohol &amp; drug abuse, violence &amp; loneliness.<br />Kindlon &amp; Thompson set out to answer this crucial question: What do boys need that they're not getting? Through moving case studies &amp; up-to-date research, Raising Cain portrays generations of boys systematically herded away from their emotional life by adults &amp; the peer &quot;culture of cruelty&quot;; receiving little encouragement to examine their emotions &amp; develop qualities like compassion, sensitivity &amp; affection.<br />In Fathers and Sons: A Legacy of Desire and Distance, Kindlon &amp; Thompson open up the sad, sad wound of unrequited love. When a grown man cries in therapy, it is almost always about his father &amp; his yearning for his father's love. Into that yearning has been fed decades of anger, sadness &amp; shame.<br />Why is it that fathers describe their sons as never listening, not understanding while their sons describe their fathers in similar terms of discontent? Why do sons rub their fathers the wrong way? Can fathers &amp; sons have a close, loving relationship? How can they close the emotional gulf? Kindlon &amp; Thompson have some good ideas, read'em &amp; weep!<br />Kindlon &amp; Thompson identify the social &amp; emotional challenges boys must encounter in school &amp; the streets &amp; show us how we can help boys cultivate emotional awareness, empathy &amp; health. They offer us seven foundations of parenting, teaching &amp; creating communities that respect &amp; cultivate the inner life of boys. Read'em &amp; weep, then practise them! <br />Raising Cain is aptly titled for it is one tough book to read! There were portions I dreaded! I do, however, recommend it heartily even if you have no boys in your life - you must have brothers, husbands, co-workers, employees &amp; bosses &amp; this book goes a long, long way to explaining why modern people of the male gender behave the way they do.

I gladly give the life of Sammy Davis Jr. 5 stars, however, the Boyers have done this bright icon who came into their lives a disservice by simply expanding on Sammy's two previous autobiographies with more &amp; longer details without any attempt to focus his memories or put order into the reading &amp; that is why I give the book only 2 stars.<br />Sammy Davis Jr. rose from childhood stardom in vaudeville to become one of the most famous African-Americans of the 1950s &amp; 1960s. At the same time his career, friends &amp; lifestyle were surrounded by controversy &amp; his experiences as a black performer in segregated America. <br />Of all the celebrities in the American star-studied panoply, Sammy Davis Jr., crossed over more lines. He converted to an unpopular religion; he had no fear of dating &amp; marrying beautiful white women; he was close to the Kennedys &amp; the Nixons; he was a member of Frank Sinatra's notorious Rat Pack &amp; he played with alcohol &amp; drugs. <br />It's amusing to read his opinions of the two songs he liked the least as they became best-sellers - going platinum to his amazement.<br />I think an Index of his best-selling songs, his legendary Las Vegas performances, his world-wide concerts &amp; his movies &amp; television shows should have been included. Sammy Davis Jr., was also a spokesperson for his people &amp; an Index of the movers &amp; shakers of the Civil Rights Movement &amp; the politicians of his time with whom he consulted &amp; for whom he worked, is vital.<br />There isn't even a curriculum vitae!

Some for their derring-do &amp; some for their expressions of inspiration. Some have made no headlines as they work with our homeless citizens or live with HIV, poverty or teach welfare mothers. One filmed documentaries in dangerous poltiical places. Another survived imprisonment at the hands of rebel bandits in a little known nation only to go to work, upon release, with refugees in ethnic-cleansing zones. Another stepped out of the shadow of a best-selling husband &amp; learnt to speak her own piece while another is a pilgrim upon her walk toward spiritual knowledge.<br />Listening to their words, remarking upon Katherine Martin's commentary, I have found myself in good company &amp; would willingly offer any one of these brave women my seat by the fire &amp; a cup of hot tea!

This is a novel of great depth, written by a man who has lived his life  observing, thinking, asking questions, considering and writing. His great talent lies in speaking for many: for fathers, mothers, sons, lovers, passionate revolutionaries and for each of us.<br />The Years With Laura Diaz, is as great a mural and testament, and as real and colorful as the Diego Rivera mural that graces its cover. Just as the great mural tells the history and stories of a people, so this magnificently written work shows us the colors and contrasts that richly color our world.

Generations of tribes of the First People gather at this high place &amp; revere this lonesome tree.<br />Then explorers from across the world pass by with anger in their hearts &amp; the pathway they find becomes the Sante Fe Trail. In time trappers &amp; settlers pass on by leaving their marks, telling their stories.<br />This is the way I love to learn history: the ebb &amp; flow of rich memories, evocative paintings &amp; curious sketches depicting the passage of time &amp; the tools of people on the move.

In her Introduction, Judy Reeves reminisces about a writing practice session when the topic was Footprints. In a trice I was off to my keyboard to tap out that image, carried with me all these years, of an immaculately vacuumed brand new carpet upon which I had, unthinkingly, just walked. <br />This book contains a year in the writing life: each month contains a Guideline; a discussion of subjects such as How To Start; Perfectionism; Slow Down etc. The Beyond Practice sections are about A Writing Date or Cafe Writing; Hot Nights/Wild Women(For Men Too)or Writing Marathons. Hundreds of rousing exercises for the slothful writer, curious snippets of literary lore &amp; legend abound &amp; it's all in good fun &amp; eminently useful!<br />This is a keeper, one your local writers would be glad to own!

Since no two people use language in precisely the same way, our identities are encoded in our own language, a kind of literary DNA. Professor Foster combines traditional scholarship with modern technology in the search for anonymous authors - creating a new field of investigation - literary forensics.<br />As Don Foster writes of his cases, he recounts the story of his own life because it is all intertwined &amp; as his prowess becomes accepted he is drawn, sometimes even challenged, into cases that have made the headlines: who really did wite Primary Colors; the Tripp-Lewinsky Talking Points &amp; the Unabom Manifesto?  <br />When Don Foster is asked to poke his learned nose into an old, old mystery of the American Classic, &quot;The Night Before Christmas&quot;, he is in his element &amp; takes us on a history lesson about how Santa Claus came to be. Off we go back in time to 1823 Poughkeepsie &amp; the writings of Mrs. Van Deusen's great-great-great-great-great grandfather who wrote funny anapestic poetry at the drop of a hat.<br />What I relish about Author Unknown is the language - it had me gleefully delving into my dictionary, opening up whole new realms. I had dreaded a dry rendition of brittle research &amp; got instead, a lilting, entertaining &amp; instructive introduction into Literary Forensics.

Early in the 1900s Charlotte Bridger Drummond, a thoroughly modern woman &amp; a writer of popular women's adventures, sets out with a search party to rescue a lost child in the wilderness between Oregon &amp; Washington.<br />In the beginning, Wild Life is written in a dense &amp; informative narrative style, reminiscent of the literature of that era &amp; Molly Gloss has captured the transformation of a self-assured pioneer woman, confident in her knowledge of the local flora &amp; fauna, until she becomes separated from the search party. <br />Then Wild Life changes to short entries of despair &amp; longer ones when the observer, the scientist in Charlotte, overtakes the pampered housewife. <br />When Charlotte wanders into the territory of band of elusive, seemingly human creatures &amp; is accepted as part of their extended family, she must re-think her modern, patronizing opinion of wild animals &amp; learn the secrets to a contented life. Then the unthinkable happens: a battle between modern men &amp; the wild creatures she has befriended &amp; suddenly all the layers of that revered civilization are peeled away.<br />Wild Life is both a joy &amp; a labor, a remarkably absorbing, thought-provoking &amp; endearing read.

Basketball was a passion in Kentucky &amp; every highschool, no matter its size, organized a team to play game after game, traveling miles in all sorts of vehicles &amp; weather. In Cuba, Kentucky, an isolated rural town around which three rivers poured &amp; flooded, a group of rambunctious 8th grade boys became inspired by Coach Jack Story's dream of winning the 1952 state basketball championship &amp; the American Dream. <br />To a lesser degree yet with as much passion, the girls in the school fought &amp; conspired to form a cheer leading troupe. In their long skirts &amp; neck high Peter Pan blouses, they added their energy to the fever pitch.<br />Marianne Walker has told their stories with enthusiasm including insights from a time before over-the-counter medicines; when most everyone raised their own food; many were share-croppers &amp; there were no funded school programs; school bussing &amp; television. In a time when radio was king, not everyone had telephones &amp; sports writers were the revered messengers of the marathon games for which just about every person would turn out. Fascinating read!

What can we learn that will guide us through our own dark times to greet the dawn with brighter sight?<br />Most of us are taught to expect tough times - to suffer horribly. We expect to be diminished, to be tested &amp; found wanting. Most of us think grieving is for wimps &amp; the emotionally unstable. We are taught that control is all &amp; surrender cowardly; that destiny rules our lives &amp; choice is for the wealthy. Most of us have been taught poorly &amp; After the Darkest Hour has a lot to help us re-teach ourselves so we may walk our path in our own shoes.<br />I really relished Dr. Brehony's Practical Suggestions &amp; her stories as she recounts her insights from the lessons her clients &amp; family taught her.<br />After the Darkest Hour is a rich &amp; thoughtful read. While gently instructive, it does remind us, frequently, that we are not alone &amp; that walking blindly through our lives will surely cause us to whack our shins on what we insist upon not seeing or believing that no one else, ever, has felt or known such misery.

Witness the three lions in a circlet on which has been embroidered the British monarch's motto or the &quot;Star Quilt&quot; of Sage Richards Treharne Jones from Wales who came on her parents' mission, both of whom succumbed along the trail. Or Mary Mortensen Bjork's migration from Denmark &amp; her lively &quot;Crazy Patch Quilt&quot;; or Christina Erika Forsgren Davis from Sweden &amp; her plain &amp; simple &quot;Strip Quilt&quot;.

The Talmud and the Internet is all about nothing ever being lost &amp; about losing The Temple in the War against the Roman Empire; about Rabbinic stories &amp; Internet sites; marriage &amp; death; about connections to the past &amp; thinking of the future.<br />It is an astonishing read filled with the stories that make up Jonathan Rosen &amp; his beloved wife. It starts out as his maternal grandmother, a sturdy 95 year old suddenly dies &amp; how, soon afterwards when his computer crashes, the journal he had been keeping was lost. It ends up with the author pondering on the heritage which his soon-to-born daughter will inherit.<br />In between, this thin little book travels far back to the Destruction of the Second Temple &amp; Flavius Josephus' record of that time. About a rabbi who chose life rather than death. About a great American thinker &amp; his anti-Semitic bent; about this author's other grandmother who was murdered by the Nazis &amp; his father who was rescued.<br />This is an amazing exploration of living Divine expectations, seeking a life of balance.

From his first minor radio appearance to the last letter he wrote before his death. Verifiable Elvis Presley telegrams, letters to fans, his lovers &amp; friends as well quips with a slew of rare &amp; unknown photographs.<br />Elvis &amp; Jerry became friends in 1967, when they both lived in Memphis, Tennessee. Jerry was a deejay then &amp; played The King's disks the most. For more than two decades, when someone calls Graceland asking about Elvis collectibles, they are routinely referred to Jerry Osborne &amp; his series of Presley reference books.<br />Elvis was not noted for his conversational skills however, I have a feeling we didn't know how funny he actually could be. He cracked some deadpan, off-the-cuff quips that you can just hear him drawl<br />This has to be for dyed-in-the-wool devotees who want to know every &quot;Thank you&quot; &amp; &quot;Oh Yeah!&quot; &amp; &quot;Yes sir&quot; The King ever uttered or his simple, polite Thank You Notes, congratulatory telegrams &amp; holiday greetings. Sometimes I get the distinct impression that The King just didn't understand what all the fuss was about nor why anyone would want to ask some of the innane questions they did. When he was asked about music, however, he waxed positively poetic!<br />In his letters, Elvis did quite well, even has a lilt that comes through &amp; it's surprising to see just who he wrote to. There is also a fascinating photographic history of this Legend's public life - a who's who of show business &amp; movies!<br />If you know any Elvis fans &amp; want to give them the ultimate present, then Jerry Osborne's Elvis-Word for Word is as good as it gets!

It's not an unusual job for Burke to act as a middleman in an exchange of cash for a kidnapped child. This time the only things exchanged are bullets &amp; they're all meant for Burke. <br />Reading an Andrew Vachss book is to race through a tunnel at top speed, briefly catching sight of stops only to be hurtled on to the next. With tense jolts Vachss drives us relentlessly through every intersection &amp; offers us panting station halts for memories long since forgotten; or hoped so. There is a lean &amp; hungry feel to Vachss' writing &amp; yet, for the first time, I note a bubbling up of humor. A thrilling &amp; unput-downable adventure!<br />If you haven't read any of Andrew Vachss' hair-raising philosophical thrillers I do encourage you to do so.

The Earth has many lessons to teach us. These lessons are written on the ground at your feet, on the mountains across the river from my house, in the rocks of a riverbed, in the trees all around us. Once you learn to read them, you'll see them everywhere.<br />This inspired collaboration between Photographer William Neill and the Staff of San Francisco's acclaimed science museum, the Exploratorium, Traces of Time, beautifully illustrates the effects of time on our natural surroundings.<br />The Exploratorium was the one place in the Bay Area where I could take my chickadees for an entire day &amp; know we would all be learning things that were both strange &amp; curious about everyday objects &amp; events. It is the only hands-on museum where you never hear a discouraging word &amp; are invited to play. There are now over 650 exhibits which people can investigate with impunity.<br />This is a gloriously illustrated, thoughtfully written introduction to how the passing of time can be seen in the moment - rushing rivers captured in the camera's lens &amp; over the eons - geology explained.<br />Traces of Time will make an excellent gift that will keep on giving.

He leads you step by step through his thrillers like finding bits of treasure clues through a very dark forest. I really like the relationship between Alex Delaware &amp; Milo Sturgis.

Meanwhile  all around them hell is breaking loose in the form of an insane inmate who seems to be predicting murders! For my full review please see [my website] killed off?  Maybe because he talked too much to the investigators.  Kellerman describes Ardis Peak, Milo, Dr. Delaware, and Derrick Crimmins fairly well but many of the other people he fails to add anything very gripping,  Therefore, when you are introduced to a new suspect, it is really a fifty fifty shot if they are part of the rampant murders.  The ending is fairly interesting but many of the connections could have been established with greater clarity.	2000-11-12

I'd not read a Bill Bryson book before so as I began his trek around &amp; across Australia, I found myself chortling &amp; enchanted at this author's mischievous sense of the absurd. This book is packed with historical, geological, botanical, biological &amp; unusual travelogue detail of his adventures Down Under.<br />He is a keen observer of culture &amp; cupidity. Whether he's relaxing in Alice Springs with a brew, watching the white Saturday world mill before him, into which stumble 20th Century Aborigines. This author puts down his newspaper &amp; ponders on the history of Australia's First People; of the incoming European settlers' morals with regard to these elusive inhabitants who had survived, quite nicely thank you, for thousands of years only to be devastated by the plague of prejudice.<br />Or whether he's off on a train to Western Australia or enchanted by a lovely clean city or dabbling in the waters of New South Wales. This author dwells upon the peculiarity that Australia is home to more hair-raising critters of the deadly kind than anywhere else around this globe. With all his research, Bill Bryson is still not sure why. <br />Few details escape this intrepid traveler; he's especially good when illuminating the early sorties into the forbidding interior which, because he crisscrosses it a few times himself, he describes in bright, busy visions &amp; has definitely wetted my appetite for a gander at Down Under.

The night he arrives one of the town's best beloved &amp; larger-than-life characters is found dangling from a rope in his home, his Bible open at the page on which could be construed his suicide note.<br />Floraville's young police chief, borne of the warring farmlands &amp; mill owners, an ex-mill worker himself, has nothing to lose &amp; everything to gain when he hires on Mario to assist in solving what he knows &amp; can't yet prove, to be a murder.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed the insights la Lucia offers Mario, like some puckish imp whispering in his ear all the silent comments unwary people think while their mouths utter utterly different words! &amp; then Mario curses la Lucia &amp; away she goes &amp; he's left depending on his own wits.<br />An Uncertain Currency is a rare feast of memories, depravity, humor &amp; redemption.

In this memoir of three lives connected by history, proximity &amp; family ties are the many stories, often intimate &amp; achingly personal as well as deeply historic of one warrior's memories of a mission that changed the world &amp; a son's final attempt to grasp his father's sense of honor &amp; duty. A haunting tribute to ordinary heroes in an extraordinary time asked to perform their duty in saving the world from evil.<br />Bob Greene has woven together an absorbing book of discovery of things momentous &amp; minute about the timbre of duty from a bygone era: his father's army trunk containing the debris of those young &amp; distant years; the 50 years his parents had attended the Saturday football games at Ohio Stadium &amp; traveling with Paul Tibbets,who Bob's father &amp; his generation call the man who saved the world, to Branson, Missouri for the last Hurrah of the Enola Gay crew &amp; another son's gratitude.	2000-10-24

Even as his Grandmother wheezes out mean comments, she begins to con away from him his emergency stash of cash. Even as his Dad takes him to a theme park where he says he's gotten so much inspiration for handling his life, Joey can't make much sense of what his Dad says &amp; soon realizes that his Dad isn't much interested in what makes him tick. Joey so wants this visit to work that he defers to his Dad &amp; when they discover they have baseball in common, all things are possible, even getting off his medicine. Or are they?<br />Phew!

It also read a lot like an old-fashioned Chandler. I enjoyed the slight exaggeration of the characters, their motives, emotions &amp; lives. Found some gaping holes as it seemed very unrealistic that cops from one jurisdiction could freely operate in every other jurisdiction with little or no interaction.

From the inspiration of a nearby pond in a small Massachusetts town comes a reconstruction &amp; interpretation of New England's natural history &amp; the generations of people &amp; animals who have lived there since pre-Columbian times. In the grand tradition of Bronowski, Burke &amp; Attenborough, Diana Muir has written the ultimate connection/romance between photosynthesis &amp; water &amp; all who have been fed, clothed &amp; housed as a result.<br />If I were to use all the adjectives that bloomed in my brain as I read this book, you would accuse me of gushing. Suffice to say: this is one remarkable read! A keeper to which I shall return again &amp; again to engross myself in Diana Muir's matchless writing skill, impeccably cited resources &amp; fascinating Notes. This is a symphony of a book that has not only changed my mind, it has entertained &amp; educated me as no history course or teacher before.

It is September of 1958 when vacationing L.A. County Deputy Sheriff Kevin Pulaski stops at a truckers' cafe in Illinois as he heads home on the Mother Road. He wasn't looking for anything more than a cup of coffee &amp; a hot meal, what he found was a beautiful &amp; enigmatic young woman with a mission &amp; some family members out to get her back.

None of what Maria Shriver writes about: be it finding  your passion or seeing the consequences of your behavior; be it working  with people or learning from menial work; from being willing to fail to  burying superwoman; from mixing marriage, motherhood &amp; careers; from  being financially independent to learning to laugh -  none of it is exotic  or unknown, however, it is Maria Shriver's unique &amp; lively delivery  that makes it all special &amp; emminently readable.

I was so glad to find a  writer who has composed an Angelus to the mending of the human spirit; a  canticle of conversations with God. <br />Set in the modern San Francisco Bay  area, Leota's children have become hollow successes carrying the burden of  their wounded spirits &amp; tainting their own children in the same  way.<br />Back when Leota was lively &amp; young there was a war on, the men  were away fighting &amp; someone had to bring home the bacon. This Leota  did very well &amp; continued when her husband came home too broken be of  help. It was in the garden that Leota found her refuge, her chapel where  she spoke to her God &amp; it was in there that beauty abounded. Then  everyone left except Leota.<br />Into this lonely old woman's life of  meditation &amp; hurt comes a callow Berkeley student with his thesis  writing itself in his brain &amp; his heart on hold. Leota's granddaughter  also turns up with a suitcase full of pain &amp; questions. <br />A redemptive  &amp; contemplative read, well written &amp; rewarding.

What would you do if you were to come face to face with your tormenter who had not only damaged your leg beyond  repair, he had also taken away your virility before you'd ever had a chance  to experience it?

What would you do if  your quarry denied &amp; denied &amp; denied &amp; then, in an unguarded  moment, revealed his true nature?<br />Jim Lehrer has a palpable hit in this  one. Culled from Pacific Theater WWII stories when US Airmen flying over  Japan were shot down &amp; captured by a culture that not only rejected the  Rules of the Geneva Convention, they despised their captives for   surviving, believing that death was honorable &amp; surviving was for  cowards. In that frame of mind the Japanese POW commanders meted out  punishment one wouldn't visit upon a snake.

I didn't know Jim Lehrer wrote novels - amusing, articulate &amp;  suspenseful political thrillers. A rather telling expose of how a  nomination can be torpedoed before it gets out of the bay &amp; the  bargaining that goes on behind the scenes. Both Charlie &amp; Marty are  likable rogues - one because he's seen it all &amp; the other because he  can't believe all he's seeing. One has an enduring marriage, likes his  creature comforts &amp; has a cadre of loyal retired spooks still active in  the old bomb-the-opposition game. The other because he's so green &amp;  full of self-righteous perfect dreams. When the two of them clash the fun  begins. &amp; those purple dots? Ah, how petty are the things with which we  barter.

This biography of the first western woman Tibetan Buddhist lama, child of  the second half of the 20th Century &amp; seeker of spiritual perfection is  delightful, frank, detailed &amp; absorbing. Born into war-torn London's  East End this girl always felt out of place, survived some astonishingly  dangerous childhood traumas &amp; headed pell-mell into London's Swinging  Sixties. All the while she's been searching, finding the rare Budhhist  community, knowing yet not knowing what to do with her life. Finally she  earns enough money for her passage to India &amp; to the exiled Tibetan  Buddhist communities in the fabled foothills of the Himalayas. There, when  she isn't taken seriously as wanting to immerse herself in the religious  life just as the monks do, her determination becomes unshakable &amp; the  ultimate feminist battle is engaged. Does the Soul have gender? <br />This is  a stunning book!  Exciting &amp; infuriating; transformational &amp;  down-to-earth.

The son of  one of the three surviving flag raisers has penned a vivid portrait of  America in the first half of the 20th Century; of six sons destined for a  fate few had ever experienced before. When that photograph was printed on  the front pages of every newspaper in the land, those GIs became icons to a  nation at the cusp of war. How they got to Mount Suribachi, what happened  to them when they came off that hill &amp; afterwards when they arrived  home is a story worth telling.<br />James Bradley has woven a superb tapestry  of war &amp; disorder, arrogance &amp; compassion, naivete &amp; brutality.  I agree with Stephen Ambrose's accolade about being the best battle book I  ever read. I also assert that James Bradley's patchwork way of stitching  each hero's life together into one quilt of a dangerous &amp; triumphant  history is awe inspiring.

I relished Emma Ford's memoirs of her early days with  owls, falcons, eagles &amp; a hilarious assortment of four legged friends  &amp; foes.<br />The only child of divorced parents, Emma Ford labored to  fulfill her mother's kind expectations of a proper profession for herself;   eagerly taking on her school assignments the quicker to take off to the  castle &amp; continue her training in falconry. Sounds like something out  of medieval times? <br />Yes &amp; no, this is one thoroughly modern young  person who follows her heart &amp; finds herself a player in medieval  recreations, her eagles starring in films &amp; dashing off to Arabia to  hob knob with a sheik. All the while her sense of honor &amp; dedication is  developing even as a charming, self-possessed Heroine emerges. This is one  fresh, focused young women who has garnered for herself &amp; her beloved  menagerie a unique &amp; fascinating niche. A fabulous gift idea!

A bit of a slog for those of us not militarily minded, however, a must if you are to grasp a modicum of what this American son is all about. I relished learning about his life before politics, the times of his  ancestors &amp; the unrelenting saga of imprisonment on the other side of  the world.

Most of them are too small to see &amp; never get worshipped, at least by anything bigger than bacteria. Consider the tortoise &amp; the eagle. The former, a ground-hugging creature with limited, immediate horizons &amp;  the latter, while living in high places, sits for hours surveying all until  it spies the wobbling tortoise. If you've not dabbled in a Terry Pratchett  yet, you are in for a treat. If you like your world turned topsy-turvy just  to see what shakes out of your pockets of thoughts, get thee to this Terry  Pratchett &amp; chuckle. Ripping good stuff &amp; utterly irreverent!

You have to put aside your workaday impatience &amp; sit &amp; receive his words as you would a cup of fresh tea. With his rich imagery, his deft craft that brings to life the  serenity of a Japanese tea ceremony or the primitive, shape-shifting of  ancient Asian hill people; or the old &amp; wondrous waterroads &amp;  buildings of mystical Venice or the starkly bland American Mafia enclaves,  you learn that Mr. Lustbader will not disappoint.

Snatched from today's headlines, a boat full of refugees sets out for Florida as a dictator lies dying &amp; his ministers plot for power. Old USSR missiles with chemical warheads come online even as the US Navy ships out-dated weapons from Guantanemo Bay.

Then Rear  Admiral Jake Grafton &amp; his side-kick, Commander Toad Tarkington are on  the high seas again off the coast of the paradise of Cuba. A super modern  naval/political yarn with surprises at every corner &amp; a rollicking good  pace.

Later, as we zoomed hither &amp; yon about our itineraries, we'd  collide laughing, embrace &amp; wave farewell. That's how Bernie Siegel  affects you &amp; that's how he writes. Vivid, energetic, affectionate  &amp; refreshing. I've often wondered what would happen to our  relationships with our own doctor/s were we to brazenly carry a copy of any  one of Bernie Siegel's books to our appointments.	2000-05-22

In composing a review of a book we've used constantly &amp; incessantly over the years, my husband murmured that I should describe our copy. Wherever we've found a portion that pertains to our patch of earth in a valley on the edges of a National Forest, I've stashed a marker. Sometimes  it's an emery board, a letter from England, pages from scratchpads with  recipes for slug bait or maps of our raised bed plantings for a year,  postcards from friends warning us about their impending visit. This book is  now double in thickness yet these markers allow me easy access to what I  need most often. We have enjoyed every penny we invested in Steve Solomon's  Complete Guide to Natural Gardening. When we've got a problem, there's  usually an answer right in there. When we're wondering about our climate,  or our soil or our expectations for a harvest, given our climate, Steve  Solomon's got an answer.

The McCarthy Era was a bad time for freedom in America. It was the most widespread episode of political repression in US history, encompassing far more than the brief career of a senator from Wisconsin. Those who were too young to understand what was going on yet were old enough to know something  was happening, glimpsed the secrecy, sensed the social distress, have now  grown up; become scholars &amp; done the difficult &amp; grim exhumation of  one horrible carcass we've interred without honor for half a century. It is  not impulsive, this tracing of the causes for this crime - it is a lengthy,  labyrinthine labor.

She is not only afraid to speak,she is afraid of being. As I read I wondered if I was supposed to like this book, this heroine, this mute misery. I often had to re-read sections to make sense of it &amp; sometimes that sense was horrible. Partly because of Flutie's inarticulateness, partly because of her raw-boned neediness, partly because of her hidden voice. This is a devastating coming-of-age of one very lost girl stumbling toward womanhood. Worth the effort!...	2000-05-21

While this book has exquisite color photos of astonishingly beautiful shoes sewn by the women who wore them together with sepia tones from decades past &amp; current snapshots in modern day China, the subject of  this book, the millennium old tradition of binding little girls' feet for  the express purpose of enticing their husbands' sexual advances, is  heartbreaking. Beverley Jackson, however, doesn't allow you to wallow in  pity &amp; neither do the last few ladies she interviewed. Even as they  have had to totter en pointe for all of their lives, they have climbed  stairways to temples, congregated in market places &amp; generally had good  lives. Since the Communist Revolution, however, they have been pariahs,  symbols of a decadent past &amp; their works of art &amp; memories have  been suppressed. Until this big-footed American strode into their lives,  showed them her collection of Splendid Slippers &amp; listened to their  stories. A marvelous book, one of a kind &amp; going into its second  printing. Very well done!	2000-04-05
