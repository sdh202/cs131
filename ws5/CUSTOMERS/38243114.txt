The part that got me was that part about the bad guy not being bad anymore for no obvious reason.   <br /> <br />Some interesting points are raised about the nature of the Rift War and the nature of the god's themselves but thats about it.  Surely not the worst book I have read all year and I will probably check out the sequal.   <br /> <br />Overall-Part of my feelings for this book are just peety and stupid I am probably suffering from George RR Martin withdraw.	2005-10-10

They just aren't worth it anymore.      That being said this book is much more interesting then any of the other books set in this universe.  I probably say that because good old Ann C.  isn't around to give us her Sacarlet O' Hara impression every 5 seconds (thank god).  In this book the vast majority of the characters actually get to do something.  This is a welcome change from the other books.  I think this is due to the fact that Harry thins the herd somewhat and this time when he kills a character the reasoning behind it actually makes sense.  Clarence Porter still kicks [...] and so does Flora Blackford these are the two that have always stood out for me.       I still have to say this so bear with me the dialog is still annoying.  As one reviewer already mentioned character A.  says something and character B. says \\"Well I wish I could think that you were wrong\\".  This occurs in every point of view in almost every chapter.  What annoyed me even more was moronic terminology \\"Y-ranging, people bombs, barrels and Featherington Fizzies just to name a few.      Overall-There are many problems but it feels like the series is finally getting somewhere.	2005-09-19

My favorite is not the most witty or the strongest or even the most adaptable but I like him anyway.  He is Ned Stark some would say he has an overdeveloped sense of honor.  I think Martin put him in the book not only because he was a good charecter but also so that the reader could realize what a hard time the traditional fantasy charecter would have in his world.<br /><br />Think about it, Ned is the only charecter in this universe that is remotly close to all the other charecters in all those other traditional fantasy books.<br /><br />While very few of the charecters in this serise are wholly good or wholly evil they always seem to have one flaw or another that is holding them back.  The Starks the nominal \\"good guys\\" are proud and honorable but are rather stuck up about it all.<br /><br />The Lnnisters are not evil just single minded and will do whatever it takes to win.  They also do not trust the ability of the \\"small folk\\" to make decisions for themselves.  This is of course backed up with an iron will and a very large army.  I think that if any of the family was taken to the Wheel of Time Universe they would take it over in a matter of weeks.<br /><br />Overall-I have gone on too long already.  The book is a different approach even if it is still fantasy.  I don't know about any of the rest of you but I have had it up to my ears with books that go exactly as you expect them to.  Heck, read the books for the comedy and the wordplay if nothing else.	2005-09-12

I always try to give Turtledove the benefit of the doubt, considering he was the first author I ever read on a consistent basis.  Well what we have here is an ok story (much better in fact then any of the Great War  books).  Then again maybe I'm just saying that because I'm sick to death of the Great War books.   <br /> <br />The characters are even somewhat interesting which is a rare thing for the more recent Turtledove books.  There is even a minimum of stupid useless sex sceanes which is a also a real achomplishment considering the vast majority of Turtledove's writing style.   <br /> <br />What has always killed Turtledove books for me is the repetitive dialog.  Such as \\"In this timeline 2 cents was real money not worthless like in the home timeline.\\"  Gee, Harry that might have been useful information if you hadn't already told us 20 other times.  It makes me angery because its almost as if Turetledove is convinced him audience is so slow witted that they have to have nonessential plot details explained to them 20 times.  (A dollar for your thoughts)?   <br /> <br />Overall-In spite of this it was an ok book and honestly I will probably check out the sequel (from the library of course I haven't gotten a Turtledove book at a bookstore in years.)    <br />	2005-09-10

Yet even I expressed doubt when I heard about the general plot and advertising campaign for the movie.  Not only did I not think a River centric movie was not going to work I also found the advertising campaign to be moronic.  I mean \\"Can't stop the Signal\\" what in the world does that even mean?   <br /> <br />Well I was wrong this novellization was excellent although it probably helps that DeCandido is a fan himself.  The book is not going to win any awards but neither does it feel fake and forced like the vast majority of Star Trek books do.   <br /> <br />Here Mal acts like Mal and Jayne acts like Jayne likewise for the rest of the crew.  The storyline sounds great and its one thing to read it.  Its another thing entirely to see it.  Although I have to admit Mr. Universe as a character name just sounds cheesy  <br /> <br />Overall-September 30th 2005, no power in the verse can stop us.  I am confident of that having read the book.   <br />	2005-09-06

I did not know that.  I also did not know that there was a time when the people that designed the buildings were paid less then the actual craftsmen.   <br /> <br />Overall-Very fun book, well researched    <br />	2005-09-03

I mean honestly some parts were great but other parts were as bad as internet fanfiction.  I as a reader feel I have matured beyond the paranoid voluptuous rich mindcontroled lesbian plotline.  This is apparently more then I can say for Clive Cussler who makes the idea the centerpiece of his book!!! <br /> <br />There was however an interesting take on why the Trojan war actually took place (If it ever took place to begin with) <br /> <br />Overall-I might have been prepared to overlook the shorcommings of the book and chalk it up to simple summer reader fun.  This was of course before I got to the end where Cussler wrote himself into the plot.  That was just stupid.   <br />	2005-08-16

God there are so many of those.  Then the plotline backtracks on itself away from a resolution that you thought was already accomplished in the last book.  I don't hate the book but it just didn't get the blood pumping the last three did.   <br /> <br />Don't even me how I thought of I feel about the fighting ability of daughter of main guy (who's name I can't seem to remember that's my only problem with John Ringo books in general I can never keep the characters straight).  I also find books where a teenager has to kick butt and take names so clique and annoying that it makes me want to poke my eyes out.  That's just me.  It would be interesting to see how Ringo develops the character at a later date.    <br />	2005-08-12

It also shows that in any age any time anywhere there are no absolutes in politics.  In this way the author is able to communicate to the reader that Cicero was both a political opportunist and a patriot.  I mean this in all seriousness this is one of the best biographies that I have ever read.  The reader (at least me) begins to care about Cicero something that cannot be said of other works that have tried to dissect the lives of other classical figures.   <br /> <br />Overall-Read this one, you will be glad you did .   <br />	2005-08-12

Its turns into your basic Scifi story young man that doesn't think he is capable of anything in the end is capable of everything.  The first part of the books will have you thinking \\"Starship Troopers\\".  The second and shorter part of the book (when the soldiers actually get to where they are going) will have you thinking \\"Armor\\".  If you liked any of these two books you should get this book.

The Citizen is fine and would be good if it had not been done 5,000 times before.      Whispering Wind starts out strong true to its genera and then does a stupid Rip Van Winkle turnaround.

Maybe it's the British humor that I can never get the hang of I don't know.  \\"Pete what did you think of Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince if you were so unmoved by the rest of the books?   <br /> <br />Well I liked the book a whole lot as it happened especially the ending which I will not give away.  Ms.  Rowling this time has turned out a book that can hold its own against all others of its kind (that's juvenile fantasy you understand not adult fantasy).  All the things that make a book good can be found here and I have to say in terms of the plot and narrative flow the book just jives better then any of the others.   <br /> <br />Overall-The author finally has my convinced she can write a good book and I feel that I will be swept away on the wave of hype next time around.  This book is good trust the word of a former skeptic please.  This is the best Harry Potter book yet.   <br />	2005-07-25

Jim Wallis obviously wants to reach out to the left leaning readers of this book and make them understand his point of view.  I don't think he does a very good job because his arguments are not very clear or organized.  The author skips around from 9/11 to the Civil Rights movement and back to the present day with seemingly only a vague outline of where his arguments are taking him.      Although there are enough good things in this book to make me love some of it.  There was the part about the author's interview with Al Frankin for instance.  I think another viewer had it right Christianity is not primarily about justice it is about salvation of your own personal soul first and foremost.  Justice is only a bonus.  I don't think any book is going to convince people or convert people mainly because this country is so polarized anyway.      I mean look at the other reviews you have one star reviews from Conservative Christians unwilling to give the author the benefit of the doubt and basically calling him a traitor to his religion and his faith.  Speaking to this category:  Guys God has a handle on this he does not need your help.      You also have reviews from ultra-liberals who post long incoherent reviews about \\"a big brother in the sky\\" and the irrationality of it all.  These arguments seek to demean and debunk the Christian faith and are in their own way counter productive.  They only serve to make the other side more polarized.      Overall-I don't know what event is finally going to reconcile the two groups in this country.  I sometimes feel that both groups are preparing for some kind of crusade that is going to wipe the other from the face of the country.  This book could have been great but it makes effort to confront the issues.  It is in some ways a rant with the author first blasting one side then the other.	2005-07-11

Not great but not bad either just what I have come to expect from this author which I thought was the stuff of great books 5 years ago but now that I'm a little older I can see the problems.  The main one seems to be that character development is often sacrificed to move the story along.  Like in this book we are told that it is 20 years later and that many people that readers learned to love from previous books are now dead.  The exact circumstances of these deaths are immaterial for the most part and the main thing that matters is the overall story arch apparently.  I have to say that while the book was uneven in some places the new generation does show promise.	2005-06-29

Eventually as the book continues things start to go wrong.   <br /> <br />Its not that the book is boring its just the exposition of characters takes such a long time this trend continues without fail in any time period explored in the book.  This makes for an extremely choppy narration and takes away from a story that could have been really great.  I really don't know if the problem is too much space and not enough story or the other way around.   <br /> <br />Overall-Needs an editor that's for sure, if they had cut out 200 pages somewhere and ironed out the dialog a little the story would have been fine.   <br />	2005-06-14

This book really gets a bad rep from some fans and it should not GRRM world is not a world of lollypops and gum drops people can die in these books.  Its sad for all of us because feelings for the characters have been developed over time even for the minor ones.  The more I reread the books the more I realize that the deaths were nessicary for the continuation of the story.  Also the fact that characters can die is welcome change from the vast majority of fantasy literature where protagonists seems to be able to kill and maim legions of foes without apparent harm to themselves.  I loved the book even though I was sad to see some of the characters go. And that is the bare bones of the matter isn't it?  Only GRRM could make me care about the characters the way I do.  I find it strange sometimes I love the main POV characters and hate their supporting cast, other times I hate the main POV character and love their supporting cast.    <br /> <br />Overall-Its all still here the back story, the humor, plus the character development of all characters.  People may just be a little dissatisfied with the ending which is after all their right as a member of the reading public.  Just remember that plotlines and stories are not done by popular vote this is GRRM's creative work.  While I may be distressed about some of the conclusions I have every confidence that he is taking us where we want to go in the end.  Now that the publication date of A Feast for Crows is definite I can hardly wait.   <br />	2005-06-07

I keep reading them because in spite of the lack of character development in his books he is just one of those authors who's work is hopelessly addictive.   <br /> <br />Overall-I have to grudgingly admit that this book is better then Big Bad Wolf.	2005-05-22

God help me I am hopelessly addicted to this guy but we all have to be honest and realize that certain character templates get used over and over again.    <br /> <br />\\"The main thread concerns a party of Drenai heroes following the trail of a woman kidnapped by a slave caravan.

The book starts out doing an ok job of trying to separate fact from fiction.  By the time in the narrative that we get to the Lawence Raid the author's bias slipped out.  What is interesting is that Cole Younger is portrayed as a hero while the James Brothers and Quantrill are portrayed as the villains.  Also I felt that too much time was spent listing the dead of the Lawerence Raid it was almost a blow by blow account.   <br /> <br />Overall-Still something that I and the author can agree on is that Quantrill was a terminal coward who was only out for his own personal glory.  A previous reviewer mentioned Castel's biography and that should also serve as a companion book.  Both have strength and flaws.   <br />	2005-05-10

It is interesting when you read this book and compare the legacy of the Roosevelt family and the Kennedy family.  This is just my own opinion but I think the Roosevelt have more personality then all of the Kennedy family which is strange considering that the Roosevelt's are more overlooked.   <br /> <br />Roosevelt was in effect the first of the modern politicians but still elements of the old school.   <br /> <br />He was arrogant, a jingoist, and bombastic.  He was also larger then life and an honest man in his own way.  He also made sure that two of his sons served with the ground forces during WWI.

Some of the characters are a little 2-demsional and they repeat themselves a lot(remember this is Turtledove we are talking about) however that does not mean it is a bad book.  I was interested during the futile American defense of Hawaii and the rise of a renewed Hawaiian monarchy (encouraged by the Japanese of course.).  I will read the sequel.   <br /> <br />Overall-Better then the World war series with the Freedom party but I still think Dr. Turtledove needs to find some way to drag himself out of this WW2 rut.  He has published other (better) alternate history books set in other places in time.   <br />	2005-05-06

The only reason the book is getting three stars instead of two is that the footnotes were interesting and they unlike the main plot actually contributed something to the story.  I would have liked to read a book about the solely about the Raven King.   <br /> <br />Overall-Too long and I don't know what it was with the characters the author meant the dialog to be funny but every single character in the book just ended up sounding smug.  I could never get past that part.   <br />	2005-04-28

This book provided an opportunity for the princess to be fleshed out and in the process it manages to tell a darn good story AGIAN!! <br /> <br />I feel lucky that I found David Duncan.  I have read 5 of his books and I haven't hit a dud yet.  Wonderful character development and it was great to see the events from the previous two books at another angle.  He even manages to wrap up the contradictory ending and even though the way he does it has been done 1 million times Duncan makes it seem fresh and original.   <br /> <br />Overall-Get this book even if you don't like Fantasy its just a good story.   <br />	2005-04-27

These are the questions that Dies the Fire asks the reader to ansewer and as premises go it's a very good one.   <br /> <br />I have to say that this is the first S.M Stirling book that I really liked until about page 20 when introduced to the character of Juniper Mackenzie a Witch but (according to her) anything we readers have read about the religion is probably wrong (page 100).  That's interesting considering that she absolutely will not shut up about it.  Its always blessed mother this, merciful goddess that.  While we are on the subject what the hell is the Sign of the Horns anyway?   <br />I would not mind if this was once or twice but it occurs on practically every page that Juniper is on..  Frankly I felt that it was rammed down my throat.  Also the constant refrain of Merry met, Merry parting, Merry met again was particularly annoying.  Although to be honest Juniper's daughter kind of grew on me.   <br /> <br />Two other things  <br /> <br />I know I am not the first reviewer to mention this but isn't it a little strange that all of these people happen to be in exactly place at exactly the right time with exactly the right training that they need to survive this thing?  Everyone seems to be a medieval weapons expert both bad guys and good guys.   <br /> <br />I found the portrayal of Christians in this book to be offensive.  I know this is my own bias slipping out but be kind to me I managed to get through 200 pages of Mr.  Srling's own biases.  The leader of the bad guys is a former member of the Society of Jesus for gosh sake.   <br /> <br />The only other Christians we met in the course of the book (at least as far as I got) are the two skinheads on the road.  Good riddance to those guys I say.   <br /> <br />Overall-A grudgingly awarded three stars.  The premise was great enough to make it another \\"Stand\\" but crappy plot development ruined it.Leave the Wicca at home next time please Mr. Striling.  As strange as this sounds I will probably read the secound book.  <br />	2005-04-16

He also tries to portray all Muslims as religious fanatics pointing to examples regarding the traditional ways that Islam has treated foreigners, slaves and women.  Now, correct me if I am wrong but hasn't the west had some problems with slavery and the rights of women in the past?  This is just one of many examples.  He also tends to get off on tangents that go nowhere such as a previous reviewer noted the absence of Classical Music in the Islamic World.  This seems a bit of a stretch, in fact the entire book seems like a bit of a stretch.  Before you lambaste me as a person who just doesn't like Bernard Lewis please note that I enjoyed \\"Race and Slavery in the Middle East\\" very much.  That book unlike this one does a fine job of ansewering the question that it set out to answer.   <br /> <br />Overall-Either Lewis is losing his touch or he needs to fire his editor.  Whenever the book gets any momentum going it will meander down a winding tangent pass never to return.  If a lot of this book seems familiar to you it should.  Lewis has used the cut and paste function frequently here with entire paragraphs being lifted from his previous works and being recycled.  Also I don't know if the odd vibe I'm getting from some of the passages is anger or just plain condescension.    <br />	2005-04-14

All of this has been said already and I do not want to take away from the importance of a classic.   <br /> <br />However this translation leaves much to desired.  As a previous reviewer said that are better translations of this book out there.  These translations tend to make some sense and you do not need a rolodex to keep track of all of the names of the characters.  I read this version and I didn't like it then I went and read another version that wasn't condensed for time.   <br />	2005-04-11

Mr. Shaara is able to pay close attention to historical detail like his dad but he seems unable to make me care about the characters like his father did.

All of the elements are there but <br />something seems to be off.  For example the premise <br />has always been that humanity was isolated and <br />scattered with few allies and fewer weapons.   <br /> <br />While we get some of that at the end does anyone else <br />think it was rather fortunate that Valentine liberated <br />the entire island of Jamaca in less then a month <br />practically by himself?  Who the heck is he is <br />superman?  That is not what this series has been <br />about.   <br /> <br />Also am I the only one who thought the super weapon <br />was stupid?  I don't care what it does to the Reapers <br />it is still a stupid idea.   <br /> <br />Overall-Look we all know that series tend to get <br />choppy around this time.  Either Knight will improve <br />or his style of writing will just get worse.  Read it <br />for continuities sake but don't expect what you got in <br />the first two books.   <br />	2005-04-11

It is just refreshing to read someone that is not hung up on the medieval stereotype of fantasy and intested in telling a story instead of just another cookie cutter loaded with what you would expect.  This type of Fantasy is much more renaissance, I know I'm not the only guy to pick up on that.  The fights just seem to have more style then in a lot of books of a similar type.  I liked the book because the characters are mostly fleshed out with read reasons for doing what they are doing.  Duncan is no GRR Martin but he is the closest that I have seen.   <br /> <br />I know I shouldn't evaluate one man's work based on the book of another guy so don't hate its just that Martin writes so well.   <br />Its good that Duncan is around because I have been going crazy looking for good Fantasy.   <br /> <br />This book is wonderful so the rest of the series must be great to I am going to check it out, I suggest you do the same.   <br />	2005-03-22

Philosophizing is fine but where the Scots came in is taking the quizzical nature of the Enlightenment and applying it to practical pursuits like science, medicine and even the beginnings of modern economics (Adam Smith, who's father was a customs officer oddly enough).  The author also does his best expunge some of the popular myths of Scottish history including the cases for the Jacobite Rebellions of 1715 and 1745.   <br /> <br />Overall-I loved the book but in some ways it got a little repetitive something akin to reading \\"How the Irish saved Civilization\\".  The Scots did a lot of great things but eventually the book has the reader believing that they did everything.  Eventually I began to wonder if Mr. Herman was going to give the Scottish people credit for inventing the wheel.   <br />	2005-03-14

The first story depicts some important decisions in the life of one particular member of the phropets own bodyguard the Angles of the Lord.  It follows him through his recruitment by the underground organization until the eventual liberation of the United States of America.   <br /> <br />The story, the first in the collection is great it is a pretty powerful testament to what is happening today in America to a certain existent.  It is also practically unique in the works of Robert H. because it features (almost) no incest of any kind.   <br /> <br />The second story is more odd.  It starts off strong and continues quite briskly until the end where it sort of contradicts itself.  I've noticed that this is a pattern in some Heinlein stories. See \\"Citizen of the Galaxy\\" for a good example.   <br /> <br />The third story gets even stranger the basic plot goes something like this:  A ship of workers/exiles set up shop on an asteroid then they figure out that they brought there own prejudices with them from earth.  I'm sure they did something but I put the story down after 20 pages or so because it wasn't making an sense.   <br /> <br />Overall-Even with the slow plodding parts of it the first 2 stories are worth reading.  Check them out.  <br />	2005-03-07

Anyway the setup is not unlike any other fantasy book.  The King who was once evil now wants to do good but no one believes him.  The action is not half bad and that goes for the characters as well, even if they all say what other conflicted characters in other fantasy book have said 5 million times.   <br /> <br />The book is good, even though its one of those books from which the outcome can be ascertained before one even picks it up.   <br /> <br />Overall-Its not the best book around but dang it I'm looking desperately for something to hold me over until George RR Martin's next book comes out.   <br />	2005-03-07

I have been ok with the lastest Conrwell books; but I felt that Gallows Theif and The Grail Quest serise have been missing something.  Here Cornwell has found whatever whatever it was that had been missing a good story with strong and complexcated charecters.   <br /> <br />It is interesting to see as the book goes on who conflictred Uthred is over everything should he fit the English who are the people of his birth or should he fight the Danes who treated him like one of their own?  Also there is a large amount of dry wit here that has been missing in most of Bernard Cornwell's books since the last of the Warlord serise.   <br /> <br />Overall this book is a promising trend in the writting of this author and I hope that this book is part of a larger serise.	2005-02-25

Good basic story the classic everyman or boy in this case finds a mask that endows him with the powers of the God Apollo.  He doesn't know what to do so he decides after much soul searching and warring with the new presence in his head to take it to Mount Olympus.   <br /> <br />Overall-What you have here is basically a solid adventure story but I do have one problem the ending like most Saberhagen endings is just a little too metaphysical for me.

I do not think the chapters are linked together in an effective way and at times the author has to spend too much of his time on background information of the period and not enough time on the actual year in focus.

The sections when taken individually are excellent and I did like the quality of the writing., I even found wondering if there was going to be a 1689 or 1707.	2005-02-13

Sure he is no Bernard Cornwell.....But he is not that bad either.  This book actually was something of a breath of fresh air considering my favorite adventure authors have been slipping recently.

Several points that annoy me  <br /> <br />1. The gate women all we need in these books is another \\"close\\" group of women who can kick ass and take names.   <br /> <br />2.  Charecter development-nile no surprise there  <br />specifically when the heck did Doc Tanner get so anti-scientific?  His beef in previous books has always been agianst the specific people that trawled him out of the not pre-dark science itself.   <br /> <br />3.

There are still the obvious problems with the writing style each of the characters have to let each other(and the reader) the same information over and over even repeating the same lines of dialog like     It's a good thing that Kassipait isn't more crazy then she is   Or   Its kind of like looking down on the promised land.      The other problem I can see apart from the dialog is a continuity issue.  When the expedition of humans actually makes it to the surface of home several members of the race approach them an proclaim that they have friends that went with the conquest fleet.  What the heck?  Do members of the race live 900 years?  That part of the story does not make any kind of sense.      The story has many good points in its favor particularly the fact that the cast this time around is significantly narrowed down.  Less people to keep track of.       Overall-A solid, if not wholly perfect installment.	2005-01-31

At times the book had all of the best elements of the first three books and at times all of the worst elements of the last three.  True you can't please everyone but I was just expecting a little bit more.  I was not impressed with Mordred as a villain or the way that Flagg was eventually taken care of.  He deserved better.  Also, as with all King books there are certain points where the momentum dies.   <br /> <br />I'm not saying the book was a total lose.  The first 100 pages were fairly good and the Coda (last part of the book) was done in the correct fashion.  I think King just got a little preoccupied with trying to tie all of his various works together and didn't really pay attention to where the characters were going.  I gave up about  of the way through the book and skipped to the end, There were just some elements of the narration I could not take anymore.   <br /> <br />The ending was good as well, I will not reveal it but I didn't have any problems with it.   <br /> <br />Overall-maybe I would not be so disappointed with this book if I had not waited such a long time for it.  This is I think part of the problem a shortfall between what actually happened in the book and how I thought things were going to happen when the Dark Tower was reached.   <br /> <br />I still recommend if you are a fan but if you are disappointed at the end result you have every right to be.  Read the book and form your own opinion don't take my word for it.  I have a feeling it is going to be remembered as one of those love it or hate it kind of books.    <br />	2005-01-04

Whoever complied this collection did a very good job.  There are sources from everywhere the old Mughal Empire, occupying British forces trying to take over India, Gandhi, Jinnah, Nehru, even Bose who is most often overlooked.  There are even examples from the untouchables activists.

The author does his best to shatter the myth that Islam is color blind.  In the pages of this book time and time again he proves that the Arab Muslims may have been in fear of and were at the very least suspicious of the intentions and work ethics of Black converts to Islam.   <br /> <br />The book is a work from a purely sociological standpoint and it also had great historical research to back it up.  Also be sure to check out the several insightful examples of artwork provided to see how Black Muslims were portrayed in the art of the Arab world.   <br /> <br />Overall-Lewis really has all of his ducks in a row here a wonderful book  <br />	2005-01-04

Rather they got as far as they did because of the internal politics of the Islamic World.  At the time of the first crusades the Islamic world was reeling from the assaults of the Tatars and Mongols they really didn't care about the encroachment of crusaders partly because the distance was so vast.  An interesting thing to point out and a view that is probably very accurate.  The book then provides the reader with an explanation of  how this situation was made to come about.  Blame mostly gets laid at the feet of the Ottoman Empire.    <br /> <br />Overall-Goodish book, not the best on the subject but not the worst either.   <br />	2005-01-04

This is sort of a breakdown of American (and world) politics.  I certainly would not have expected a book of this quality to be authored by John S.  One of those books that you have to own to appreciate.  I checked a copy out from the library and then went and bought one for myself it is just that good.  All of the other contributors to the book did a really good job as well.   <br /> <br />The only thing that lessened the experience for me was the columns by Samantha B.  Listen lady Canada is a wonderful place, just stop trying to get all of us to live there.   <br />	2004-12-24

He yells and screams as much as the next guy but he actually does research to back his ranting points up.  This separates him from everyone else cable news (and radio) weather those people are liberal or conservative.  I honestly don't know what side of the aisle Bill sits on.      Overall-I think reading this book is worth your time.	2004-12-22

If a book ever gets to point where I can tell what is going to happen next the author is not doing the best job possible.   <br /> <br />And the ending was a little weak as well  <br /> <br />That's not to say that I didn't like the setup or the characters, some of whom were absolutely hilarious, especially Pepper and her odd fascination with...well peppers. <br /> <br /> I made the same mistake I always make I read a book in a series out of order.  Have to go back and read the entire series now.  <br />	2004-12-08

Boy is bought as slave, boy becomes beggar, boy loses mentor, boy honors mentors final wish and seeks out the people who will give him the skills to survive in a harsh uncaring galaxy a rather peculiar and heavily armed bunch called \\"the people\\".   <br /> <br />From that point on the book gets very interesting basically its about freedom and the choices we have in life, no one can decide your destiny you have to arrive at the conclusion on your own.   <br /> <br />While it is not Heinlein's absolute best it is not his absolute worst either.  Te only thing that killed the book for me was the last 40 pages totally took away from the sprit of the book.   <br />	2004-12-02

Bouncing around the Well of Lost Plots and the Great Library is fun do not get me wrong but nothing beats Chonoguard Agents, Neanderthals, Dodos and the undead.  This was a wonderful book, once agian never stale or dull a welcome change to most fiction produced now-a-days.   <br /> <br />Overall-Eagerly hoping for the next installment.	2004-11-23

It is at this point that the serise proves just how fun it can be.  Once you realize how good the plots are plus the knowledge that with fiction as his backdrop Fforde can never run out of ideas there is nowhere to go from here but up.  Each book in the serise gets better.  Even if you don't like the general plot occassionally Thursdays crazy family will make an appearence and you cannot help but love them.

I also have a problem because I have never read Jane Eyre before and I realize that half the jokes are going over my head.  I plan to read Jane Eyre than go back and read this book than I will be able to appriciate it more.   <br /> <br />Overall-Give the other three in the serise a shot even if you have a hard time getting into the first.	2004-11-09

Point is that the ADA is a useless bit of legislation and the entire act needs to be revisited and firmer classifications need to be established and keep in mind that this is person with a disability talking.  The points raised in this book are totally valid, please read with an open mind before you judge it.  I say that the issues are exactly the same as other equal rights movments of the past.

I know you fans have been patient and some of you(like me) had given up but give Harry one more shot.   <br /> <br />That cliffhanger at the end was really what made the book worth it for me.   <br /> <br />Overall-The books not that bad, the author seems to be pulling out of a tailspin.	2004-10-26

As much as I wanted to enjoy the book and pay attention to it I couldn't get past the torture parts  <br /> <br />These included(but were not limited too) <br /> <br />Torture  <br />Gang Rapes  <br />Beheadings  <br />Skinning people alive but not before the people had their tongues ripped out usually with bare hands or a dull knife  <br /> <br />I normally wouldn't mind but most of the time this stuff is carried out with a sort of glee that I would expect from someone who was into bondage or S&M <br /> <br />Another problem I had aside from the torture was that as with most pieces of epic fantasy I could skip whole pages and the plot had not advanced at all.  This is not an isolated incident a lot of fantasy authors have this problem.   <br /> <br />Overall-When the plot finally rolled around it was a good plot it managed to suck me in and keep my attention.  I am not saying that the book was bad.  I will probably read other books in this series but not before I have a nice stiff drink to keep me loose.   <br />	2004-10-20

That thing is the difference between the old way of doing things and the new way of doing things.  The nearest thing I can equate these books to is the difference between the New Star Wars movies and the old.  In fact those movies and these books have a lot of things in common.  They are both set in the same universe(or so we are told) and both have basically the same charecters.   <br /> <br />The old books feel freash and orginal able to inspire the imagination after so many years.   <br />Brian don't you realize that Dune was my introduction to the world of Science Fiction?  <br /> Kevin can't you understand that you write better on your own and not when you are butchering some creation of another person?   <br /> <br />For love of God as much as I liked the book, and i'm not saying there were not good parts there is just on cmparsion between the different books.  You also should be wary of comdeming something out of hand please read this book first(get it from the library) <br /> <br />Overall-I'm going to read the orginal \\"Dune\\" agian bye.	2004-10-11

I know that it goes with the territory and I really shouldn't complian because I have read the entire \\"STARFIST\\" seirse but sometimes you want a little more for your money.  <br /> <br />Overall-You can turn off your thinking cap and have some fun with this but the plot is very by-the-numbers you have read it a million times before.	2004-09-23

You can tell these poeple had fun when they were writting these stories and in the end that counts for a lot.   <br /> <br />I have to pick up the other volumes in this serise, you should too.	2004-09-20

The first type dealt with Native Americans in a negative way the common steriotypes Native Americans were protrayed as dirty durnken and savage even in the modern average world.   <br /> <br />The secound type is the opposite end of the spectrum Native Americans loved the land and were at peace with it.  Than the big bad europians came along and killed them.  But even in the modern day they carry on stoicly in the face of insermountable odds.   <br /> <br />The truth is somewhere in between the two extremes and it is not hard to figure out into which of the two catogories this book falls.  It pretends to be a serious historical approach but really is just prograganda.  What happened to Native Americans was awful but people hhave been getting loads of crap dumped on them since the begining of time.  Just because one group has been through a lot doesn't make them any better or noble than any of the rest of us.   <br /> <br />Overall-I have a problem with the price 72 pages for 9 dollars?? Come on.  I also think the book fails both as a historical work and as call to arms(its never quite sure which it is) <br /> <br />Get this book if this is your thing but do your research first.	2004-09-14

The characters are getting very interesting and I found myself warming up to some of the newer ones even Mia surprisingly.  The book kinda gets hazy in the middle but manages to sufficiently recover enough to keep the readers interest.   <br /> <br />Overall-I really don't know what to think of this book as much as I liked it I can see where the next book could go south really quick if King does it the wrong way.  And just for the record I found all of those commalla quotes at the end of the chapters really annoying.

It is also an essential book to read because if you skip this one and go to number three you will miss the most best part of the serise.   <br /> <br />I guess other than the good writting and the wonderful charecters(most of them and even than I can respect the ones I don't like)the reason I like this book so much is that everyone is preety much at the height of their power.   <br /> <br />With Robb King of the North and the Trident  <br />Tyrion in King's Landing practically running the place  <br />John Snow and the rest of the Night Watch going out to kick Wilding butt  <br />Even Theon Grayjoy manages to do something unexpected with kind of makes me like him in a pitying kind of way.   <br /> <br />Overall-Most of all don't forget Stannis and Renly because however you feel about this book you have to agree when Kings clash the whole land trembles.	2004-09-03

This book is a fine illistation of how well some of Heinlein's idea have transfered over into the 21st century (moon is a harsh mistress).  <br /> <br />Others simply have not (Farnham's Freehold).  I really didn't like where the book wound up for the vast majority reads like a sort of Turner Diaries in reverse only this time with the black men on top but than suddenly at the end of the book the main charecters are suddenly forgiven all of their transgresions and its back to square one.  In the end the book really doesn't make any kind of sense and too otp it all off the book is almost drianed of the author's usual good humor and wit.  Therefore it was really no fun for me too read.   <br /> <br />Overall-The author wrote this book for two reasons Either he was trying to make a vast social statment to white people about the shoe being on the other foot someday and that us white poeple had to change our ways.   <br /> <br />Or he just really hated black people I honestly don't know.  I do know that nothing in this book inspires me to read it over and over agian ike I have done for practically all of Heinlein's other works that I have read.	2004-08-31

Even though the book makes a mention 4 main heroes the 4th guy(the swashbuckler) really doesn't do much.   <br /> <br />The characters are likeable A forester, A young novice priest and a young knight.  I try not to compare this to Song of Ice and Fire but it is sort of unavoidable.   <br /> <br />So now my list of favorite authors reads  <br /> <br />George R. R.

I hope it is not the last they should prove worthy additions t the universe.   <br /> <br />The plot is preety standard they get to planet and find out that things are not all as they seem.  Which is just as well because if they got to the place and nothing happened it would make for a very dull Star Trek book.  The only thing that hurts the book is that the main conflict is wrapped up so easily.   <br /> <br />Overall-My small critisms do not mean that the book is not fun to read I polished it off in an afternoon it was also nice to see the Orion Syndcate they are probably my most favorite component of life in the Star Trek universe proves that there are still people in space that don't buy the federations high minded ideals.	2004-08-07

This book is not his best. Not really his fault he still writes well and can still tell a good story but the serise in general is trying to make sense of itself.  <br />  <br /> There will never never be a single Star Wars book ever agian that can touch the anticipation with which I awaited every installment of the New Jedi Order and that is what kills this book.  <br />  <br /> You cannot succesfully have a book that follows on the heels of Galactic Civil War not Zahn's fault it just can't be done.  <br />  <br /> Overall-Not bad, its just that I never thought I would see a star wars book that resorted to the old &quot;A bunch of crazy suvivors trapped on a spaceship ploy. It just doesn't work anymore and no self repecting Star Wars author should have to settle for it. It was however refreashing to watch Luke and Mara get together for some old fashion butt kicking. If that is why you buy a Star Wars book, go for it.	2004-07-27

I for one am blaming the editor becuase there is no way the author who gave us the first two installments of this serise could have knowingly contrbuted to the fourth.  <br />  <br /> It is one of those books that is not exactly good and not exactly bad the fact remains that you can skip whole chapters and really not miss one secound of the action. The previous reviewers are right it is almost as if David Farland grew sick of writting the book, it doesn't so much end as just stop.  <br />  <br /> As result  <br /> Questions that all readers have are never ansewered  <br /> Charecters from previous books are just forgoten  <br /> After waiting 4 books for the final resolution between good and evil the final showdown happens much too easily.  <br />  <br /> Overall-The main moral of this story seems to be	2004-07-26

While I dislike the man none can doubt his intelligence or proficiency as a writer.  Newt and his co-author manage to present a very believable picture of an alternative Gettysburg Champaign.  Just as full of struggles and suspense as the real battle was.<br /><br />Such it will never win many literature awards but parts of it are a darn sight better than what passes for alternative history currently.<br /><br />Two things annoy me and keep this book from getting a perfect rating.<br /><br />1. The lack of a descriptive vocabulary the word \\"Oppressive\\" was used to describe heat on no less than 15 occasions in the course of this book, I know because I counted.  It was wasn't just about the description of the heat, this happened a lot.<br /><br />2. Mr. Gingrich seems to have a personal basis towards what he calls \\"passive history\\" on behafe of history students all over the world I would like to apologize.  Some part of me(demonstrating my love for history by picking up this book) can't help but be a little offeneded.<br /><br />Overall-Other than that wonderful book a good alternate history book not written by Harry Turtledove I never thought I would see than if I lived to be 100	2004-07-26

The character of Odd is both well adjusted and funny considering all the crazy stuff he see and does.  The supporting charecters are well drawn and fleashed out as well.  I like books about perceptive characters that have strange abilities.  <br />Overall-May not be the most original idea ever conceived but I would buy a sequel fun and entertaining.  Only bad part is that the conclusion feels rushed like mr.  Koontz remembered he had to stop writting somewhere.	2004-07-15

The characters are all incredibly funny and fun to read.  <br />The basic plot runs like this a peaceful veterinarian in the town of Grange Florida has just won the lottery 14 million dollars.  She is a women and black.  Nothing big ever goes on in her quite little town except for the busloads of tourists coming to view the local favored religious shrines.  <br />There would not be story without a conflict which arrives in a pair of two skinheads who just so happen to have the other winning lottery ticket.  The two racists steal the ticket and rough her up.  <br />Now she has to get it back, with help from an investigative reporter, a friend in the ATF and a waitress at Hooter's.  <br />My impression-I liked the characters, some of the one-liners are classic.  The book would not be as good if the author were not as prolific but mystery writers as a general rule have to be.  The book is not without flaws the largest of which is that it is too long in my view but the conclusion does not feel rushed or convenient.   <br />If enjoy a good fun read treat yourself to this	2004-07-12

I thought the book was O.K but I will not reread the book agian and agian like I did with War God's Own and Oath of Swords.  <br />Overall-I really should not be this disappointed over a book I know but I waited for 6 years and got my hopes up.

I try to read this author all the way through, God knows I try but somehow his books always start strong, than fall off, than get strong agian.  I really don't know what my problem is must be my short attention span.  Part of my also wants to like this book, but than another part can't stand the charecters.

Sure his charecters in the 35th Maine can wax, wane and moan about the injustice of slavery and the horror of canabalism but it is always limited.  <br />Eventually he just shuts up and tells a good story.  Therefore this book is engaging and you can turn off your mind.  You still care for the charecters on some level but you do not have to think a lot.	2004-07-07

These books are like the enigizer bunny they keep going and going and going.  It has spawned 9 sequals(with talk of a tenth) and a prequel novel(and God only knows where that will end)  <br />I have heard about how great Ropert Jordon for years from some of my former highschool buddies who always praised him at great length(weather I wanted them to or not).  <br />Logically I asked what the plot was about they wouldn't tell me because I had to &quot;experiance it for myself&quot;(a more condensed version of what was actually said but I got the message that Robert Jordon was a great writer and a great man) <br />So I broke down and got the book. I made it to about page 50 before I just gave up.  Nothing was freaking happening, the charecters were still traveling down the road and Jordon seemed to be rather obsessive about describing every little detail which was probably why the story was taking so long.  <br />Overall-Some of you fans take this stuff way to seriously its a darn book it will not impart to you the meaning of life so quite reading it that way.  Heck when you take all the books together its probably longer than the Bible.  <br />As for myself I am sticking with George RR. Martin His books may be long winded but at least his charecters are interesting and there is something resembliong plot in his books.	2004-07-02

First published almost 60 years ago this work does a wonderful jobof explianing the differences between various schools of thought not just in China but in the rest of Asia.  <br />The differences between the teachings of Chuang Tzu, Mencius and The realists may not seem like much to us westerners but these three groups have all done a lot to shape Asia. <br />The thing I like most about this book is that it is short and broken up into three parts.  Therefore your mind doesn't do a blowout trying to digest all the material and you can study each school indivudally.  <br />Overall-Great book, most of the stories are very deep and will hold some meaning for everyone if you are just willing to listen.	2004-06-26

I'm sorry but never has a book by this author moved so ponderously and slowly almost without purpose.  This should not surprise me considering the plot type had been done a million times before.  To be fair I did not read the whole book I just managed to get about half-way but nothing was happening, nor were the characters doing anything by the halfway point I just gave up.  <br />Overall-Having just finished Odd Thomas I have to say that the contrast between the two is extraordinary if you are a Dean Koontz fan looking for a good time give Odd Thomas a spin and leave this one on the bargain rack where it belongs.	2004-06-07

Flawed hero overcomes big odds and eventually wins the day.  Does that mean the story is not good?  Of course not but the approach does get old at times.  <br />This particular installment shifts focus from Calin Ring ward or Jam Grimothe to Gaise Macon son of the &quot;evil&quot; Moidart.  Some people have not liked this book because of the transformation of this charecter from a bad guy to a good guy.  Now I was fine with what almost ruined the experiance for me was the supposed conflict between good and evil it just came across to me as rushed and unfinished like something Gemmell thought of at the last minute.  <br />Overall-A tad weak but still very solid all round a good read	2004-06-01

Three things that should never be mixed in any form of writing what so ever are Nazis, Vampires and the hallow earth theory.  <br />Let me just say that this book reminded me of those guys that used to wear black in High School they would drone on and on about how depressed they were and how all of their dreams were going to come true when they got out.  <br />In that regard at least the similalarites are unmistakable(that and all the Goths bad in High School had a pasty white vampirish complexion).  Rehnquist while trying to act the part of the tough guy seems to come in contact with a bunch of people that fight/deduce/debate/negotiate their way out the nearest wet paper bag.  His romantic relationship with Thyme Bridewell was particularly unbearable.    <br />In the end I was confused the mostly two dimensional characters do not go anywhere or achieve much of anything.  The characters in the went down into the earth and I was still on the surface scratching my head still trying to figure out where I lost track of the plot.  <br />Overall-This guy makes the likes of William W. Johnstone and James Axler seem like John Steinbeck. The characters needed to be fleshed out and so did the plot.	2004-05-22

I've noticed this too is a constant theme in books by this author one book will close and things will be going fine and than in the next installment it is 100 years later and things have really gone to hell in a handbasket.  <br />I think of all the books in by this author this is my favorite except of course for &quot;Legends&quot;.

The plot in and or itself is fairly mediocre and variations of it have been rehashed in mystery novels before.  What makes the book so good is the wonderfully crafted characters(Bernie, Caroline, Ray Kershmen) and the fact that Lawrence Block is such a prolific writer.  I mean I just love this guy he can make mundane activities like running from the police, hiding at a friends house and picking a lock into tremdosly funny activities.  It is for that reason that I read this series and while I will continue to read it, all the way up to volume 20 hopefully.	2004-05-18

The serise is nearing its end as can be seen by the way the rest of King's stories are becomming so intertwined with these books.  <br />The story starts out with the group being recuited to save a village from a  mysterious force.  Since as readers kniw, all paths lead to the beam and that the beam leads to the Dark Tower it turns out that the events of this book take them closer to their goal rather than away from it.  <br />The strain of the journey can be seen now and some of the actors in this great drama are taking a turn for the worst,  <br />Roland is willing to do his job but is dymatically running out of steam <BR>Eddie is comming into his own ready to take over should Roland fall.  <br />There are new people as well my favorite being Father Challahan-another travler from our side who King fans will recognize.  <br />The only drawback for me was jake, I don't think he gets enough speaking time in this book, hopefully that will change as the last two books wrap up.	2004-04-08

The time travle really isn't time travel the charecter who reacts to everything in typical Rambo fashion gets to share a part of his mind with an occupent of the 5th century.  i know it sounds like a good idea but  it loses its appeal in 15 pages tops.  <br />2.  Even if the Irish had overwehlmed the English at the time how would that &quot;Destory the World&quot;.

At a point this book is just one drawn out slugging match with the forces of the Emerald Queen.  <br />Everyone who has possibly even remotly been in a Feist serise of books has a part to play and for the most part this works out really well.  <br />My favorite sequence in the whole book is the conversation between Duke James and the leader of the Thives Guild.

In spite of all the great setup and the charecters that the authors had obviously put a lot of thought into we never really got to know them.  They whized by very fast and their chapters were over almost as soon as they had begun. I had a hard time remembering who these guys were and what they were doing.  <br />2.  The obvious attempt to leave an open ended cliff hanger so people will buy a sequal.  While I liked the story well enough that is not the point, people are supposed to LIKE a book well enough that they buy the sequal.  <br />If you perposfully leave out half of the story(when you could have wrapped it all up with no trouble) I don't know it smacks of something wrong in your overall approach to being an author.  <br />Overall-I'm cautiously interiged, but I will not pay for another book in this serise.	2004-03-27

I mean the funny parts of this book are still funny but really how many gun explosions, animal attacks, and just plian stupidity can we take?  The problem with this idea is that its just not novel anymore(doesn't mean they aren't funny)  <br />Good Idea in this book-I don't know about any of the other guys out there but I got fend up reading Darwin awards and discovering that appently only men do stupid things to get themselves eliminated from the gene pool.  <br />Here for the first time there was a section devoted to the stupid things women had done(however I must admiit that nothing in that section could hold a candle to some of the stupid things men have done)<br />My own personal favorite in this installment also happens to be the first entry from way back in the 1870s when a trial lawyer(presumably intellegant) who was attempting to prove his client's innocence demonstrated how the murder victim was holding his gun in such a way that the discharge struck him in the face and killed him.  He successfully demonstrated this to the jury.  However he forgot to unload the evidence(the gun).  <br />Either way he was right.	2004-03-15

The fact that anyone however ignorant of history could think that living in ancient Rome was greatest thing since sliced bread needs to have their head examined.  Yes I realize that this is a fictional character its just that she is unlikable(in the beginning) that it makes me want to throw up.  This character talks about precived \\"Offenses\\" a lot.  She is offended that she is living in a man's world, she is offended that her husband will not pay child support, she is offended that she has to take care of her children and on and on and on.  <br />Well I'm offended that she uses phases like \\"Testosterone poisoning\\", and \\"Tolerance\\", like they are going out of style.  <br />Two things save this book for me <BR>1. The fact that this book may have been written tongue and cheek(I'll give them the benefit of the doubt) <BR>2. The fact that most of the other people in the ancient Roman seem to make fun of the characters foppishness.  <br />Overall-While I am a Turtledove addict and read every single one of his books this one was a painful experience.  I call to mind the first thing that Mrs. Perrin remarked on when she was transferred make in time.  What was it you ask?  Was it that she might never get home?  Was it that she may never know what happened to her children?  No it was the lack of tampons.  <br />It was stupid crap like that that almost ruined the experience for me	2004-03-12

Its one of those books that you have in your possesion so you know you read it.  At the end of the day you just can't recall a single detail about it.  <br />If you want a book that the author put some serious thought into read &quot;Bourn Idenity&quot; or even &quot;Road to Omaha&quot;.  <br />Overall-This one just doesn't cut it	2004-03-12

I like Roo less than I like Erik so I found this book a lttle hard to get into at first.  Than about halfway through the book I started to realize that the charecter of Rubert Avery was starting to grow on so I ended up not minding all that much.  This is all coupled with the fact that there was some very cool &quot;Power behind the throne&quot; stuff, an approach in fiction that I have always been partical to.  <br />Overall-Thew most redeming quality of this book for me was that if left off at exactly the point where the book should have ended.  You know, when you read a book and you feel that the book should ended ten chapters ago?  There is none of that feeling here, I can't wait for my chance to read book 3.	2004-03-06

While there are problems that I had with the book the fact remains that I enjoyed it greatly as well.  When I first read I said to myself &quot;Hey this is great finally a Native American's perspective.  Than I looked at the orginal publication date...1969.  <br />Thats my only problem while it is witty and funny the issues discussed are at time too far in the past for me to understand.  All I have to go upon are my own preconcived notions taught to mein history class.  Mr. Deloria on the other hand was right there when all of this stuff was happening and for that reason this bok deserves some serious study.  <br />He basically has three main points <BR>1.  That the programs set up by Whites to help Native Amerixcans have actually hurt them in the llong run(be sure to read his rant agienst Anthropologists and missionaries)<BR>2.  There are still Native Americans east of the Mississippi(Some readers will not be aware of this even today)<BR>3.  The Native Americans have power but they are kinda like the Democratic Party they just can't organize(htis hasn't changed much even today) <br />Overall-I loved it, its a good book to see where Native Americans were in the 60s and how things have changed(or not changed) in the lat 34 years.	2004-03-05

While Feist may not be a Geroge RR. Martin he does manage to craft an enjoyable story with charecters that you can care about, particularly Erik and Roo, but I also like Bingo.  There are times when the story seems to fall into a pattern but it never stays there for long.  <br />Wonderful read I think this serise will tide me over untill the next book in A Song of Ice and Fire comes out.	2004-02-22

This book is funny with plently of inside jokes and interesting information.  I very much enjoyed it and I feel kind of stupid because I had this book on my self for 5 years before I read it.  <br />I'll say this for Nimoy if he is as big an egotist as William Shatner he sure doesn't write like it.  While it might not have the scope of Shatner's books, I don't know it just seems more human.  <br />Overall-A must for any Star Trek fan.	2004-02-22

You know things we can actually see as opposed to stuff we just have to take Moore's word on.  <br />Overall-I liked this book much more than I liked &quot;Stupid White Men&quot; but it still needs improvment.  It will make you think and make you laugh.	2004-02-14

I really tried with this book, I tried to like it and enjoy it but in the end I just couldn't get into it.  I think it would have helped if half of the book had been set before the catachlism and half of the book after the catachlism.  It would have longer but in the end I feel it would have made muchg more sense.  The hardest part for me while reading a book, epecially one dealing with Alternate History is accepting the events are happening.  Just being thrown into this new world and being told &quot;O.K this is whats going on&quot;, just doesn't cut it for me.  <br />Overall-I guess what i'm trying to say is that while I liked the story I think the author could have gone a lot more in depth with it.	2004-02-12

There hundreads of these types of book and virtually everybody eles that I can think does a better job.  Two main problems <br />1.  The aliens are too human-Whatever happened to just plian old bloodthristy aliens?  The bad guys can't make up there mind one minute they want to be our friends the next they want to kill us.  <br />2.  The writting style is just crap, as much as I wanted to like the book the writting style prohibited that.  As a result you can't really get involved in the story.  If you can't do that than you can't get to know the charecters and therefore you have wasted your money.  <br />One last thing-most of these soliders reminded me of the reservists from &quot;Southern Comfort&quot; for some reason.	2004-02-09

These types of collections are good because they expose people to various authors that they would not have read normally.  Thinking back on some of these stories still brings a smile to my face in some instances and a very loud goanb in some others,  <br />The strongest short stories in this colllection are <br />&quot;The Hedge Knight&quot; by George RR Martian-Its a good story and its nice to read a story by this author where the point of view is not shifting every 5 secounds<br />&quot;GRINNING MAN&quot; by Orson Scot Card-I probably wouldn't think it was so great if I didn't like &quot;The Tales of Alvin Maker&quot; so much.  This tale is also fun too because it centers on Alvin and the antics of one David Crocket King of the Wild Frontier.  <br />These are the two front runers I'll give an honorable mention to the &quot;Gunslinger&quot; short story because it was a good in me keeping my sanity in the long years between &quot;Wizard in Glass&quot; and &quot;Wolves of Challa&quot;  <br />Terry Goodkind's &quot;Debt of Bones&quot; does its job but remember that with all of Goodkind's works it is very discriptive.  Just speaking for myselgf wheneever i read one of his works I want to cheer and vomit at the same time.  <br />The only &quot;bad&quot; story in the bunch is Anne McCaffrey's &quot;Runners of Pern&quot;  who can you have a Pern story and not even throw in a dragon to keep us interested Mrs.  McCaffrey?  <br />Overall-solid and well rounded don't expect the unexpexcted where these authors are concerned.	2004-02-04

Rest assured most of your questions and lose ends will be answered people  <br />Nom Anor will finally pick one side or the other <BR>Jaccen and Jaina will be reunited <BR>The Galaxy will be saved <BR>There are great battles and plently of action which has been lacking some of the books ect everything will work out fine.  <br />Most of the time final epics in a series manage to fall flat on their face, this one managed to do amazingly well and truly triumphed in the face of my great expectations.  <br />I'm almost sorry the series is over.  I mean if you think about it those of us who have been reading this series since the very beginning kind of sort of grew up with these characters.  <br />When Vector Prime first came out I was 15 and in the midst of puberty, unable to smoke, drive a car or vote.  Now I attend college and have a steady job.  <br />So I guess in the end in addition to how good the book is \\"The Unifying Force\\" will make you think of all the things you have done in your own life since this series first started in '99.  I have to tell you it is a rare Star Wars book that can do that for me.  <br />My only question is why did James Luceno not get to write more of the other books in The New Jedi order?  He is a great author.	2004-01-28

Here for the first time in a long while we get to see a novel designed for Klingons and about Klingons facilitated by the use of previously introduced characters from TNG and DS9 episodes.

David Weber and Eric Flint are excellent at complementing each other.  Don't get me wrong I loved 1632 but this book was a lot more precise and intricate than a bunch of hevily armed hillbilly's blasting there way through poorly armed inexperienced mercenaries.  I still have some problems with this book but they are so minor I will not even mention them.  <br />This book proposes some interesting ideas <br />When the small West Virgina mining town was transported back through time did they emerge in a new universe or the old one that they came from?  <br />What would nations in 1633 do if they had access to history textbooks?  .  <br />I just think that this book takes itself more seriously than 1632 and as such characters that we were not supposed to like(The Simpsons) were fleshed out and made more human proving that they too had a role to play in this new world the West Virginia find themselves thrown into.  <br />My only beef is that it has been some time since I read 1632 a list of characters would have been appreciated. <br />Overall-All in all this is a good book and it has the potential to be a great series(highly recommended).	2004-01-17

So if you are looking for a biography there are probably better books you could pick.   <br />Two-While I loved the book I can certainly see where some others may have a problem, it suffers from a big problem in some historical accounts of all times, namely it is dry and at times it rambles.  That's fine by me I like blow-by-blow accounts of operations and battles but someone who is looking for something different might want to try something else.  <br />Overall-This book is sort of a like it or hate it book.  I happen to like it.	2004-01-06

Oh course there are also some demons, assasins and a dark God or two that also want him dead.  Keep in mind this is nothing Bahzell can't handle he has the War God on his side. <br />Sure this is just an ordinary book, but its a very fun ordinary book, I would not expect anything less from David Weber.

There are 4 main heros pitted agienst an equal number of bad guys.  Billy Bob, his son, Doc and his daughter I also enjoyed the characte1r of the sheiff in the town but I guess he really doesn't count as a \\"Good Guy\\" because he is just doing his job.  <br />The three bad guys are Clayton Dixon(the most menicing charcter in the book), Terry Witherspoon his annoying psychopath in training and a mobster who is about as stereotypical as they come.  <br />Barring all of these it's a great book for what it is, there are good guys you can root for and bad guys you can hate.  People familiar with a few James Lee Burke books will also take note there is also a ghost and several crazy people rounding out the cast something that no self respecting James Lee Berke book would be without.  <br />Overall-I loved the character development, the thing that killed this book was the many plot threads and that its villains were disposed of much too easily and conveniently I almost felt cheated when the book was over.  This is a book that will be perfect for long distance driving, because it keeps a listener or reader interested but not OVER interested.	2003-12-28

There is this fictional place on Long Island.  Now this lpace is an ordinary bar like &quot;Cheers&quot;, only its got aliens, time travlers, talking dogs and ordinary people that are just trying to cope with the stress of everyday life.  <br />Never before have I read a serise of books that the charecters had so much life and just plian fun.  This is just one of those books that makes you think to yourself, hell the author had a lot of fun writting this stuff.  <br />The stories are arranged conologically for 15 years and with rare exception the stories get better the further along you go very interesting sight to see.  <br />Overall-I love these books, and if you are a rookie just getting into the I hope you will too.	2003-12-18

The idea that neadersal man could developing ESP I thought was very cool.  So I checked the book out and got about halfway through.  The problem in this book lies not with the concept but with the characters. Them seem like they are ripped from the pages of a soap opera. Instead of worrying about the scientific discoveries and important stuff like that the two main protagonists seem only interested in having sex with each other.  Never mind that they are high up in the mountains being chased by a bunch of homicidal hominids.  <br />Overall-Great idea the author must really want the reader to go take an anthropology 101 class.	2003-12-16

The book also goes in directions that I would not have expected it to go providing it with a satisfactory conclusion which is more than I can say for most books of this ilk.  <br />First you have the humans-Old story the general population is weary of war and anxious for a peace that the military knows is never going to happen <br />The Enemy-The Zor, now these guys seem themselves as holy warriors on some sort of religious crusade because they see humans as servants of their equivalent of Satan.  They are the \\"ZURG\\" from Starcraft the \\"Kilrathi\\" from the Wigcommander series.  No doubt noble in their own way but difficult for us as characters to get into.  <br />My problems with the book-<br />Too much time is spent on the Zor mysticism aspect of this book, then we the reader realize it is two chapters later and nothing has been said.  <br />The human characters are interchangeable with the exception of one or two, all very prim and proper but not lifeless or unlovable don't get me wrong.   <br />I only read this book because a friend suggested to me that if I liked a similar series made by David Weber I would like this one.  <br />That set of books is good, this seems rather a poor imitation but not without its good points.	2003-12-06

There is some guy out there killing young couples in the Virginia area.  The press seemingly always without imagination in these types of books has started to call him &quot;The Couple Killer&quot;.<br />With mounting political preasure Scarpetta has to do what she is good at...crack the case.    <br />Some people give this serise a hard time because Scarpetta spends most of her time doing the actual field investigations not really any forenscis work.  I was fine with that and I respect the fact that authors couldn't sell many books if they just had the main charecter working in a lab all day.  <br />What annoyed me was Abby's charecter never in my entire life have I actually been praying for the bad guy to kill one of the charecters.  Did she always whine so much?  <br />All the other members of the supporting cast I liked Morino, The old black guy even the couple killer.  They all had depth, life and a sense of humor. <br />I had only read the first and one other in this serise.  I plan to go get some more.  I suggest you do the same.	2003-12-02

I enjoyed this book every much it didn't have the slugish feel of the last book and th echarecters this time around actually developed.  <br />As the book opens several changes have occured from the last time we meet these charecters <br />Manion Butler has retired from the senate of the Leauge and left control in the hands of the power hunergy and manipulative Iblis Gingo.  <br />The Jihad has ground on for years with little headway and the common folk are growing restless and weary of a war that seems to have no end in sight.  <br />They would have given up long ago if not for the will of Xavier Harkonian and Vor Attriades.  I particulary liked the interaction between these two charecters.  It will be interesting to see just how the break between their families occurs.  <br />You all will be very surpised as to what eventually happens to Saliem Wormrider and Norma Chenva, my two favorite charecters.  <br />Overall-I loved this book as much as I hated the last one.  If I can be convinced anyone can so I beg all of you to pick up this book.  It more that makes up for the shortfalls of the first book.  <br />However it did seem to me that quality was sacrificed for quantity in some instances.  This is really the only bad thing about it.	2003-11-22

A nice solid storyline and an interesting new universe helped to build up my anticipation for what should have been a great story and not just a good story.  <br />Some parts I liked, a new me everyday, disposable, reuseable clay warriors settling disputs between nations but for as much as you like the story the author sets up charecter development leaves much to be desired.  Albert came accross to me as a whimp how carried more about his garden than he did about his girlfriend.  <br />Also the ending and the final resolution were very weak considering the incrdable promise the book had at the start.  <br />Also and this is just a quibble on my part, why was their no glossary?  I grew confussed at use of terms such as Grey, Green, Red and yellow.  I'm sure I just missed a definition someplace but it annoyed the heck out of my to not know what the charecters kept refering to.  <br />Overall-The book was solid and well thought out but something gets lost in the translation that takes it down a star.	2003-11-15

Some very good plot twists make up for \\"Huh\\" moments any of us might suffer from.  <br />I do have some issues with this book <br />1. it takes a damn long time to get anywhere, once it does it manages to clip along fairly well and the reader tends to get interested but for the first 5 chapters it is just as slow as frozen molasses in winter time.  (that's a regional expression we have in the south)<BR>2. Characters are built up and then discarded with no explanation as to where exactly it was that they went or in some cases just killed off conveniently almost as if the author got bored with them.  <BR>3.  The ending (particularly the very end) is worthless and severed no point at all why I had to struggle to reach the end and find out the ansewer to a question I already knew is totally beyond me.  <br />I did like the story I'm not saying that, its just that parts of it do have their flaws <br />1. I liked the supporting characters Chris Jackson and Sergi in particular the back and forth between these two is priceless.  <BR>2. The author does have a good ear for what he is talking about as far as the technical stuff is concerned I like that.  <br />Overall-Good book but not perfect you should still consider if you are a newcomer, would be a nice introduction to this author.	2003-11-05

I liked parts of it especally Gabon's strides to keep his army together and his interaction with the mentally disabled man that killed 9 reavers with a pick ax.  I think the charecter of Baron Walt will come up agian in the fourth installment.  <br />I find it difficult to review this book simply because so much happens in it mostly good stuff.  I think the serise has reached the crossroads stage.  Usually after the 3rd book a serise gets better and stays better or heads south faster than an object dropped from the Empire State Building(can you say Wheel of Time?).  <br />This book is great for what it is i'm just holding off full judgment one way or another untill the 4th book comes ot in November.  <br />if you haven't started this serise go ahead and do so, you will not be disappionted.	2003-10-27

I got this book because I absolutly feel in love with &quot;Total Control&quot; a very good book.<br />This book on the other hand seems not to really have anything resembling a plot, at least not anything as intricite and in-depth as &quot;Total Control&quot;.<br />What I mean is you could try and read it if listening to a HE-MAN super sniper is your idea of a good time, but I personally couldn't stand the boo.  It just didn't make an sense and I gave up after about 65 pages.<br />overall-If you really, really like this author go ahead and read this book, as for myself I'm reading &quot;Total Control&quot; agian.	2003-10-24

The trouble is that any of you that were hear for the last book already know that.  <br />The most interesting part of the book has to be the part concerning Wedge.  These battle sceans are why I gave the book the 4th star they are wonderful.  We also have the internation between Nom Anor \\"The Prophet\\" and the rest of Vong to keep us interested.  This book tries its best to keep us entertained but fails on many levels.  Simply because much of the information that was \\"discovered\\" we as readers already knew about or had at least suspected.  Still this shouldn't diter you from buying the book I have the feeling that the series is building up to something big and that this book has an important role to play in it.  <br />Overall-You should only get this book if you REALLY have been keeping up with the series from book one.  You knew guys coming in will not understand all that is going on so don't try.  Once again battle sceans and the interaction were great it just appears to be the length of the series that's the problem here.  In many respects this book suffers from a lot of the drawbacks of a large serise taking 3 books to explian what could easily have been said in 2.	2003-10-20

Every couple of years a book like this will come along it usually centers on one of thre things.  <br />A John Wilkes Booth Conspiracy <BR>A Jesse James Conspiracy <BR>A Masonic Conspiracy <br />This time it is a combination of all three and it is one of the better ones.  <br />It tells the story of The Knights of the Golden Circle and their activities after the Civil War to raise the funds necessary to continue a second civil war.  <br />Parts of the book are great, parts of it sound like it was written by a crank some of the instances in this book are just that unbelievable.  <br />So if you are suspicious by nature and generally like books about conspiracies involving the civil war this is probably the book for you.  <BR>If you want a little proof to go with your history book this might not be your idea of a good time.  <br />Overall-I liked it a lot but only because this is my sort of thing	2003-10-19

Meet Anita Blake Vampire hunter, polkice consultent and Animator of the recently dead.  She has a problem, somthing is killing families wholesale, she needs to get help from an unlikely source namly Jean-Clade Master Vampire of the city of St. Louis.  <br />This book manages to combine gallows homor, wit, sarcasm and just plian old blood and guts into a real page turner.  I also like it because it doesn't seem to suffer from a lot of sex of the later books(most notably the last one in the serise)<br />All in all-This is just a wonderful read and a fasenating twist on the world of vampire stories.

For all of you who didn't like the last Sharp book I have got to say that this is the book for you.  <br />This is old school Sharp sort of a reverse of Sharp's Rifles this time with Sharp leading a group of green Portugal troops and trying to keep them alive.  <br />we have a great supporting cast here <br />The loveable Patrick Harper <BR>A French marshal with royal ambisions who you just love to hate <BR>A lawyer turned solider <BR>Mike Hogan <BR>and my own personal favorite a new addition William Christoper who is a fine sucessor to other venerable Sharp villans.  <br />It just seems to me that Mr. Cornwell had a lot more fun writting this book then he did the last one.

The writing style is simplistic and easy to understand and should be a wonderful book for new Christians.  The message of huminity and simplicity is a good one even if the meathods for getting the message across are a tad rash.  I loved the book.  I feel it was written to shake things up and juding by the reviews just on this page it has done a very good job. <br />This one is a must read people   <br />I do have several problems with the book however<br />1. Did the author have to make ALL of the clergy in this book regardless of denomination totally clueless?  I mean what are these guys supposed to be idiots?  Weren't they just a little bit too stupid not to see the truth that was staring at them dead in the face?  <BR>2. The Author has to say again and again what a great guy Josh is like its some profound thing.  Well anyone who knows how Josh is supposed to be/represent already is aware of most of the facts that the author is trying to present so why keep repeating yourself?  <BR>3. The Catholic Bashing:  I am not a Catholic, but if I were I would be greatly offended at the pretrial of every clergymen in this book as narrow minded, theologically blind, calculating and superficial(expect for one or two).  I know there are supposed to be bad guys in every book but did they all have to lumped into one category?	2003-10-03

This book doesn't try to gloss the horrors of war over with honey or nationalism it real, its raw and it hits you like a sledge hammer.  If you like gritty realism I highly recommend that you pick yourself up a copy of the book.  At some points this book even manages to inject a little humor into a bad situation and for that I am thankful because otherwise I wouldn't have been able to read it, its still a great book.  <br />Just make sure you have a nice stiff drink handy you'll need it.	2003-09-26

Unlike other books of its type where magic either permiates everything(or never existed in the first place) majic has been lost here.  <br />A lone farmer gets together with 2 warriors and a travleing crarnival to find out what in the hell went wrong.  <br />My impression-This book was definatly above average but it suffers from the curse of most fantastical books a sappy ending.  <br />The set up is great and the charecters particularly Rable was wonderful but the end result leaves you feeling somewhat confussed.  Still I enjoyed the book to much for that to take away from my overall positive experience.  <br />If you can find tis either on Amazon or baring that a secound hand book store i would highly recommend it.	2003-09-24

When I first started this series(with \\"Gust Front\\") I thought it wasn't all it was cracked up to be.  <BR>I was wrong.  If you just allow John Ringo's style to grow on you I think you will find that the characters do develop and you can get quite attached to them.  In this book especially you can actually feel the hopelessness of the characters as the last pockets of humanity are overcome one by one.  I found this a nice contrast to the first two books where the characters bounced along with showing any emotion regardless of what was happening <br />I did feel a bit cheated that we the reader in effect missed the war.  I mean here we are chugging along in Hymn Before Battle getting ready for a knockdown dragout fight and when we open \\"Dance With the Devil\\" the war against the insane have to kill all the human super-horses has already been going on for some time.  I loved the book but this is what costs it the 5th star.  I would have liked to have seen humanity getting the stuffing knocked out of it.  <br />The series looks like it is going to continue and if that is the case I will continue reading it	2003-08-26

I feel that this series shows promise if the author could just stop shifting between action and narration in such a haphazard way this book could have been great.   <br />2. Does the author want to make Raj Altman a bad guy or a good guy?  He can never seem to make up his mind.  I personally like that about this character one minute he is doing something humane and decent the next he flies off the wall and slaughters an entire village.  It is an aspect of the character that makes no sense and I just want a little clarity.   <br />Overall-It was nice to see the main character learning to use his new abilites both to help his people and force Raj Aktman to unite agienste a common foe.

Thank God they provided a dictionary at the end of the book or I would have been totally lost.  <br />Third Part-Really Really odd-I mean this is the weirdest part of the book you have to read it know what I mean everything was wrapped up too fast.  It seemed sort of<BR> anti-chlimatic.  <br />Parts of this book are great, you have the SHIVA parents that want what is best for there kids fighting the good fight against overwhelming odds.  But somewhere along the line something just falls apart and you will find yourself skipping whole pages with no impact on the story.  <BR>Overall-This book is not bad, but big scientific words were used and it also feels like there a million different stories going on all at once.

In this installment you basically have Leia trying to come to grips with the fact that while her father became a killing machine he was still a child at one point.  This is also interesting because we get to meet pepole in this book that we last saw as kids 35 years ago.  <br />As for the book itself it is fairly action packed and has a good plot.  Realistically this book only gets 4 stars from me.  However there is one important addition to this book that has ben missing from star wars for almost 5 years.  <br />CHEWIE IS BACK!!  Thats right my favorite charecter is back for one shining moment and that alone makes up for any other problems I have with this book.  <br />Overall-Preety good book, very interesting revalations that open new possibilities for other books.	2003-05-04

We are never given an details about the main players.  <br />You expect something good (espically considering that these stories come from someone like Orson Scott Card.)<br />In the end the stories just don't deliver.  <BR>Bottom Line-Great setup, but the stories make no sense that is what kills &quot;Folk of the Fringe&quot;.	2003-04-30

The action is fast paced and the ending(although not wholly surpising) was well done.  I espically liked the ingenuity the &quot;Riverworlders&quot; displayed at every turn.  My favorite part was where they used the fat in the bodies of the dead to make parts for explosives.  This didn't hurt anyone because the next day they would be resurrected along another strech of river.	2003-04-29

He could not have been more wrong, he had been resurrected on a giant river with most of the rest of humanity. It's a whole new world, so he decides to go up to the source of the river and find out hw had restored them all to life. This was the guy after all who snuck into Meca and got out alive, why should a river 200 million miles long populated by every bad(or good) person in history prove to be any obstacle? <br />Overall-I think that the book is great, though I don't know if I could acuratly describe it as science fiction. The book is wonderful but it has a lot of extra information that takes away from the overall force of the story...	2003-04-13

I finally decided to see if I could find the first book in probably his most popular series.  <br />Mother Mastif didn't know what stopped her on the way to her shop and drew her to a slave auction.  Quite without meaning to she buys a boy named Flix who has some..rather interesting abilities.  Then things get really interesting as the book goes on.  <br />My impression what I love most about this series, (other then the action and humor that drip from every page) are the names of the charecters.  <br />With names like Mother Mastif <BR>Flix <BR>Pip <BR>My personal favorite an ex-solider named Makes Peace you know that you are in for a treat.  <br />I know that this sounds quiche but this not typical science fiction.  I don't give just any old science fiction a 5 star review it has to be really really good.  But to Quote Lavar Buurton &quot;Don't just take my word for it&quot;.  Go out and get yourself a copy of this book.	2003-04-13

I don't know about you but there are a few people that I would like to suck the wit out of and keep it for my own personal youth.  Think about it this would be a great form of capital punishment <br />The story itself <br />I have read a lot of books that one could cal stereotypical fantasy and this is one the better ones.  It does fall victim to one of the major pit falls of fantasy literature<br />A. It is always difficult for an author to gauge the proper mix of action and description<BR>If an author puts too much into the disruption you are left with a finely crafted world and no plot.  If there is too much action the scenes meld together making almost no sense.  <br />The problem with this book is a typical one.  The reader is waiting for the final confrination with the evil force in the story when it finally arrived I felt thrilled and cheated at the same time, it was over that quickly.  It is an aspect of this branch of literature that annoys the [heck] out of me.  <br />My impression-This is a greatly enjoyable book but the concept and the pace of the story is not for everybody.  If you like happy feel good fantasy this is not the book for you.	2003-04-12

But there is not way I can describe this book except this.  Think of a mirror and around Pg.  25 that mirror gets shattered into about 100 little bits and chunks.  There are plot lines that make no sense, Charecters that make sense and a final resolution(the end of the book) tha makes eve less sense.  <br />My Impression-If you have any respect for Joe Haldeman at all, aviod this one.	2003-03-27

In his outfit Code named THE DIRECTORIT he has stopped everything from political assassinations to arms deals.  He is forced into early retirement and begins a quite life as a college professor.  Then one day old friends from the intelligence community confront him and tell him a lot of crazy stuff.  Just for starters that he actually working for a communist government all along and his actions were undermining America, not helping it.  He sets out to find the truth <br />This information leads him to an ever deeper conspiracy with the unknown name of Promesous to identify it.  <br />My impression-Liked this one a heck of a lot better then I did The Cassandra Compact.  Good action good suspense  this is the type of book that you want to  be your last publication when you die.  The only thing I really didn't like was the need of Mr. Ludlum to spend pages building up characters and whenever action finally gets started Kill them off!  What is the point of the constant reunions in this book when you know that the charects you have just been reintroduced too will be dead in a short time?	2003-03-21

On the first leg of their journey they encounter forces from the Imperial Remnant old enimes who must be helped in order for the galaxy to survive.  Near animation of your way of life does indeed make for some strange bedfellows <br />My impression-I had never read anything by Sean Williams and Shane Dix before so I was a little apprehensive.  My fears were unfounded after a sluggish start.  <BR>I was particularly interested in the character development of  Nom Anor it was interesting to begin to watch him destroy the system that he had spent his life serving. <BR> Several characters seemed to have disappeared from the book althougher however.  Where are Winter and Akkbar and the rest of the military brass?  I realize that they are not the point of this trilogy but I would still like to know so that some of the loose ends could be tied up.  Don't let this minor quibble discourage you however,  this is still a great book<br />The New Republic is dead<BR>Long live the Galactic Alliance	2003-03-21

I am beginning to wonder if the previous reviewer actually read the same book that I did?  <br />I found these stories to be amazingly good probably on my top three list of short stories.  <br />I liked them all but my favorite has got to be(get name of story) Where Davy Crocket hoping to refight the Battle of the Alamo learns that there is no profit in revenge.  <br />Also there is (get name of story) Where an actor pretending to  be Robin of the Hood helps Julies Vern to recover his Utopia from Al Capone.  <br />Now I realize that the two stories I've mentioned sound like a bad acid trip but you must keep in mind that all things are possible in Riverworld.  Saint mingles with Sinner, Viking could fight Monguls, Elvis could run for president if he wanted to and these are just a few of the possibilities.	2003-03-21

One of the soldiers had already survived and he has an intriguing story to tell the king.  <br />This book is an excellent representation of the Spartan Culture.  It does a wonderful job of weaving the characters together, some fictional some not.  It actually becomes a wonderful microchasum of the historical Greece of the time.  With parts that will have you both laughing and crying you will be glad that you brought this book.  <br />Overall-Probably the most original and hard hitting military fiction I have read in the last five years.

The Core will not simply not tolerate this insolence and send one of their crackerjack admirals to assess the situation and salvage what he can.  <br />My impression-Being from the region of the country that I am I have always been a sucker for books about lost causes.   I Found this book much easier to read then other books situated in this universe such as \\"In Death Ground\\".  The characters had more depth and the plot lines were more easily established.  You saw the loyalists not as bad guys, just people doing what they thought was right in a tough situation.  I particularly liked the character of Admiral Ian Trevayne sort of a reverse Admiral Nelson and apparently the only innerworlder that exhibits any kind of thing approaching common sense.	2003-03-13

Also I found the plot to resemble almost an Acid Trip with no liniear set pattern that I could figure out.  <br />When I brought this book I was under the impression that it would be a rousing adventure tale about heroes trapped in a VR universe.  Ok, i'm sure it is however I slugged by way through up to page 300 and nothing of any consequence had happened as yet.  Now I became a Tad Willams fan after reading his Merrory, Sorrow, Torn trilogy and while those book were just as long at least they kept you interested.  <br />Overall-I'm sure it would have been good had I stuck with it, however I just didn't have the time, so if you want a book you can really be interested in don't buy this book.	2003-03-06

When I fist read this book I had never heard of the Author Tony Horwitz and I have to say that I found him to be stunning, that is the narrative itself.  <br />The narration of this is composed of a series of trips that he took through the south in the middle 90s.  This book does a wonderful job of trying to explain the differences between the regions and the shared history that drove this country apart for a brief period in the 1860s.  <br />My Impression-This book is as deep as it is humorous. Mr. Horwitz meets some very interesting people in this book<br />Daughters of the Confederacy <BR>Klansmen <BR>Civil War Reinactors(both the puriest and non puriests, or FARBS  and Non-FARBS as they like to call themselves.    <BR>He also travels to the state of my current residence and meets some people from his region of the country that support the Confederate Flag( I.E, Northerners) I just found that odd.  <br />So if you are from the south and read this book you will have a new appreciation for just how strange we can seem to our brothers to the north.  <br />If you are from the north and read this book by the time you are finished you will have a new understanding (or a deepening bafflement) of the question that has been asked by northerners for years.  &quot;why do southerners show such devotion(in some cases almost a divination) to a nation that was defeated almost 140 years ago,&quot;  <br />Bottom Line <br />Mr. Horwitz does a good job of making sure that if you don't accept it you do at least UNDERSTAND the point this book is trying to make.  <br />This book is wonderful	2003-02-17

When I got it I thought it would deal with the Arthurian legends at least in part.  Instead I found that the book dealt with basically the same tale being told again and again.  This is of course accomplished by means of reincarnation so that in each story the names of the characters change but not their basic role in the plot. <br />My Impression-I liked the stories on an individual level but when woven together the effect is not as grand as just taking the characters and stories one at a time.  This book really peaked my interested and I will look into the others.  If you like a good adventure story I suggest you do the same.	2003-02-01

This book is very descriptive but at the same time it can also be very boring.  This is not the stories fault no, not by any means the story itself is in depth and descriptive.  I loved the story when I finally found the time to finish it.  <br />My main complant is about the main character \\"Lerris\\" I found him to be an annoying dork.  This again is not his fault I probably would be as boring as Lerris had I grown up in a land as self righteous as Recluce.  <br />It seemed to me like whenever the story threatened to pick up speed or become interesting such as the conflict between the White wizards and the Grey Wizards Lerris would start whining about how bored he was with everything.  We have to endure 300 pages of him listening impatiently to his teachers.  I mean if he can do it better then everyone else why doesn't he shut up and movie the story along.  <br />My Impression-The story is good and other books in this serise are indeed excellent(I started I reverse order) but if I have to deal with \\"Lerris\\" for another book I think I will skip \\"towers at sunset\\".  The Villians were fleshed out and all charecter were taken as far as they could go.  It was refeshing to see a practical approach to magic	2003-01-08

By the time you are interested in the story it is over.  Most of these stories are actually very good<br />Lay your head on my Pilose-Just a creepy story, full of murder and subtlty I wish this one had been longer<br />Diesel Dream-This is one my two favorite stories it tells the tale of a trucker on his way to fullfill one of his runs (at least on the surface).<br />Leathel Prespective-My other favorite story tells the story of monsters and their invisible war against human kind, it is very short but very good.<br />Fitting Time-A dearly departed friend of Elvis asks a tabloid editor to stop running stories about the rock star, it was O.K<br />We Three Kings-Monsters of legend learn the true meaning of Christmas, very funny<br />Empowered-Also very good ask the fundimental question \\"What if the Lawyers got the better of the Super Hero's<br />Sideshow-I had never read any of the Pip and Flinx adventures before I will have to now, this is really interesting<br />The only story I didn't like was \\"The Kiss\\" just a stupid and pointless story.  The other stories I haven't mentioned I didn't read because they didn't capture my interest.  Whoever most of the stories in this book were really good and I highly recommend	2003-01-08

While I particularly liked the description of his own childhood (the Jewish friend of his couldnt go to the country club and he always wondered why).  Other parts are very disjointed there are times while reading this book where I had trouble remembering if I reading about The Holocaust or Martian Luther or Karl Marx(both of whom have  a roll in the story.  <br />I think the main thing that defeated this book was the shear length of it( 616 pages).  A lot the matrial in the book is repetitive, simply put Carroll repeats himself a lot.  Also it doesnt seem that Carroll is saying much other then Its wrong to hate Jews simply because they are Jewish(Not that these are the wrong sentiments at all).  <br />Also it doesnt seem like a lot of this book is by Carroll own design in addition to the bible size amount of pages listed above there are an additional 88 pages of references.  I realize that this is work of history and history books have to have references but come on.  <br />I mean pasting together what other guys have thought into a workable sentence, interspersing it with quotes from various sources and calling it your own work is not A History its A review of history<br />Overall-Ok but there have been many better books on the same subject made by better authors	2002-12-27

The former unlike the later offers no great moral advice or social satire other then the Twain wit invibed in every one of his stories.  The reason that this book will be remembered is that Tom is a romantic.  Whereas Huck can look at a Sunday school class and only see the sceane in front of his eyes Tom sees a band of travlers ready for plunder by his pirate gang.  It is also extremly funny when these two views of the world clash, making this book fun for the entire family.	2002-12-23

I guess when you pick apart every syllable and say it means something profound then it does. As for a plot that means anything or charecters that make the slightest bit of sense well lets just forget that.<br />At best you have a harrowing tale about kids being trapped on an island losing their identify here the become a mycocausum for different types of society.

This book primarily follows the adventures of one Huckleverry Finn as he escapes his home, his father and reality on a raft floating down the Mississippi River.  On these journeys he is in the company of Jim, a house slave who at first appears to be an ignorent slave.  Then we find out that this guy has a wife and a family and that he also has his own personal demons to settle just like Huck.  Jim can sometimes be a bit steriotypical but even that serves its purpose in the end.  In the process they discover things about each other, Jim discovers that not all white people are bad, Huck discoverers that Black people aren't stupid and savage as has been taught to him since birth.  This book is a perfect example of society(and Twain in particular) triyng to come to terms with himself in the latter half of the 19th century.  All this is done in the vernacular and with great humor.  It is a great book<br />Now, this book has taken a lot of heat over the last few years for a few words that some people have deemed offensive.  Well yes I agree that the word is very offensive when taken in a negative contex, however that is not what Twain wanted to exhibit.  Do not draw the conclusion that since the word is in the book that automatically makes Twain a racist.  If you do your research you will see that Twain was probably the most non-racist person of his era.  He only included the word because he wanted hwat people would have said to be as accurate as possible.  This book should not be taken off of selves just because that one word of because of the way a certain character is portrayed<br />Overall-Great book, the only thing I never liked was the last chapter, I mean what the heck?  The book gave back all the ground it strove to make through out the course of the story.  Sort of ends on a low note.	2002-12-18

Its not the books fault I found the book itself to be quite good the audio vrsion is awful.  <br />I know its my own fault for not reading it and maybe someday I will but the narrator just bored me to death(which is odd because normally George Guidall does a very good job).  <br />My impression-From what I heard(that is listened to on audio) the charecters are there preety much as an afterthought. I couldn't keep Eraumus or any of the others striaght in my head and I wasn'tabut to write little notes to myself to remember how the charecters were.  <br />So..

Well they burned them at the stake but its basically the same thing.  <br />Into this maelstrom steps William Shakespeare and he really doesn't care one way or another he just wants to keep his head on his shoulders and write plays.  But he is faced with a difficult task how can he inspire his countrymen to revolt and still keep his head?  <br />I really liked this book a lot better then most of the stuff Doctor Turteldove has come out with in a long while.  It is intense and full of intrigue and revenge(plus Shakespeare).  Harry also has a few good rebellions scenes thrown in to keep the simple guys(namely me) interested.  There is also an almost total lack of something that has become all to common in Turtledove's work VIRTUALLY NO STUPID SEX SCEANS.  Not that I mind sex in books its just sometimes with this author adds on sex scenes whenever there is a lull in the plot.  Lulls in the plot don't happen in this book it never lets up so this is not an issue.	2002-12-16

Yes there are historical inaccuracies in the background, but there were historical inaccuracies in \\"Enemy At The Gates\\" too an otherwise perfectly good movie.  <br />As for the plot-Its basically the Hare(Zaitsev) setting up a sniper school with a fellow sniper with whom he precides to kick German(Nazi) butt.  <br />Only thing I didn't like about the book is that the last chapter seems to have no place in te story.  It would have been find had they just left it at the end of the sniper duel, but thats just my view <br />Overall-Good book all round	2002-12-10

This proves to be of little use to the New Republic at present, it is scattered and its people have lost almost all confidence in the leadership.  <br />With the help of the frail Admiral Akkbar the forces of the new republic prepare for a huge gambit this could be a reversal of fortune for the Republic.<br />My thoughts <br />I didn't like this one as much as I liked Rebel Dream or some of the others.  While the last 60 pages or so make up for a book otherwise lacking in a lot of action, all everyone seems to be able to do is TALK!! TALK TALK TALK!!  These people are supposed to be out there guarding the galaxy shouldn't they do something more then talk about how they WILL safeguard the galaxy?<br />Now in this case, with the elections for new senate members I can understand the necessity of doing this.  However if you don't like a lot of talking this book is not for you.  <br />Overall-I consider myself a simple man, give me a lot of stuff in a Star Wars book, then blow it up for me then I am happy.  The last 60 pages or so make up for a lot of this.  So in the end I decided to give this book 4 stars.  I can't wait for the next book, the whole series is starting to look very promising again.	2002-11-23

This book is divided into two parts(I think) <br />These being the Romance part and the historical action part <br />Part B was the part I liked it really got into the complex politics of the region(Italy of the 15th century).  This includes rather confusing political marriages and city politics.   The shear decadence of the Borga family was amazing and this book does a very good job of covering all of that.  There are also some really good battle sceans to keep the reader interested <br />Part A in a word \\"sucks\\" yes I know that the \\"Union\\" between Cathera and Luchrathia actually happened but why can't we just say something like \\"And so they had sex\\"?   No that would be too easy, instead they have to go into gory detail.  <br />Overall-I love Puzo but at times this one reads more like Ann Rice or some cheesy romance novel then Puzo.  Also past reviewers are correct, this book has an air of not being finished, like they had to rush this for to the publisher or something.	2002-11-23

However Mike Moore does do a lot in this book that makes you think and in some places the book is quite funny(particularly his comments on the election of 2000).<br />I really liked this book a lot but there were a few things that really annoyed me <br />1. Moore's constant reference to Al Gore as \\"president in exile\\".

This isn't just a story of 9 guys being chased through the woods for 400 pages, it is about their myths, culture history and way of life.  Now some have criticized the language and I can see where that would throw some people off, however if you just let it flow over you it can really get insense.  Now personally I myself feel a little annoyed with the characters seemingly endless urge to compose songs and poems, but I can see how this adds a lot to the story<br />Overall-This book is incredible and you need to read it become you see the movie, otherwise you will be absolutely clueless.	2002-10-30

Smith and his buddies must stop an international conspiracy before it kills a significant part of the population(I read this somewhere before didn't I?).  The only reason this book is getting 3 stars is because of Peter Hoyle the British spy it was his activities in this book that, in my opinion pervented this from being a really bad book.  It is still not up to snuf with the stuff that Ludlam was putting out when he was alive but it is not horribly awful.  <br />To sum it all up: The delivery system is different some of the names and faces have changed but if you didn't like the Hades Factor your not going to like this one.	2002-10-30

You get to hear what the charecters are acrually thinking.  In the movie you had to guess by what they said(they always did a very good job).  The secound thing that I really like about the book is that eventually Kay excepts that she is never going to change her husband Mike and ceases to moan and complian.  <br />Conclusion-If you liked the movie, you will love the book.	2002-10-19

I know i'm being a jerk when comparing these two however at least with the &quot;Honor&quot; books you had characters that you could become attached too, not just paper thin constructs that are put in to add dialog between the space battles.  The characters come and go so fast that you can never get attached to them.  Also there are many terms and new weapons which while they are explained fairly well they are explained only once.  I have a tendency to forget the differences between a HAWK, SBHAWK, ARHAWK and SSBHAWK.  I would just like my memory refreshed from time to time is that too much to ask? <br />Overall-3 and 1/2 stars	2002-10-16

I also liked the fact that there was some charecter development in this installment.  My favorite new addition has got to be that of a Glossary at the back of the book, this way if you are confused about a particular term you can go back and look it up.  This solves my biggest problem with the first book	2002-10-16

The plot is excellent and it will keep you guessing until the very end.  <BR>There is only one part I didn't like, in some books and movies whenever there is a flat part the dialog something happens that is unique to that book or movie.  This means that in such an instance Arnold Swartenager kills someone or a Christian in the Left Behind series would pray.  <br />In this book when there is a flat line the dialogue Jonathan Smith pines and moans over his wife to be.  I am not saying this isn't nessacary but after the 5th time you just want to yell &quot;SHUT UP AND GET ON WITH THE STORY MAN&quot;!<br />Overall-Very good I particularly like the character of Marty Zelerback and hope to read the next book in this series.	2002-09-27

But as the first settlers arrive they realize that getting to ringworld was just the beginning.  This is one of my most favorite books in science fiction.  Mr.  Nivian has created a wonderful premise here and it continues in other books of the serise.  If you enjoy a good story I suggest you read this.	2002-09-23

Into this mess flies Hawk Hunter, always resiliant in his F-16 he flies though a post apocalyptic.  <br />There is, of course one problem Hawk Hunter does all of this HIMSELF!!  He dopes though the world and of all enemies he runs across with the help of allies he just happens to run into.  <br />The Deathlands has a group of 9.  Ben Raines and his rebels have an entire army, Hawk does it all himself, it is at times pointless. <br />Overall-Read only if you really REALLY like Hawk Hunter.	2002-09-23

Charles, the hero is a fine addition to the world of Science Ficton and as the serise goes on we get to see him mature and grow.  You get to see Dougles finally come into his own as the leader of this tight nite little family.  <br />I did not, however like ths book as much as I did the first in the serise entitled &quot;Jummping off the Planet&quot;, it just seemed a bit rushed in places.  <br />I realize this book is for young adults however I feel that the charecter of &quot;Stinky&quot;(Bobby) was added almost as an afterthought.  He contributes nothing the dialong or the story line in fact hisonly actions thought the whole novel are to moan and complain and suffer brief periods of bladder control problems.  We already know that from Mr Gerrold's portrayal of Howard that he doesn't like members of the legal profession.  Maybe he is also trying to tell us that he doesn't like small children either.  <br />I will read the 3rd and final book to see if Bobby matures a all.   <br />This is a wonderful book don't get me wrong.	2002-09-22

Only there is one little problem that someone at the diplomatic crops forgot to mention these people hate women almost as much as the Talaban.  <br />Now I know you want to see how honor gets herself out of this don't you?

This 2nd part deals with exactly what the English did after they had overthrown their alien captives. I think the secound part is worthless and Weber should have saved it for the sequel when he would have had time to elbatorate.

I personally do not think that another Kennedy would get elected in this day of conspiracy theories and suchlike.  <br />As books go it's main fault is that it over reaches, trying to be too many things all at the same time.  <br />It's main story line centers around a potentially deadly series of assignation attempts that include various world figures. <br />There are also 3 sub plots that are pulled off with varying degrees of successes.  <br />I'm not saying that this isn't a good read, its just that when all is said and done and the book is finished you have a very unsatisfied feeling in the pit of your stomach.  Don't forget that too much is going on all at once, things can get confussing.	2002-09-04

This is also true if you are writting a book.  <br />X-Wing #1 was fine although a bit slow it had to be to introduce us to characters we will get to know later.  <br />X-Wing #2 is much more fast paced and will be that kind of book that you want read in one sitting.  <BR>I admit it does however geta little trying at times, Couresant is supposed to be the Empire's back yeard yet it seems at every turn we meet some new alien who is prepared to give aid to our Rouge Squadron friends.  <br />Even if you hate this book its compleation is vital to understanding the rest of the serise so even if you hate this book and couldn't bring yourself to finish it get it at the library or something.	2002-09-02

This book tells of a new war between the USA and the CSA, taking place in the 1880s. Warfare has changed a lot in twenty years, and the military leaders of both sides must come to bloody terms with Gatling guns, fast-firing artillery, and trench warfare. The viewpoint characters are amusing and interesting portrayals of real people. Sam Clemens (Mark Twain), for example, is working as an editor in San Francisco, while the aging Abraham Lincoln wanders the country spreading Marxist ideology. Such individuals give the book a great sense of period.  There is also Fredrick Douglas and numorous other cameos by other famous people of this period <br />Overall-While it may not be th ebest of Harry's books it does provide good background for the rest of the \\"World War\\" serise	2002-08-15

On Basilisk Station is the first book in the Honor Harrington series. Honour is a commander in the Manticoran Navy. The kingdom of Manticore is under threat from the People's republic of Haven (the peeps) and Honor finds herself on the front line. As captain of a light cruiser (Fearless) she is sent to Basilisk Station as punishment for embarassing an admiral, (She blew said admiral's ship away in a wargame scenario) and finds herself in conflict with a disillusioned crew and an old enemy from her past. Honor struggles agianst her crew's dislike and tries to perform her duties but then she discovers a plot to annexe the system she has been set to guard. <br />Now at times this serise get a little too bogged down in formality and a whole lot of Mantorian Navy red tape.

A lot of books have bashed Pope Pius XII for not taking a harder line agienst both Hitler and his little buddy El Duche. To stand there and constanly attack the man, probably the most popular Pope of the 20th century with the exception of the 2 John Pauls, is totally without merit. To attack a man for what he DIDN'T do is not history. In my opinion such a tactic lies somewhere between aggitation and slander. <br />Now sit back and ask yourselves what could the Pope have done? <br />A. Openly help to smuggle out jews and others thereby putting himself and the whole population of Rome in danger <br />B. Arm the Vatican guard? maybe somehow overthrow the German puppet goverment? <br />Or what he really did <br />C. Niether help nor hinder but be willing to look the other way if a priest or a friar took some independent action <br />If you want to see another item that deals with this problem check out the Gregory Peck film \\"The Scarlet and Black\\"<br />You did a wonderful job Mr. Rychlak	2002-07-31

The killing off of minor charecters for no good reason <BR>B.  Whenever you have a charecter you love to hate he is the one who ends up winning(General Custer, Jake Featherington) <BR>C.  That you are constantly told(again) useless information about the characters you memorized 2 books ago.  <BR>D.  The Stupd Sex sceans!!!  They were wonderful when I was 14 but for Gods sake Harry grow up!!<br />Now in its defense let me say that the book is good for what it is, but you guys are asking me for my honest assesment.  <br />The thing that annoyes me the most is that none o fthe charecters does anything unexpected <br />Moss does his lawyering thing <BR>Ann Calton continues to be a turncoat who joins causes which will futher her own ends(God forbid she matures and comes up with an attack of conscience)<BR>And it goes on from there I really hope that Featherington takes the Rebel hordes over the border pretty quick, I'm about to give up on one of my fav writers.	2002-07-29

My favorite narrator is \\"Granny Younger\\" the old women that lives on top of Hurricane Mountain(and in her spare time battles Imps of the devil).  <br />The bottom line is that even though this story may be long you never lose interest in it.

Well ,maybe this inaccurate they are on a mission to save ONE world from the incrouchment of the Kitty Cats.  <br />My favorite charecter is Hunter(Ian St. John) and since this book deals largly with his(and his new found favorite beverage of chocie) I was not disappointed.  As in all other Wing Commander book this one also provides great space battles and wonderful charecter development.  <br />This is perfect for all you diehard fans out there.	2002-07-18

This includes all of Han's smuggler buddies and the Bounty Hunters.  <br />I only have one question, how exactly did Han manage to alienate all of these people?

Perry did a good job here but the book does not deserve: <br />games <BR>posters<BR>sound tracks and comic books.  <br />The villian Prince Xzar last of a battered poeple sometimes can be a bit overbearing and in the end I think he was disposed of 2 easily.  I mean if this guy is the head of a vast underground empire wouldn't you think he had better armerment then he did?  <br />The good part is that the book provides a nice leeway between the events of ESB and ROTJ.  <br />I don't know about you but I always found it hard to fasom that our heros hung out for the better part of year while waiting for their favorite smuggler to get out the block of Carbonite.

This book preaches self reliance, common sense government, a unified health care system and I almost forgot the Right to Bear arms.  The stories revolve primarily around the adventures of one Ben Raines who I have to admit kicks more [bottom] then Dirty Harry.  The series is primarily his own personal Eden The \\"Tristates\\"(a cool name).  I can agree with enough of what these books are saying(and the action scenes) to enjoy them.  If you want to read good pulp fiction go ahead and read these books.	2002-07-07

It is also in this &quot;Prelude&quot; to the epic as it were we meet characters never before seen in the other books (although we do meet their descendants in other books).  <br />Asimov was the last of his kind there will never be another to match imagination and sear attention to detail.

We are also introduced to J.B Dix, Kysty, Do , Hun and many others.

Scott is the sole suspect in the murder of a fellow (racist) prisoner.  The odds are stacked against him and the situation does not look good.  The story is told from the point of view of Tommy a navigator shot down over Libya.  Because he spent half a semester in law school he is appointed to serve as Scott's defense lawyer(he is woefully prepared).  <br />As you read this book you will discover that the plot will thicken into ways you could not possibly imagine on first picking it up.  There is plenty of action to keep you interested throughout the book there is even humor in some places and nice plot twist at the end you will not be expecting.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys World War 2 fiction.	2002-06-16

In this case I think the authors draw an interesting parelle.  Christian fanatisim can be just as deadly as the islamic kind(Read the book to see what I mean)	2002-06-06

But the more he considers the old man's story the more he is intriged.  It is a mystery that goes back to the time of Stalin's death and its implications are vast.<br />My Imprezsion-I liked the book but there are a few fatal flaws the most major of which is the fact that towards the end they wrap everything up to neatly.  The idea of Stalin having a son who could carry on his \\"leagecy\\" is crazy but spellbinding.	2002-06-06

The most annoying part was having to sit and listen to the FBI agents discover what Deker and his partners in crime had discover 20 pages ago.  You could also see the \\"plot twists\\" coming from 5 miles off.  <br />I am always a sucker for books dealing with a resergeance of the Nazi idology.

This one leaves a sour taste in your mouth, but at the same time is very good in its own right.  Mr.  Denning has done a very good job here of cramming a lot of material into one novel, this &quot;need for space&quot; is preety much semless.  However you may feel about this serise(New Jedi Order) you do not want to miss the last 20 pages.  <br />Overall=This book will back you feel happy and sad at the same time.	2002-06-06

I do however advise you to stay away from the &quot;prequels&quot; of the 90s that lack both the depth and scope of the original.  I would say more but I like this book so much I would use up my alloted space.  For now I will leave you to discover the mysteries of Arakias(also known as &quot;Dune&quot;) for yourself.	2002-06-04

Then after I was about halfway through the book I thought that I couldn't care less if Gaft and his minions were successful in turning Ender into a homicidal killing machine.  Then about halfway through the book I started to really appreciate the clear Machiavellian simplicity with which Card has crafted his universe.  So basically this book has 2 stories, one on the surface for kids 10-12 and another for older people.  It really works on all levels, but don't just take my word for it, go read \\"Ender's Game\\" for yourself.	2002-05-31

As long as you remember that it was first published back in the early 80s the movies were not done yet.  For example things might get a little steamy between Luke and Leia but thats alright because the author didn't know that they were brother and sister.  I also liked the idea of an imperial offical that actually CAN THINK.  I loved the movies but that little part of the story line where the underdog rebels always beat an over confident empire gets a little tireing.  We meet some new charecters in this book that are also well worth the money(because except for the normal charecters you would expect they never show up in a star wars book agian) some are quite memorable.	2002-05-28

It follows the lives of 3 brother, Saban, Lengar and Camabin. All three have various problems.  <br />Saban is a coward and both Camabin and Lengar(to varying degrees) are nuts. The story goes very well untill half way through the book. Then it seems to suffer from Steven King syndrom and rush the rest of the way through, so in the end what you get is a really lackluster book. However that does not take away from the good battles you can always count on Cornwell to give you.	2002-05-28

Upon my completion I was amazed, there was so much more they could have done to improve the STORYLINE these few things are-<br />1. Having Jon's father be outside of BA when the bugs blasted it, it was great to see father and son working as a team.<br />Now that I come to think about it that is about the only MAJOR thing they could have done and that point above is my main beef with the book itself.  As for the book itself it is (and I am running low on additives here) wonderful. This book is so much better then most of the other cookie cutter military Scifi out there today.  This book along with dune will provide an excellent edition to any hardcore sci-fi fan's library	2002-05-25

To escape these pressures and as a prelude to advancement on some other battlefield Starbucks is given a test a most difficult one.  He is required to turn a bunch of convicts into soldiers.   I have several problems with this book the first of which is that it has been so long between this book and any other new releases in the series.  Doesn't Mr. Cornwell have anything better to do then come out with trite books like \\"The Archer's Tale\\"?  These were wonderful books sir please get back to them.  My second complaint is Luthifer the new character it just seems a little too P.C to have another black guy with a gun rebeling agienst his southern overlords.  These points did not take away from a wonderful book however, and I hope Mr. Cornwell continues them.	2002-05-25

I am sure that it was very controversial back in 1961.  It is also interesting to note that what is happening today in the Christian church has its parallels in this book.  Doesn't it seem that some churches are just places where people show up to watch the football game?  I totally Grook this book and Valentine Michele Smith.	2002-05-25

This is, of course only after they run a huge guntlet of Ex-Hapian military vessles.  It is important to follow the serise in this instance because without prior knowledge you will not understand what is happening.  <br />In edition to being stimulating this book also raise a key point <br />1.  How do the Jedi expect to defeat the Yuuzhan Vong if they do not use what they know.  <br />2.  With that being said this new generation of Jedi has to redefine the force.  <br />3.  At this point it gets interesting because the line between light and dark becomes blury.  <br />Overal-Excellent serise of books I plan to continue	2002-05-24

I could never do that I read the entire X-wing serise and love them(although Mike didn't write the last 4 hehe no matter).  At this point in the serise the Yuuzhan Vong are still not understood for the most part.  A lot of this book reminds me of England in the early '30 and '40, ok so what if this Hitler guy is a threat maybe he is rational.  Well in this serise the Yuuzhan Vong are Hitler.  Crazy and apparently unstoppable these bad boys have been sweeping up planets right and left.  However Luke, Mara, Han, Liea and the others have a plan if they can somehow snach a minor victory and prove that the Yuuzhan Vong can be beaten then maybe all hope is not lost.	2002-05-24

The serise started with a bang and it ended with..this not a bang, not even a wimper.  What the final book does is take all the lose ends from the other books in the serise and tie them off in really stupid ways.  <br />For example <br />An evil sith lord killed by the happy good jedi <BR>An almost evil Kyp realizing his mistake halfway through the book and comsequently being FORGIVEN for all the horrable ...[stuff] he inflicted on people.  <BR>We also see Moth Duel the evil smuggler of the first book reduced to a sniving whiner held up in a palace complex.

Let me just say that the fist 100 pages dealing with Roland, Jake, Eddie and Blane are excellent after that the book hit the dirt--hard.  It is important to learn about Roland's past but did they have to it in such a boring manner?  I can't see how he feel in love with the women myself though she was beautiful and all that.  The book redemmed itself at the end when Roland, Alan and Cuthburt went on the warpath.  I can't wait to see how King wraps these books up.<br />If you are just starting out with this serise start with the first in line(#1) and work your way up.	2002-05-21

(Get the book youu'll see)<br />R&R-Shows that us gimps can still kick butt.  <br />Re-upping-just a good story all around <br />Clash by Night-This story is great after reading it and looking at the bios I was amazed to discover that it was published in 1947.  For years one of my uncles used to tell me about the quality of stuff that they published in Mags like Astonding and Galaxy.  If this story is the rule and not the exception he was right.  <br />The only story I didn't like was the one by David Drake.  You know those things that you hate regardless of how good they are?  I can't stand Drake's writting style, no offense Mr. Drake.  <br />Even this does not take away from a wonderful set of stories.  This is a true find for any serious Scifi fan.	2002-05-13

In this book Kirk is an admiral and as usual has to solve an intergalactic conspricy with nothing(except the resources of an entire galaxy).  I remember reading this book and the reason  why I rmember it is because of the unique inovation of putting impluse engines on the (by then) old space shuttles.

You can smell the gunpowder(sort of).  <br />This provides you with an excellent snapshot of the post-civil war south.  You've got free slaves, ex-rebles, a crazy grave digger and an ex slave catcher.  <br />The story is extremly solid but it does tend to go into the descriptive narative just a  little too much.  <br />You will like this book if you like an above par civil war novel.  In other words this book is not in the same leauge as &quot;North and South&quot;.  <br />The only reason I don't give 5 stars is because of the ending, I didn't get it.	2002-05-04

Now from a strictly theological standpoint it does have merit but that is not enough to save it.  It does not help spread the message of Jesus in any way, it only helps spread the Fire and Brimstone approach that is so prevalent in some areas of this country.  No one is going to read this book and be converted or filled with holy zeal.  Christians like myself will pat themselves on the back because they are going to heaven and the unchurched will laugh and call us \\"ignorant fudentalists\\".	2002-04-30

It provides a wonderful and beautiful and descripitve story that is fit for CHILDREN.<br />At my [local store]there were 16 year old kids reading this book. Teachers say that this book has been instrumental in getting kids to read but I ask you is this the best they could do?  I mean its wonderful that this books have been such a big success and that J.K Rowling brought her own castle.  I read this book to see what the entire fuse was about, this is not the greatest kids novel of all time. That honor still lies with either the Hardy Boys or The Boxcar Children.<br /> Harry Potter is NOT a conspiracy used by Satan to attract younger members to his cause.  Let me say again that these are Children's books for anyone on either side to get keyed up about them is laughable.	2002-04-30

The basic premise(Washington took the colonists grievances before the king) is alright but the whole time you are expecting action, which you don't get.  <BR>I am a big Turtledove fan but this one is just totally implausible.  Just as example there is the whole premise that Washington actually made George the 3rd understand the colonists problems.  Then he has a change of heart and offers them dominion status.  How is this possible?  George III was a self indulgent arrogant guy why would he suddenly have a change of heart? <BR>In some parts the book is solid but it always drops back into somebody complaining about how wild the town has recently gotten.  It goes solidly for the first 200 pages and then falls apart.  <BR>The little bit about Napoleon was pretty inventive I thought but they didn't carry that too far.<br />Overall-Buy if you are a SERIOUS fan, this should not be your introductory Turtledove book.	2002-04-10

One, the length too short the story gets started well is kinda hazy in the middle and picks up strong agian in the end.  The secound problem is that I am not quite sure what this book is.  Is it the life of a family in the 23rd cenutry?  A book of an impendeing asteriod impact?  How about a book of a new war of religions?  The end result is that you just don't know by the end.

The plot can be seen in the much better Warlord trilogy.  I don't know the book just seemed to lose something in the translation.  <br />Thomas's town is attacked he is (luckily) out of town at the time and is able to kill a few of the attackers with his bow.  He learns that the village priest(his dad) who he thought was just nuts was really a noble hiding from his crazy family.
