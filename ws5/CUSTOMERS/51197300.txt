However appealing visually, the downside is very dirty water, water everywhere. You can't get &quot;there&quot; from &quot;here&quot; without crossing the canals, and God forbid you should ever, ever fall in!<BR>The protagonists fall in the canals, suffer from seasickness, and root around in sub-basements never meant to be seen by the tourists.<br />The plot is secondary to the fun and the easy-to-digest art history that author Pears provides.  Gorgeous, volatile Flavia and diffident Jonathan (think Hugh Grant) team up to investigate the endangered members of the prestigious Titian Committee, who are being picked off one-by-one.  Their directive is to bring the investigation to a speedy, expedient closure that will make the various Italian bureaucracies look good.  Solving the crime is secondary.  As Flavia's marvelous superior General Bottando informs her when she triumphantly states she has found another body in France, &quot;But you're not meant to be finding more,&quot; he said grumpily, &quot;You're meant to be dealing with the more than adequate supply we have already.&quot;<br />It is hard to pigeonhole Pears' Art Mysteries as to type.  The satire is good humored, but nevertheless has a bite.  The protagonists are made far too uncomfortable and the action too graphic to be a &quot;cozy,&quot; and the lack of dedication to task make it impossible to label the stories &quot;hard boiled.&quot;  If you adore things Italian and have more than a passing interest in art history, I highly recommend this series.  <BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2003-09-10

All the off-limits basements, vaults and circuitous corridors are open for our inspection. (Think &quot;Relic&quot; by Preston/Childs).  A body of a young woman is found remarkably preserved in an ancient Egyptian sarcophagus.<br />&quot;The Bone Vault&quot; never finds a focus.  Rather than being entertained, the reader is distracted by meandering threads, dead-end sub-plots, and a dull cast of characters.  I found this one of the most put downable books of the year.  The suspects are so lack luster, I was indifferent as to which of them did the dirty deed.  <br />Heroine Alexandra Cooper, head of the Sex Crimes Department, is presented as fearless and energetic, but with &quot;issues.&quot;  She takes tremendous comfort in the dog-like loyalty of her loudmouth, red neck, graceless police department detective, Mike Chapman.  I was strongly reminded of Patricia Cornwell's loutish Marino, whose slavish devotion to Kay Scarpetta is unquestioning and limitless.  Strangely, I think Ms. Fairstein does have an inner core of toughness that Ms. Cornwell lacks, but both have a blind eye to how little these charmless behemoths add to the storyline.  <br />Though I think Ms. Fairstein did some excellent researching on her source material, the story just isn't there. Grade: 2.5 stars<br />-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2003-09-07

Grace is a maverick assistant director of one of the U.S. Government's alphabetical spook forces that investigates money laundering.<br />The novel opens explosively with a heart-stoppingly dangerous sting operation going terribly bad under Grace's direction.  To her horror, she discovers her husband of one year is on the bad guy's team. His cover was perfect.  It is inconceivable that this quirky, humorous, obsessed bird-lover could be a deep cover assassin.  Grace relentlessly sprints around the world chasing him down.  The villains pop up everywhere, and often the most deadly battles are between rival intelligence agencies.<br />The pace is fast and furious, but with surprisingly strong characterizations.  I kept hoping Grace would find out it was a terrible mistake about her husband's nefarious intentions.  Mr. Eddy had done such a good job of convincing the reader as well as Grace of Ben's lovable character; it was almost sickening to accept his deep betrayal.  Grace is not portrayed as Wonder Woman.  She is impulsive, somewhat paranoid (who could blame her for that?), headstrong and arrogant.  The ending is a bit of a cliffhanger that clearly is trying to whet your appetite for the next installment.<br />The story barely manages to keep all its threads intact.  There are so many competing agencies, players, and competing goals; it is easy to become confused.  I did idly wonder how a Brit could be an assistant director of a U.S. intelligence agency, but willingly granted the author artistic license.  In spite of these minor flaws, I highly recommend &quot;Flint's Law&quot; for non-stop entertainment.<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2003-07-18

(The director insisted he have &quot;real&quot; money in the pivotal scene for authenticity's sake).  Harry undergoes the labors of Hercules trying to get interviews and documentation.  Then both LAPD and the FBI warn him off.  Harry (no surprise) doggedly carries on.<br />Connelly gives the FBI the back of his hand as usual.  He succinctly shows the dangers of the absolute power of Homeland Security.  Best of all, Connelly's characterizations, particularly of a paraplegic former police officer shot on duty is so sharp and acute, it is painful to read. The reader shares Harry's reluctant empathy of the desolation of the man's daily life. <br />The complex plot is deft and always firmly under Connelly's control as he springs twists, turns, and surprises on us.  But the biggest surprise of all is the last one, and it strictly belongs to Harry.  His life is going in a new direction, and I can't wait to see what it is.<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2003-07-07

The lyrical descriptions of Michigan's Upper Peninsula are a joy to read.  However, the plot is contrived, convoluted and improbable.  The cast burgeons until there are so many people involved; I ended up being indifferent to the outcome.<br />Alex is in a black depression.  To get him out of the house, his good friend Jackie forces him to sit in on a poker game held at the opulent home of Winthrop Vargas.  Armed robbers appear and rob Vargas' very secret safe. Suspicion of an inside job spreads to the poker regulars who were the only outsiders who knew Vargas had a safe and kept money in it. Murder of one of the robbers follows.  Alex is galvanized into action to protect his friend Jackie.  A wild boat chase on Lake Superior unmasks the wrongdoers.<br />Alex's former partner Archie provides some welcome comic moments.  Alex enthusiastically chases so many red herrings, I lost faith. Many of the characters are stereotypical. I think Steve Hamilton needs to infuse Paradise with some new blood. <BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2003-07-07

Yet John Grisham pounds home his &quot;message&quot; with such forceful clarity, you would think he had just discovered Betsy Ross was a traitor.<br />Mysterious Max introduces Clay Carter, a youngish lawyer going nowhere, to the shadowy world of &quot;mass torts&quot;.  Mass torts are when a large group of consumers bring action against a corporation for a faulty product.  One lawyer may represent thousands of citizens.  The idea is to get the corporation to settle (without going to court).  The payout is in millions; the lawyer skims his enormous fee off the top and frequently the consumers get only a pittance in a successful action.<br />Clay's greed goes into overdrive and he is sucked into this new world of big money.  By the end of his first year at his new job he is worth ten million, proud owner of a Gulfstream V, a gorgeous girl to hang on his arm and spend his money, and a definite thirst for more. This is a precarious and pressure-filled universe just barely operating on the sunny side of the law.  One misstep is disastrous.  <br />Trouble is, the reader knows from the get go that Grisham is never in this world going to allow Clay to enjoy his misbegotten goodies.  So we spend the whole book waiting for the other shoe to drop--and drop it does.  Also given Mr. Grisham's former profession and his outlandish success at his present occupation, I think he is standing on a fairly fragile pulpit.  Nevertheless, Mr. Grisham, as always, is a master storyteller so it isn't a chore to follow Clay through his Pilgrim's Progress and back.  But be warned, this isn't a mystery or general fiction; it's an admonitory tale.<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2003-07-03

Six of the nine stories originally appeared in magazines and have never been collected before.

For further emphasis, the protagonist, former P.I. turned writer's name is--Nebraska.<br />As a favor to an old friend, Nebraska agrees to look for the missing daughter of the local banking scion.  When he heads out to interview the father, Nebraska finds him dead at the turn-in to the family farm.  Though Nebraska tries to keep his focus on the missing girl and out of the local police's way, he finds more and more reasons to think the two events are linked.  Though the family offers up some wonderfully satisfying suspects, city corruption and blackmail seem to widen the net.  <br />Mr. Reynolds is obviously a fan of the old hard core noir fellas and Nebraska is continually comparing his speech and responses to the likes of Marlowe, Spade, and Raymond Chandler.  It's a trifle overdone to the point that Nebraska is beyond self-deprecating and comes off as one self-conscious sleuth.  However, he lends a light touch to some fairly grim business.  The writing is deft, the puzzle is intricate, and the solution is satisfying.  I am surprised the Nebraska mysteries are all out-of-print.  He gives good value, and I intend to read more.  Fortunately, the series is available used, and I recommend the books to mystery lovers who like an author who has excellent abilities to describe a locale as well as a fast paced whodunit.<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2003-04-21

Heroine Kate Reddy, has cash in abundance. Right then, I knew I'd like the book.  I wasn't in for an exhausting drama of baby on hip, phone in ear, mop in hand, and brain numb with juggling finances. Good!<br />Kate is a very well compensated corporate hedge fund manager in The City (in the U.S., translate to Wall Street). Her job is 24/7, stress-filled, and calls for international travel.  She lives in an almost renovated townhouse with her darling almost-perfect husband and two children, baby Ben and kindergartner Emily.  Kate grew up poor with an irresponsible father. Husband Richard's background is achingly comfortable and stable.  That's the setup.  Kate, though awesomely energetic, witty, capable and yes--lovable-- can manage only if Everything Goes Perfectly.  One slip, and the entire structure collapses. She is sleep deprived, nervous, self-punishing and a shocking nag.  The burning question: Can she somehow do a perfect job and be a Perfect Mother and Wife? No, of course, not but contrary to what many reviewers complained about, Kate did not Sell Out when she did the big scam, quit her job and bought a house in the country. You just know the cottage industry she is trying to \\"help\\" with her ever-increasing guidance, will blossom into a hugely successful, Kate-run conglomerate.<br />Kate was inept with her household help.  Her cleaning lady has a back problem that does not allow her to bend or reach over her head; therefore, she can only clean (?) what is right in front of her.  And the Nanny Problem.  How can this be?  We Americans know the English invented nannies and train them so the parents only meet their sweet smelling, well-dressed offspring twice a day.  Not so at Kate's house. I wondered why it wasn't in the job description to have Nanny feed, bathe and pajama the children by the time Kate came home. Also, the English are famous for turning over theirtykes to a good boarding school at an ungodly early age and sustaining only a nodding acquaintance with said tykes thereafter.  Not Kate.  I believe she will strain to keep the children with her until they are both gray haired. It's enough to make you lose faith in the English Way of Life.<br />\\"IDKHSDI's\\" Kate is a vast improvement over Bridget Jones.  Kate doesn't meander through her life.  She has depth and a willingness to change.  She is interesting enough to make the pages fly and we, as readers dream up suggestions by the carload to improve her sense of well being.  Remember you can spend as much of Kate's money you want make things better!<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2003-04-13

Jeffery Deaver, the master of twist and turn, misdirection and illusion conjures up a magician villain who is--you guessed it--a master of twist and turn, misdirection and illusion.  It was overwhelming to this reader, like an overdose of my favorite Edi's espresso chip ice cream.  Trickery became the norm, and I ceased to be impressed.<br />A music student is murdered in a locked room, and the two responding policewomen plus the security guard hear voices in the room; yet when they break in, the room is empty.  A makeup artist is sawed in half in his locked building. The police were there in minutes, but the murderer had disappeared. (But wait! Who was that old lady leaving the building?).  Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs were called in on the case, and in spite of his best efforts, Lincoln was always a step behind the magician and his wondrous bag of tricks.  Young, ambitious wannabe illusionist, Kara, volunteers her services to Rhyme.  She recognizes and identifies many of the seemingly impossible happenings.  Is this a serial killer? A hired assassin? A man with a long simmering grudge? Rhyme and Sachs seem to be chasing random puffs of smoke.<br />Kara, the illusionist, is the best-developed character.  It is from her we learn some fascinating lore about the art and science of magic. The pace is Deaver deadly, and as always, he has all threads neatly in hand.  If this were the first Lincoln Rhyme novel I had read, I'd have been knocked out by Deaver's cleverness that I have since come to take for granted. But having read all the books, I found Lincoln (not the story) a bit predictable.<br />By the time I was nearing the end of the book, rather than frantically turning the pages, I was burned out and relieved to get off the mad merry go round.<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2003-04-13

Perhaps \\"A Fine Dark Line\\" is a bit too close to his prize-winning \\"Bottoms,\\" but nevertheless, this is prime Lansdale reading.<br />Stanley Mitchel, Jr. 13 resides in Dewton, Texas.  His daddy owns the Dew Drop Drive-In movie, and their home is kind of between the screen and the concession stand, which Stanley thinks is a very good thing.  The whole family, Mom (\\"Gal\\"), Daddy, and older sister Callie run the theatre.  It is the summer of 1958, and as Stanley says, more things happen in that summer than have happened in his entire life.  He finds a hidden trove of love letters that lead in him to a burned out plantation in the woods in back of the drive-in and discovers a young girl was burned to death in the fire. On the same night another young girl was murdered on the railroad tracks, decapitated and her head never found.  Rumored ghosts abound.  The remnants of the house and mill are eerily entwined with vines and saplings that have grown around and through them. Stanley decides to investigate the mystery, and gets a great deal more than he bargained for---corruption in high places, blackmail, and two psychotics: father of his best friend Richard and erstwhile boyfriend Bubba, huge and terrifying, of the family's housekeeper Rosy Mae.  <br />The characterizations are sublime.  High spirited, cheerleader-cute sister Callie is wonderfully drawn.  She knows she has great powers of attraction and uses them like an inexperienced marksman with an assault rifle.  Friend Richard wrenches your heart with his deprived and catastrophic home life.  The family employees, Buster, the projectionist, and Rosy Mae, crackle with life, earthiness, and vibrancy.  Daddy, in spite of his bad temper and propensity to fight, shines with goodness, and mother Gal is secretly in charge of everyone.<br />\\"A Fine Dark Line\\" is witty, terrifying and occasionally mischievous.  Sometimes credibility is stretched. Even in 1958, could there be one 13-year-old boy that still believed in Santa Claus? The amount of terror and mayhem that happened on one night couldn't have happened to most people in a lifetime.  But believe me, you will consider every last word right and true as you race through the pages.  A book not to be missed.<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2003-04-08

You have about ten minutes to ponder this experience; after that, you're dead.<br />Broker had hired on as a guide for three men who had won a statewide lottery giving them a license to hunt moose in the far north of Minnesota. All were competent, if not expert, outdoorsmen and enthusiastic to a fault.  Writer, Hal Somers had even delayed a hernia operation so as to not miss the hunt. The other two, a doctor and a lawyer, had left city life behind them.  Weather closed in them while they were maneuvering their canoes. The waters boiled up as they fought the blizzard that had descended upon them.  Broker's canoe capsized and Somers saved his life, getting him back aboard and paddling powerfully for shore.  Somers hernia ruptured during his efforts throwing him in a life-threatening situation on a bleak and isolated island in the wilds.  After an heroic effort on the part of the three men, Somers was airlifted by helicopter to the nearest small hospital through the raging blizzard.  His life was saved by his fellow hunter who was a surgeon.  The surgery was a success only to have Somers go into a coma while he was unattended in the recovery room.  Was it negligence or was there evil intent?<br />Chuck Logan is a masterful storyteller.  You're on the edge of your seat all the way from the storms inception to the recovery room scenes.  While never slowing the pace, Logan allows you to get to know the four men.  Even Somers, who is comatose, has his thoughts as he struggles for consciousness.  And it is only Somers who knows exactly what has happened--if only he could tell someone.  I like the way the author never wastes a word, yet is sensitive to his characters and the surrounding locale.<br />Get a cup of hot chocolate; wrap yourself in your favorite quilt to prepare for some fast moving entertainment!<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2003-04-08

I think Barbara Vine (Ruth Rendell) has surpassed herself in the creation of Ursula, the ignored wife and mother.<br />Gerald Candless, famous author, devoted and adored father, husband of Ursula dies of a heart attack at 71 in his home on the Devon coast.  His two daughters, to whom he has dedicated his life, are devastated.  Ursula feels nothing, but as both Gerald and her daughters have disregarded her since they were born, no one particularly notices. Elder daughter Sarah is commissioned to write a memoir of her celebrated father.  During her preliminary research, she finds that Gerald Candless reinvented himself at age 25, that the real Gerald Candless died when he was six years old.  This seems to be an impossibility given the extreme closeness among Gerald (who wasn't really Gerald) and his daughters.  Sarah is ambivalent about going forward with her research.  The daughters who are in their early 30's are just about as spoiled as you would expect them to be and shockingly indifferent to their mother.  Ursula is almost paralyzed by her apathy toward Gerald and unable to reach out to her daughters after being thoroughly rebuffed for so many years. This is the mystery that is to be solved. <br />Ms. Vine cleverly gives us more and more well-placed psychological clues that lead us toward Gerald's secret.  Each chapter heading is supposedly a quote from one of Gerald's books and they are engagingly witty---\\"The meek may inherit the earth, but they won't keep it long.\\" --- and serve as clues to the upcoming events. Great importance is placed upon \\"The Game\\" which Gerald and his daughters trot out to torment those not in their inner circle.  It is so stupid; the entire trio should have been smacked. Ursula wisely has never taken part. (Not that she was asked!)<br />The problem with \\"The Chimney Sweeper's Boy\\" is the setup is great, but the denouement doesn't live up to it.  Some readers might feel they have invested a great deal of their time and energy for very little.  I felt like getting there was half the fun and admired the way Ms. Vine breathes life into all these people.  Even the enigmatic Gerald is more to be pitied than scorned.  I would recommend reading Ms. Vine's \\"Dark Adapted Eye\\" first.

You may criticize that his characters are flat, and dialogue is sometimes lacking; but after you have read \\"A Case of Need,\\" you will be amazed how much Mr. Crichton has improved in his writerly abilities since 1969.<br />The daughter of a prominent doctor dies after having had a botched abortion.  A close friend of the protagonist, Dr. John Berry, pathologist, is accused.  To muddy the waters, the friend Dr. Lee does do abortions, which were illegal at the time, but is highly professional and is extremely unlikely to have done the deed.  Dr. Berry is complicit in that he has supplied Dr. Lee with fake pathology reports to cover the abortions.  Dr. Berry sets out to clear Lee to save both of them.<br />Dr. John Berry wins my 2003 prize as Most Unlikable Protagonist.  He is rude, arrogant, moody and humorless.  Oh, and did I say \\"arrogant\\"? His sleuthing method is to barge in on people, insult them, scream at them and wonder why they aren't inclined to cooperate with him.  The author patronizes the reader by explaining each medical term with an asterisk (*).  Not only does it slow down the story, half the time we already know the meaning and the other half it doesn't matter. The dialogue is so bad; it is painful.  Along with most beginning writers, there are far too many characters for the reader to sort out.  The accused Dr. Lee is presented in such an unfavorable way (he and the detestable Dr. Berry were made for each other), the reader doesn't much care if stays in jail or not. <br />I enjoy the Michael Crichton stories, from the \\"Andromeda Strain\\" to \\"Jurassic Park.\\"   He is a champion page-turner.

Author Secrest does a workmanlike job of peeling back the layers, but can't quite reach the inner core that made Rogers the composer-genius he was.  Rogers was urbane, witty, hypochondriacal, magnetizing, petty, alcoholic, competitive, gloomy, secretive, philandering and funny.  How do all of these traits combine to bring about some of the most beautiful songs of the 20th century?  Reading about Richard Rogers and then hearing -- say \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\" from \\"Carousel\\" makes you exclaim (like Oprah), \\"How'd he DO that?\\"<br />Richard Rogers was born to a moderately wealthy Jewish family in New York City. He was composing music for the stage by the time he was seventeen. He had his first Broadway hit by the time he was 24, and after he partnered with Lorenz Hart produced one hit after another.  In the meantime, he married the fragile beauty Dorothy, had two daughters and became increasingly wealthy. Sounds like a trip to the pinnacle, a stairway to the stars, doesn't it?  Well, not exactly.  Rogers and Hart broke up mainly because of Hart's alcoholism and mental fragility.  But Rogers got the rap for \\"deserting\\" him and banning him from the theatre.  This wasn't quite fair to Rogers, but it wasn't untrue either.  Rogers' storybook marriage was complex also.  Dorothy was a perfectionist and emotionally needy.  Rogers' response was a parade of infidelity.  And yet.  I believe Rogers loved her all his life as much as he was able to love anyone, and she fulfilled some deep-seated need in him.  As parents, they both were failures.  The daughters were marginally fonder of Richard who they considered distant and savagely critical. Dorothy was seen as a selfish tyrant.  The daughters' recollections are not kind. His last years were a combination of poor health, increasing alcoholism, and being out of touch with modern day musicals.  Yet honors were heaped upon him and the money kept pouring in. <br />Ms. Secrest did a mountain ofresearch, and it shows.  She not only had the full cooperation of his daughters; they commissioned her to do the work. The book is well notated and indexed, and has a bibliography.  She gives a fair and balanced accounting of a many-sided man.  There are not many lighthearted moments, but Richard Rogers was not a lighthearted man.<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2003-04-05

Ensconced in a valley in Kenya they named Happy Days during the '30s, they transformed what had been a laudable pioneering community less than 30 years before into a cesspool worthy of a Somerset Maugham play. Parties lasted for days, wife swapping was endemic, alcoholism and drugs were the norm and the motto was \\"Party On!\\"<br />The main surprise of Lord Erroll's murder, shot in the head while sitting in his car was that anyone cared enough, was passionate enough to carry out the dastardly deed.  Lord Erroll was involved with the former Diana Caldwell, Lady Broughton.  They had not been discreet, and it was an activity he had been perfecting for years.  You could safely say adultery was the rule, rather than an aberration.  Lord Broughton was arrested, tried and found not guilty.  The evidence was flimsy, Lord Broughton was a calm and credible witness, and there it ended.  The question was if Broughton wasn't the murderer, who was?  The first half of the book acquaints us with the players and the crime.  The second half is the sleuthing that the author and the late Cyril Connelly did to solve the crime thirty years after the fact.<br />The book is interesting and moves at a good pace.  I had to smile at the author's obvious enchantment with Lady Diana.  He finally met her when she was in her late sixties, and her charm was as potent as ever.  The story has \\"movie\\" written all over it, and a highly successful film was made in the early '80s.  My problem with the book is I never could mind much about either the suspects or the victim.  They were all equally unlikable, so solving the crime was not compelling.  Mr. Fox has done a good job of marshalling the facts and digging out the clues.  He has me convinced his conclusion is the right one.  If I only cared, I would be more enthused.<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2003-04-05

This is not your standard serial killer outing.<br />Ben Stack, legendary homicide detective and his assistant Rita Lopez are assigned a grisly case.  A man while bound has been torched in his own New York high-rise apartment.  The crime took place in the kitchen and apparent safeguards have been taken to keep the fire from spreading.  The victim was a bachelor with no apparent enemies and well fixed financially.  There are virtually no clues. Another almost identical killing takes place. The tension racks up not only for the police, but also for the fire department who fear that if these fires get out of control, it could be a catastrophe.  It is impossible to effectively fight a fire over the 10th story level.  The net widens to take in more suspects, but the killer seems invincible.  The climax is a nail-biter; their main suspect could also be the next victim on the list.<br />Mr. Lutz tells his story in a crafty manner with effective flashbacks, foreshadowing and glimpses into the killer's thought processes.  The characterizations are sharp, though Lt. Ben is a little wooden.  Assistant Rita never misses a trick to force her way into Ben's affections.  No retiring flower here!<br />Contrary to previous reviews, I believe the story is well told and in a convincing manner.  The information on high-rise fires is not only interesting, but also instructive.  There are bits of humor in the interactions of the various characters, slyly placed and well presented.  There are a few loose ends (how did the killer gain entry?), but they are minor.  \\"Night Watcher\\" is well worth your time.<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2003-03-24

It's been that way since the Civil War, and it isn't likely to change.  The townsfolk don't expect much, which is a very good thing, because they are not going to get it. Nominated for the Edgar First Novel prize, Stephen Clark's light ironic tone and fine writing make him a worthy candidate.<br />Nelson Ingram, a local boy of an old Litchfield family, has come home to work on the local paper.  His résumé is sketchy, full of holes and fits and starts, and truth be known, his motivation is lackluster.  When a local black man is apparently lynched, Ingram is fired up to take on the KKK.  Then he learns the victim was shot before he was strung up and the local KKK has been defunct for ten years after being bankrupted by civil suits.  No one seems particularly interested in solving the crime, but Ingram is fired up looking for the Big Story.  He gets further and further away from the Klan and closer and closer to possible Mob activity.  But why in the world would the Mob be interested in Litchfield?  Everyone is too poor to do drugs and they are not even on a big enough river to float a casino. Ingram cannot figure out if he is being confronted with apathy or conspiracy.<br />\\"Southern Latitudes\\" has a good pace, and Mr. Clark is deft, humorous and sometimes sardonic. Speaking of a total pork barrel construction of a waterway, \\"The whole thing finally opened up in 1985 to a great fanfare and all stood back and waited for the Silent Hand of the Market to transform it into a throbbing liquid highway of commerce.\\" When the hulking villain comes up behind him, Clark says he is \\"looming, like bad weather.\\"  I'm looking forward to further stories from Mr. Clark and recommend this fine debut novel. <BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2003-03-24

His beloved Dad who was stuck with a fatal heart attack at a Yankee game has directed him to defend a man on death row who is going to get a new trial on a technicality.  Dad was the District Attorney who prosecuted the case. Andy learns he has inherited 22 million mysterious dollars from his father, and has no idea where the money came from.  Also, he is growing apart from his perfectly nice wife who also happens to be the daughter of an all-powerful U.S. Senator who was his father's best friend.<br />The case against the alleged killer is interesting, but the evidence seems to be a slam-dunk for the prosecution.  The more Andy investigates the less certain it seems to be.  The courtroom scenes are stellar, quite a few notches above the average legal thriller.  However, Andy efforts to wrench the evidence around to show his father was untainted by the chicanery all around the case diffuses the tension. (But there is that 22 mill, isn't there)<br />Andy is a bit naïve about prosecutors safeguarding the rights of the accused. It shows him as a nicer guy even if you wonder where he went to law school.  He is a bit of Robert Parker's \\"Spencer\\" without being as confident or nearly so witty, and a lot of Harlan Coben's fellow-Jerseyite, sports loving Myron Bolitar but not nearly so lovable.  <BR>Edgar nominated (Best First Novel) \\"Open and Shut\\" has promise.

Rozan knows how to punch a story. From the time Bill Smith gets a plea for help from his estranged sister's son, to the last desolate scenes in a bleak New Jersey parking lot, Rozan totally engages the reader in a powerful narrative. The story is paced by clipped dialogue and driving action.<br />When nephew Gary disappears, Bill battles through his sister's total denial (\\"Gary is a good boy!\\") and his brother-in-law's sour hatred.  Bill tries to get a feel for Gary's problems and finds them in football-mad Warrenton, NJ.  The \\"jocks\\" are everything and apparently untouchable in the community.  The Bear-Bryant-On-Steroids coach reaffirms the all-for-football mania.  The whole school closes for a week while the seniors on the football team attends a super camp to better ready them for college tryouts. Nephew Gary is an up-and-coming Junior varsity player.  Bill finds that Gary had befriended a girl now dead after a wild and unchaperoned party at her home.  The party was crashed by the \\"jocks,\\" there may have been drugs and possibly murder.  The entire town seems bent on protecting the athletes--or at least wanting to wait until the camp is over.<BR>The body count rises and inevitable tragedy lies in the wings.<br />Ms. Rozan has strong feelings about the children who are made \\"outsiders\\" through no fault or wish of their own. She deftly draws what can happen when organized high school sports run amok.  But the result is too black and white; the story needs a little leavening gray areas. My big problem with the book is its lack of resolution. There is no ending as such.  After the sound and fury of the deeply felt narrative, I think the reader is entitled to a solid conclusion, which in this case just isn't there.<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2003-03-24

After being thoroughly delighted with Jane Stanton Hitchcock's latest novel, \\"Social Crimes,\\" I couldn't wait to read this earlier outing.  Before reading 20 pages of \\"The Witches' Hammer\\", I could hardly believe it was by the same author.  The plot was sheer comic strip, the characters were one-dimensional, and it had \\"movie\\" written all over it. (Though I find it hard to believe even Hollywood would think of taking on this potboiler.)<br />Totally repressed, gently bred, convent educated Beatrice O'Connell is confronted with the murder of her book collector father the day after he receives an ancient book of evil spells. She feels the police are apathetic and vows to find her father's murderer and is convinced the answer lies in the little book.  She descends to Spanish Harlem to meet with an occultist and meets a totally erotic, sensual man. She goes with him and realizes her inner \\"wolf\\" woman. She returns from the wild and steamy assignation a charged and changed woman.  She discovers an evil cabal within the Catholic Church who are willing to go to any lengths to recover the now lost book.  This group wants to return to the practices of the Spanish Inquisition, locate and burn witches, and completely repress women because they are inherently evil.  Her allies are her ex-husband and a strange frail little rare bookseller. The evil ones have a big spread in upper New York State that Beatrice infiltrates. The conspiracy is everywhere.  The action becomes increasingly bloody and violent when Beatrice is confronted on all sides by malevolence.  <br />I felt like Beatrice stepped into a phone booth and came out in her Superman suit to take on the forces of evil.   I could not make the leap of faith that Marion the Librarian is in reality a Wonder Woman/Superman.  Feminists would be better served by Pat Buchanan than \\"The Witches' Hammer\\" over-the-top silliness.  The only thing I learned from this book was the definition of \\"grimoire.\\" Read \\"Social Crimes\\" and give this one a pass.<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2003-03-17

Not only is \\"Savannah Blues\\" living breathing, Savannah, it's a given this story could happen nowhere else.<br />Our heroine, Weezie, wins the prize for most unusual occupation; she is a picker, a trade only known in the antique business.  She \\"finds\\" items from kitsch to Empire sideboards and sells them to antique dealers.  She hits the flea markets, yard and estate sales, and even does a little dumpster diving in the course of a business day.  Weezie is a bad-luck divorcee.  In the settlement she got the carriage house in the back yard and one-half of the closed garden while her ex got the lovingly restored (by Weezie) historic townhouse. To make her misery complete, the ex has installed the \\"other woman,\\" the beauteous Susan, in the townhouse and even gave her Weezie's slot in the garage for her jazzy sports car. <br />Weezie is illegally \\"previewing\\" an estate sale at a run down plantation in the dead of night, opens a closet and out falls the body of her rival Susan. Weezie is the prime suspect, and her friends rally round: Uncle James, an in-the-closet gay lawyer who was formerly a priest, best friend BeBe (pronounced Bay Bay); Daniel, master chef and incipient lover; and Merijoy, rich, social, dedicated Preservationist and jaw-droppingly efficient young mother.<br />Even the smallest characters are quirky and unexpected.  Weezie's highly proper mother starts her day with half-and-half (iced tea and Four Roses). Andrews' dialogue is dead-on Savannah-speak, and I kept thinking the characters from \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good & Evil\\" were going to join the fun at any moment.  Weezie has to be the most nonchalant murder suspect in the annals of crime.  She assumes (I presume) justice will prevail and goes about her business, obtaining an unusual antique cupboardand shooting herself in the foot in the romance department.  <br />This is a romp and a character study; so much so that long stretches go by when no one even thinks about the murder mystery.  Andrews pours on too much in the last quarter solving the murder and righting the wrongs to the point the reader is confused.  I felt like I had been called in from recess to study for the final.  All in all a delightful book.  Andrews and Savannah can take a well-deserved curtsy.  <BR>-sweetmolly-... Reviewer	2003-03-17

The author is the grandson of one of the sisters, which gave him unprecedented access to some never-before-published letters and journals. Lizzie, Irene, and Nora take a back seat to highly visible Nancy (Lady Astor, first woman to serve in Parliament) and Phyllis, the author's grandmother. The author weaves historical and political background around the sisters' stories, which gives the book a pleasurable informational heft and weight.<br />They started out poor, as most Virginians were after the calamity of the Civil War.  Eldest sister Lizzie was born in 1867, only two years after the war.  Father, Chillie Langhorne, hit it big about twenty years later by entering into business with some Yankee railroaders.  Then he was able to purchase the fabled Mirador, a perfect setting for his daughters.  Chillie and mother Nemoire could have been stand-ins for Scarlett O'Hara's father and mother.  Chillie was a hard-drinking charmer and a complete autocrat while Nemoire was almost saintly in her beauty and patience. They had eleven children, eight who lived, five girls and three boys.  Two of the boys died young of a combination of hard drinking and tuberculosis.  <br />Eldest Lizzie, who grew up poor and was already married living in genteel poverty in Richmond when Chillie hit it big, resented her sister's success all her life---but thought monetary gifts were her due.  Irene was a true phenom, a bona fide celebrity, the last true Southern Belle who took the entire East Coast by storm with her breathtaking beauty. She married Charles Dana Gibson and was the prototype of the Gibson Girl.  Irene may not have been the sharpest knife in the drawer, but she was kind (a rare trait among the Langhorne girls) and supportive all her life.  Volatile, incredible Nancy who married and divorced a Boston millionaire, then married one of the richest men in the world, Waldorf Astor, almost single-handedly tore her family apart with her extreme possessiveness of both her sisters and children.  Nancy looked like a beautiful, frail Edwardian lady with marvelously intense sapphire-colored eyes.  Looks deceive.  She was actually fiery, cruelly witty, and indomnible.  Phyllis followed Nancy's footsteps marrying and divorcing an East Coast millionaire and remarrying famed British economist Robert Brand.  Phyllis was soulful, the best woman rider in the country, and was a born martyr.  My favorite was baby sister Nora, scatter-brained, scandalous, with a complete disregard for the truth fell in and out of love all her life.  Men could not resist her.  Nora's sisters had to bail her out over and over again, while Nora sincerely said she had made a \\"fresh start\\" every time.  But Nora was a loving, generous person and a wonderful caring mother (her daughter was the actress Joyce Grenfell), and her nieces and nephews adored her.<br />\\"Five Sisters\\" is a fascinating read, well researched with an excellent index and bibliography.  I recommend it highly.<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon reviewer	2003-03-17

They have a certain intensity (I'm convinced that most were ADD children), they rarely can sit still, unless it's their opening lead; then there is an eternity while they sit stone-faced and contemplate.  The bridge pro has concentration that cannot be broken by topless girls dancing on his table, yet can scream with fury at someone cracking their gum. Yes, they are different. And how do they get that way?<br />Alan Sontag is your genial, if hyper, guide who takes you through a small story of what it takes.  Alan is one of this generation's great pros, having won national and international titles with some of the best players in the world, and has put in his time as a playing pro with his students who you might think learned the game yesterday.<br />He has a good history, and some great stories to tell you.  A few I strongly suspect are apocryphal like the famous match in Jamaica (see for yourself!).  He also describes what it is like to \\"get in the zone\\" with an expert partner and know what it feels like, that particular time and that particular day to be the best in the world.<br />Obviously, \\"The Bridge Bum\\" will be fascinating to all who have ever attended that madness called a bridge tournament, but I think Alan's light hearted prose will appeal to the general reader and others whose interest is piqued by the unusual profession and what a special set it qualities it takes to be successful.

I thought about it again recently and wondered if I would have the same enthusiasm 35 years later.<br />A short answer is \\"yes!\\"  Mrs. Rodgers built a country house to her specifications in 1965. \\"The House in My Head\\" is an informal diary of her thoughts and the construction of this \\"perfect house.\\" The author recounts her lists, her \\"must-haves,\\" and the triumphs and failures of that tumultuous year.<br />The reader must keep in mind that Mrs. Rodgers (wife of composer Richard) had some very specific needs that might not include everyone.  She was accustomed to lavish entertaining and frequent houseguests.  Is it \\"dated\\"?  Yes and no. Her taste in furnishings is classic so the decoration is never faddish.  However, a few things look a little stodgy, and I doubt if she were building today, she would put so much emphasis on a swimming pool.  Perhaps they were more of a novelty in the Northeast then.  Her floor plan is model of well-planned use, and she has many tips that are invaluable.  It is daunting to learn that a perfectionist such as Dorothy Rogers could run into foul ups and disasters just like the average human when building her own home.<br />An excellent addition to any library and a must for those interested in the history of interior design.<br />-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2003-03-11

It was published in 1978, and I was curious as to how much change had occurred in the suburbs in the last 25 years.  The second reason was the author.  I had read \\"Our Crowd\\" and \\"Real Lace\\" that studied respectively the Jewish and Irish upper class, and thought both books were interesting, lively and well researched.<br />\\"The Golden Dream\\" is best described as superficial.  It takes a swing through the United States usually touching on one aspect or family of the suburb mentioned (all of them very high dollar).  It reads like a loosely collected series of magazine articles long on anecdotes and short on depth.  River Oaks (Houston) is a send up on the vulgarity of the natives. Scottsdale (Phoenix) is well-scrubbed Barry Goldwater country and Salt Lake City is Mormon Town.  I had the impression Mr. Birmingham had spent, at most, ten minutes west of the Mississippi River.  He does marginally better in the central states, but home is the Northeast. <br />If I were a resident of any of these communities, I would be upset at the narrow focus of attention and probably wonder if he had ever actually set foot in the town he was writing about.  However, \\"Golden Dream\\" is for the most part good-natured.  You don't learn anything new, but he has a few good anecdotes.

He can't resist keeping a fair portion of the action in his beloved Minnesota, but other than that, this is new territory for the author.<br />Bo Thorsen, a Secret Service agent, is assigned to the First Lady's detail when she makes an emergency visit to her injured father, former Minnesota Senator Tom Jorgensen.  Bo suspects the senator's accident may have been premeditated.  In the background are the U.S. President, his re-election campaign and his strained relations with the first lady.  When escaped mental patient and assassin, David Moses, is added to the mix, the widening implications of the accident, the first lady's safety, and the president's re-election seem to be joined.<br />By far the most fascinating character is assassin David Moses, brilliant, chilling and who has had an indescribable horror of childhood. David is the best drawn and consequently over-balances the book. \\"The Devil's Bed\\" begins with a riveting prologue, and begins with a compelling pace.  Events seem to tumble over one another.  The reader is given a good background on Bo, who has so much in common with David, but as a child was redeemed rather than permanently abandoned. About at the halfway point in the book, it starts to lose focus.  The scope is so broad: government, conspiracy, agencies, and politicians; the story starts to spin away in ever widening ripples.  To gather all his threads back together is almost a super-human task for Mr. Krueger, and I felt the ending a little flat.<br />I'm always glad to see an author stretching his abilities and not getting in a rut with a comfortable series.  Think \\"Devil's Bed\\" is a good departure, a good read, but perhaps too ambitious in scope.  Nevertheless, it is enjoyable, and I await Mr. Krueger's next book with pleasure.<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2003-03-11

Submarine squeezes, dummy reversals, double throw in end plays are very exciting stuff, but 1) they don't come up all that often and 2) you have to visualize all four hands before they work.<br />Goren starts you out on Chapter I with \\"The Bidding\\" just like you would at the table. Each chapter ends with a quiz.  Take them and then go back and reread the areas you missed. Until you feel very comfortable with all aspects of bidding, don't go any further.  You will never get to play that brilliant hand if you land in the wrong spot.  That's what bidding is all about, to get you to that perfect spot where you get a chance to shine and slay your opponents.<br />When I learned to play bridge as a teenager, Goren's Bridge Complete was my Bible.  It has gone through many revisions since, but looking over the latest, I see it still retains all its virtues.  I'm not denying this book will take a lot of time, and everything must be read more than once best with a paper and pencil close by, but you will be rewarded.

I am a fan of Nancy's skill, fun, and humor in all her books, and I wish I could say Nancy was just as funny, humorous and witty in person as she was in her books.  Well, she was all of that, along with selfish, egocentric, cruel and sometimes incredibly brave and devastatingly wistful.<br />Nancy was born into the minor aristocracy.  Her parents, Lord and Lady Redesdale were two smashingly handsome people; he of the towering rages and enthusiasms and she with such perfect detachment, one wondered if her feet touched the earth at all.  They had five daughters, all highly original and one son who was killed in WWII.  Nancy, the eldest was a best selling novelist; Pam was the loyal farm girl; Diana, the beauty, first married into the Guiness family then the infamous \\"Nazi\\" Sir Oswald Mosley; Unity, who fell in love with Hitler and Nazism and tried to kill herself; Jessica, who also was a writer, became Americanized (which horrified Nancy) and wrote the \\"American Way of Death\\"; and Deborah who became the Duchess of Devonshire.<br />With this background, it is not hard to see how Nancy developed into an unusual woman.  In some ways she had it all.  She was an embodiment of the Jazz Age, friend to some of the most interesting people of the 20th century (Evelyn Waugh, Winston Churchill, Charles deGaulle) and finally made enough money to support her very patrician tastes in clothes, homes and fine living.  Yet her marriage was a farce, and she had a life-long passion for an unsuitable man who was never going to marry her and most of the time ignored her.  With all her fame and all her friends, during her last illness she closed the door to everyone but her sisters who she had mostly ignored (with the exception of Diana) for years.  Nancy was a great one to shoot herself in the foot.  She longed to be loved, but her malicious humor and savage wit drove people away.  She was truly unhappy in her love life, but insisted on a gay, nonchalant face to the world and would allow no one close enough to comfort her.<br />This biography is lively, but does not contain much we didn't know before.  It does a good job evaluating Nancy's literary output.  The continuity is poor as the author skips back and forth in time enough to confuse the reader.  Nancy's great love was France, and she lived most of her adult life in Paris.  But the author's long quotations in French by Nancy and her friends are a little tiresome to the average reader. But all in all, an enjoyable read.  I think the reader who likes to read of the upper class in the early 20th century will take pleasure in this book.

His descriptive scenes of the Everglades, the darkness, dampness, infernal haze of insects and the never-ending heat pervade every page of the book. King's knowledge of Everglades and a good feel for the swamp rats as well as the glitzy city dwellers give him a toehold in the crowded field of mystery writers who pen guy-gets-away-from-it-all-in-Florida tales.<br />Max Freeman, a Philadelphia cop, killed an unarmed boy during a robbery attempt.  He was a lackluster cop before, and the killing undoes him psychologically.  He quits the force, lets his marriage go without a murmur and in quiet desperation decides to start over in Florida.  Fortunately, for him financially, he was badly injured in the robbery and received a big settlement brilliantly invested by his lawyer friend Billy.  Max chooses a stilt house so far in the swamp; you have to reach it by canoe.  It has none of the amenities (heat, electricity, a/c, running water).  When we enter the scene, Max has been in his shack for over a year.<br />While canoeing home one evening, he spots a wrapped package that turns out to be a dead child.  He is suspected because of his background and finds this is the 4th child-murder that the body has been dumped in the Everglades.  A serial killer is at work, and Max must clear his name.  In the process, he has a \\"meet\\" with some native swamp rats that is the true highlight of the book.  <br />The trouble with Max is he is so humorless, dismal and depressed; we have a hard time empathizing with him.  He takes terrible physical punishment throughout, yet I was unmoved.  The plot is a bit contrived and the ending is a little flat.  Still, Mr. King's powerful imagery makes \\"The Blue Edge of Midnight\\" highly readable.  I think with a more experience, he will round out his protagonist's character.  I am looking forward to the next book.<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2003-03-07

The teacup may be small, but the battles rumble like thunder on the bay. Lucia is incredible.  She combines absolute self-absorption with ironclad charming resolve to succeed in her every endeavor. She really is wasted being queen of Society in a small English village when fulfilling the duties of Lord High Admiral would not cause her so much as a tiny frown.<br />Lucia is a newly minted widow in this hilarious outing.  Her fires have been banked, and she is anxious to get back in the swing and show her mettle.  She rents a house for the summer from the formidable Miss Elizabeth Mapp of Tilling.  Miss Mapp is clearly the leader of society in Tilling and revels in her role. Lucia eyes the situation, and the lines are drawn in the most charming but resolute way possible  Lucia is the richer of the two and possibly more clever, but Miss Mapp has some powerful advantages of her own.  She has pride of place, a town full of quaking allies, and indomnable perseverance. When these two square off, the fun begins and doesn't let up.<br />This is a delightful read, a mood lifter of the first magnitude.  \\"Mapp & Lucia\\" is my introduction to Lucia, and I cannot wait to further my acquaintance with this fascinating lady.<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2003-03-02

The claustrophobic narrative (you can't for a moment get away from Francie) creates pity, terror and exasperated laughter in the reader.<br />Francie, the only child of a mean-drunk father and a slovenly, barely sane mother keeps his sanity by his all-encompassing friendship with Joe Mullen.  He and Joe \\"mess around,\\" do all the boyish things and bond as blood brothers. But as Francie's oddities increase, Joe pulls away from him.  Francie shatters. From the very beginning, there is a tethered violence in Francie; as he descends into madness, his terrifying ferocity is unleashed.<br />Mr. McCabe plays with us readers very well by putting us in Francie's lightning-quick mind and never letting us out.  Francie is exhausting, humorous and the most Attention Deficient child you will ever meet. I felt a terrible sorrow for Francie, so much so I wanted to command events.  I wanted to say \\"Not. One.

I just about did figurative cartwheels over both of them; one for the solid debut and the other as a marvelous thriller. Warning: If you intend to read \\"Known Dead,\\" read it BEFORE you read \\"Deep Thaw.\\"  Unfortunately, the \\"Known Dead\\" story is only Part I.  Also, \\"Deep Thaw\\" contains many spoilers for \\"Known Dead.\\"<br />\\"Known Dead\\" starts briskly with a drug stakeout gone bad.  The \\"stakeout\\" is not on the mean streets, but in the forest where a patch of marijuana is being cultivated. Two cops are concealed and watching as a subject appears obviously to tend the \\"garden.\\"  Gunfire erupts from an unknown source and one of the officers and the subject are killed.  Deputy Sheriff Carl Houseman is in charge of an increasingly puzzling case.  There are small time drug dealers, motorcycle gangs, right wing zealots all seemingly involved and the FBI and DEA have much more than average interest in the case.  A shootout takes place at a barricaded farm where a news photographer and police officer are killed and the Nation County sheriff is badly injured.  The stakes are high, the cooperation between agencies is poor and Carl seems to be almost alone in really trying to solve the crime.<br />\\"Known Dead\\" did not hold my interest like Mr. Harstad's other works.  There were too many law enforcement agencies involved. (FBI, DEA, Iowa Crime Agency, and the county sheriff's department).  All these competing groups made the story too diffuse and the plot did not hold together. We never were quite clear what the connecting links were.  I'm well aware that a good bit of police and military work is \\"hurry up and wait.\\" But \\"Known Dead\\" had far too much waiting for the pace of any mystery.  Also, it is open ended (the conclusion is in \\"Deep Thaw\\").  I felt decidedly gypped when I read the last page.  \\"Known Dead\\" was a disappointment from an author who can do so much better.<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2003-03-02

Neighbor Bobby Lowe was an eye-to-eye witness. Hit man Harry Aleman had left his car to check on the victim when Bobby's dog leapt in front of him.  For a few seconds, the two men stared at one another, Bobby in shock, and then Harry broke the spell and returned to his car, which then sped away. And Bobby's life changed forever.<br />Though Bobby told the police he had been an eye witness (much to his family's dismay) and had identified Harry's picture in a mug book, nothing happened.  It was buried.  Harry Aleman was well connected with the local mob and a nephew to one of its kingpins.  Authorities estimated Harry had killed over 20 people.  Four years later the case was reopened, and this is when Bobby's personal hell began. Before the trial (estimated to be a slam dunk), Bobby, his wife and three children were placed in one seedy motel after another.  They had to give up their jobs, the children changed schools on a weekly basis, and they lived off fast food.  The trial was a farce, Aleman was found not guilty and the Lowes entered the Witness Protection Program without adequate identification to secure a decent job. Bobby spiraled down and lost his job, his family and self-respect.  Finally, he got his life back together, discarded his false identity, and regained his family. In 1997, the case was reopened again, 25 years after the crime. Bobby had no choice but to testify again.<br />Possley and Kogan do a masterful job in presenting this complex case without wasting a word.  Bobby's character is done so well, you feel like you have known him all your life.  The research and documentation are meticulous.  The only mystery that remains is Harry.  He was an excellent husband and adoring father that just happened to be a cold-blooded killer. I would buy another book explaining to me what made Harry tick.<br />Sadly, the message I received was to never, ever admit to being a witness to a mob killing.  The Witness Protection program, which is devastating and mind shattering even if it worked perfectly, was a farce for the Lowe family.  \\"Everybody Pays\\" is true crime and investigative journalism at its finest.<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2003-02-22

Sister	Sister (Dorothy) Parrish was \\"gently\\" born, and she played this card like a violin all her life to great success. Expensively, but scantily educated Sister had an \\"eye\\" for proportion and taste that never failed her. Her decorating services became astronomically expensive, yet she had a Grande Dame persona that made her clients feel she was doing them a great favor by decorating their homes.<br />\\"Sister\\" is authored (perhaps edited) by her daughter and granddaughter very respectfully indeed. It contains little essays and remarks by friends and colleagues, plus sections by Sister herself from her autobiography that never was completed. Her daughters were clearly terrified by her, though her granddaughter seems to be a little bit of a chip off the old block. An oddity I noticed in the pictures: movie-star-handsome men run in her family while the women are plain as peahens.  Sister speaks of growing into beauty, but I would have to respectfully disagree.  Imposing, and dramatic--yes; but \\"beautiful\\"--no.  All mention her wonderful sense of humor, which struck me as cruel and belittling along with a razor sharp tongue. The pictures of her projects (sadly, most in black and white) show her capabilities in making a fabulous mansion into a home rather than a museum.  However, in spite of Sister's declamations that the client's wishes were first and foremost, most of her actions show that you go her way or the highway.  Her Pekinese dogs always were with her and each seemed to have a talent for vicious nipping.<br />\\"Sister\\" is fascinating and does a good job (mostly Sister herself) describing her artistic techniques.  The family history is well done.  But there is a slightly patched together quality of the book that makes this reader feel the events are only half-told and some not told at all.  I don't mean I expected or remotely wanted a \\"Sister Dearest.\\"  I admire the tact and respect displayed by Ms. Parrish's heirs. I just wish a few of the reminiscences were by folkswho had less than 100% adoration for Sister!<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2003-02-22

The author's 26 years of law enforcement experience are pivotal in making his stories so authentic sounding, it feels like true crime.<br />The Nation County Sheriff's patrol is cruising their 750 square mile jurisdiction in minus 20-degree weather trying to get a lead on some burglaries taking place in empty \\"snowbird\\" residences. (Folks with good sense who flee from Iowa winters) Carl almost runs down a forlorn figure who has been honking his horn.  Local ne'er do well, Fred \\"Goober\\" Houseman finally admits he is the wheelman for the latest rash of robberies and says his two cousins who were going to rob the nearest farm last night never came out, and now poor ole Fred doesn't know what to do, so he's been sitting there honking the horn.<br />Upon investigation, Carl finds two frozen corpses in a shed by the empty house.  The crime unravels to much more than burglaries and appears to have a far right wing militant conspiracy involved. The story escalates into a bang-up conclusion that really needs to be on the big screen with splendiferous special effects.<br />This is my second Donald Harstad book, and he just keeps getting better.  His characterizations are subtle and nuanced.  He is careful to keep his 99 percent law abiding and normal Iowa citizens in the forefront, so the reader doesn't get the impression only serial killers and loonies live in northern Iowa.

This novella written in 1954 was the first that delved into the psyche of a totally evil child.  For sheer chill, few of the followers have matched it.  Little 10-year old Rhoda Penmark is flawless perfection without a soul.  She is a pretty, tidy, obedient child who worms her way to adults' affection.  Her peers avoid her.  Her teachers are puzzled. And her mother is about to lose her mind.<br />Rhoda only has two buttons to push: Greed and Personal Safety.  If she wants something, she will go to any lengths to get it.  If she fears for her own well-being, she is willing to do anything to safeguard herself. Other than these two flaws, she is flawless. True, she has a short attention span and gets bored easily, but if you keep her satisfied, she's absolutely fine.<br />The novella gets its power from the strain of \\"I'm watching you watching me\\" until it is heightened to unbearable intensity.  You begin to believe Rhoda is a force of nature, and she can no more be circumvented than the West Wind.  The book shows it age in some of the almost caricature characterizations of supporting characters.  From our hurried-up 21st Century viewpoint, you can't help but think everybody has a little too much time on their hands. Nevertheless, \\"The Bad Seed\\" still packs quite a wallop.<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2003-02-22

I have always enjoyed this method (see \\"A Woman of Independent Means\\" by Elizabeth Forsythe) of letters or diaries being the narrative device.  When well done, the reader has a unique intimacy with the narrator.  When not so well done, the reader gets a galloping case of claustrophobia.  Ms. Greenberg does well with her material and produces a highly readable book.<br />Antigone (\\"Tig\\"), the head of the clan, is a former activist who is taking a year off to walk across America from California to Cape Cod with an environmentalist group, maybe to get in touch with her past. Her correspondents are husband Marz, daughters Justice and Solidarity (right there, I had doubts about heroine Tig, who would burden her children with such names!), and grandchildren Ben and Hope.  Tig and Marz, highly intelligent, have had marital problems in the past mostly because of Tig's high-minded activism.  The daughters are polar opposites, Justice is a rigid conformist; Solidarity has drifted through life with few goals. The grandchildren, both teenagers are well drawn; Ben comes off as a wise child; Hope is achingly innocent, stubborn and idealistic.  When Hope falls in love with a Native American boy who is about as stable as an earthquake, a tragedy is in the making.<br />While the story was interesting, I was continually irritated by the passivity of the characters.  I became more and more sympathetic with Justice, mother of Hope and Ben, who was frantically trying to head off a maelstrom while the rest of the family counseled patience and love. Why on earth Tig did not abandon her march to help put out fires on the home front makes her seem grotesquely selfish.  Marz's platitudes and reasoning are at best ineffectual, at worst down right stupid. The Warriner's solution to an 800-lb. gorilla in the living room was to pretend he wasn't there.<br />The story is strong enough to make the reader care, but not necessarily like the main characters.  This would be a good book club selection because everyone will have strong opinions that should make for a good rousing discussion.<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2003-02-19

Given the last decade in American politics, anything short of the president of the United States concealing a harem of thousands in the Casbah is unlikely to even raise an eyebrow. When Cassidy Drummond consults P.I. Frank Pavlicek about the disappearance of her twin, Cartwright, he is reluctant and remains so though most of the tale. The Drummond twins are daughters of a high-placed politico who has enough clout to subvert any embarrassing investigations.<br />Frank is yet another former homicide cop with a sidekick named Joe Tornado who could easily go by the name Hawk.  Frank has a sophisticated love interest, Marcia (read Susan) and his hobby is falconry. (Well, Berretta had a cockatoo.)  He lives in beautiful Charlottesville, VA and, like Jonathan Kellerman, a stickler for giving you routes, street names and landmarks. I always thought my lack of enthusiasm for this sort of information was because I did not know Los Angeles.  I have lived in Charlottesville, and I can vouch for Mr. Stranka's authenticity, but I spent a lot of time visualizing exactly where I was when it really didn't make much difference to the plot. I know some readers enjoy this very much.<br />I think Mr. Stranka is a good workmanlike writer.  He takes care and precision with his plots.  \\"A Killing Sky\\" just has too much a look of being written from a blueprint of what makes a successful mystery novel.<br />-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2003-02-19

The church, the gentry, public schools, the penal system, the judiciary, token blacks and the aristocracy.  If he missed anything or anybody, that's the biggest accident of all.<br />Paul Pennyfather is the transparent vessel that is acted upon by all the howling winds of hypocrisy.  I liked Paul and always expected him to muddle through with his excellent manners (\\"always a gentleman.\\") He is sent down from an Oxford look-alike under the cloud of \\"indecent behavior\\" when he is the victim of a hazing incident that leaves him trouserless on the common.  His guardian cancels his allowance for the shame of it, and Paul is forced to take a position in sub-par boys school in Wales.  The cast of characters is well used, whoever he meets always returns later in the story until Waugh settles them or kills them off, whichever suits his fancy.  As wild as the ride is, the story ends tidily with Paul in exactly the same position as when he started.<br />There is an undertone of iron in this biting tale.  I think Waugh already was getting his religious visions in place.  \\"Decline and Fall\\" is brilliant, but moody.  Your discomfort level might rise even while you are laughing.  \\"Decline and Fall\\" is an excellent introduction to Evelyn Waugh's works.

From the time she married until her death at the great age of 97 in 1994, she lived in splendor, most of which she created herself.<br />Nancy was born in Abermarle county, VA in 1897 at Mirador, the plantation of her grandfather, Chiswell (Chillie) Langhorne. She was raised there and in Richmond until the sudden death of her parents when she was a teenager.  The lovely Nancy lived with aunts (Irene, who was the prototype of the famous Gibson Girl and Nancy, who became Lady Astor and was the first woman to be elected to Parliament).  She married Henry Field, of the fabulously wealthy Marshall Field family, but five months later he died suddenly of a minor operation.  Subsequently, she remarried Ronald Tree, American born, but raised in England.  The Trees, if possible, were even wealthier than the Fields.  Nancy's goal was to live at Mirador, but Ronald's ties and ambitions in politics were all in England.  She spent the greater part of her life in England and became renowned for her brilliant decorating of her grand country houses and her skill as a charming hostess.<br />The book is part biography (Becker) interspersed with Nancy's own recollections that are printed in boldface.  The first part of the book is excellent in giving a real feel of the very conservative upper class South still recovering from the ravages of the Civil War.  Nancy draws vivid word pictures of her family and surroundings.  She displays a vibrant wit and sense of humor.  From the time of her second marriage forward, the emphasis is on her homes and how she decorated them.<br />Though I am not a big fan of \\"tell-all\\" types of memoirs, \\"Nancy Lancaster\\" is downright curious in the way factual information is elided or ignored.  She was very close to all her famous aunts, yet never mentions when or how they died except for Lady Astor.  She states Lady Astor was the \\"last\\"of the sisters, and that is the first the reader knows the other four are deceased.  Nancy has an older brother, who is mentioned twice in the entire book.  We aren't told if he was a black sheep, disliked by Nancy or ran off to South America.  Nancy seems to have a fond relationship with Ronald Tree but for unknown reasons divorces him in 1945 and marries (briefly we suppose, as he never is mentioned again) \\"Jubie\\" Lancaster.<br />All readers will not enjoy the heavy emphasis on how she renovated, decorated, and beautified all her homes and gardens.  The book lacks enough pictures to show adequately what she has done.  I found the book highly readable, but unless you have an interest in early 20th century English society, stately homes and Virginia, you will be disappointed.<br />-sweetmolly-Amazon.com Reviewer	2003-02-12

This roller coaster of a book builds tension into an appallingly great climax. If this is Mr. Harstad's debut book, I can't wait to get the next one.<br />Carl Houseman is the laid back, politically aware sheriff of a small midwestern town.  A ritualistic murder takes place with overtones of Satanism. Then another farm family is similarly attacked.  The danger escalates, the list of suspects grows, and the undermanned Sheriff's department is stretched to the breaking point.<br />Carl is a likeable guy with a not too happy marriage that you sense is mainly due to himself.  He's a great friend, but his detachment is tough on close emotional bonds.  The author obviously has insider knowledge of police departments, the politics, mechanics, and organization.  I would have liked a glossary for all the 10-11's, 10-61's that peppers the dialogue.<br />\\"Eleven Days\\" has a high gruesome level, which may put off some readers.  However, most will be so totally absorbed in the accelerating frenzy of events, they will accept the violence.  Great read!<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon[.com] Reviewer	2003-02-12

Abagail Adams must be purring with delight somewhere in the great beyond that at last her \\"beloved friend\\" is receiving the attention and kudos he deserves. John must be dancing a jig.  David McCullough has written a warm and witty definitive biography that flies off the shelves. (1,500,00 hardback copies!)<br />What is all the fuss about? Simply, the average American doesn't often consider John Adams.  He was a vague outline of a \\"Founding Father\\" whose presidency was book ended by the towering Washington and Jefferson.  \\"Towering\\" literally--Washington was 6'4\\" and Jefferson was 6'2\\".  The gently rotund Adams came in at 5'7\\". Adams rather wistfully noted what a fine figure Washington cut in his dashing uniform.<br />Simply, our country would be a far different place without Adams.  His tireless efforts in the Continental Congress, always with the long view and rising above petty considerations assured the U.S.A. would not be a squabbling group of nation states. His principles and integrity in every area of his life serves us to this day.  Adams was no saintly do-gooder.  He was irascible, thin-skinned and had a fearsome temper. He suffered bouts of black depression. But his unflagging loyalty, brilliance, and statesmanship lifted him above almost all his peers.  And something I never expected; John Adams had a wonderful sense of humor, a trait both Washington and Jefferson sorely lacked.  He had a wonderful relationship with his wife and appreciated her wit and wisdom.  He also thought she was a \\"Venus,\\" a title not many people would bestow on Abagail Adams!<br />\\"John Adams\\" is highly readable using many primary sources and exhaustively researched.  Mr. McCullough has a conversational writing style that is rare in a biographer, and he never intrudes.  My only misgiving is I felt the author gave Thomas Jefferson a very rough ride, that Jefferson's virtues were not adequately acknowledged.  <br />When I closed this book, my main thought was \\"Thank God for John Adams!\\"<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2003-02-12

When I closed \\"Death of Sweet Mister,\\" I shut my eyes and hoped to forget Shugg Akins, but knew I never would.  I just sat there dry-eyed and hollow.  This is quite a testament to author Daniel Woodrell's skill, but at a price I'm not certain I wanted to pay.<br />Shugg aka \\"Morris\\" aka Sweet Mister is fat and thirteen, a bit of an outcast with his peers (because he's fat? poor? at the bottom of the poor white trash social scale? -- we don't know.) Shugg, our narrator is bright, quick, and a pragmatist through and through.  He goes along to get along. His only champion is his mother Glenda, a pretty lady whose looks didn't get her very far, whose only weapons are persistent sensuousness and an ever-present silver thermos containing rum-laced \\"tea.\\" Shugg's nominal father (probably not) is Red Akins, a cruel, brutal, truly evil man whose purpose in life is drinking, drugging and make certain Shugg and Glenda's lives were spent in abject humiliation.  Red is not smart, but he is a shrewd and cunning, formidable foe. \\"Foe\\" is the wrong word for Red; you'd no more oppose him than an evil force of nature.  I once read of an Australian Wandering Spider, one of the most venomous spiders in the world who is so aggressive that if you try to kill him, say with a broom, he climbs right up the broom handle and goes after you, and isn't satisfied with one bite--he keeps on biting till he's through.  Red is a subhuman Wandering Spider.<br />Red and his pal Basil drag Shugg with them to steal drugs from terminally ill people and doctors' offices, the theory being if Shugg gets caught, as a juvenile, he will only be reprimanded.  Shugg complies in his sheer terror of Red, and descriptions of this overweight, clumsy boy trying to be a second story man are both pathetic and ironically funny. What Shugg lacks in physical aptitude, he makes up for in clever quick wittedness far beyond anything Red would understand.<br />When Glenda hasa torrid affair with a man who has a green T-Bird, the inexorable tragedy must play itself out. Everyone is in place: murderous Red, loyal Basil, and Shugg who has been taught to love his mother too much and knows he has not a song, but a scream, in his heart.  Glenda's Sweet Mister is gone.<br />Woodrell is powerful, concise and unsparing.  \\"Death of Sweet Mister'\\" is compelling, well-written, but not for everyone.  With a tragedy, there are no alternate endings.<br />-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2003-02-02

Cook is as easy with his craft and characters as if he had been at this for years. The East Texas honky-tonk, just-getting-by-but-not-quite, the On the Road ambiance is the warp and weave of this book.<br />Ex-cons Eddie and Ray Bob, \\"runnin' buddies,\\" stop at a convenience store for cigarettes.  Eddie is a penny short of the price, and the stuffy clerk is adamant, and Eddie shoots him.  It is hard to tell who is more amazed, Eddie or the victim.  Eddie carefully lays down four one dollar bills and goes back to the car whereupon Ray Bob rushes back, cleans out the till (and retrieves Eddie's four dollars) grabs snacks, cartons of cigarettes and sandwiches.  When he ambles back to the ragtop Caddie (stolen?), he announces, \\"You can't steal from a dead man.\\" Their odyssey has begun, a rampage of raiding convenience stores and leaving dead clerks.  They are shot with luck, as there never are any witnesses and things go well until they pick up Della, who has had a spot of trouble of her own.<br />Ray Bob is vicious, highly intelligent psychopath who is jealous of Della coming between him and his runnin' buddy.  Eddie, a sweet dim bulb with the soul of an artist, is clearly over his head with the murderous Ray Bob and infatuated with Della.  Della, an almost \\"babe\\" (her eyes are too close together) is a combination of low down schemer and \\"what's a nice girl like me doing with thugs like you.\\"<br />You get to know these three like members of your family (though you wouldn't want to admit you knew them.) There is a Texas Ranger grimly trying to trail him, and victim's husband who is a religious zealot and a gun nut who is following the ranger, but Ray Bob, Eddie and Della are blissfully unaware.  Texas wraps around you like a sandy scarf.  You think this is going to end up like the gunfight at OK Corral, but Mr. Cook has many  surprises in store before you reach that last page. When you close the book, you will think long and hardabout justice, in the abstract and in the particular.<br />\\"Robbers\\" is wonderfully written, and I would choose it as my second favorite book of 2003 (after \\"Life of Pi\\").  There have been many comparisons made from Faulkner to James Lee Burke, but I'd have to say Mr. Cook has his own unique voice, and a very good one it is.<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2003-01-31

She plans to take her son to a remote cave in the Grand Canyon where she can protect him, and they never will be found.  Her distraught husband hires a private detective of high reputation to find her.<br />The tension is high as the reader reflects upon not only Martha's instability, but also her ignorance of the outdoors and primitive living.  She shows great determination and tenacity learning how to cope and trying to set up a \\"normal\\" (?) life for her small son. You can't help but admire Martha with her wry humor in spite of her acute paranoia. Her planning has been meticulous. However, her self-made Eden cannot last, and how she resolves her problems make a shocking finale.<br />\\"Prince of Lost Places\\" is more a novella than full-fledged novel.  The author describes the Grand Canyon-desert locale very well. There are a few foreshadowings that needed tightening up to keep the reader from guessing the author's intentions, but overall it is a tidy piece of fiction that gives the reader something to ponder over after the last page	2003-01-30

It couldn't happen to a nicer person than Jo Slater, our luxe heroine of this finely crafted psychological novel.  Jo started off poor, became the mistress and later the wife of an obscenely rich man.  She paid her dues, was the perfect wife and hostess, educated herself and became an arbitrator of Society.<br />Jo knows her 18th century French furniture, her Porthault linens, her couture wardrobe----knows it all except her incredibly conniving older husband and her former great friend, the young Countess de Passy.  Husband dies suddenly in shocking circumstances, and Jo finds she is left with nothing but her jewelry and wardrobe while the Countess is left half his fortune.  Hell hath no fury, etc., but Jo's is focused on the Countess to the point of obsession.  However, it's tough to successfully scheme when all the bucks are on the other side.<br />Picture a cross among psychological thriller writer Minette Walters, \\"W\\"'s savvy society columnist Suzy, and the light hearted wit of George Plimpton and you will have an idea of what Ms. Hitchcock is about here.  Jo is so likeable even when she is thinking her darkest thoughts that you feel like you want her for your new best friend. <br />Though \\"Social Crimes\\" is eminently readable and witty, it is no fluffy beach book.  The author zeros in on the pain and belittlement of obsession and humiliation; how even the best of us can become emotionally crippled by a sudden change in our fortunes.  Revenge is a very cold dish indeed.<br />Can't say enough good about Ms. Hitchcock and \\"Social Crimes.\\"  Do yourself a favor and read it!<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon.com Reviewer	2003-01-24

I had a \\"Who in the world do you think you are??\\" attitude before I read a page.  So before going further, I would like to commend her on her hard work, and the fine investigating she did on the late Victorian era, and depictions of the poverty stricken East End of London, particularly White Chapel.<br />Ms. Cornwell shows her inexperience in handling historical material by her woeful lack of sources and citations.  Her opinions are just that. Her bibliography does not list one source by any of her colleagues who have devoted years of study to the case.  Her villain of choice, the artist Walter Sickert, is not a new suspect, nor has all her investigation elevated him to prime suspect level.  The degraded mtDNA found on an envelope enclosing a letter sent to Scotland Yard purportedly from Jack the Ripper could belong to 40,000 people in London alone as well as Walter Sickert.  Ms. Cornwell refuses to believe ANY crank letters were sent to the Yard and London newspapers, that every last one was from Walter Sickert.  This would entail Mr. Sickert traveling the length and breadth of Great Britain and France during a two-month period.  Ms. Cornwell \\"proves\\" Sickert was in London at the time of the murders by flatly stating no one \\"proved\\" he wasn't there in spite of the fact that a contemporary letter from Sickert's wife places him in France. She places hidden meanings in his dark forbidding paintings that try as I would, I couldn't see \\"weapons\\" and \\"hidden faces.\\"<br />All through the reading of this book, I had the uncomfortable feeling Ms. Cornwell was trying to squeeze a size 16 model into a size 8 dress, slicing off a leg here or an arm there; anything to make it fit.  All to no avail.<br />\\"Portrait of a Killer: Case Closed\\" is poorly organized and repetitious, making it a dull read particularly the last few chapters.  My conclusion is the sameas many readers; too many years have elapsed.  Jack the Ripper is lost in the fog of time.<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2003-01-24

This is a welcome change and gives Milo a depth lacking in previous books.  I always saw Milo as a set of traits (rubbing his face as if washing, desert boots, too much booze, acne scarred) and frankly, was bored with him.  The saintly Robin is on hiatus this trip; she may be permanently fed up.  We are treated to Alex really behaving like a jerk to her via long distance that amused me; they have always been far too idyllic.<br />Alex receives a mysterious photo album entitled \\"The Murder Book\\" with 50 pages of glossy scene-of-the-crime photos of disparate victims.  They are clearly police photos, and Alex thinks they are meant for his friend Milo. Sure enough, one of the photos is a victim of a 20-year old unsolved case of Milo's when he was a rookie detective.  A young girl was savagely murdered and the higher-ups shut down the investigation.  Milo's edgy partner took early retirement, and Milo was transferred to another division. Alex and Milo investigate and find themselves thwarted at every turn.  The highest and lowest of LA enter into the mix (making for a huge cast of characters) as the pair follows a tortuous trail.  There is a whiff of Ross MacDonald here in the multi-generational corruption.  The author handles all the threads neatly and carries the reader to a fine twist-and-turn conclusion.<br />\\"The Murder Book\\" is first-rate Kellerman.  Previous to reading this book, I had read two or three other bestseller mysteries, including Sue Grafton's \\"Quarry.\\" Kellerman's writing ability shines in comparison.  He succeeds in making even his worst villains human (though he is a bit hard on second generation rich Beverly Hills types), and even the most saintly (including Alex) have their nottoo attractive quirks.  Most admirable is Kellerman's ability to stay out of the rut with a long ongoing series.  There is no particular need to start at the beginning of the series; \\"The Murder Book\\" stands alone nicely.  Recommended.<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon(.com) Reviewer	2003-01-22

Grafton became interested in this unsolved case and sponsored a forensic sculptor to do a likeness of the victim, which she included at the back of this book in hopes that someone will recognize the picture.  This seems to be the year for big time mystery writers to take a hands-on interest in unsolved crimes what with Patricia Cornwell's six million dollar investment in the Jack the Ripper case.<br />Two retired detectives call in Kinsey Milhone to assist them in reopening the cold case of an unsolved murder of a Jane Doe victim.  The trail leads the trio to small town Quorum CA.  On the surface, Quorum is God-fearing and conservative, but appearances are deceiving, and soon Kinsey is up to her tumbled hairdo in suspects.<br />The book is a bit of a slow start to get everyone in place.  I question the wisdom of having two cohorts that are both dying.  Not only is it depressing, a lot of time is spent to and froing to emergency rooms and discussing diets and the horrors of smoking. I do not object at all to Grafton's love of placing senior citizens in her stories, I just wish she would be sure their health warranted the tasks she sets out for them.  Like many other reviewers, I could do without the ongoing soap opera of Kinsey's rediscovered family.  \\"Quarry\\" is back in the familiar groove after a really fine departure in \\"Peril\\" where Grafton extended her scope and vision.  She does her usual fine job of characterization and descriptions that add so much to her novels.  The plotting is excellent, and the ending is nicely surprising.  I'm just hoping Kinsey can soon find a friend who is under 65.<br />Ms. Grafton heeded her fans.  The final report is back in place, the whodunit is crystal clear with no ambiguity that might possibly make the reader think for a few minutes after closing the book, and the motives are straightforward with no complexities.  Thisis the type Kinsey that pays the bills.<BR>-sweetmolly-[Amazon.com] Reviewer	2003-01-19

They love each other, but cannot live together; he the rationalist, she the spiritualist.  Son Jeremy is the narrator and swings between love and resentment of his exasperating parents.<br />Bernard and June meet at the end of WWII and fall instantly and passionately in love with each other and their ideals.  They are both communists while their contemporaries are falling away after Stalinism has blasted ideals.  While on their wedding trip, June is attacked by two wild dogs.  The experience affects them both profoundly.  June sees the attack and its aftermath in a spiritual light, Bernard in a cold rational manner.<br />McEwan takes the reader by the hand and spins his magic of story telling around Bernard and June.  There is a climactic incident between Jeremy and Bernard when they are in Berlin when the wall comes down.  McEwan makes this so vivid, I could see the crumbling wall, feel the tensions of the variegated citizenry, smell the fear as neonazi hoodlums confront them.

This is the second chance I have given Bentley Little (the first being \\"The Store\\"--don't ask) because well-regarded friends have recommended him. Mr. Little comes up with good ideas and then runs amok with them until they become laughable parodies of a bad spook movie.<br />Barry and Maureen Welch buy a dream home in remote Utah, a gated community with a Homeowner's Association from hell.  At first, the \\"restrictions\\" are merely petty and irritating.  Then people start disappearing.  Barry is confronted with a limbless man with his tongue cut out clothed in a bloody diaper screaming and rolling around on a walking path.  When he tries to report it, he is told (with a smile) \\"Oh, that's just Stumpy.  He's just eccentric.\\" This is a long way from being thinkable, let alone plausible. Then Maureen & Barry see construction for an Association-built swimming pool presided over a bull whip-cracking supervisor and a crew of shirtless robot type \\"volunteers.\\"  Now at this point, ordinary human beings would pack their bags and get out---but not Barry & Maureen.  The escalation is fierce, the action is grotesque, loose ends are over the place, and there is no resolution.  In an epilogue Barry & Maureen are buying a little shack in a non-restricted area with run down trailers, no curbs and gutters, and are as happy as merry elves.<br />I have the impression Mr. Little had a bad experience with Wal-Mart (\\"The Store\\") and another with a Homeowner's group (\\"The Association\\") then treated himself to a revenge fantasy and wrote it all down in a white heat.  I'm sure it gave him a great deal of satisfaction and relieved his stress.  Unfortunately, it does neither for the reader.  Give it a pass.	2003-01-13

He soaks up knowledge of animals and shares it with whoever will listen.  He is enchanted with God and becomes a Hindu, Muslim, and Christian with exuberant impartiality.  As his father says \\"he seems to be attracting religions the way a dog attracts fleas.\\"  Life becomes difficult for the Patel family, and father decides to sell the zoo and immigrate to Winnipeg, Canada.<br />They embark on an old freighter for they are transporting some of their more exotic beasts.  The ship sinks losing all hands, and Pi finds himself in a lifeboat with a zebra, a spotted hyena, an orangutan (Orange Juice) and a 450 lb. Bengal tiger (Richard Parker).  Given Richard Parker's natural tendencies, the population quickly dwindles to Pi and Richard.  Pi is a resourceful boy, knows a great deal about animals---enough to be absolutely petrified of Richard Parker--- and decides his only chance is to convince Richard that he, Pi, is the alpha trainer.  This is not an easy task on a lifeboat.  But Pi has a few advantages.  Richard tends to get seasick and Pi has a whistle that startles Richard terribly.  They suffer horribly over the next 277 days, almost die and then revive.  They finally wash up on an isolated beach in Mexico.<br />The end of the story has a twist, and Pi leaves it up to the listener what he wants to believe.  I was profoundly affected.  Mr. Martel lets Pi be prosaically informative (but oh, so interesting) about animals and lets him soar with spiritual and imaginative beliefs all with an excellent sense of humor.  The reader must be braced for some hair-raising events and keep in mind that Pi is a survivor, just as much as Richard Parker is. <br />\\"The Life of Pi\\" is as magical as you make it.<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2003-01-06

I have been with it since the start and don't believe I have missed an episode (though some were eminently missable!).<br />\\"The Stingray\\" came out hoping to capitalize on first \\"Survivor\\" winner Richard Hatch's instant fame.  The author's big beef is 1) CBS has Survivor cast members so locked up, it's a wonder they can even renew their drivers' license and 2) Richard Hatch \\"strung him along\\" and a $500,000 book deal sunk from sight because Richard either was unaware of the lock CBS had on him or thought he could get around it.<br />Mr. Lance never considers that maybe Richard Hatch was also bummed out about losing $500,000.  The book is basically one long whine. Lance constantly reminds us he is a multiple award winning \\"investigative journalist\\" and Hatch is well---chopped liver.  Richard is a fascinating subject, a man that has reinvented himself more times than you can count, very bright, self-destructive, and some of this information is presented.<br />Awards aside, this book is atrociously edited and hardly a page goes by without major typos and misspellings. The organization is non-existent. Mr. Lance is much given to \\"More on THIS later\\" type statements, only there never is any \\"more.\\" The author constantly zings Hatch with \\"you knew how to win a million dollars; but you didn't know what to do after you got it.\\"<br />Well, now it is two years later.  Richard seems to be doing ok, and he has been resurrected as the Prime Survivor.  All other Survivors are compared to Richard and found lacking. Latest Survivor winner Brian Haydik, who could probably give a whole new meaning to the phrase \\"coldly ambitious\\", is believed to have modeled his strategy on Hatch's game. At the time of Richard's win, he was the man you loved to hate, and Peter Lance sneered that would be his undoing.  Not necessarily so.  Viewers gradually realized you could be Charley-nice-guy and get booted off the island, or you could Outwit, Outplay, and Out Mean everyone else and come home with a million dollars.<br />Many of the interviews in this book are second-hand, even at the time the book was printed.

Impenetrable plots.  In \\"Cards on the Table,\\" she has exceeded herself.  It is a whodunit lovers delight.  <br />To make such a puzzle work, the circumstances have to be fairly contrived.  So you will just have to accept that four of the best sleuths alive all have consented to be guests of a repellent billionaire who claims the other four guests are successful murderers.  Why the four accused murderers would also accept is unimportant.  The entertainment will be contract bridge with the idea that by knowing a person's bridge game, you will see the inner man (or woman as the case may be.) Actually, this is not true.  Some very nice people become gargoyles at the bridge table then instantly revert to their nice selves once the game is over, but we will let this pass.<br />The sleuths are Hercule Poirot, the observer from hell; Supt. Battle, the plodder but tenacious; Colonel Race, pragmatist and gentleman; and Ariadne Oliver, penner of detective novels and rather silly.  Why Dame Agatha didn't substitute Jane Marple in Ms. Oliver's place, I do not know.  Perhaps Jane didn't play bridge.<br />The guests are stock Christie characters: the Doctor, the Ingénue, the Stern Upper class Lady, and the Military Man. The sleuths play together in one room, the guests play 3+ rubbers in the other room (the reader is supplied with a tally).   Sometime during the play, the host is murdered in the same room as the guests with no one the wiser except the murderer, of course.  This is an embarrassing state of affairs for the sleuths, having the murder happen almost right under their noses, and they pool their skills to unearth the murderer.  We gradually find out more and more about the guests.  Each, of course, had an excellent motive for doing the host in.  To keep us thoroughly confused, the guests lie at will about themselves and each other, but they cannot outthink, outwit and outplay their opponents for long.  We get the solution,and then a twist and then a final twist before Poirot & Co. have successfully settled the matter.<br />This is one of Christie's finer puzzles.  It suffers from a static setting (the crime scene), but she invests enough interest in all the characters to keep our attention close and our little gray cells churning.<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2003-01-03

April has developed into a unique character, her stories show increasing depth and excellent research, and even her romance with the long-suffering Mike Sanchez is finally showing some sparks of maturity. With a myriad of colorful characters \\"The Silent Bride\\" is her best yet.<br />April and Mike are called upon for a high profile murder of the bride at an Orthodox Jewish wedding.  The well-to-do, deeply devout family are not obvious suspects, nor is the groom who 1) was standing at the other end of the aisle when the shot was fired and 2) barely knew his bride to be. (This was an arranged wedding.)  A hate crime is suspected, but less than a week later another bride is shot and killed entering St. Patrick's cathedral.  This high society wedding had almost nothing in common with the first murder except the wedding planner, gown designer and florist.  The planner is light-fingered and a crack marksman, the florist has a flamboyant lifestyle and likes to \\"adopt\\" boys from Third World countries, and the gown designer is enough like the real-life Vera Wang to make me take her off the suspect list immediately.  The problem is why would any of them do something that would probably destroy their businesses?<br />I had a soft spot I didn't know about for brides.  It was almost as shocking to think of a bride being killed as it would be a child.  And the author does not let you off easily.  Bride #1 was totally innocent, had never been on a date, a dreamy quiet girl.  Bride #2 was spoiled, but likeable and had her whole life in front of her.  April's sister/cousin who was to be married in a week was perhaps a designated third victim. This ratcheted up the sense of urgency nicely.  The florist's \\"boys\\" came under observation, and the author gives a chilling picture of young men who have suffered horrible psychological damage, seen their whole family destroyed, made to serve in an army at 10 years of age, then being \\"rescued\\"and sent to the U.S. by well-meaning people, but with very little desperately needed guidance and help.<br />I hope this is the big breakout for Leslie Glass.

Their exciting detective work becomes your own and there is even almost instant gratification.  When the elusive piece is found, then authenticated, there is the very real reward of seeing what price the customers put on your sleuthing and expertise.  It may be millions if you are as expert as the Keno brothers.<br />The boys grew up in upstate New York with part-time antique dealer parents.  They found treasures as soon as they were old enough to dig them up.  They started with antique hardware and went on to glass and stoneware.  Soon they were in business for themselves at flea markets and auctions.  As soon as they graduated from college, they found places with dealers in their specialty, 18th century American furniture, and quickly found employment at Christies and Sothebys respectively.  Leigh has subsequently gone into business for himself as a dealer.  <br />The frame of the book centers around a unique secretary (combination two-piece desk) created in Newport R.I. by the famed Townsend family.  The secretary has silver fittings, almost no \\"secondary\\" wood and no detail too slight to have anything but expert craftsmanship. The piece had been \\"hiding\\" for 150 years in a modest French apartment. The secretary was auctioned at Sothebys for $, the highest price ever paid for an American piece.  With tax, handling added in, it was actually $.<BR>There are many other stories in \\"Hidden Treasures\\" just as exciting if maybe not quite so costly.  I found out that Americana antiques lose value if they are \\"cleaned.\\"  If there is any old paint or rags of upholstery, leave it as is or the price will go down.  This seems strange to me; surely it must be prettied up before it is displayed.<br />This is a beautiful book with lavish color photographs very sharp and clear.  The Keno brothers are extremely likeable and never put the reader at a distance.  They seem to want you to enjoy their story as much as they do.  This is a good book for the general reader; I found I could not put it down.

He is detained by the law in a fortress like detention center situated in the flatlands.  This is desperate times for Parker who has escaped from a prison in the distant past and killed a guard in the process.  He must escape and does in most ingenious manner.  He is coerced (against his better judgment) into a jewelry heist that involves tunneling into an impregnable armory.  It is all in the finely engineered details that enchant us.  How they get in.  More important, how they get out.  It isn't Parker's lucky day.  He has to get another confederate out of jail.  Surprising to me, Parker and crew take some hostages. (I'm surprised because I think of Parker as a \\"take no prisoners\\" type.)  By this time, Parker has been trapped so many times through no fault of his own, all he wants is to get back to Jersey in one piece.  Will he make it?  Of course he will.<br />People always wonder why they have this fondness for Parker, a cold-blooded outlaw with no remorse and no friends, only \\"associates.\\"  For me it's easy.

Mr. Faulkner enfolds his prose around you like kudzu and makes you part of his world.<br />In a small Mississippi town in 1948, black Lucas Beauchamp is wrongfully arrested for shooting white Vinson Cowrie in the back.  Sixteen-year old Charles Mallison owes Lucas a debt of honor incurred four years ago.  Lucas hires Charles' cynical uncle, Gavin Stevens, to defend him.  The most pressing matter is not Lucas' guilt or innocence; it is keeping him from getting lynched before he is arraigned.  Lucas is a nightmare of a client. He is stubborn, stiff necked and proud.  He dresses like an old time plantation owner and neither owes nor accepts favors from anyone. Uncle Gavin is trying to save Lucas' neck while Charles is trying to clear him.  Gavin laments that Lucas would be easier to keep alive if \\"he would just ACT like a n----r.\\" This Lucas refuses to do.  There is body snatching, graveyards at night and some thoroughly frightening characters to liven up the journey.<br />Another reviewer mentioned \\"drunk on his prose,\\" and it is a very apt description.  It works best if read aloud; you will find Faulkner's rhythm and make it your own.  The long sentences don't trouble if you just let his prose carry you along.  Mr. Faulkner thinks any southern woman over 35 years old is a secret Amazon of quiet strength and fortitude, which makes for interesting characters, but is a little hard on credibility.  There is long section on how \\"outsiders\\" (read \\"Northerners\\") have interfered and thereby delayed integration. However true or false this may be, it slowed the story down and seemed tacked on. <br />\\"Intruder in the Dust\\" is not generally ranked with \\"premier\\" Faulkner (\\"Light in August,\\" \\"Absalom, Absalom!\\"), but it stands on its own as a fine read and certainly is one of his best post-WWII books.<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2002-12-30

Given these strictures, our picture of Eleanor is cloudy indeed.  In the 12th century, women were rarely mentioned, let alone chronicled no matter how lofty their status.<br />We know Eleanor was the greatest female landholder of her time (and almost any other time as well), married Louis VII of France, went to Jerusalem on the Second Crusade, divorced (had the marriage annulled) Louis and married Henry, Duke of Anjou, subsequently Henry II of England, the first Plantagenet king.  She had two daughters by Louis VII and nine children by Henry.  Three of her sons were kings of England: Henry (who co-reigned with his father), Richard I (Lionhearted) and John who was forced to sign the Magna Carta.  She lived to the extraordinary age of 82. Everything else is conjecture.  <br />Ms. Weir's book is by necessity more about the times, Henry II, Louis VII, Richard I and John than it is about Eleanor. There are many years of her life completely undocumented.  There is no portrait, only a sculpture and an effigy, neither meant to be likeness.  The shadowy picture we see is of a lively and adventurous woman.  Alas, the story of her charging at the head of battle, bare breasted like an Amazon is only a myth.  Yet she did go on the Crusade, almost an unheard of for a woman in her time.  It appears she became restless in her marriage to the very pious Louis VII, and it was she who forwarded the annulment.  Chronicles state Louis loved her \\"beyond all reason.\\"  It was rumored she dallied with Geoffrey of Anjou, Henry's father, before she married Henry.  Geoffrey was noted for his blinding handsomeness and \\"lustful ways.\\" Her marriage to Henry, though fruitful, was probably a political affair.  She had tremendous influence over her three sons, particularly Richard I, who was her favorite; yet she left her two daughters by Louis, never saw them again and made no apparent effort to do so.The lovely tale of Rosamund, living in a tower in the midst of a maze only to be reached by a golden thread and cruelly poisoned by the jealous Eleanor never happened.  Henry had many mistresses, including his son's betrothed; none seemed to distress Eleanor unduly.<br />Those of us who have seen \\"Lion in the Winter\\" with Katherine Hepburn playing Eleanor will be doubly fascinated by this biography.  Ms. Weir discounts Richard being a homosexual (the only \\"proof\\" being that once he shared a bed with Philip of France.  This was common practice at the time as beds were in short supply.) Far from being oafish, John was thought to be very fastidious, it is recounted he actually took eight baths in six months time!<br />My overall impression was of the barbarity of the times.  Henry was thought to be cultured and scholarly.  Yet he would fly into rages, roll around on the floor and chew out hunks of straw out of his mattress.  When Eleanor was between marriages, other men didn't exactly woo her; they tried to abduct her on the highways.  Henry's sons were like a pack of jackals trying to wrest the crown from their father and each other.  There was not a scrap of filial loyalty or love among them.<br />This is an interesting, well-researched book of the mid-12th century.  I'm sure Ms. Weir got as much factual material on Eleanor as is extant at this time.  She does complain a little overmuch about the paucity of material.  I think this period of history is a little removed from her usual field.  <BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon.com Reviewer	2002-12-30

Sheer acclaim brought me to \\"Boy's Life.\\"  One book lover friend after another praised it to the skies.  Finally, I had to see for myself what all the talk was about.  I had previously read \\"Swan Song\\" and while impressed, did not think it measured up to Stephen King's \\"The Stand.\\" I had also heard McCammon became disheartened at being typecast as a \\"horror\\" writer and all the comparisons to King.  I approached the book with a cautious but open mind.<br />Cory Mackenson, almost 12, lives an almost idyllic childhood in backwater Zephyr, Alabama. The time is 1964, but has the feel of the late 30's or early '40's.  He is the only child of an anxious mother and a thoughtful father who is a milkman for the local dairy. While riding the route with Dad, a car goes into the lake.  His dad dives in for an attempted rescue and discovers the victim is most cruelly murdered with his wrists trussed with baling wire.  The sensitive father is severely traumatized by the incident and the lack of closure.  The victim is a John Doe, and no one seems much interested in solving the case.  This is the incident that forms the base of the book.  What follows are a series of almost stand-alone vignettes of Cory's adventures, all with more than a whiff of the fantastical magical. The strongest, I felt was Cory praying his mortally injured dog to live and the chilling result. <br />Cory and his pals are excellently done; just about exactly what I would imagine would be high good times and conversation among twelve-year old boys.  Cory is a highly likeable protagonist: polite, unusually devoted to his family, very like and highly intuitive toward his father's thoughts and depression. Cory thinks of his hometown and his boyhood as an enchanted time, and he evokes that sense for the reader. <br />I was disappointed in the trite denouement of the mystery.  Heck, we used to make up better endings than that when we played cops and robbers! But there were so many satisfying little endings; I forgave the lackluster big one.  \\"Boy's Life\\" is an entertaining read, particularly for boys of all ages if the young ones can relate to a boy who was sans computer, cell, video games and the mall!<BR>-sweetmolly-Reviewer	2002-12-20

The entire Polar Party died in a blizzard returning to home camp.  Invaluable scientific, geographic, and biologic data were obtained, but the hideous Winter Journey to collect Emperor penguin embryos at terrible risk turned out to be useless information.  They hoped the embryos would show a connection between the evolution of dinosaurs into birds.  (It did not.)<br />Cherry Gerrard is a highly likeable, very human teller of the tale.  He was the youngest member of the expedition, very much the gentleman and an Englishman to his fingertips.  He shows us his human side (he didn't have the usual Englishman's fondness for animals and thought the dogs and ponies were miserable, exasperating beasts). He has a knack of bringing his fellow explorers to life, yet never criticizes at all.  He has the highest regard for everyone in the party.  He recaps from some of the other members' diaries to great effect.  The enthusiastic Bowers writes his mother, \\"There is so much to see and do here; I just wish I could be three places at once!\\"  Bowers was the best of them, to my way of thinking, and I was appalled when he \\"volunteered\\" for the Polar Party (already knowing the fate of same).  Cherry Gerrard had enormous artistic appreciation for the austere beauties of Antarctica, but no matter how brilliantly he described them, my enthusiasm was nil for such a bleak landscape.  He shows his depressive side in remarking on the \\"beauty of sleep\\" in the Antarctic---\\"sleep where you never need awaken.\\"  He was tremendously brave and endured what no man should have to bear.<br />This is the best kind of book for me to read for it sparks my interest to find out more.  Cherry Gerrard is so deferential to Captain Scott, some of whose decisions seemed downright odd to me; I am going to read Huntford's \\"Last Expedition on Earth\\" that does a critical comparison of Scott and Amundsen.  To find out more about the elusive Cherry Gerrard, I shall read Sara Wheeler's \\"Cherry\\" plus her \\"Terra Firma\\" just because it looks so good.  One heroic seaman who should star in his own movie was \\"Tom Crean: Unsung Hero of the Scott and Shackleton Antarctic Expeditions\\" by Michael Smith.<br />My only fault to find with \\"The Worst Journey--\\" was a lack of pictures.  I would have liked to see the type of clothing they wore (it sounded pitifully inadequate).  The constantly referred to \\"sledges\\" sometimes pulled by ponies, sometimes by men--I would like to see what they looked like so I had a better idea how they operated.

The photography is sharp, clear and the colors are beautiful.  What is most impressive is the range of the text.  It takes up the culture of the Sherpas, Buddhism, some geological and physiological findings as well as the climbing and filming of the Everest IMAX movie.<br />Sponsored by the National Geographic, and led by David Breashears,  a highly respected leader and photographer, this was a dream team in operation.  Lead climber was Ed Viesturs, brilliant U.S. climber who has attained 12 of the 14 highest peaks in the world, all without supplemental oxygen.  I am happy to report he is not just a myth; his favorite meal on the mountain is Spam, yes Spam.  Also this grueling trip was his \\"honeymoon.\\"  His bride accompanied him to Base Camp (about 17,000 feet) and got to worry about him for a solid month.  I enjoyed reading about sparkling Aracali Segarra, attempting to be the first Spanish woman to summit Everest (she made it!)  She is living proof that female mountaineers can be pretty and vivacious as well as awesome athletes.<br />The IMAX team was of enormous assistance to the beleaguered Hall/Fisher teams.  They supplied oxygen, helped rescue and support the injured climbers on the South Face.  Some of the pictures are brutal of the rescue attempts.  The pictures of the mountain are splendid.  The viewer will get an excellent sense of Everest's brooding size.  To me, Everest is a Godzilla of a mountain.  It does not have the proportioned beauty of K-2; it is one enormous hulk.  But this does not take away from its majesty and awe. To the Sherpas, climbing Mt. Everest is a spiritual experience, something that is done with many prayers and much reverence.<br />Everest: Mountain Without Mercy will give you hours of enjoyment.  It covers so many aspects of the area, and is beautifully printed and bound.  I recommend it for your own reading or an excellent gift.<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2002-12-19

This is an excellent history, and I feel positive and secure that Mr. Roper's records are as accurate and precise as they can possibly be of that rowdy and rambunctious world.  I enjoyed reading about the historical climbers and the more social rock climbers of the '30s. Those were the days when families came, climbed a little, picnicked a lot, and a good time was had by all.<br />The Golden Age of the '60s, of which Steve was a part, was a time of great improvements in equipment and methods, and also a first crack at some of the awesome spires that were heretofore thought \\"impossible.\\"  It was wild, giddy and reckless, adjectives I would never apply to Steve Roper. Mr. Roper is austere in his beliefs of the \\"purity\\" of the climb and who is worthy.  Though he recounts a few wild escapades, I had the feeling he did not approve.  His callousness toward the first Camp 4 fatality made me back up and reread.  Yep, I read it right, though I'm sure he was trying to keep up the \\"Right Stuff\\" façade in the face of what must have been a great shock to an 18-year old boy. That is the problem; there are so few that Roper considers to have the Right Stuff.  If they were women, they were mere appendages.  If male and had the misfortune to be born after 1955, they were not pure enough. <br /> John Long's \\"Rock Jocks, Wall Rats and Hang Dogs\\" is devoted to Camp 4 in the '70s. John is Steve's polar opposite except in their mutual love for and expertise in rock climbing.  John is wildly funny and sometimes just wild, but I had more a feeling of place when reading his book.<br />As another reviewer said, \\"Camp 4\\" is a must-have for West Coast rock enthusiasts.  It is considered the Bible of the Golden Age.<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon.com Reviewer	2002-12-19

But if anyone can make you laugh, snort, and giggle at the thought of some poor sod hanging by a fingernail to a crumbling mountain ledge, John Long is that man. Also cartoonist Tami Knight has an equally irreverent sense of humor.<br />However, if you are not laughing too hard, you will notice Long's Commentary and Prevention notes on each tale are precise, well written and helpful.  The big moral throughout is you can never ever be too careful when rock climbing.  Also, never assume anything.<br />I think this is a particularly good book for young people who have an interest in rock climbing.  A solemn, dry book would never do the trick. It is difficult to grab this group's attention, particularly since the hormones are raging, and they are certain of their immortality.  But they adore gallows humor, and just perhaps a few of these safety measures will stick in their minds and hearts.<br />John Long has a knack of coming on like your new best friend.  Similar to Stephen King, you feel like he is telling his stories just for you and no one else. So settle in and enjoy the read!<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2002-12-19

Michael Crichton, along with Mary Poppins, is a firm believer that a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down.  The \\"sugar\\" being the characters and story line.<br />Actually, the disinterested wife fascinated me right up to the finish line.  For this, I was pleased.  The story is formulaic: doomed scientists frantically searching for the key to destroy the monster before the monster destroys them (and the world).  This monster is only impressive in numbers, not size.  Microscopic computer chips programmed to be an \\"eye in the sky\\" for defense purposes.  Individually, they are dumb; put a few billion together and they evolve very quickly.<br />Because these chips have been formulated in a hunter/prey mode, there are certain short-term defenses that can be taken.  When a group of scientists is threatened, one smart fellow yells \\"Flock!\\" I confess I would have been struck dead right there, for I haven't the first notion of how one \\"flocks.\\"  It turns out they were to march in step together taking up the most amount of room possible making the swarm think they were facing a huge entity (until said swarm figured it all out, that is.)<br />Mostly I enjoyed the book and had a small glow of self-satisfaction because I had plowed through the technical pages per Mr. Crichton's wishes.  I can't help but think it will be a very silly movie, but I suppose a movie it will be, as I believe it is written into MC's contract before he even takes pen to paper.  I suggest waiting for the paperback, unless you are a die hard Crichton fan.	2002-12-19

Tempe Brennan multi-tasks in Guatemala.  She is there on a mercy mission to identify 20-year old corpses massacred during government upheavals. Then she is called in by a local homicide detective to assist him in removing suspected remains from a septic tank.  Oh my! It is just as bad as you think, but if you can get through that, your stomach and spine should be strong enough for the rest of the story.<br />I enjoyed the exotic setting.  Reichs has a good feel for Guatemala, its government and the populace.  Tempe is well presented in this outing, brisk, humorous and delightfully vulnerable to a handsome man crossing her path.  That said handsome man is almost a clone of the one she has stashed in Canada just shows she is a consistent lady.  <br />\\"Grave Secrets\\" is seriously over-plotted, but the author does get some good mileage with all her red herrings and distractions.  She makes an interesting point of how differently a crime is treated when a major diplomat's daughter is involved as opposed to an ordinary citizen.  A warning: when Ms. Reich's says, \\"Do you want the short version?\\" Brace yourself for at least three pages of very technical material on such things as stem cells, septic tanks and DNA.<br />I think Kathy Reichs is a steadily improving author.  She is head and shoulders ahead of rival Patricia Cornwell because Reichs has the advantage of forensic anthropology credentials and the liveliness of spirit to make her heroine a multi-faceted human rather than a drama queen with angst such as Kay Scarpetta.

Sheriff Joanna Brady doesn't just solve crimes.  She is newly remarried, mother of a sensitive 12-year old daughter, has an irritating mother, and what looks to be a househusband.  I felt the walls of resistance rising against slogging through this type of story.  But Ms. Jance is an experienced spinner of tales, and I became involved almost in spite of myself.<br />Joanna's daughter and tent mate discover a brutally murdered woman while at a Girl Scout camp out.  The girls snuck away after to lights out to smoke cigarettes and encountered a body instead.  For a while there, I didn't know which caused more consternation; the discovery of the body or sneaking smokes.  But when the daughter's tent mate is found dead in suspicious circumstances, things heat up.  Joanna's understaffed department is confronted with a possible serial killer, a car jacker, and the daughter's safety.  While the serial killer plot is fairly transparent, the death of the 13-year old tent mate is not.  Ms. Jance does an excellent job of unfolding clues and motives perfectly paced and well placed.<br />The author's strength is in her story telling abilities and her obvious love of the desert locale. Her weaknesses are dialogue and male characters with as many dimensions as volleyball. The husband is a marvel of patience and understanding, her chief deputy is robotically perfect at following orders and her former father-in-law is a lovable old geezer.  Too much of the book takes place in a car.  Apparently Sheriff Brady does not believe in phones (though she is forever on her cell phone), faxes or even inquiring as to whether someone is at home before sending half her staff whizzing across state while she takes off in the other direction. But even with these shortcomings, the story moves along and keeps the reader engaged.

Rainier September 23rd of this year. In spite of the fact that Ed had a co-writer, his own voice rings very clear in this book.  There is something very appealing in his modesty, sometimes almost a childlike idealism, and his wrenching appraisals/reappraisals of himself.<br />Ed grew up in modest circumstances, somewhat of an outsider with not much enthusiasm for school.  Early on, he developed a fascination for all things Alaska, seeing it as a Last Frontier and he hung on to his dream.  His next goal was to become a pilot, and I was impressed with the adversity he overcame to reach his goal.  He had no money, only a high school education and ended up being a pilot for American Airlines.<br />He finally made it to Alaska, a land he loved forever, and thought he had the world by the tail with a part time job as a bush pilot, his hippie chick girlfriend--the beauteous Sandy, and a baby on the way when disaster struck.  He took three passengers (one being his brother-in-law) on a sight seeing jaunt and crashed high up on Mt. McKinley.  Two (including the brother-in-law) were injured fatally, but Ed and another passenger were not hurt too badly initially.  Then a storm front set in, and would-be rescuers could not reach them for five days.  Ed's recounting of these hellish five days is harrowing. The weather was fierce, and by the time the rescuers got there, the two living victims were frostbitten badly.  Ed lost both feet above the ankle. <br />He very honestly admits he was in a tailspin for a long time.  He was besieged by legalities he didn't understand, he had a terrible time with the Veteran's Administration who was underwriting most of his massive medical bills including a 3-1/2 month stay in the hospital, physical therapy, and prosthetic devices.  He withdrew from life, became apathetic, drank his breakfast, lunch and then some.  His marriage suffered irreparable harm.  Part of his problem was the miserable time he had with his prosthesis. <br />Once he attached himself to a goal, he was seemingly unstoppable.  He made up his mind he would fly again; he not only achieved the goal, he went back to work.  Then he decided he wouldn't get closure until he had successfully summitted Mt. McKinley despite his artificial feet and lower legs.  He did it in two tries.  Though Ed Hommer didn't care about material goals, he set his sights high and was a miracle of achievement.	2002-12-06

That's all you need to set eminent decorators, Colefax and Fowler to work.  The \\"few good pictures\\" are preferably old masters and the \\"several nice pieces\\" should be priceless antiques, but if you aren't already blessed with such bounty, C&F will see to it.<br />This is a beautiful, delightful book!  I bought it used, and it was pristine. There are 264 gorgeous color plates of excellent photography and the prose is a lively mix of C&F history (particularly John Fowler) and description, tips, and information about the homes/castles/estates decorated. There is a wonderful Glossary for those of us who are vernacular-challenged when it comes to elegant decorator terms.  I for one was pleased to learn that a \\"fauteuil\\" is a \\"French salon armchair with carved decorations, sometimes gilt.\\"<br />Put bluntly (which Mr. Jones wouldn't dream of doing), Ms. Colefax provided the money and contacts, and Mr. Fowler provided the inspiration and brains. And contacts were desperately needed for this venture.  To achieve casual, elegant nonchalance required great outlays of money not to be had from your everyday man on the street.  Colefax and Fowler became expert at the tactful handling of the temperamental, sometimes eccentric foibles of the very rich.  If Mr. Jones is any example, I'm sure he would take it right in stride when I announced I'd like less \\"balance\\" on the mantel piece please, and I really didn't care much for massive curtains that puddled on the floor.<br />There are useful tips and diagrams that can be put to use in much more economical settings. For instance, a maxim of Mr. Fowler's was, scale of furniture should be relative to height, not width.  In other words, a large low-ceilinged room would not call for big important pieces of furniture where a high-ceilinged room would. <br />This is a book of which you will never tire.  The color schemes, the placements and the sheer beauty will call out to you again and again. A fine investment of your time and pleasure.<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2002-12-06

One of the girls is a savvy traveler, the other a complete neophyte.  The match up was not made in heaven, and soon the girls are entangled in a web of forced dependence upon each other that ends up in a shocking murder of an innocent bystander.<br />Ms. Carlon sets us to the task of figuring out which girl did the dastardly deed.  Each of their stories is seamless, verifiable, and each accuses the other of the crime.  I liked the set-up; I just wished their trip was more interesting.  They never seemed to have a destination and their actual routes were a dull slog indeed.  There were no scenic descriptions, only a lot of dust, heat, rain and wind.  Their interactions with other people were brief and rare.  Their mode of transportation was hitchhiking which seems a strange choice for two middle class girls in the '70s.  The author did a good job of characterizing the girls; they both seemed believable if not very likeable.  That was my problem as a reader; I didn't care much what happened to them.<br />The solution, while neat, was not believable and I closed the book disappointed.  I might give Ms. Carlon another try as she writes a tidy plot and has strong skills in characterization. \\"The Souvenir\\" needed more color and life.<BR>-sweetmolly- Amazon[.com] Reviewer	2002-12-04

Unusual for a debut, \\"Denial\\" is not plot heavy nor does it have a cast of thousands for us to keep track of.<br />Dr. Frank Clevenger is about as anti-hero as I have ever read; he is an all around addict: coke, sex, alcohol, and gambling.  Plus, he plays the blame game on himself for every misstep in his life.  I always feel when reading a mystery that the protagonist is my pilot, constant companion and must see us both successfully to the finish.  After Dr. Clevenger, my next trip will be with someone more like McDonald's Travis McGee, who I can depend upon to not fold on me until the last villain is vanquished.  With Frank, I was exhausted trying to get us both to the end without cracking up.<br />Frank is given a mercy job by an ambitious sheriff to sign off on whether an accused murderer's confession is admissible.  The accused insists he is General William Westmoreland among other visions and ramblings.  This murder sends Frank on a quest to find the guilty party who is viciously slaughtering his victims. The story is replete with abused and emotionally crippled victims, Frank included.  The author's empathy and expertise are shown in representing these people.  I admired the level of professionalism Dr. Ablow displayed in his understanding of state hospitals bureaucracy and the patients treated there.  <br />\\"Denial\\" has a high level of eroticism that is in keeping with Frank's character; however, it may be too steamy for some readers.  The book shows talent and promise.  I will look for more works by this author.<BR>-sweetmolly- Amazon Reviewer	2002-12-04

Though an Irishman residing in Dublin, \\"Every Dead Thing\\" has an entirely believable cast of American characters set on the eastern seaboard of the United States. True, some of personalities are a little frayed around the edges from over use, but whatever they are, they don't seem Irish.<br />The plots, subplots and minor skirmishes are so involved in this extra long thriller that I will only recount the bare bones.  Charlie \\"Bird\\" Parker of the NYPD suffers the devastating loss of his wife and child in a particularly gruesome murder.  Charlie is racked with guilt, as he was as usual, on his favorite bar stool when the crime was committed.  After a few months in a moral tailspin, he quits the force and the hooch and resolves to find the murderer. His quest takes him from upper eastside New York, to rural Virginia, to New Orleans and bayou country in Louisiana.  The danger, gore and mayhem are unrelenting.<br />Charlie is my least favorite type of protagonist: recovering alcoholic who primly makes a point of ordering Perrier when there is the slightest thought of an alcoholic beverage in the wings, appropriately dark and bitter, finds a lady who might make it all \\"worthwhile\\" if she lives through all the blood and thunder to which he subjects her. (It never occurs to the these types that it is perfectly ok to leave the little lady at home instead of dragging her through the tunnels, cellars and swamps where all the terrors take place.) Then there are Angelo and Louis, two hardened criminals, who are Charlie's loyal sidekicks--Robin Hood and his not-so-Merry Men. <br />The action and the pace are excellent.  I was daunted (or just plain tired) when Charlie made a tremendous discovery halfway through the book only to find we were right back where we started. I certainly give Mr. Connolly credit for not making the rest of the book seem like an anti-climax.  The final denouement was a bit rushed, but seeing as we were on page 467, I was certainly ready to forgive and forget. Though the author writes well and plots beautifully, \\"Every Dead Thing\\" is aimed at the die-hard gash and gore fan...	2002-12-04

Thank the Lord for Joe Pike, who remains cynical and enigmatic.<br />A pretty young lady radiating wholesomeness (is there any other kind?) wants to hire Elvis to see why her fiancé, an LAPD copy, has been acting so distant toward her lately.  Elvis finds her a quick, not too pleasant answer and the case is closed.  Right?  Not quite, or the story would end on page 22.  Elvis has sparked the interest of a whole squad of LAPD plus some heavy-duty gangbangers.  The action picks up; the escapades are just short of unbelievable while Elvis and Joe are on everyone's Most Wanted List.<br />Mr. Crais does some excellent description of South Central LA, bringing the mean streets to life and shows us it isn't just one vast killing ground.  The action is fast, it's highly readable, but not on a par with other works by Robert Crais.	2002-11-25

Perhaps there is a cultural chasm or translational difficulty, but bluntly, Mineko does not come off as particularly truthful, likable, or appealing.  The aspects she chooses to display show her great love of dressing up, dancing, and her almost frenetic energy.<br />The most interesting part of the book is her early childhood that was in a semi-rural part of Japan and was idyllic.  The reader has to swallow that Mineko had an almost photographic memory from age three plus great insight into people's characters.  She was an odd little girl who preferred to be alone, spent most of her time (by choice) in closets, and did not like to talk to people.  She nursed (or tried to nurse) until she was almost 10 years old, long after she had left her mother.  Maybe this is a Japanese custom.  She left her family for good by the time she was six-years old to live permanently in the Iwasaki okiya (geisha house).  She insists throughout the book that her father, an aristocrat in reduced circumstances, was not, as accused, a baby-seller; yet he did just that with three of his four daughters.  His eldest never forgave him and ran away to get married before the debt to the geisha house was paid.  Mineko heaps scorn upon this eldest sister throughout the book because she &quot;dishonored&quot; the family and caused her father grief.  <br />Mineko was not typical because she was heiress-apparent of the house, and was always treated with a great deal of honor.  To most American readers, it might seem this &quot;honor&quot; turned her into a spoiled, arrogant brat.  She complains the other girls did not like her and were jealous of her attainments and superiority. It was likely they had more genuine reasons for their dislike.  There is no doubt that Mineko worked hard and earned her number one status.  Her schedule is almost unbelievable (she says she only slept a few hours a night).  It is interesting the amount of celebrity she occasioned as the top geisha (geiko) in Kyoto.  Crowds gathered round, autograph hunters were everywhere; she had commercial endorsements. To us, she had the life of a rock star.  She retired at the height of her fame at age 29.  Since that time, she has been successful in business (why does this not surprise me?), married and has one daughter.  <br />&quot;Geisha, A Life&quot; is interesting and the author is very good at giving us small vignettes of her experiences with her peers.  Her descriptions of her beautiful attire and the backbreaking work of making up, hairdressing, and donning the various garments to ready herself for public appearances are fascinating.  I really wished I could have liked her more.	2002-11-25

With Michael Crichton weaving his magic over the scene and Edward Pierce, mastermind and protagonist, we have an unbeatable combination.  The author does wonders describing authentic period scenes and showing us the huge divide between the English middle class and the wretched poor in Victorian times.<br />Edward Pierce wants 12,000 pounds sterling that will be sent by rail to fund the Crimean War.  The obstacles are huge.  It takes four keys to get to and unlock the safe.  This was before the days of nitroglycerine, so the safe could not be blown, and it was too heavy to carry away.  All four keys are held by separate persons and must be found and copied.  The thieves have to get the payload unseen off of a moving train.  Mr. Pierce has a hazy background, presents himself as a wealthy traveling businessman with a fine home in London, a well-dressed gentleman with an appreciation of the finer things.  As we get to know him better, we learn he has nerves of steel, a quick and clever wit, and is relentless planner with infinite patience.  He is blessed with a mysterious mistress, Miriam, whose acting abilities could put Meryl Streep to shame.  The suspense and tension as Pierce and his accomplice, Robert Algar, work for a solid year on their plan is riveting.  Naturally, when the heist takes place, even the most careful plans have to change with unforeseen circumstances.  Will they get away with it?  Read it and see.<br />The author puts us in the skins of Victorian people of the time.  For instance, the police department is only 25 years old.  London citizens were accustomed to being very hands-on when a crime is committed.  Not like today when one's first thought is to call the police.  If a criminal was observed picking a pocket, there would likely be a great hue and cry by the nearest citizens and all would chase the thief until they caught him.  Only then, would they call the police.  A married woman was the \\"property\\" of her husband.  This of course, is abominable for her human rights, but if she is caught say counterfeiting money, her husband goes to jail, not her.  After all, he is responsible for his property.<br />\\"The Great Train Robbery\\" was made into a movie in the late '70s with Sean Connery as Mr. Pierce.  One way or another, I am going to see it.  This is a great read and a well-done social history of one of the most fascinating men of the age.  Highly recommended.<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2002-11-25

The fortyish Ms. Lane has died despicably of some unnamed degenerative disease that cruelly turned her vegetative.  Molly, who had been mistress to both friends, was married at the time of her death to an immensely wealthy unlikable man.  Vernon and Clive reminisced over their old friend Molly and comforted themselves with the thought she had never even liked husband George, unworthy that he was.  But the bleak circumstances of Molly's death disturb the old friends with thoughts of their own mortality and cause them to enter into a peculiar pact.<br />McEwan's skill and craftsmanship make Clive and Vernon's thoughts and actions familiar to us, and the prose sparkles.  Yet both men seem tinder dry, unengaged and hollow.  Neither seemed more than his professional success; Clive an international composer---Vernon, a noted newspaper editor.  The friends have a bitter falling out, and the crux of the novel, whether their friendship will be strong enough to overcome their differences plays out like a Greek tragedy.  <br />On the down side, I never cared enough about either man to be more than academically interested in their rise and fall.  The small book (193 pages) almost demands to be read in one sitting, as it is one continuous arc.  Mr. McEwan doesn't fail in giving us a story, very well told, but I wished the vibrant Molly had not died before the tale began.<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2002-11-19

This freshens up a series that was running on fumes.  Lou's troubles (wife with cancer, guilt ridden affair with Daphne, job dissatisfaction) were taking on the proportions of Job and becoming tiresome.<br />A troubled young woman is tossed off the Aurora Bridge.  Lou is investigating the disappearance of two local women, one of whom is a personal friend and takes on a request from Mama Lu to investigate the \\"accidental\\" death of her cousin, Billy Chen.  Daphne is up to her elbows in charity work at a local woman's shelter and trying to turn the life of a pregnant client around.  All of these threads lead to the Seattle Underground, a city below the city, buried over more than 100 years ago.<br />Mr. Pearson excels on two levels: his characterizations are sharp and interesting.  Via Daphne, Pearson gives us an in-depth look at suspects Lanny Neal, Ferrell Walker, and Nathan Priar. He keeps them in our face, and they are always lurking (sometimes literally) at the edges of our thoughts.  Secondly, the locale.  Pearson is magnificent in putting us in Seattle; you feel you should be reading holding an umbrella. And then the underground---the decay, the sickening odors and terrain, the sense of claustrophobia, the occasional dusty shop window untouched in 100 years reflecting your surprised image, the very real sense of an imminent cave in, and LaMoia's comment that graveyards are over their heads.<br />This is an excellent read with a smash of a finale and Pearson ties up the threads as neatly as an expert tailor.  I could have done with a little less of Daphne's interior monologues.  Sometimes I wondered what she was doing besides being lost in thought while all this furious action was taking place.  Also feel the subplots of Margaret; Daphne's client, and Billy Chen were there strictly for plot purposes, not for their necessity to the story.  However, these are minor quibbles.  The gruesome level is fairly high, but manageable for all but the very faint hearted.  \\"The Art of Deception\\" is an excellent addition to Ridley Pearson's fine stories.<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2002-11-19

There is some of that but the main thrust is the Art of the Deal:  the chicanery, foolishness, cleverness and mind boggling intrigue of the fools, visionaries, and rascals who see the ownership of the Empire State Building as the jewel in their crown, the Nirvana of a real estate deal.<br />The Grand Old Lady is a bit worse for wear, only second tier desirability office rental space, lacking in security and a tad rat infested, but like a true Cleopatra, drives men mad with desire to own her.<br />Investigative journalist, Mitchell Pacelle, does a fine job unraveling the bizarre cast of characters who have tried to nail down ownership, particularly in the last dozen years.  Hideki Yokoi, an elderly disgraced Japanese billionaire designated his illegitimate daughter Kiiko to be his emissary and agent in the huge purchase.  Kiiko is either a dragon lady or a submissive flower of a daughter and wife to the mysterious James Bondian Jean-Paul Renoir, who is a great businessman, crook, or fall guy; take your pick.  You could never make fictional characters out of these people; no one would believe you.  <br />On the American front was real estate titan Lawrence Wien, who had a sweetheart 114-year lease on the building.  I treasured Mr. Wien because, though very rich, he seemed---well, normal.  Partners with Mr. Wien were Harry and the dreaded Leona Helmsley.  Multiply everything by ten you have read regarding the Queen of Mean, and you have Leona as she appears in this book.  Last but certainly not least, is Donald Trump, the one and only.  Donald, who never had one thin dime of his own money invested in the takeover caused merry havoc for over ten years.  I had to admire him for two reasons 1) he loathes Leona and never let an opportunity pass to rile and discomfit her, and 2) he structured such a deal, he might have ended up kingpin without a particle of risk on his part.<br />Mr. Pacelle does an excellent job of taking us through this maze of perfidity, and illustrates very well the spell cast by the wooing and winning the Empire State Building.  Well researched and a good read.  Recommended.	2002-11-17

Gary Giddins has presented us with a masterful biography of the musicology of Bing Crosby.  This volume is the early years through 1940, and it minutely follows Bing's evolving musicianship from his early days with the Rhythm Boys, through his early jazz days, to films and records.  The author critiques a staggering array of songs and arrangements.<br />What struck me early on was the instant recognition of Bing's ability by the big names as well as his peers. Though he was not a dependable, responsible youngster (early 20's), he still was instantly sought after.  His voice was so extraordinary; it paved the way for him.  I particularly enjoyed reading of his early days with Bix Beiderbecke and Frankie Trambauer, their escapades as well as their music.  In less than a year, Bing was well known in musical circles and played with Paul Whiteman (whose patience with Bing was saintly!).  There's no denying Bing was lucky as well as gifted.  Never have I read of a guy who was in the right place at the right time more than Bing.<br />Bing, apparently at the behest of wife Dixie, did a turnaround in attitude and consumption of alcohol (and probably marijuana as well) and became an incredibly hard working solid citizen. Alas, this left little or no time for his marriage and sons, for when Bing was not on the job, he was an obsessive golfer, outdoorsman, and competitor.  One thread that carries over everything he did was he didn't like to lose.  It is hard to comprehend just how one man could be as continually successful at whatever he turned his hand to.  His positives were he never forgot an old friend, his modesty, generosity, and delightful cool sense of humor.  His negatives were his total detachment, a dogged stubbornness and lack of forgiveness.  You never got a second chance with Crosby. <br />This is a remarkable biography.  It contains a discography, filmography, endnotes and index.  I admire Mr. Giddins' avoiding any trace of attempting to psychoanalyze his subject.  However, I wouldn't have minded an occasional opinion as to the \\"why\\" of some of Bing's actions, but Mr. Giddin's resolutely sticks with his Joe Friday persona.  The book is lengthy and requires close attention, but is well worth your while.<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2002-11-17

The plot is swift and spare and the story is not over-populated with characters.<br />Detective Inspector Tom Thorne is confronted with a serial killer whose aim is not to \\"kill\\" but render his victims powerless to move or speak, yet remain fully conscious.  So far, he has had one \\"success,\\" Allison Willetts, who is under the care of neurologist Anne Coburn.  Thorne becomes dead certain he has the killer identified, but has no proof.  Things become awkward indeed, when the suspect turns out to be a life-long friend of Dr. Coburn who Thorne is beginning to admire. An unusual literary device has each chapter beginning with the italicized thoughts of Allison, who cannot communicate.  You become increasingly fond of this brave and spirited girl with an offbeat sense of humor who is suffering this terrible misfortune.<br />I don't know if I have ever heard of a crime novelist getting his start as a stand-up comic, but Mr. Billingham makes the most of his background by supplying excellent dialogue:<br />\\"Thorne raised his eyebrows.  \\"Do women still get upset if you ask how old they are?\\" She plonked an elbow on the table and leaned her chin on the palm of her hand, trying her best to look severe.  \\"This one does.\\"<br />\\"Sorry\\" Thorne tried his best to look contrite.  \\"How much do you weigh?\\"<br />No matter how serious the rest of the book, I had to stop and laugh at the offbeat lines Mr. Billingham fed Thorne.  \\"Sleepyhead\\" is a fresh inventive debut with a satisfying twist worthy of a veteran.<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon.com Reviewer	2002-11-15

The feel of the desolate, huge Outback is with us every page.  Her sense of the country and the Aborigines is right up there with Bruce Chatwin's \\"Songlines.\\"  (yes, that good!). Ms. Carver's characterization of her lead character, India Kane, makes for fascinating reading.  India is strong, mysterious, but beautifully flawed.  And then there is the plot---to put it succinctly, it lacks continuity.  After a fine, tightly written prologue, we are plunged into the main story line wondering what, if anything, the prologue was meant to foreshadow.  <br />India Kane is to meet her best friend in the remote outback town of Cooinda.  Her car breaks down, and she receives a lift from a kind young man to her destination boarding house.  No friend greets her; she awakens the next morning only to be arrested by a policeman for the murder of the kind young man (who turns out to be a policeman) and her friend.  This is a cop from hell, someone who would make the worst of the LAPD look like pussycats.  That India has no motive and has never been in this town in her life doesn't seem to bother the detective in charge, nor is her lawyer too concerned with her rights.  A kindly Aboriginal policeman protects and shelters her.  He is a very well developed character who gets dropped inexplicably never to be heard from again.  And so it goes.  Sometimes, when I would turn a page, I was convinced I'd skipped a few pages (I had not) because there would be a great leap in time, action, and locale.<br />You think of Nevada Barr, who has her own problems with over busy plots, when you read some of Ms. Carver's excellent word pictures of the Outback.  I do think most readers will enjoy this debut effort in spite of the non-structured plot.  She clearly has verve, a sense of humor, and her own sometimes odd take on what makes a decent human being.  I am looking forward to further outings with India Kane.  3-1/2 stars.	2002-11-14

Disguises, dewy romance, and comic relief.  This is very early Christie (1925), and I think she let her girlish enthusiasm run away with her.  I noted Ms. Christie, who developed a weight problem as a young woman, worships at the altar of skinniness.  There are constant references to her heroines as being \\"gloriously slim.\\"  I couldn't help but smile.<br />A mysterious manuscript and a bundle of letters are the focus of frantic attention by the British Foreign Ministry and the tiny Balkan country of Herzoslovokia.  The stately English home, Chimneys, is the focus of where the agents, the intrigue, and the paperwork are supposed to arrive.  A weekend party is hastily arranged, and we meet the characters: the loopy Lord, madcap daughter called \\"Bundles\\" (shudder), a beautiful woman, mysterious handsome stranger, young English oaf, Balkan prince and his entourage including an Igor-like manservant of frightening loyalty, stuffy politicos of English and Balkan stripe, a perfect butler, an odious American, an equally odious financier, and the stalwart Scotland Yard types. The prince is done away with in a mysterious manner.  How anything could be \\"mysterious\\" at Chimneys amazes me because there was such a large cast, I would think no one had enough privacy to paint their fingernails, let alone murder someone.  Much hiding behind doors, in bushes, and behind curtains ensues.  The murderer is unveiled and a magnificently improbable finale marks the fall of the curtain.<br />This is definitely one of Dame Agatha's lesser efforts.  Her anti-semitism is particularly grating when she tries to put a humorous aspect upon it.  The mystery is intricate, but by the time it is explained, I really didn't care that much.  I would recommend giving \\"Chimneys\\" a pass.	2002-11-05

In spite of her advantages of good health, education, a car, and a fund to supply her with a deposit on a rental; she needed to work two jobs, seven days a week to barely survive.<br />Two points that struck me over and over were 1) no matter where you go, there is NO affordable housing and 2) during possibly the most prosperous decade in the century, wages never increased on the lower end of the job scale (fast food, retail clerking, waitressing, house cleaning).  Though at almost every Wendy's and Wal-Mart across the country, there are big &quot;Help Wanted&quot; signs, the wages are and remain at a flat six to seven dollars an hour. <br />The author does an excellent job of describing her various job duties, many of them far more complex than you would ever dream, and humanizing her fellow workers and her interactions with them.  The crunch for many people is the inability to put up a rental deposit plus the first month's rent for a place to live.  The practice of the large chains and fast food industry of deferring the first week's pay for a week or ten days is frequently devastating. Advising people to cook up a big stew and make their own bread to cut food expenses is quite beside the point when they have nowhere to cook.  Ms. Ehrenreich points out general health is poor because they rarely have health insurance and cannot afford to take any time off for illness.  The work is usually strenuous, and bad backs and pulled muscles are endemic.<br />The author has a built-in bias against people who do not clean their own houses.  Her trials and tribulations as a housecleaner are sometimes unintentionally funny, but the grueling work and the indignities suffered are very real.  Her solutions are breathtaking in scope and possibly too sweeping to have a chance of fulfillment. However, the ever-increasing disparity between &quot;working poor&quot; and &quot;lower-middle class&quot; must be addressed and acted upon soon before we have a huge transient peasant class always on the verge of homelessness.<br />The next time you drive by a beautifully &quot;gentrified&quot; section of your town, ask yourself &quot;where did the poor people go?&quot; And keep in mind, that person &quot;flipping burgers at Mickey D's&quot; is working long, grueling hours on their feet for very little pay.   &quot;Nickel and Dimed&quot; is highly readable.  It may make you uncomfortable, but it is well worth the time.	2002-11-05

Chris Bacon gets back to his pharmaceutical lab in Cambridge MA in no time.  He is testing the properties of an exotic flower that might have some usefulness in extending life.<br />Come again?  Eternal youth?  Not exactly.  You see, animals don't die; their cells lose the ability to replicate, then it is curtains.  This wonder drug seems to enhance the cell's longevity.  Chris is carefully and secretly experimenting first with rats and then with monkeys.  He is at the breakthrough point when the word gets out to his employers and some really bad underworld types.  Chris packs up his family and runs, but not before he is framed for murder and terrorism.<br />Chris's character arc is improbable.  He begins by being a rather vain, workaholic with an abnormal fear of contracting Alzheimer's disease like his father. In a drunken moment, he takes the drug and, in a well-written and described sequence, is shown over a period of six weeks becoming a young man at the peak of his powers.  His clever plans and improvisions to remain hidden make for fascinating reading.  But his character evolves into an almost Christ-like figure of understanding and sacrifice. This spiritual person bears little resemblance to the Chris in the earlier part of the novel. The reader can accept the physical changes, but the underlying character turnaround is not believable.<br />The author does a good job examining the ethics of such a drug and its implications.  Some have criticized the shallowness of the discussion, but I believe in a novel of this type, profundities are not in order. I have the advantage (disadvantage?) of reading Mr. Braver's second novel \\"Gray Matter\\" before I read this one.  I think he grows in maturity and some of the loose threads and improbabilities evident in \\"Elixir\\" are absent in the stronger second novel.<br />\\"Elixir\\" has a pace like lightning, and is a most satisfactory read.  It may even make you think some after it is over.	2002-11-03

The author toys with us in this complex novel.  The reader spends two-thirds of the book not mulling over what has happened, but what is going to happen.<br />New owners of beautiful Wyvis Hall uncover human bones in the pet cemetery on the grounds of the estate.  This sets in motion events which have been hidden for the past eleven years.  The story goes back and forth from the present to the fateful summer of 1976.  The tale is told from the viewpoints of Adam, Rufus and Shiva.  Adam earns his father's undying enmity by inheriting his great-uncle's estate Wyvis Hall when he is 19.  Adam with casual friend, Rufus drives down from London just intending to have a look at the property and going on for holidays in Greece.  The estate works its magic on the young men and their stay extends to the entire summer.  They sell off items in the house to keep themselves in money, drink quantities of wine, laze about and keep the world at bay.  The party enlarges to include Zosie, a fey childlike homeless girl, Shiva, a highly proper Indian and his companion, the mystic Vivienne.<br />The reader knows something is going to happen this summer because of the prologue when the bones are discovered.  But what?  We know the event has had a profound effect upon Adam and Shiva that has entirely changed their lives.  Rufus seems to have escaped unscathed and is living according to his original plan.  None of the characters are particularly likable, let alone lovable.  We don't connect with them, but do feel this terrible unease as the tale unfolds. The buildup is masterful, the horror is cataclysmic and the epilogue is chilling.  Contrary to a few of the reviews posted here, this book does not have a &quot;happy&quot; ending at all.<br />Ms. Vine/Rendell deserves all the prizes she received for this craftily constructed novel.  Some of the issues touched upon are profound; yet we are never allowed to be sidetracked into a case of the existential vapors. Recommended.	2002-11-03

As usual, Dame Agatha has her way with us, sending us off in the wrong direction, maddeningly obscure clues, and a thoroughly suspicious bunch of characters.<br />Roger Abernethie's heirs are gathered to hear the will when flighty sister Cora drops the bombshell, \\"He Was murdered, wasn't he?\\" The next day Cora is found axed to death in her little cottage. We have a raft of suspects and Ms. Christie is careful not to give any of them a satisfactory alibi.<br />\\"After the Funeral\\" is vintage Christie.  She was at the height of her powers (1953).  The characterizations were surprisingly deft (usually not her strong suit.) Uncle Timothy, the malingerer, was overdone, but George, the clever ne'er do well had some great malicious lines.  She has a marvelous sketch of a private detective, Mr. Goby who was \\"--small and spare and shrunken.  He had always been refreshingly nondescript in appearance and he was now so nondescript as practically not to be there at all.  Mr. Goby was not looking at Mr. Poirot because Mr. Goby never looked at anybody----he emphasized his last point by nodding significantly at the sofa.\\"<br />This slyly humorous well done mystery was a pleasure to read.

As a mystery fan, rather than a science fiction \\"crossover\\" reader, the abrupt introduction to protagonist Mick Axbrewder was a shock.  I felt I'd been dropped into the den of a wounded bear---a bear with nerves that were frayed years before I ever met him.  His keeper is a lady named Ginny that he loves, hates, scorns and reveres.  Apparently, she is fed-up-to-here with Brew.  He is fearful of existing without her drive and leadership, but resentful that he needs both.<br />Brew is on the lam in a strange city that might or might not be Phoenix (pet peeve: when authors anoint major cities with pseudonyms a la Ed McBain, Scott Turow and Richard North Patterson). He finds work on a hotel security force that needs extra help to host a martial arts conference that is going to display some Chinese antiquities consisting of tiles (called \\"chops\\") and if authentic, are priceless.  During the tournament, Brew's employer is murdered and Brew is up to his earlobes in Asian martial arts intrigue.<br />The martial arts lore is fascinating.  I understand the author is an advanced student of Shotokan, and I certainly believe it; the tournament and comments made have a fine air of authenticity.  He goes into detail about the manners, honor and spirituality of these disciplines---some of which are hard for a Western reader to fathom.  This back story is a good reason to buy the book, even if you don't care much about the rest of it.<br />Though I got over my initial alarm in meeting Brew, I ended up being mainly annoyed with him.  He is so self-involved, he frequently cannot see beyond the end of his nose.  He is one of these over-the-top people who, if stuck with a pin, will roar with dismay insisting he has been skewered with a sword ---- and then tell you about it in excruciating detail.  He spent pages and pages trying to explain how his brain worked vis a vis his famous \\"intuition.\\"  I never was a whit the wiser, but he clearly enjoyed the telling!  I cannot think of one major Sunbelt city where average wintertime temperatures would continually threaten anyone but our fragile Brew with imminent sunstroke and heat exhaustion.<br />The author gives away the mystery about one-third of the way through, but there is good action throughout.  There is a fine scene that takes place in a notorious Fight Club.  His descriptions of subtle interchanges between characters are good. My biggest complaint is I wish Mr. Donaldson had provided us with another guest of honor.  Five stars for the martial arts and story description, knocked down to three because Brew is our narrator.	2002-10-30

Allow yourself an hour or so to eat and sleep; nothing else will distract you from this biotech/medical thriller.<br />In this day and age of funneling affluent children from birth into the \\"right\\" preschool, prep school and college; is it unthinkable to want to \\"enhance\\" Johnny's all-to-average I.Q.?  I find this most believable when we have platoons of small children robotically marching from ballet to play dates (a term I particularly despise) to tutorial groups to soccer practice.  Many need an appointment secretary just to march in place.<br />The Whitmans are an upwardly mobile dream couple, wealthy, handsome and living in one of Boston's most desirable suburbs.  The only cloud on their horizon is son Dylan's Learning Disability.  Dylan is a happy six-year old with a wonderful ability to sing and memorize show tunes (with gestures).  He is an outgoing, gentle, loving little boy, but let's face it, an I.Q. of 83.  He is behind other children in his cognitive abilities and grasp of abstract concepts.  His days of the week are Monday, Twosday, Threesday, etc.  <br />The Whitmans are distressed and want the best for their son.  By clandestine word of mouth, they hear of the possible \\"enhancement\\" of mental abilities, even doubling of I.Q.s from a friend who has an irritatingly bright daughter.  Meanwhile in a parallel story an obsessed cop has been searching for three years for the identity of a dead child.  All he has to go on is a skull with a series of small drilled holes in it. We meet a few of these \\"enhanced\\" children, and they are as advertised: brilliant.  But all seem to suffer side effects of loss of affect or compulsive behavior.  As the Whitmans get closer to accepting the expensive procedure, the more sinister the situation becomes.  The parents become divided on what is best to do.  Some of the other parents are in heartbreakingsituations.<br />Mr. Braver is skillful in his plotting, notching up the tension incrementally.  He has a graceful way of bringing his characters to life.  Dylan is a truly fetching little boy and becomes compellingly important to the reader.  This novel delivers and will make you think.  Be prepared to count off at least a few people you know right in your own backyard that might see \\"enhancement\\" as a very good thing indeed.<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2002-10-24

Wodehouse type lark were Bertie Wooster & Jeeves.  Val McDermid contributed an impassioned introduction on the proper appreciation of Dame Agatha's myriad talents.  In my case, Ms. McDermid was preaching to the choir. <br />Idle rich young folk are houseguests at country house Chimneys (revisited-see: \\"The Secret of Chimneys\\") that is being rented by noveau riche Lord Cootes for the summer.  The young men at the party, though uniformly dense, have reasonable names.  The young ladies, dashing and beautiful, are called \\"Bundles\\" and \\"Socks\\" for no particularly good reason except perhaps to annoy the reader.  These madcaps play a joke involving multitudes of alarm clocks on one of their sleepy headed fellows, and the joke turns sour when the young man is found dead in his bed.<br />Superintendent Battles is the voice of calm and reason here, but the sleuths are the young people.  They roar around in roadsters, take fearful risks and generally have a fine time.  The plot is intricate, the red herrings clever and misleading.  As usual, Ms. Christie offers up a total surprise at the end.<br />I agree with Ms. McDermid that AC has a particularly sly sense of humor.  The larger-than-life trivial and shallow aspects of the characters are meant to amuse, but sometimes grate.  However, in honor of splendid plotting and excellent misdirection, \\"The Seven Dials Mystery\\" certainly deserves a B.<BR>-sweetmolly- Amazon Reviewer	2002-10-23

Harlan Coben showcases many of his dazzling strengths in \\"Gone for Good.\\"  Dead-on dialogues,  tenderness that never turns mawkish, quick cuts, oddball characters and parental love are all displayed in abundance in this whirlwind thriller.<br />Will is a dubious sleuth.  He is naïve, credulous, and not the bravest boy on the planet.  Fortunately for him, his best friend, a former neo-Nazi who has blossomed into a fantastically successful yoga master, partners him.  The FBI (rough, tough and mean in this outing), plus two deadly high school friends of Ken quickly take an interest in his search.  It seems Will's fiancée had some connection with brother Ken, but what we do not know.  After three chilling murders, a few walks on the wild side, every piece of knowledge Will acquires is designed to throw him in deeper confusion despair.<br />In a sense, Mr. Coban does not play fair with the reader.  We need more character development to accept some of his incredible turnarounds as to why who is doing what.  To say I was surprised  at the final scene would be an understatement; I was astonished!  Unlike some writers, the author attempts to tie up the loose ends.  However, a few of his major characters were left in the land of surmise.	2002-10-23

Many of his books contained a spirit of mischief, glee and a lot of \\"gotchas!\\"  \\"Buick 8\\" is a mature work, sadder and wiser, nostalgic and uncertain of the certainties.  The big answer is: there is no answer.<br />Pennsylvania State Police, Troop D towed an abandoned car to their headquarters in 1979.  Its driver had stopped for gas and disappeared. The squad discovered the car repelled dirt and self-repaired scratches, and its tire treads would not even hold a pebble. Sgt. Sandy Dearborn decides the \\"car\\" (\\"because you have to call it something\\") merits further investigation and stores it in the barracks unused Shed B---and there it remains for the next thirty years, with only Troop D aware of just how strange this thing is.<br />In the present, a grieving son of Trooper Wilcox (who had brought the car in) is trying to get closure on his father's sudden death by vehicular homicide.  Ned helps out around the barracks and is given temporary duty during his summer before college.  He wants to know the story of the Buick.  The sergeant and troopers decide to tell him---of the \\"lightquakes\\" (a Stephen King word if I ever heard one!), the strange and disgusting creatures the car would bring forth, the disappearing of Trooper Ennis and the glimpses of alternate universes.  Different troopers tell the story, Sandy taking the lead.  Sandy emphasizes that the \\"goings-on\\" were intermittent, not a daily thing, and weeks and months would go by with nothing happening at all.  Troop D would almost forget the Buick.  Ned is an impatient listener and his interest in the car becomes compulsive.<br />The 1979 references were so nostalgic and ephemeral, I felt we were talking about 100 years ago rather than thirty.  I had a slight aggravation with the esprit de corps of Troop D.  Not just Sandy, but all of them seemed to have no life outside of the State Troopers.  Their loyalty was first and foremost to the Troop, then the State Police, and way down on the list: family, friends and outside interests.  When they were off-duty, they gathered at the barracks; they even slept and ate there.<br />King's emphasis that day-to-day life frequently transcends the wonder of the supernatural in Shed B was hard on the pace of the story.  If Troop D can forget for months at a time, so can the reader. It is true that we cannot constantly and obsessively be aware of our own mortality and where we fit in the universe, but we do need the focus for King's story to have maximum impact. \\"Buick 8\\" was not meant to be presented as a leisurely told tale spread over many years. I think it would have worked better as a novella.<br />I would call \\"From a Buick 8\\" medium-King.  A race to the bookstore for all diehard Kings fans (me); others might want to wait for the paperback.<BR>-sweetmolly- Amazon Reviewer	2002-10-23

I had become a bit tired of Lou Boldt and Daphne's clenched teeth platonic relationship, and looked forward to some new characters.  I looked in the wrong direction.  The plot and the modern day railroad lore are excellent, if a bit too technical at times.  The characters are preposterous.<br />Peter Tyler is a down and out ex-homicide cop with an anxiety disorder that presents as acute claustrophobia. He is fired, in disgrace and facing a civil suit for excessive force against a black child beater.  Somehow these qualifications get him temporary employment with the National Transportation Board to investigate a possible homicide involving a major railroad line. In a side-by-side story line, Umberto Alverez is seeking revenge against the railroad company for what he sees as negligence and cover-up in the crossing deaths of his wife and twin daughters.  The chase and the chased gradually draw closer and closer together until Tyler and Alverez have a symbiotic relationship.  <br />Reading about the trains was excellent stuff, interesting (hobos aren't \\"hobos\\" anymore, they are \\"riders\\") and informative.  The action was fast paced.  But the character's actions and motivations were like a James Bond movie gone bad.  A beautiful, ambitious female executive becomes an informer on her own company because she may or may not have an itch for a scruffy, delusional ex-cop.  Another fast living cocktail waitress who had a crush on Umberto when she was twelve behaves like a combination of Joan of Arc and whistle blower to save Umberto from --- what? An intelligent, highly placed government administrator misuses government authority against the railroad company because--he is in a pout?<br />There is a lot to like about \\"Parallel Lies\\" if you can just shut your eyes to why anyone is doing anything.  The author has clearly done a lot of research on railroads, and the writing is vivid and clear.  The enjoyment outweighs the frustration, but not by much.	2002-10-14

Joe Sheer, a fine old man, retired safecracker (jugger), has been Parker's contact man for years.  Parker receives a disquieting letter from Joe and wonders if he is getting a little old for the job.  Parker decides to pay him a visit, not to present a gold watch, but perhaps to help Joe along to his eternal rest.  The usually overly careful Parker flies to Sagamore, Nebraska to have a hands-on visit with Joe using his clean-as-a whistle alias, Charles Willis.<br />Picture Smalltown U.S.A.  Friendly folks, picket fences, nicely clipped lawns, tree shaded lots, porch swings, and you have Sagamore.  Now picture deadly purposeful Parker strolling down the sidewalks. Neither one of them are quite ready for the other.  Alas for Parker, there is no heist this time, Joe is already dead, and the local and state police are taking far too much interest in Charles Willis.  Parker has to put his superb planning abilities in high gear to settle the natives, and solve the mystery of Joe's alleged buried fortune.  Parker's sole interest in this is to get Charles Willis back to Miami unknown and uninvestigated.<br />This is a fine Parker outing where Parker is the only one in Sagamore with good sense, and with much exasperation has to lead the law to the truth.  To get the job done, a few homicides happen, and a left over lady with \\"the eyes of a pickpocket and the mouth of a whore\\" helps him out.  \\"The Jugger\\" is best read after you have read a couple other Parker novels for background.  For all other Parker aficionados, this is choice.	2002-10-14

He can no more remove himself than the spindly trees that grow, if not thrive, in the neighborhood.  A Dominican man is found stabbed ... half in and half out of the putrid, polluted Gowanus canal.  Hardened Detective Leightner almost faints at the sight of the cruel stab wounds.  He is unbearably affected by this crime and pursues it long after his superiors want to put it in the unsolved file.  As much as a mystery, \\"Red Hook\\" is the story of Jack's searching for redemption or at least self-acceptance.  He has become a total outsider, but obviously a likeable man as many people reach out to him.  Why do the stab wounds so profoundly affect Jack?  What makes him totally reject his formative years in Red Hook?  Why cannot he connect with his grown son?  What happened to his younger brother who died at age thirteen?  As another reviewer commented, all great books are mysteries, and \\"Red Hook\\" fills the bill.  <br />In spite of the books introspection, it has a quick pace and a thunderous climax that literally left me limp.  \\"Red Hook\\" works on many levels; the exquisite descriptions of light upon leaves and rusted out rubble, Jack as an existential man, and a thumping good police procedural.  I hope to see more from this talented author.	2002-10-13

Though the novella has some creaky spots, I can see what a fun play it would be: people running in and out of rooms, doors slamming, and strange noises in the distance.  The story wears fairly well, the motivation a little weak, but a nice zinger at the end.<br />The other stories are for the most part well chosen; \\"The Case of the Perfect Maid\\" is positively elegant with not even a murder involved.  The construction is tight and Ms. Marple is a joy.  Ms. Christie shows how a romance/mystery should be done in \\"The Case of the Caretaker.\\" The reader gets a lovely romance, but we are never quite certain if love or avarice rules.  Interestingly, Miss Marple works better in the short stories than does Hercule Poirot.  I believe it is because Hercule takes some developing before we can take him seriously.  \\"Four and Twenty Blackbirds,\\" though it is one of Christie's more acclaimed short stories, did not strike my fancy.  The plot is intricate, the method far-fetched, and I was not convinced.  \\"The Love Detectives\\" features both Poirot and Mr. Harley Quin who Dame Agatha brings into play when things are going to get supernatural.  Quin and Poirot make quite a crowd on the stage, and as I don't share Ms. C's fascination for the occult, I didn't much care for the story.<br />This selection has something for everyone, so you will probably find a few stories that suit you right down to the ground and a few more that will be entertaining.  After being confronted with nine in a row of Ms. Christie's fearfully clever plots, I can't help but heave a sigh of relief that she decided to be a mystery writer rather than a con artist.  She would have sheared us like sheep.<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2002-10-11

The idea that a contemporary thriller would share top billing with metaphysical poet and Dean of St. Paul's, John Donne (1572-1631) is a haughty premise I could not resist.<br />Mr. O'Connor delivered and then some.  This highly original story provides seemingly ordinary characters with traits that send them into an orbit that can only be called bizarre.  Our chief detective, John Underwood, is overworked, underpaid, and his marriage is disintegrating.  Sound familiar?  Not quite.  John becomes so overwhelmed with his wife's leave-taking, he disintegrates before our eyes.  While detecting, he becomes carried away by fantasies of revenge and mayhem.  For one, I become highly nervous when serial killers are running about, and our protagonist has a complete mental and physical breakdown.  When John is taken out of the picture, we are left to the mercies of his second in command Det. Sgt. Alison Dexter, an ambitious lady who has worked hard to come up in the ranks.  Again, a familiar character in crime fiction except DS Dexter is so ambitious, she plots and connives against all who might take a shred of credit from her. Her assistants despise her in spite of her cleverness and bravery.<br />The strange killer who removes the left eye of his victims also leaves scraps of poetry written in blood at the scene of the crime.  The killer clearly means this poetry to serve as a clue to his motive.  He notifies a medieval expert at nearby Cambridge in case the obscurity is too much for the local police.  Enter a rather annoying gorgeous lady who is a Donne expert.  Many people (self included) enjoy Donne's poetry because it brawny, frank and robust.  This is the man who gave us such lines as: <br />&quot;Busy old fool, unruly Sun<BR>Why dost thou thus,<BR>Through windows, and through curtains call on <BR>us?&quot;<br />and &quot;For God sake hold your tongue, and let me love.&quot; <br />In the author'shands, the &quot;conceits&quot; and kernels of Donne's love poems are so convoluted and ephemeral, I was lost.  I had to have the professor who I didn't like very well lead me by the hand to all the clever conclusions.<br />However, the pace is good and the trip worthwhile if a little abrupt at the conclusion.  I look forward to more books by the clever Mr. O'Connor.	2002-10-10

It is interesting to see what type of girl (Ann Beddelfield) is Dame Agatha's ideal:  well born, raised by her academic father but not devoted to him, beautiful and aware of it, uses her many charms to get her way, intelligent but wildly impractical, idealistic, adventurous and believes in that knight in shining armor will come and carry her away.<br />Ann is deeply afraid she will end up in a rut forever as an underpaid secretary only to marry a ho-hum businessman and while away her life.  Her father's meager inheritance, 87 pounds, even in 1924 money, will not see her far. She impulsively buys a ticket to South Africa that costs exactly 87 pounds, hoping for adventure.  The subsequent story exceeds her wildest dreams with mysterious deaths, kidnapping, diamonds and Russian ballet dancers.<br />Miss Christie has some excellent descriptive scenes of South Africa.  It is clear the author is in love with the landscape, the mystery and the vivid life of the area.  I never quite got in the spirit of the \\"adventure,\\" as I worried incessantly (seeing as Ann would not) over what she was going to use for money once she stepped off the boat.  The book does not contain a master sleuth, so it is not a case of one grand mystery, but a series of small mysteries solved as you go.  There were so many subplots, I lost all sight of the main purpose, but was agreeable if confused.<br />\\"The Man in the Brown Suit\\" is a departure for Christie, one I'm glad she did not make too often.  However, it is a good natured, high-spirited romp, and I am sure she had a grand time writing it. 3-1/2 stars.<BR>-sweetmolly- Amazon Reviewer	2002-10-10

Cantankerous, blunt but sly Dolores has lived a long hard life.  She is neither good nor bad, but has a fierce will and love for her family and a willingness to fight any and every battle to protect them.<br />The story is a taped interview with the police who suspect Dolores of killing her elderly employer, Vera Donovan, for whom Dolores has served as a housekeeper for over 40 years.  Dolores thinks she must confess that she killed her husband Joe over 30 years ago to explain why she could not have killed her employer.  As the story rolls, you are fascinated with the interplay between Dolores and Vera.  Vera is a match for Dolores, equally strong minded and diverse. (Dolores is convinced Vera went senile just to aggravate her.)  Her story of her marriage to the vile drunken Joe and her stealthy plans to kill him are riveting.  Dolores can't remember any reason she married him except he had a \\"smooth, clear forehead.\\"  She is stealthy, not because she fears any person on this earth; she just wants to spare her children the knowledge that she killed their father. Nothing goes quite according to plan, and even powerful Dolores suffers long periods of mental exhaustion.<br />\\"Delores Claiborne\\" without monsters or the supernatural and told in an uneducated but perceptive, voice is brilliant.  This is one of Stephen King's finest works and well worth the read. <BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2002-10-10

Greg Iles, never-fail creator of hair-raising suspense, has succeeded again in this tale of not-so-subtle reincarnation.  The problem is the reader is left high and dry.  I actually started reading the Acknowledgements thinking it must be the last chapter!<br />John Waters is sucked into a clandestine affair with Eve Summers, a realtor who seems to have uncanny knowledge and mannerisms of John's first love, the sensuous Mallory Candler who has been dead for ten years. Only John knows that under Mallory's (Miss Mississippi 1982) charm and beauty lays a tortured borderline personality who is evilly possessive.  John comes to realize Eve is not trying to trick him; she has become possessed by Mallory's soul/spirit.  In an ever-widening swath of terror, murder and madness; John's family and friends are drawn into his downward spiral.<br />Once you are hooked, you will be flipping pages fast enough to create a whirlwind as Mr. Iles works his wonders on your curiosity.  I give him five stars for the great suspense, but take away two for an ending that leaves his characters wondering and waiting.<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2002-10-10

I expected Ignatius J. Reilly to leap off the page at me.  I wasn't disappointed.   On the first page, outside a staid department store in New Orleans, Ignatius in his usual grotesque costume of green hunting camp and too small flannel shirt is awaiting his mother innocently enough until a policeman decides he is a vagrant and tries to arrest him.  A crowd is quickly engaged by his steaming objections and loud protestations.  Ignatius is at his best when hollering for help.  When his weary mother makes an appearance, \\"Mother!\\" he called \\"Not a moment too soon.  I've been seized.\\"<br />We quickly meet friends and denizens not quite on the underside of New Orleans, but leaning that way.  Ignatius is a force of nature that needs to be fed, nurtured, and kept on course not only by his long-suffering mother, but any citizen who happens to cross his path.  If Ignatius is left to his own devices, he is like a loose pinball, except a pinball never screams for help.<br />Ignatius, who is the epitome of pseudo independence and ingratitude, actually is fearful of being left alone.  When his mother, for the first time in living memory, decides to have a night out, Ignatius is piteous, \\"I shall probably be misused by some intruder!\\" he screamed.<br />For the first third of the book, I was highly indignant at Ignatius: his selfishness, his arrogance and his ingratitude.  Gradually, I became fond of him and then fearful for him.  He is underscored with tragedy; he has a vision of a world not of his making and it threatens him.  Somehow Mr. Toole gathers up all the threads and the end is not chaos as I feared, but everyone seems to get just what they deserve.  I was pleased, and I think you will be too.<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer	2002-10-10

Sweeney would make Hecht &amp; McArthur's &quot;Front Page&quot; newspapermen look like weenies.  Sweeney doesn't just occasionally drink too much; he binges out and spends weeks in the gutter, broke, filthy, and homeless.  When Sweeney sobers up (just moderately), he is such a star reporter, his employer's leap to cater to his every whim.  Like Wow!<br />In this 40's era Chicago-noir, Sweeney,while in a nearly comatose binge, witnesses a strange crime site through a plate glass door.  A woman (is she dead?) is sprawled on the floor with a fearsome, slavering dog guarding her.  No one can get by the dog to see what is wrong.  The woman slowly rises, and drops her gown in a spectacular manner.  Sweeney decides then and there 1) this is the most beautiful woman in the world and 2) he, Sweeney the Magnificent, will spend a night with her. And anything he wants badly enough, he gets. <br />Though Sweeney is a little uncertain if what he witnessed was an alcohol-induced hallucination, he finds out quickly it was the real thing.  The police think The Ripper, who has terrorized Chicago with three victims, has made an abortive attack on the lady, but her dog saved her.  She is an at-risk witness who might be in further danger.  Sweeney intends to solve the crimes and get the girl.<br />Frederic Brown is an edgy writer with a razor sharp sense of humor.  When Sweeney theorizes, we don't know if he is putting us on or himself. Mr. Brown is concise and sardonic with a crafty throwaway style.  He leaves us always slightly off-balance, and then walks away.  Take it, or leave it.  Most readers will take it and line up for more.	2002-10-03

Ms. McCloy has some good ideas that are poorly developed.<br />Adored wife, newly pregnant Marina awakens in a hospital after a car accident.  A sinister psychiatrist tells her she has amnesia from a head injury, is not pregnant, and she may not see her husband. She attempts to escape, but finally manages to be discharged when her husband picks her up---only he is not her husband.<br />As quickly as Ms. McCloy piques the reader's interest, she damps it down by a too ready explanation.  The pseudo-husband is unmasked too quickly, we are not left to wonder about the real one for any length of time.  The crux of the mystery (why is this happening?) is explained in detail early on when it should be left for the end of the book. The author has an interest in cryptanalysis that either should be better explained or left out all together. <BR> <BR>The saving grace of this slim (180 pages) novel is Marina.  She is an interesting combination of devoted and romantic bride, fearless aggressive adventurer, and remarkably intelligent woman.<br />&quot;The Imposter&quot; is like the magician who shows you all his tricks halfway through the show.	2002-10-03

This is all to the good because Dame Agatha is the master of the country house with endless servants hovering about doing tiny tasks.  Her one nod to modern times is a shortage of gardeners.<br />Crime writer Ariadne Oliver calls upon her friend, Hercule Poirot.  She has been hired to provide a Mystery Hunt at Sir George Stubbs' annual Fete.  She has a &quot;hunch&quot; that all is not well.  Ms. Oliver is prescient; her mock &quot;victim&quot; turns into a real one.  There is no shortage of suspects, but Poirot and the authorities are baffled.<br />Ms. Christie rains clues as big as rocks along with her usual red herrings.  The problem for the astute reader is not who (though Ms. Christie conceals the murderer with her usual adroitness), but how and why.  &quot;Dead Man's Folly&quot; is a very busy book, and the scattered presence of Ariadne Oliver (one of my least favorite continuing characters) is perhaps one distraction too many. Subtract one star for overdone motivation, and another one-half for Ms. Oliver's constant dithering. Rating:  3-1/2 stars.	2002-10-03

Miss McGillicuddy, while riding the entitled train, saw a woman being strangled on a train running parallel to her own.<br />Miss McG. reports this shocking occurrence to her hostess Miss Marple, the police and the train authorities.  No body is found, and the authorities chalk up the report to an elderly lady's vivid imagination.  But Miss Marple knows that one thing rock-solid Elspeth McGillicuddy lacks is a \\"vivid imagination.\\"  If Miss McG says she saw a murder, Miss Marple is certain a murder did, in fact, take place.  Her curiosity aroused, Miss Marple enlists the aid of young Lucy Eyelesbarrow.  Lucy is a delightful character who combines fearsome organizational abilities with all consuming charm and tact.  In a fine bit of sleuthing, Miss Marple ascertains the only area where the body could have been dumped from the train is on the Crackenthorpe (don't you just love these names?) estate, Rutherford Hall. <br />Lucy gets herself hired at Rutherford to find out about the people, and hopefully locate the body.  The head Crackenthorpe is the old, miserly father who enjoys his poor health and depriving his grown children with equal enthusiasm. The family consists of his martyred spinster daughter, three sons, a son-in-law and a grandnephew schoolboy.  Clever Lucy finds the body residing in a sarcophagus in a falling down barn on the property. The murderer would have to be very familiar with Rutherford Hall and its environs to have found such a resting place.  None of the family has much of an alibi, but though they all have excellent motives for wanting to do away with their skinflint father, it appears none have any ties to the stranger hidden in their barn.<br />The author displays a great deal of sly humor in the book, and her descriptions of the days and ways at Rutherford Hall are fascinating. Ihad a little difficulty believing this class conscious family would immediately accept Lucy as an equal and confidante, but I never let the small things bother me in a Christie book.  The plot was delightfully intricate.  For once, I thought I had pegged the murderer, but Dame Agatha triumphed yet again, and I was foiled.  That the motive was a bit thin and barely acceptable is my only complaint. It is a fine Christie effort, not her best, but very much up to her standard of excellence.	2002-09-30

I planned to read it a story at a time over a period of weeks, but as usual got hooked on King and read it straight through, right from his usual folksy introduction (each of which I am sure he writes solely for me!) to the charming little moral folktale tacked on at the end.  The stories are to say the least, diverse.  I would call this collection \\"King's Scrapbook.\\"<br />\\"Dolan's Cadillac\\" highly regarded by most Amazon reviewers is very hard tech for King.  Interestingly, he says in his notes that technical stuff bores him, but it had to be done for this story.  I have no more interest than he does in the proper \\"arc of descent;\\" I would have been just as mindlessly satisfied if he had shot the Cadillac out of a cannon, so it's not one of my favorites.<br />\\"Clattery Teeth\\" I just know SK had a hoot of a time writing it.  He lovingly sets the scene and characters and then puts them at the mercy of a set of not-so-funny joke teeth (that wear spats). It's 80 degrees more grotesque than the \\"Young Frankenstein,\\" and I felt guilty for laughing.<br />\\"The Moving Finger\\" Mr. Mitla is the perfectly normal man living a perfectly normal life when one morning he goes into his bathroom, and a finger is emerging from his bathroom sink drain and tapping on the porcelain.  No one can see this finger except Mr. Mitla, and he slowly goes bonkers and his entire life is in a shambles.  Unlike \\"Clattery Teeth\\" this one is terrifying.  See for yourself.<br />\\"My Pretty Pony\\" though highly acclaimed, didn't much interest me UNTIL I read in Notes that the exquisitely sensitive little boy, Clive Banning, grew up to be a hardened killer in an unpublished Richard Bachman novel.  We leave Clive at 7-years old in the Pony story.<br />\\"The House on Maple Street\\" delighted me because children are empowered and the bad guy gets his just desserts in a most explosive fashion.  I was all-around satisfied.<br />\\"Umley's Last Case\\" is my favorite. SK takes a spin in Raymond Chandler land.  He sets the scene meticulously and the characters are perfect.  I was reminded of Nathaniel West's \\"Day of the Locust.\\"  Then things start going askew in a very King-like way.  What if the author of P.I. books decided he liked the detective's life better than his own, and decided to swap places? What would happen?  Would it be too far out if the detective who has never lived outside a book set in the 1930's had to spend a week toilet training himself? (Characters in hard-boiled novels never have to go to the bathroom.) <br />There are 20 stories in \\"Nightmares & Dreamscapes.\\"  It is not as brilliantly crafted as \\"Everything's Eventual\\" nor is it as well organized as \\"Skeleton Crew\\" and \\"Night Shift.\\"  I don't think many readers will like ALL of the stories, but there are such a variety, that most of the readers will like SOME of the stories, and some will like MOST of the stories.  Chances are everyone will find one or two that will stay with them forever.	2002-09-28

The characters are etched like diamonds, but I never figured out what or who was directing the dance.  \\"Dancing Bear\\" is 228 pages long.  On page 221, Milodragovitch says \\"Hell lady, I'm still not real sure what this was all about.\\" Milo's comment made me feel marginally better.  How could I be expected to know when the hero didn't?<br />Milo obtains a break from his security job to take a well paying case from a wealthy elderly lady who seems to want nothing more than to find out what her neighbors are up to.  It quickly transpires the \\"neighbors\\" are up to deadly games.  Milo's new allies are over-interested in his inherited 3,000 acres of prime land, and one is the type of environmentalist we all love to hate.  She is the Aquarian kind who has her eyes so firmly fixed on the \\"big\\" picture that she neither notices nor cares about the devastation she is wreaking while straining for her goal. Another ally is out to prove no man can ever resist her charms; all she has to do is put her mind to it.  And these are his friends!  You ought to see the bad guys!  Trouble is we never are clued in to exactly what the motivation is for anyone but Milo.  He just plain gets sick and tired of everyone trying to knock him off.  Very understandable.<br />\\"Dancing Bear\\" is an interesting read because of the well-drawn characters.  Crumley zeros in so well on an overweight, hard-as-nails, prostitute; we understand perfectly why Milo finds her an irresistible Red Hot Mama---not an easy task.  The pace is fast, but we don't know where we are going, and the master crime/criminal is about as amorphous as having a vague discontent with General Motors.  It was not the follow-up I expected to the brilliant \\"The Wrong Case.\\"	2002-09-28

The area, formerly part of the USSR, is bordered by Pakistan, Afghanistan, China and Iran.<br />There are only a few areas of the world that meet the geologic criteria of having Great Walls and Kyrgyzstan is one of them, along with the U.S.'s Yosemite National Park. These kids were great climbers, but their awareness of world affairs was zero to none.  True, State Department advisories were vague, and the fact they were not warned or stopped by either their on-site travel agency or the military is unbelievable.<br />The quartet, three boys and one girl, had a terrifying experience being under fire, under constant threat of execution, seeing a soldier executed before their eyes, and had almost no food or water during the nightmare ordeal. They finally escaped by one of them shoving their guard over a cliff, presumably to his death.<br />I was struck again and again by the almost total helplessness of these young people, particularly Beth Rodden.  She is a very nice, well brought up young lady, but seemed to revert to a sobbing childlike state of overwhelming terror.  The boys were very protective, but unable to plan coherently and missed many opportunities to escape.  Two of the boys were full of braggadocio and talk, but ultimately were incapable of action.  The other was almost catatonic, but at least had a very real awareness of the danger and when it counted, acted.  The terrorists did not physically harm them.  They were ready to execute the hostages at any moment, but never assaulted or beat them. <br />Greg Child is uniquely qualified to tell this white-knuckle tale.  He is an experienced mountaineer, familiar with Kyrgyzstan having climbed there in '95, and is the author of some well-received mountaineering books. I have read two of his books and enjoyed his easy going style, his expertise, and his factual integrity.<br />Their return prompted a media frenzy that quickly turned into a firestorm.  First because Mr. Child obtained exclusive rights to the hostage's story causing much hostility from other members of the press and secondly, the guard who the hostages pushed off the cliff turned up very much alive and not much worse for wear.  The guard's accounts of the escape sometimes did and sometimes did not agree with the hostages' account.  There were cries of \\"hoax!\\" and bitterness over the large monetary advance Mr. Child and the hostages received.  I believe the story and am not much troubled by the fact the hostages' assumption they had killed the guard.  It was dark, they saw him cartwheel in space, and thought he had fallen a great distance. (He did not.) I once saw a convertible on a switchback mountain road sail over a guardrail and tumble into space.  I was positive and would have sworn that all the occupants had to be dead from the fall.  It turned out the worst injury was a broken arm and the other two only had scratches and bruises.  And this was in broad daylight!<BR> <BR>I agree with other reviewers that noted all the controversy about the kidnapping did not belong in the book proper.  He badly needed endnotes and should have uses appendices to set forth conflicting views.  Nevertheless, it is a riveting story and a great read.  The best way to judge the veracity is to read the book and form your own opinion.	2002-09-25

Despite her grace, fragile beauty and charisma; Edie Sedgewick was almost born to be doomed even before the drugs did her in.<br />She was born into a wealthy old family that had a history of instability.  Her father, also breathtakingly beautiful, had crushing psychological problems.  Two of her brothers committed suicide.  Her mother was ineffectual with her large brood.  She was raised on an isolated ranch with her seven siblings with almost no contact with the outside world.  When she hit Cambridge at 18, she was pathetically ill equipped to be in the larger world.<br />I couldn't agree more that she found herself in the midst of horribly decadent people.  Andy Warhol gets a particularly bad rap in this book, but to me, he was no better nor worse than his hangers-on, just a shade more self-absorbed.  What really saddened me was that I don't think it really mattered who Edie took up with.  She was destined to spin out of control.  She had no focus, no inner strength, and was dangerously self-centered and delusionary.  <br />\\"Edie\\" is compelling reading whether or not you have experienced the '60's.  It is good to keep in mind that Edie herself and the contributors to the book all were a part of a very small stratum that whistled through this confusing decade. They were no more representative of the rank and file than Emmerin is representative of this decade.<br />Such a lovely child, such a terrible waste.	2002-09-23

(No, it's guaranteed not to &quot;spoil&quot; anything.) &quot;Phantoms&quot; was Koontz's sophomore book after the wide success of &quot;Whispers.&quot;  Acceding to his publisher's demands and much against his judgment, he wrote the &quot;horror&quot; story they wanted and forever after was known as a &quot;horror&quot; writer.  This is what he feared, and it has been a continual thorn in his side ever since.  I had the feeling throughout the book that Koontz was saying &quot;You want a horror story?  I'll give you the Mother of Horror Stories!&quot;<br />&quot;Phantoms&quot; takes the premise of the empty town where it appears everyone has vanished suddenly into thin air and runs with it.  A doctor, her young sister and a band of local policemen try to solve the mystery. They discover a few bodies that have died most mysteriously, hear strange voices and noises, and realize they are being watched and are likely to be attacked -- but by what?  Mr. Koontz pulls out all the stops in the creep and gore department and sets up good look-over-your-shoulder-fearfully tension.  The dialogue is very bad, and he did better with the characterizations of the supporting cast than he did with the principals, but for the most part they are believable.<br />&quot;Phantoms&quot; is overlong; and because of it, the tension ebbs at times.  The babykiller and the biker would never have been missed.  Though the reader certainly gets his money's worth in the horror department, I wouldn't call this one of Koontz's better works.	2002-09-23

By night she is poet Baroness Pontalba reading her stuff at carefully selected dives around town.  Her clothes are meticulously described, which is a very good thing, because in our wildest imagination, we would be hard put to come up with a mental image of her glorious plumage.  And the Baroness (thanks to Julie Smith) comes up with some pretty good poetry--see \\"Queen of the May.\\"<br />As with most poets, Talba needs a day job to support her writing.  Due to her razzle-dazzle preparation, she stuns elderly white male detective Eddie Valentino, into hiring her.  He had braced himself to hire a nerd, but a \\"nerdette\\"?  Eddie takes her along on what looks to be a pretty ho-hum case: finding out the identity of a man who has molested the client's daughter.  The situation heats up considerably when a sure fire witness suddenly dies in a hit and run accident. Running concurrent with the investigation is Talba's emerging curiosity about just who and what her father was.  Her entire family seems to be in mutual conspiracy to keep her in the dark about him.<br />The story has a good pace and is always colorful, but Ms. Smith does tend to overplot.  She has such a long stretch about her father; I almost forgot the other mystery entirely. Actually, the two stories could stand alone and probably should have.  The tie-in, as always, is the wonderful depictions of the star that grabs the spotlight:  New Orleans. I can't think of anyone who captures the feel of this city like Smith does.  \\"New Orleans Hotshot\\" is a nice welcome back for Julie Smith.	2002-09-23

Indianapolis and the Extraordinary Story of Its Survivors	Books	5	0	1	N	N	Biggest Snafu in Naval History	\\"In Harm's Way\\" is a compelling, edge-of-your-seat read.  In the waning days of WWII, the USS Indianapolis was hurriedly put under orders to carry the first atom bomb, \\"Little Boy\\" subsequently dropped on Hiroshima, to Guam for assembly.  This was so ultra top secret, none of the crew, including the captain was told what a deadly cargo they were carrying.<br />The miscommunications starting at Guam were lethal.  Before Guam, the hasty questionable orders could be chalked up to wartime emergencies and too much red tape.  Captain Charles McVay, not only was kept in the dark about his cargo, 250 of his crew were green as grass.  The training they were to have received in San Francisco in the next three months never took place due to their emergency orders.<br />Between Guam and Leyete, the Indianapolis was torpedoed and sunk in less than 20 minutes.  Of the crew of 1,946 men, 900 went into the water of the shark-infested sea almost on the equator.  Because of the speed of the sinking, very few lifeboats were launched, many of the men were not dressed and some did not have life vests.  A distress signal did get sent, but the captain was not sure there was sufficient power for it to be received.   But he was sure rescue operations would begin in 24 hours when they did not show up in Leyete.  This was a good assumption except the Navy \\"lost\\" the Indianapolis.  How you lose a battle cruiser that stands 133 ft. above the water line and is 661 feet long (two football fields) carrying 1,946 men is hard to fathom, but lose it they did.  The distress signal was received but an indignant commander called back the towboats that were sent out because they did not go through him to implement the order and he decided it was a hoax anyway.<br />It was five days before the survivors were accidentally spotted.  Their suffering was indescribable.  Over 200 were lost to shark attacks that were continual.  The equatorial heat dehydrated them quickly and the lifeboats that were supposed tocarry water didn't.  Many hallucinated and attacked the other men.  Some were in the water the whole time.  Of the 900 that went into the water, only 317 survived.<br />Captain McVay was made a scapegoat (failure to take evasive action!) and court martialed.  His life and career were ruined. He committed suicide 20 years later.  After unstinting efforts on the part of the survivors and Captain McVay's family, he was cleared in 1998, but the court martial remains on his record.<br />This is a vividly told account, well researched with helpful endnotes, bibliography, maps and index.  The author shifts the narrative among the survivors, which gives the account an immediacy that is almost unbearably painful.  Highly recommended.	2002-09-20

You can never settle right in and accept the persons and scenes quite the way they are presented.  \\"What a lovely girl --- and yet?\\" is a typical reaction. In \\"The Brimstone Wedding\\" Ms. Vine is at her best, right up there with \\"Dark Adapted Eye.\\"  The novel is beautifully crafted, the prose spare and the atmosphere of the Fen Country in East Anglia is perfect.  Because The Fens are a series of islands based in the boggy soil, the foundations are forever shifting.  Nothing changes, but nothing stays exactly the same which is an excellent setting for this haunting tale.<br />Jenny/Genevieve Warner is a care assistant at a luxurious home for the elderly where she has built a friendship with terminally ill, exquisitely turned out Mrs. Stella Newland.  Two women could not be more different on the surface.  Jenny is a modern, practical, hard working country girl who has never traveled and is a product of village life and education.  Stella comes from the gentry, married very well and seems so sheltered as to have come from a different age all together.  Yet the sparkling Jenny's humdrum marriage is teetering because she has discovered passion in the form of a married lover.  Stella has some dark secrets she has lived with for over twenty years and wants to share them with Jenny.  Stella believes in nothing, but would like redemption.  Jenny believes in everything: omens, charms, and every passing happenstance has psychic meaning for her.  Jenny is willing to work her way to better things; Stella is passive.  But why does Stella own a house that no one knows about? And why is she afraid to even ride in automobiles when she once was considered a dashing driver?  Why does she refuse to sit outside in the sunshine?<br />The author keeps us asking these questions and sends us down some strange paths to get the answers.  We know we are heading for a nameless horrific climactic event in Stella's past that will somehow impact on Jenny's present, but what can it be?  Ms. Vine never falls into a Gothic romance-type of trap.  Her people and events are sharp edged.  Stella smokes irritably in spite of the fact she is dying of lung cancer.  When Jenny finally works up her courage to leave her husband, he will not take her seriously; so what should be a grand melodramatic episode degenerates into farce.  \\"I'm leaving you Mike\\"----\\"Well take the washer and leave the car, there's a good lass.\\"<br />The author builds the tension until we are wrought up for at least a tornado strike, and she doesn't disappoint.  Then when we think we have taken quite enough for one day, she adds another zinger.  A great well-done page-turner.	2002-09-19

I met again the Michael Connelly to whom I was introduced in &quot;Black Echo&quot; and &quot;Concrete Blonde&quot; and &quot;Black Ice&quot; that electrified me with his broody LA, sharp characterizations and twisting suspense. No one in &quot;City of Bones&quot; is 100 percent nice or straight arrow, though all are very recognizable.  I had my usual problems with Harry, always wanting to tell him to lighten up a bit.  By this time, I should be resigned.  Harry Bosch is to gloom like Goldie Hawn is to giggles.<br />Harry walks into a cold case when a dog digs up an old bone in Laurel Canyon that turns out to be human.  Harry's superiors are unenthusiastic because the chances of closing a 20-year old case are slim to none.  Harry is grimly determined because when more of skeleton is found, it is ascertained the victim was an abused child. Harry first runs afoul of a former girl friend Medical Examiner (suspiciously close to Cornwell's Kay Scapetta) who has risen so far in the world; she cares more about photo ops than the integrity of the case. Along with hard working cops, there are plethoras of politician/cops who are willing to set up and convict the first likely guy that comes up on the radar.  As if Harry doesn't have enough troubles, an ill-fated romance with a police rookie streaks across his horizon.  He antagonizes his own partner with his lone wolf tactics, and seemingly neglects an obvious suspect for far too long.<br />The denouement has twist after twist, surprise after surprise leaving us breathless and far behind Harry all the way.  Then Harry gets another idea, leaving us hollering, &quot;wait a minute!&quot; but Harry just keeps walking right off the last page.	2002-09-18

He is our narrator in this sharply satirical trailer park trash slice of life.  <br />Sammy meets Jamalee and Jason Merridew while very unsuccessfully robbing a mansion.  So far, the only thing he's managed to pilfer is a half-gallon of vodka, which he decides to drink then and there.  Jamalee is a half-pint girl with hair the color \\"only a vegetable should have\\" and brother Jason is \\"the most beautiful boy in the Ozarks.\\" Jamalee wants to get out of West Table, MO, and just maybe Sammy can help her.  Sammy wants love or \\"any bunch that will have me.\\"  In Venus Holler they meet mother Sandra, a laid back, easy going, southern-to-her-fingertips whore.<br />Their antics are so funny, their energies and coping mechanisms so off the wall wild, I just gave in to helpless laughter. And yet, there is a sense of something preordained, sad and tragic about their existence.  In ways both large and small, they are stripped of their dignity over and over again by the way they are perceived by society.  \\"Society\\" ain't much in West Table, but it knows for a fact it's a world away from the likes of Sammy, Jamalee and Jason.<br />As the author shapes the rhythmic cadence of Sammy's story, the future is glimpsed and it's bad.  It's been a long time since I have grown so fond of a character in a book.  He has all the fascination of a train wreck waiting to happen.  And then you shed a tear and knew it had to be.	2002-09-15

The man is first and foremost a storyteller par excellence, and \\"Watchers\\" reels you in just-like-that---zip!  All of his favorite elements are in play: the hulking government-sponsored lab, the super dog, the pathetic monster, the burnt out protagonist and redemption.  It may be a formula, but then so is the chef's masterpiece.  When it's done right, it's a work of art.  The dialogue is Koontzian stiff (the dog has the best lines), but with such strong characterizations, it is but of small moment.<br />Travis Connell is a man in bleak despair.  He has lost everyone who meant anything to him and is convinced he is a jinx.  With great serendipity he meets an extraordinary golden retriever and one of life's misfits, Nora Devon.  The dog and Travis meet and mutually support one another in a wilderness area where something unknown is threatening them.  They in turn meet the sheltered, totally repressed Nora and save her from a sexual predator who is insinuating himself into her life.  The three are inexorably drawn to one another and each almost miraculously strengthens the others. <br />The story shifts among the trio, a workaholic NSA agent, and a particularly repellent professional hit man with a God complex.  The hit man Vince is wonderfully rendered and, unfortunately for the reader, we understand all too well his skewed logic.  Lemuel Johnson, the NSA agent, has too much personal baggage and sometimes retards the story.  The golden retriever, subsequently named Einstein, is a perfect realization of a dog that has been genetically engineered for high intelligence.  He thinks, he reasons, he communicates (no, he can't talk, thank God!), but he remains very much a dog with all the traits we human dog lovers treasure.  Somehow the author keeps him from ever being cute or a circus wonder; he has dignity and gravitas.<br />This is a great, fast read that will leave you with something to think about and makes the reader face some moralambiguities.  Mr. Koontz flawlessly pushes all our buttons in this, possibly his best, novel.	2002-09-13

I expected a mystery/thriller mainly because of the author's debut novel, the beautifully written &quot;Bag Men&quot; written under the pseudonym John Flood falls into that category.  &quot;Big If&quot; is what is generalized as a &quot;character driven&quot; novel.  But two of the most important &quot;characters&quot; are things rather than people, the U.S. Treasury's Division of Secret Service and a vicious, venal interactive fantasy War Game produced by a company named Big If.<br />The plot is pegged around presidential primary campaign travel with all the focus on the Secret Service's role in ensuring the safety of the candidate. The only thing we know about the candidate is that he is a sitting Vice President in a very tight race. He is a logistical object, nothing more. The spotlighted Secret Service characters are not one big happy cohesive group.  They are under such job related stress and strain; all their thoughts are inwardly directed toward keeping their minds in the Zone.  Their job is making nothing happen at all.  Yet they must be poised at all times for a cataclysm.  There are no allowances for family, home life or even a proper day off.  The only fully developed character who is not Secret Service is a brother of an agent who is a technical genius.  He writes beautiful code for Big If, but the result of this mathematical poetry is the bloody awful, wildly successful War Game for his employer, Big If.<br />Mr. Costello is a wordsmith on a par with Jonathan Franzen.  &quot;Big If&quot; is at times wildly funny and the descriptions sing with originality.  I was convinced that doom was around the corner every time I turned a page, so I read entirely too quickly.  I later went back and reread passages and chapters, for Mr. Costello is playing a deep game with us.  It is a book that can be read at many levels, all of them enjoyable.  He keeps things moving, is witty, and you care about these people.  You also can learn about things you have never thought about very much like a realtor's spiel or how a claim adjuster evaluates damage.  Mark Costello is an author to watch.	2002-09-10

It recounts the story of Hilary, a brilliant screenwriter who is just beginning to enjoy the fruits of financial success.  She loves her beautiful home and garden, a sharp contrast to her poverty stricken unhappy childhood.<br />Hilary returns to her home only to have a man to whom she is slightly acquainted leap out of the coat closet and brutally attack her.  She is so shocked that Bruno Frye, a wealthy, urbane vineyard owner, is 1) in her house and 2) insanely enraged, that she is at first too stunned to react.  Finally she recovers, finds her gun and scares him off temporarily.  She calls the police who do not believe her. (Among other imprudent actions, she tidied up before placing the call.)  The next night she barricades herself in her guest room and upon awakening, thinking all is well, cautiously emerges into the hall with a 4-inch knife in her hand.  Bruno has again found entry into her house and is waiting outside the door.  In a terrible battle she mortally wounds him.  He is found, declared dead, has an autopsy, is embalmed and buried. --- And returns.<br />The weakest part of the story is the blindness of the entire cast to consider the most obvious solution to the puzzle.  In the first 100 pages, I kept waiting for someone to suggest a likely line of investigation, but waited in vain.  This was the first of Mr. Koontz's books to be a resounding success, so perhaps the poor dialogue is something he mastered with more experience.  But the story is too long and needs editing.  The political views that crop up every chapter or so adds nothing to the novel's storyline and are an irritation. <br />Mr. Koontz can set a scene that will spook you into next week.  He can come up with unimaginable horrors.  He developed Bruno Frye's character well enough that the reader has a certain amount of sympathy or at least pity for him.  Overall, C+.	2002-09-08

A dark horse Republican takes over Parliament and his first act is to dissolve the monarchy.  All their estates and belongings are turned over to the Government.  The Royal Family is instantly transformed into poor pensioners receiving welfare and set up in grim little council flats.<br />It is pleasing to tell you that Queen Elizabeth copes admirably.  After a few faltering missteps (please remember Her Majesty has never dressed herself, opened a door or made a cuppa tea in her life), the Queen pulls herself together, makes do and takes charge of her bewildered family. Philip goes into a deep depression and takes to his bed. Charles becomes a passionate gardener and gets a crush on a well-endowed commoner next door.  Diana airily, with excellent good will, sets about redecorating and rearranging her clothes.  Margaret is arrogantly certain it is all a hideous mistake.  The Queen Mum is good natured, befuddled and instantly makes tremendous friends with her Cockney neighbors.  Anne is grimly practical and sees the advantage of courting a plumber. Charles and Wills have no trouble losing their accents and becoming one of the guys in the gang. <br />&quot;The Queen and I&quot; is more a gentle satire and almost never mean spirited.  I think the author has confidence in the Queen's powers of diversity and admires Princess Anne's spunk.  I am sure English readers appreciate and are more aware of the subtleties than we Americans, but this didn't stop me from having a most enjoyable, very fast read.

As the deepest cave in the world, the Kubera Cave in Georgia (formerly USSR) is 1,710 meters, only 235 meters deeper than Huantla, we are talking about some extreme caving.<br />The main purpose of the expedition was to test out Mr. Stone's \\"rebreather,\\" an artificial breathing device that allows an underwater diver more than six hours of oxygen as opposed to 45 minutes in the average scuba tank.  This amount of time is needed in caves with large \\"sumps\\" or underground water passages where the surface can be a great distance away.  The problem with the rebreather, aside from its experimental nature, is its complexity, an added component of difficulty to a diver's already altered state of awareness.<br />The expedition was a diverse group consisting of five divers (these are extreme guys!), five top-of-the-line cavers, and Stone's girl friend, Barbara am Ende, a PhD geologist, but less experienced cave diver.  The story unfortunately begins in Maryland where they assembled the group and the gear.  I say \\"unfortunately\\" because it is an overlong section that leaves us a long time to wait before we get to the cave.  Once at the site, the book is engrossing and exciting.  Excellent maps are included that are vital to the understanding of what they were doing and where they were at any given time.  Stone's descriptions of the types of caving and diving required are outstanding.  I have never willingly been in a cave (my claustrophobia kicks in just reading about it!), yet I could easily visualize exactly what was going on. The dangers, particularly of diving, are appalling. After finishing the book, I looked up \\"most dangerous sports\\" and was surprised #1 is bull riding, #2 water speed records and #3 cave diving.  After reading \\"Beyond the Deep,\\" I was certain nothing in this world (and possibly the next) could be more dangerous than cave diving!<br />The book has weaknesses mostly in the format.  Mr. Stone chooses to use the third person singular, i.e. \\"Bill Stone says--\\" when he is talking about himself, something I find irritating and pretentious.  The author states at the beginning that the dialogue is not exact, only an approximation.  It is extremely stilted and when the author tries to get off a good joke that  \\"cheered everyone up,\\" it falls flat as a flounder. Guess you had to be there. Ms. am Ende is portrayed as almost walking on water; her patience is unremitting, her cheerfulness amazing.  This is in contrast to the other members who were displayed in a much more three-dimensional, interesting manner.<br />This is one of those books you feel like you don't quite have the whole story.  Mr. Stone is an enthusiastic proponent of his rebreather, yet I felt the divers' concerns and uneasiness were quite understandable and to the point.  The author is clearly a driven person and whether he showed bravery or a blatant disregard of safety by continuing the exploration with the inexperienced Ms. am Ende is something the reader will have to decide for himself.  <br />A good, interesting read with glossary, index and notes.	2002-09-08

Salinger, famous reclusive author of &quot;Catcher in the Rye,&quot; rebuffs all requests for interviews and is said to consign fan letters to the garbage, most of these letters have a tenuous air.  At least the writers can be assured their letters will be read, if not by Mr. Salinger (shame on him!), by other Salinger junkies.<br />The letters are divided into sections from Writers and Readers, Students and Teachers, and From the Web.  The letters run the gamut from a touching letter to Holden &quot;thanks for being your sixteen year old self forever&quot; from Alma Luz Villanueva to a question from Joanne Cavanaugh Simpson: &quot; In the end, I guess you, like Holden, decided not to ever tell anybody anything again.  But even so, don't you miss everybody?&quot; <br />Some letters are in the form of poems, some are breezy and informal (&quot;Howzit goin' Jerry?&quot;), others are painfully stiff, but almost all have the hope that J.D. will at some date, sometime read them. There is the query from a young poet in England that would like to know the proper pronunciation of &quot;Zooey&quot; since that is his name.  His mother, in an excess of enthusiasm for Salinger, named him after that notable character, but never was quite sure how it was pronounced. An admiring e-mail from Nicole Corrow says, &quot;--you're SO *fantastically* BRILLIANT you could make me relate to a whisk broom.&quot;  The only one I found one huge yawn was a woman who quoted a rigidly boring section (looong) of her doctoral thesis in hopes, I presume, the master would read it and be properly impressed.<br />Editor Chris Kubica provides a lively introduction and Will Hochman does the honors in a postscript that nicely summarizes what we have read.  I found the book sometimes amusing and frequently thoughtful.  This is a handsomely produced book that would make a nice gift to your favorite Salingerophile.	2002-09-04

This excellent biography well researched and beautifully written has but one flaw:  the subject.  David Geffen is so contradictory, no matter how much information about him is amassed; we are still baffled.  In keeping with the rest of his personality, I understand this book was \\"partially\\" authorized.  That is, when Mr. King began the project, DG was forthcoming and enthusiastic, only to totally reverse himself later on and be bitterly opposed to the undertaking.<br />David Geffen is a poster boy for ADD.  He is frenetically active, but with a remarkably short attention span.  He disliked school because it wasted his time.  He can be a caring friend or an implacable enemy. He can be embarrassing intimate with almost complete strangers, yet distant as a north star toward his own family.  He has lived a gay promiscuous life, yet fell hard for Cher and wanted to marry her.  Easy going Cher recognized him as a \\"controller\\" and walked away.  He shows great generosity personally and publicly; yet hasn't a qualm about financially ruining friend and foe alike for a perceived slight, and sometimes just for the hell of it.<br />No matter how much you thank your lucky stars that you never, ever have to do business with David Geffen, you cannot help but be awestruck at his genius as a businessman, visualizer and strategist.  He is beyond compare, and in spite of Mr. King's admirable dissecting of various business deals, it is impossible to follow Geffen's leap of ideas and creativity to make things happen.<br />In spite of David Geffen's striving for the most money, the best deal, and the top of the financial ladder, I would not call him a materialistic man.  Unfortunately for him, he doesn't feel an emotional bond to his beautiful artwork and homes.  Name him a good price and he will sell it to you--as is.  He has never had a sustained relationship, and now going on his 60th year, he has everything but someone to leave it to.<br />\\"The Operator\\" is a meticulous undertaking, and Mr. King has an easy writing style that is very balanced toward his multi-sided subject.  I will look for other books by this author.  A very enjoyable read.	2002-09-03

A newborn baby is left on the back steps of St. Alban's Episcopal Church in Millers Kill, New York on a bitter November night.<br />The tightly woven story features Clare Fergusson, a newly hatched, unorthodox Episcopal priest and Police Chief Russ Van Alstyne who have more in common than you would think. Murders take place that seem to be linked with the baby's abandonment and the upper class parishioners of St. Albans.<br />The omnipresent star of the book is the weather.  In this Adirondack community right on the Vermont border, the oncoming winter is a living thing that is ignored at one's peril. Ms. Spencer-Fleming is deft in drawing both interiors and exteriors.  She broadens the dimensions of her characters in describing how they live, what they like to have around them, and how they cope with the brutal winters that are part and parcel of their landscape.  Some of the townspeople have a \\"winter rat,\\" a beat up, barely serviceable car they use when the weather and roads are so tough, the road salt eats up the undercarriages and driving is one controlled skid after another.<br />\\"In the Bleak Midwinter\\" is just short of a \\"cozy\\" with its budding romance between the sheriff and the priest and its delightful warm interior scenes.  Clare could use a crash course in detecting.  There are a couple of times this otherwise sensible lady goes into the \\"absolutely stupid heroine routine\\" usually depicted by a young lady who hears suspicious noises in a gloomy mansion in the dead of night.  Does she call the cops, scream her head off, or hide under the covers like any sane person would do?  No, she creeps around in the dark in her bare feet and nightgown, and then (surprise! surprise!) something GRABS her.  Clare is not this bad, but almost.  She tears off to suspicious, lonely places all by herself, without informing anybody in a sports car lamentably unsuited to a blizzard and dressed as if she is going on errand in New York City on a temperate autumn day.  Be that as it may, Clare is immensely likeable.  The author handles her strong religious faith expertly; it works naturally without being cloying or moralistic.<br />The book is a page-turner, well plotted, and the issues are never silly or contrived.  I am looking forward to Ms. Spencer-Fleming's next book.	2002-09-02

Picture thousands of notes on 3\\" x 5\\" file cards and 100 pages of John Roskelly's \\"Nanda Devi, The Tragic Expedition\\". Throw them up in the air. Wherever they land, pick them up and submit them as a manuscript.  That is the only way I can conceive this disorganized, unedited book was published. <br />It is hard to categorize this book.  It is not a biography (see Laurence Leamer's \\"Ascent\\").  It is not a memoir; I don't believe the author knew Willi Unsoeld in life.  \\"Fatal Mountaineer\\" concentrates mainly on three defining moments in Willi's life:  his brilliant traverse of Everest via the West Ridge in 1963 when Unsoeld was at the peak of his ability, the tragic death of his daughter Devi on her namesake mountain, and Willi's death in an avalanche on Mt. Rainier at age 54. There are explanations and definitions of Bergson and John Muir's philosophies throughout.  These two philosophers supposedly had a significant influence on Willi's spiritual outlook.<br />Sometimes it was hard to tell who was the main subject of this book, Willi or John Roskelly.  The author seems to have a love/hate relationship toward Roskelly referring to him as the \\"Buffalo Demon\\" and a wily self-promoter while praising his mountaineering abilities to the skies.  Mr. Roper's extensive quoting from Roskelly's book is unacknowledged by the author except for an asterisk on page 265.<br />The Nanda Devi climb that culminated in the mysterious death of Unsoeld's daughter, aged 22, is given the most attention.  As the expedition leader and as a father, Unsoeld's behavior was strange to say the least; his exploitation of this tragedy afterward via lectures, slideshows, and presentations was inexcusable.  His death in an avalanche while a leading a student expedition in the dead of winter was his last tragedy in that he took another 22 year-old girl with him. His judgment was fatally flawed to even think of taking such an inexperienced group on such a venture.  It speaks well for the other 20 students that they managed to survive.<br />When closing the book, I had gained no additional insights about this compelling, charismatic man who had great leadership abilities, was larger than life and had a continual adoring coterie of fans around him right up to and including the time of his death. Mr. Roper obviously had no endorsement from Unsoeld's family, he cites no printed sources, has no endnotes, and no bibliography.  The book seemed nothing more than an exercise in self-indulgence.	2002-08-30

A typical Coyne client's (think \\"very rich\\") son needs representation for a DUI accident that killed a woman.  Brady recommends his good friend Paul, a cracker jack defense attorney.  Paul, in the throes of mid-life angst, reluctantly agrees and gets the thoroughly guilty miscreant off.  Paul is depressed over the caliber of his clients, the state of his marriage, and the state of the legal profession.  Paul disappears and bad things start happening to his less than pristine clients.<br />Mr. Tapply has given us much more a plot than usual, and the fast pace of events work nicely against Brady's reluctant involvement.  Brady centers his attention on getting one good day's worth of trout fishing while everything conspires against him.  To make him even more miserable, his comfortable life style is threatened when the love of his life proposes getting away from it all and moving to Maine.<br />The exquisite descriptions of Newburyport and Plum Island MA are a joy to read.  The personal crisis Brady faces is portrayed honestly and well. He does some excellent sleuthing and hands the reader some surprises.  This is a well done tightly woven narrative.  Best of all is how fond one becomes of Brady.  You want to reward him with a good fishing trip for a job well done. This story is included in \\"The Brady Coyne Omnibus.\\"	2002-08-30

She paints a witty portrait of her mother (who deserves her own book), a domineering, beautifully dressed, luxury-loving, hard driving businesswoman and a protective overbearing mother.  Interestingly, this description fits author Anne like a glove.<br />In affairs of the heart, Anne calls herself a \\"belligerent doormat.\\"  I loved this phrase!  I doubt that many of her long-term love interests would have agreed with the \\"doormat\\" part, but she felt/feels she takes to heart every criticism made of her and goes into a passive/aggressive mode.  Though she seems very bare bones honest in reporting her emotional entanglements, there are strange gaps.  For instance, how in the world did she make her second husband-to-be so angry with her that he testified against her in the custody trial for her daughter?<br />\\"Memoirs--\\" is worth the price if for no other reason than Ms. Robinson's honest and bleak reporting of her crippling alcoholism and how she gradually climbed out of this life-threatening spiral of devastation.  And it did ruin her career and almost kill her.  Interestingly, Ms. Robinson, though she spares herself very little, is a champion grudge holder.  She clearly has never forgiven the court for the judgment that caused her to lose custody of her daughter.  Yet at the time, she was a non-functional alcoholic who was totally undependable. <br />She turned her life around big time, and went on to become a highly successful reporter, radio and TV personality, which I found quite inspiring.  I admit I have not yet seen \\"The Weakest Link,\\" but now cannot wait to see her. I am sure Ms. Robinson can triumph in any and all situations.  The book is well written, just what you would expect of a top-flight reporter.  She has an excellent, if acerbic, sense of humor that makes her story even more enjoyable.	2002-08-28

There is no sleuth, the pace is fast, frenzied and breathless, and rather than \\"types,\\" she takes pains with characterizations.  The body count is high, and the mode of death frequently untidy.  \\"And Then There Were None\\" is among the most favored of Christie's books.  It has gone through a few title changes; I knew it as \\"Ten Little Indians,\\" and before that it had even a more politically incorrect title.  Be forewarned, Ms. Christie is neither enlightened nor tolerant. Some of the passages and references are bigoted and might offend some readers.<br />A group of ten strangers is invited or hired for a long weekend on Indian Island, a mile off the Devon coast.  It is somewhat improbable that these ten would all accept such a vague invitation from a host they do not know to a place they have never seen before, but each for his or her own reasons accepts.  They include a doctor, a games mistress, a soldier of fortune, a rich playboy, a retired policeman, a judge, a spinster, a retired general and a married couple who are to be the servants.  They arrive on a bleak rocky island to a completely modern house with all the amenities.  The fires are welcoming, there is an ample supply of food, the servants are impeccable, but their host is absent.  In each of the bedrooms, the Ten Little Indians nursery rhyme is posted on a prominent wall.  It begins:<br />\\"Ten Little Indian boys went out to dine;<br />One choked his little self, and then there were nine.---<br />Drinks are served, and one guest chokes, turns blue and falls over dead.  The tension builds, the fright of the stranded people is palpable as one by one, they are picked off, each in accordance with the nursery rhyme. As the number of victims increase, the survivors' suspicions of each other reach a frantic pitch.  In an epilogue, the police arrive and find them all dead.  Who is the murderer who has to be among the victims?<br />\\"And Then There Were None\\" is told in short choppy chapters that build suspense and tension.  I would call this Christie's one and only thriller.  None of the characters are even likable and once again (see \\"ABC Murders\\"), Christie toys with the idea of the serial killer long before such an animal was even heard of.  She is a good profiler too!  This is an excellent story, and the author is miles ahead of you at all times, If you can figure out \\"who\\" and \\"how\\" before she lays it out for you, you deserve the Sleuth of the Year Award!re Were None\\" is told in short choppy chapters that build suspense and tension.

The issue is assault weapons and whether they should be sold to private parties.  Kinnick is a strong anti-gun control advocate, and an offshoot of the NRA called SAFE has paid his expenses.<br />After an all-night session of reading the bill, Kinnick comes to the conclusion that the bill is reasonable, and he testifies in favor of its passage to the dismay of his sponsors, SAFE.  When Wally and Brady take off to do their favorite thing, fishing in the wilds of Massachusetts, Wally is shot with an assault rifle.<br />Have NRA types disgruntled with his testimony shot him?  Is it a hunting accident?  Could it be his lady friend's about-to-be ex-husband?  Brady has more than a passing interest because he, as well as Wally, has been put on SAFE's \\"enemy list.\\"<br />The author presents a balanced view of this explosive issue, which is much to his credit.  However, the story lacks momentum.  It is one of these where vital facts are kept secret because of \\"confidentiality,\\" which I find annoying.  The choices are too narrow for who the attacker might be.  So the reader is a few steps ahead of Brady all the way.  As always, the author does an excellent job of describing the local scenes.  Brady is a very likeable guy, but his laid back persona slows the story down badly.  \\"The Seventh Enemy\\" is a quick read, pleasant, but one you forget by the next day.	2002-08-27

The author enlarges on the history of collecting orchids, orchid hunters, and the flower itself.  She is to be commended for her research on all and the Seminole Indians as well.  Did you know the Seminoles are technically still at war with the United States?  They are the only tribe that never signed a treaty.<br />The title character, John LaRoche is almost-but-not-quite worth the focus he receives.  He has a quirky mindset, an enthusiasm that is catching; but his total self-absorption gets tiresome.  His knowledge and keenness for the art and science of plants is entertaining.  But hey, the guy is a small time crook, a trail of unrealized dreams, and a very poor friend.  In spite of many denials, I think Susan had more than a mild crush on him; why else put up with all his inconsiderate nonsense?<br />The description of the various orchids is masterful, (How I wished for color plates!) and Susan was vivid in all interior and exterior moods in her depiction of Florida.  So much so, I would state southern Florida is the underlying theme of the book.  Her experiences and bravery in the beastly Fakahatchee Swamp, home of many wild orchids, are dramatic.  Plunging into brackish water up to the waist, and having to toe around for submerged alligators on the squishy bottom is not for the faint of heart.<br />Part of the enjoyment of this fine non-fictional work is the very likeable Susan herself.  She tends to be shy, hates the heat, is homesick, tired of driving all over, fears the swamp, but she persists. The end result is well worth her efforts.	2002-08-25

White-shoe lawyer, Brady Coyne, is called in to defend a friend of a friend, Daniel McCloud, who is facing felony jail time for having a large garden of the best marijuana.  Daniel, a Viet Nam vet who has been Agent Oranged, claims he uses the drug only for medicinal purposes to relieve his terrible skin rash.  Brady takes an instant liking to Daniel who is quiet, modest and completely self-reliant.  He hunts, fishes, knows the forest as well as the animals, and has built a beautiful modern home by hand in rural Connecticut. <br />Daniel gives Brady a box containing his \\"book\\" instructing him to find an agent to get his work published, but not to open it or read it.  Then the mysteries start to pile up.  Why did the D.A. drop charges against Daniel when they had an airtight case?  It seems everyone who has contact with Daniel's book dies (including Daniel.)  Why do the local cops dislike Daniel? Why are they not investigating his murder?  At this point, we are right where we want to be as a reader--baffled, intrigued, and ready for more.<br />Well, that's it folks.  The suspense goes down like an old soufflé and we are left with half-answers or unlikely ones. The book just seems to run out of gas.  Brady is a very likeable hero, he has non-intense, non-monogamous relationships.  He is very laid back and admits that fly-fishing is his first love (and probably his second or third as well).  What could have been a highly suspenseful story just leaves us hanging.  Brady probably just went fishing. C-	2002-08-23

Insert Vivaldi's \\"Four Seasons\\" into the CD, settle in your favorite chair, and get ready to enjoy.  <br />\\"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption\\" I am one of the few people I know that has not seen everyone's favorite movie,  \\"The Shawshank Redemption.\\" Yes, I do live on this planet, but I stubbornly avoid prison movies.  After reading this life and hope-affirming story, I will have to break my rule and give Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman a chance to wend their magic.  Wily old Red, a lifer who has seen it all, tells the story of Andy Dufresne, an innocent man who is sentenced to life in prison for the murder of his wife and her lover.  Andy gradually wins the respect and finally awestruck admiration from the cynical Red by his patience, determination and understated kindness and true sense of self.  As I approached the end of this story, I could think of at least six awful ways clever and manipulative King could end the story.  I caught myself saying \\"not this time--please!\\"  knowing that I was firmly caught in any web King cared to devise.  <br />\\"The Apt Pupil\\" I will state at the outset, was my favorite.  Mysteries and thrillers are my preferred form of escapism; \\"The Apt Pupil\\" is a psychological thriller at its finest.  Todd is frighteningly enough, every parent's dream child.  Modest, polite, handsome, gifted student and athlete with a winning grin that melts teachers and friends alike.  At 13, he has the world in front of him.  He also has a peculiar interest in what went on in concentration camps in WWII. By sheer chance he discovers a neighboring old man, Mr. Henker aka Dussander is in fact one of the most brutal Nazi war criminals and who has been living under an alias for all these years.  Rather than being shocked, Todd wants to hear all about it.  Dussander does all he can to drive the boy away, but finally gives in from the very justified fear that Todd will turn him in.  Thus begins a descent to the depths with Dussander's depravity reawakening and Todd's symbiotic parasitism of Dussander's soul.  The novel is so well done, it gives you a series of small shocks until you are so weakened, the huge momentum of last big horror about does you in.  What is interesting is you can't decide who is the more depraved, Dussander or the boy.  Brilliantly conceived and executed.<br />\\"The Body\\" made into that sleeper hit, \\"Stand By Me,\\" is a coming of age story of one Labor Day weekend in the lives of four 12-year old boys.  I suspect King is so excellent at this type of story is because there is still a great deal of the 12-year old boy remaining in him.  That is my one criticism of this tale; King, the grown up narrator, interferes too much.  A corpse of a 12-year old boy has been discovered and abandoned by the \\"big\\" boys of Castle Rock who fear they will get in trouble. The four youngsters decide they will \\"discover\\" the corpse themselves and become famous heroes in the local TV and newspaper.  The boys are not morbid, and it is clear they see this as an adventure, camping out in the woods, hiking, and then their just rewards. The body is just incidental or a means to an end.  A breathtaking example of King's lyric abilities is when he describes a wild scream heard by the boys in woods at night:<br />\\"The scream climbed with a crazy ease through octave after octave, finally reaching a glassy, freezing edge.  It hung there for a moment and then whirled back down again, disappearing into an impossible bass register that buzzed like a monstrous honeybee.  This was followed by a burst of what sounded like mad laughter ...and then there was silence again.\\"<br />\\"The Breathing Method\\" I noticed was dedicated to Peter Straub and his wife Susan.  Alas, I am afraid that is what \\"The Breathing Method\\" is.  Bad Peter Straub.  Old men gathering in a strange club telling chilling tales to one another.  The title talewas almost comic in its horror, the type that makes me want to go, \\"Oh puh-leez.\\"<br />This is a 5-star book with one not so good story (and many people liked it).  By all means, get the book, read it and then rewatch the DVDs.	2002-08-21

Eleven of the twelve Circuits have had a mysterious death among their judges during the past year.  The 4th Circuit is the last one. Judge Hannah has stoutly refused any type of protection.<br />There are subplots galore in \\"Darker Justice.\\"  Mary's long time lover, Jonathan Walkingstick has a new love interest (much to Mary's dismay) who is a full-blooded Cherokee, a tepid attraction grows between Mary and FBI agent Dan Safer and Judge Hannah herself has a courtly Irish farmer swain.  \\"FaithAmerica,\\" a wealthy televangelistic group has designs on world domination, and there is a \\"camp\\" for poor boys right in Irene's backyard run like a Marine boot camp by Soldier of Fortune, Sergeant Robert Wurth.<br />In the strongest section of the book, two boys, Tommy and Willetts, try to discover the secrets of the draconian Camp Unakayawa to facilitate their grand escape.  The hidden cachets in the mountains, the moldering old pile of a once abandoned castle-like building and the interaction between the two boys show Ms. Bissell at her best.<br />The author keeps a tight rein on her many threads, and leaves no strings dangling.  The pace is good as are the characterizations.  I had some problems with Judge Hannah who seemed almost too good to be true, and became a mite weary with Mary brooding over her love life.  As yet, Ms. Bissell has trouble bringing mature male characters to life, but she has improved in this area since her last novel.  I wish she would dispense with some of the slash and gash; with her strong feel for the mountains and the people who live in them, I feel she could write her own ballad books that could stand the testof being compared to Sharyn McCrumb.<br />\\"A Darker Justice\\" is a good second book and highly readable.  Ms. Bissell is improving all the time.  Probably best read in order.	2002-08-20

It was a disappointment.  Leo seems like a pale imitation of James Crumley's Milo Milodragovitch with a little of Robert Parker's Spencer thrown in for good measure.<br />The plot is confusing and depends too much on visuals; nice in a movie but a strain in a book.  Leo is hired to protect the good name of the La Cuisine International who are holding their first non-European convention in a five-star Seattle hotel.  Employer Sir Geoffrey Miles feels some of the member/participants are in \\"mortal danger.\\"  Two competing magnates of chain steak houses are briskly skirmishing in the courts, a food critic of enormous influence is playing a ruthless game of  \\"who gets the five-stars.\\" Except for the fact that all the characters in \\"danger\\" seem uniformly disagreeable, it is difficult to see a compelling reason to kill them.  Leo employs his Army of the Homeless for surveillance purposes, much chasing around ensues, great efforts are made to keep one of the steak house owners from having a giant barbeque in downtown Seattle and the food critic is knocked off.  The reader solves the mystery about 100 pages ahead of Leo leaving not much but a series of anti-climaxes.<br />There are some bright spots:  Sir Geoffrey Miles is deftly characterized as a Nero Wolfe par excellence and is amusing and entertaining.  Mr. Ford does Seattle very well, as I noted in \\"Fury.\\"  He makes it sound so attractive I have to keep repeating to myself \\"Remember the Rain, remember the rain!\\" The homeless characters and their lifestyles are interesting and handled with sensitivity.<br />Perhaps Mr. Ford just had a bad outing.  I will try another book, probably without Leo, and hope it rekindles my enthusiasm for Mr. Ford's books. Give \\"Slow Burn\\" a pass.	2002-08-18

(I kept picturing someone who looks like a young George Stephanopolus).  <br />There is a serial killer on the loose, and Frank knows he is heading for a nervous breakdown every time he looks at one of the victims.  Something seems familiar and frightens him very badly.  He has had a terrible childhood and has had psychiatric help in the past.  He has blackouts and memory loss and terrible dreams.

Birdman makes him look like a creampuff.  In grindingly, horrific detail we learn just exactly how this Jack-the-Ripper style murderer gets his jollies.<br />Highly troubled, but blindingly handsome DI Jack Caffery, is called in to investigate a mass burial site in a desolate construction area that contains five female bodies that are in variously advanced state of decay.  The ladies are identified as \\"throwaway\\" girls, the types that would not be reported missing if they disappeared.  Most were part-time prostitutes.  They have been hideously butchered, and all have had a small living bird implanted in their rib cage.<br />The technological gadgetry used by this London police team is first rate and most interesting.  The interplay between various police personalities is well done.  I would have liked villainous DI Diamond to have maybe one endearing trait to make him human, but I will not quibble.  There is one character, like in the usual WWII movie, that is entirely too lovable, and he might as well wear a sign on his back saying \\"Casualty.\\"  <br />Our hero, Jack starts off with a fascinating, very unsatisfactory love life. Veronica is perfection in beauty, charm, housewifely skills---and Jack is becoming disenchanted---and he wants his house-key back, but does not know how to ask her tactfully.  She has planned a Martha Stewart-worthy party at his home, and he hates the whole idea.  There are other delightful little subplots in \\"Birdman\\" that I fastened onto like a drowning person, perhaps as a breather from the sheer awfulness of The Case.<br />In this debut novel, Ms. Hyder demonstrates fine writing skills and an ability to pace.  At the halfway point the mystery is supposedly solved, but is only a brief hiatus of worse to come. Her plotting for clues needs work.  Jack frequently looks up at the stars, and KNOWS!  The reader is not privy to just how this revelation came to him out of the blue, so to speak. The unblinking grotesque scenes may or may not sell books.  From toilets to torture to trepanning, the repellant/disgust level is high. I hope Ms. Hyder does not find herself in the position of being unable to top herself in the macabre market, such as Thomas Harris has, going from his brilliant \\"Red Dragon\\" to the absurdity of \\"Hannibal.\\"  Nevertheless, Ms. Hyder has talent and bears watching.	2002-08-17

To make the average reader understand that a search warrant improperly executed makes everything found (up to and including murder weapons), null, void and inadmissible as evidence is a difficult concept, yet Mr. Mayor succeeds.  His writing is so realistic; we are as disappointed as the police.<br />Brattleboro VT police detective Joe Gunther's very special lady friend of fifteen years (Joe is nothing if not a careful man), Gail is brutally raped over a three-hour period not long after Joe has left her house.  Joe is enraged, guilt-stricken, and stunned.  Gail is shattered, but fortunately is being taken care of by her highly experienced women's group.  Though Gail can barely speak, she indicates she wants Joe in charge of the case.  The majority of his fellow policemen and all of his superiors try to discourage him from attempting this dual role as clear-eyed, impartial cop and Gail's distraught comforter. <br />After some brilliant police work, a clear trail leads to a thoroughly despicable scumbag who has all the right credentials.  A search of his house solidifies his guilt.  An aborted arrest attempt leaves Joe in a coma after suffering abdominal stab wounds from the suspected man.  To add to this unfortunate turn of events, it is found the warrant was improperly served and the assailant cannot be tried for the rape. (A silver lining, of course, is that he CAN be tried for attempted murder.)  After Joe staggers back on duty, it begins to look as if the rapist must be someone else.  Joe is further knocked about, bounced on his head, and shot, but justice is eventually served.<br />The book is very tightly and skillfully written.  I had a few qualms about Joe and Gail.  They were so lofty in their sentiments, understanding and goals, they seemed to me to belong on pedestals in the park rather than ordinary (if superior) people.  I was as dubious as everyone else in Brattleboro about the propriety of Joe taking the lead in the investigation.  Think a lot less mayhem would have ensued with Joe being left on the bench.  Then there were Joe's remarkable recuperative abilities.  I couldn't help but wince every time he tore his stitches out anew while grappling with the bad guys.<br />This is one hard-boiled mystery that I admire the craft more than the probability.

To win, he was must prove a murder was committed in the death of a wealthy, elderly lady who had terminal cancer.  Said lady, Miss Agatha Dawson, had made no will, and the medical certificate said \\"heart failure.\\"<br />True, her young doctor was unhappy about the situation.  He had thought Miss Dawson's death entirely too sudden and had made strenuous inquiries, so many in fact, the people of her village turned against him, and he had to give up his practice there.  In fairness, it must be stated that the good doctor did seem rather egotistical, and perhaps he was just miffed that his prognosis of six more months was a shade too optimistic.<br />Further investigation divulges that Miss Dawson's young ex-servant has died mysteriously of a heart attack in a meadow.  The more Lord Peter investigates, the more the injuries and mysteries pile up.  A young lawyer has a near miss, Lord Peter is drugged, a young village lady is murdered while vacationing by persons unknown, and Lord Peter's associate is held hostage.  <br />Lord Peter wins his wager, but at what a cost!  The reader is left with an interesting moral dilemma.  Is it better to let a complacent murderer be to avert the consequences of his or her obsession?<br />This is one of the earlier Lord Peter Wimsey books.  It has a great deal of banter---what some would call silly dialogue, and poor Charles, Peter's brother-in-law to be and Scotland Yard detective, looks a bit like a stuffy fool.  But in this book the mystery is real and the stakes are high.  This will be good news to some Sayers readers who feel cheated when they find nothing of import has happened at all!  I was relieved to note \\"Unnatural Death\\" is pre-Harriet Vane, as I find her perfection tiresome; other readers may miss her.  This is a complex tale and will keep you turning the pages.	2002-08-15

Travis and pal Meyer endeavor to clear the name of ship captain, Van Harder.  His client, Hub Lawless, was lost at sea and Harder was accused of being passed out drunk at the time of the accident.  Van claims he was doped, not drunk, and now has lost his license and means of livelihood.  Meyer engineers a neat scam whereby he and Trav get access to all the powers-that-be in Timber Bay, the town where the unfortunate Mr. Lawless was a king pin.  His disappearance has left the town holding the bag and severely depressed.  There is a serious question whether he engineered his own disappearance, and the insurance company is holding up the payment of a $2 million policy to the widow.<br />The book is fast paced with excellent dialogue, and if that isn't enough--Enter the Girls!  First Trav hooks up with the lady piano player in a bar.  He and MacDonald dance around for a few pages trying to absolve Trav of taking advantage of the dreaded, non-sensitive One Night Stand.  Then come two good-time girls, Mishy & Licia who were on the boat at the time of the disappearance.  Licia, though lovely, has a teeth problem.  Much to her dismay one crude fellow told her \\"with teeth like that, you could eat a Big Mac through a venetian blind.\\" (Not our Trav, of course).  Then, saving the best until last, Gretel who brings Trav to his knees in instant adoration.  I always get nervous when Trav finds true love; they seem to have a very short life span.<br />\\"The Empty Copper Sea\\" is vintage Travis McGee with more turns than a corkscrew and surprises to match.  MacDonald sets up one of his trademark scenes of macabre horror right when you least expect it.  He wipes that smile off your face, just in case you thought this was going to be only a lighthearted ramble.  Recommended.	2002-08-13

MacDonald: Five Complete Travis McGee Novels	Books	4	62	62	N	N	Good Selection	Of the 21 novels in the Travis McGee series, this collection is an excellent representation.  The five books are from MacDonald's &quot;middle period&quot; and two of the five are among his best:  &quot;The Green Ripper,&quot; a dark and violent story of revenge against a supposed cult religious group, and &quot;The Dreadful Lemon Sky,&quot; a skillfully crafted Floridian tale of follow-the-money.<br />The remaining three:  &quot;A Tan and Sandy Silence,&quot; &quot;The Empty Copper Sea,&quot; and &quot;Freefall in Crimson&quot; are all solid contenders and may be a favorite.  I particularly enjoyed all the visual imagery of &quot;Freefall in Crimson.&quot;  Travis gets involved with hot air balloons, takes his first ride and falls in love with the experience.  You know someone is eventually going to fall, be tossed or otherwise have something particularly bad happen to him/her up in the air; but this just lends spice to the proceedings.  &quot;The Empty Copper Sea&quot; features intricate plotting and fine character development.  To my way of thinking, &quot;The Tan and Sandy Silence meanders a bit and Travis broods overmuch, but some folks count it as their favorite McGee.  <br />I am subtracting a star from the otherwise great collection because it is full of typos, far more so than the originals.  This is not a major deterrent for me, but some readers find it very irritating.  The book is well bound with an attractive dust jacket and a good table of contents.  A bonus is the left hand page always is entitled with the current story making it much easier to find your place.  This would make a good gift for a MacDonald fan.	2002-08-13

I would put it right up there with the best of them, \\"Green Ripper\\" and \\"Bright Orange Shroud.\\"  It boggles my mind that MacDonald could write the abominable loser \\"Turquoise Lament\\" in 1973, and turn around and write this sparkling gem in 1974.  <br />Carrie, a blast from the past, pays McGee a surprise visit aboard the Busted Flush with a suitcase full of suspicious money.  She asks him to keep it safe for her, keep a $10,000 \\"fee,\\" and if she does not return for it in two weeks, send it to her sister.  Two weeks later and no Carrie; McGee goes out to earn his fee.  Carrie has died in a car \\"accident.\\" McGee mounts his white horse and vows vengeance for the lady.  He finds drugs, danger, more action than even he bargained for, and meets a load of fascinating (if not righteous) characters.  He discovers an all too happy singles only apartment complex apparently fueled by marijuana and presided over by a Big Daddy who is the benevolent landlord.  A mysterious newly widowed Cindy Birdsong plays his Bond girl role, if somewhat diffidently.  The locale is all Florida, purely Florida.<br />\\"Dreadful Lemon Sky\\" is superbly plotted with a surprising number of twists and turns for a MacDonald book.  The character vignettes are sharp and right on the money.  This is a Travis McGee not to be missed.	2002-08-08

So bright, so charming--what a shame!  He's on the skids with booze and drugs, but going down gracefully.  Milo is a private eye who just got legislated out of business.  The divorce laws have been eased.  It used to be adultery and insanity were the only grounds for divorce in his state (Washington?  Montana?), which gave him a steady supply of clients trying to nail an errant spouse.  Now all it takes is \\"irreconcilable differences\\" to win a decree, and who needs a private eye for that?<br />The standard gorgeous lady comes to his office with a tearful request as he is consuming his lunch of raspberry yogurt and \\"office whiskey.\\"  Her brother OD'd on drugs and has been declared a suicide.  She vehemently insists he was murdered.  Her description of her sensitive, academic gentle brother does not jibe with Milo's recollection of the cold-eyed loser he had seen about town, but he has fallen in love--instantly.  He assembles his troop of bums, eccentrics and low livers to assist him in investigating the crime.  He discovers layer after layer of corruption and rampant drug dealing in his supposedly peaceful town of Meriwether that his great grandfather founded. He is neither surprised nor dismayed.<br />This is a novel beyond noir; it is a novel of despair.  Like Hunter Thompson's hero in \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,\\" Milo is destroying himself with clarity and precision.  The book is witty, humorous and lyrically written.  The action is intense and explosive.  But the undercurrents are always there, gray and dark.  <br />Brilliantly written and highly readable, put this book on your \\"must read\\" list.  You won't regret it.	2002-08-08

Murders,\\" written in 1936 stars Hercule Poirot with Hastings as his faithful chronicler.  A person(s) signing himself as A.B.C writes Poirot taunting letters advertising the locale of his upcoming murders.  And sure enough, his first murder of Alice Asher, who is a shopkeeper in Andover, goes off as advertised.  The second forecasted murder is of a waitress named Betty Barnard from Bexhill, and the third is Sir Carmichael Clarke from Churston.  Gracious!  Where will it all end?  Will we get to Zachary Zimmerman from Zanzibar?  Has Dame Agatha written the first serial killer novel?<br />To say the least, Poirot is troubled.  The little gray cells are working overtime.  Finally a gentleman with the intriguing name of Alexander Bonaparte Cust is arrested.  He was at the scene of each crime.  Witnesses identify him.  His typewriter was used to type the insulting notes to Poirot.  Open and shut?  Poirot is not satisfied.<br />\\"A.B.C. Murders\\" is a bit of a departure for Ms. Christie in that two of the victims are everyday citizens.  Usually, Dame Agatha only consorts with the gentry.  She has some insights that would do a modern day \\"profiler\\" proud when Poirot speculates upon the nature of the murderer.  The denouement is intricate, so much so, some readers might find it too clever by half (to quote our British friends).  I was enchanted anew at her cunning misdirection and the slyness of the murderer.  This one isn't just a whodunit; it is also a \\"howdunit.\\"  A good example of Dame Agatha's brand of sleuthing.	2002-08-08

It was especially painful for me to read because I not long ago re-read her vibrant, lively and completely mystifying \\"Murder at the Vicarage\\" which was written in 1927.  The comparison was depressing.<br />Hercule Poirot is teamed with Mrs. Oliver, a crime novelist, to find the truth of a 15-20 year old murder/suicide.  Mrs. Oliver's goddaughter, Celia is the daughter of the couple who supposedly entered this pact. For the first one-half of the book, we are not advanced an inch in any direction.  Many people are interviewed (the \\"elephants\\" of the title) and most have vague memories of the couple, as does Mrs. Oliver herself.  Mrs. O's dithering is not artlessly charming, for we are as confused as she. Saddest cut of all, the red herrings are not \\"herrings\\" at all. They are giant signposts.  Rather than Poirot gracefully unraveling the mystery on the last page, the reader has left him in the dust 50 pages ago.  The prose has a distinctly purplish hue. <br />According to the publisher, \\"Elephants Can Remember\\" was originally published as \\"Five Little Pigs.\\"  I do not recommend this book, because it does not do Dame Agatha justice.  There are 75 titles to choose that will far better reflect her abilities and why she earned the title \\"Queen of Crime.\\"	2002-08-01

The offices are drab, your superior may be a smart politico but absolutely inept in the office h/she holds, the paperwork takes precedence over the doing the job, and you always and forever Cover Your Backside.  Theoretically, the police department \\"serves\\" the District Attorney's Office.  In reality, the Chief of Detectives superintending five divisions of detectives is a far, far, bigger honcho than an Assistant Attorney General Bureau Chief who has a total staff of ten.<br />The life expectancy of New York's drug lords has been unexpectedly shortened in the past few months.  Five kingpins have been murdered.  At one level, this is not a cause for consternation; after all these creeps are not pillars of the community, right?  What is disturbing is the slickness of the crimes, and there is a suspicion that a rogue cop might be at work cleaning up the city on his own time and in his own way.  As the highly secret investigation proceeds, corruption is uncovered at higher and higher levels.  But where to go with the information?<br />Butch Karp, Assistant DA Bureau Chief and Marlene Ciampi, a lawyer on his staff and his fiancée are a marvelously realized pair.  He is moody, filled with angst, cynical but still loaded with integrity.  She is a firecracker, witty, fast tempered with an off-the-wall sense of humor.  Some of their exchanges are priceless.  Marlene (rightly) regularly gets fed up with the Great Man's moody silences and frequently galvanizes him with explosions of mirth, temperament, fury---whatever it takes. This is one of the most strongly written duos of the mystery genre.<br />While the situations ring true, the action is somewhat predictable.  You know who will still be standing at the end, unlike Jeffery Deavers who does away with your favorite character when you least expect it.  \\"Reversible Error\\" (somewhat oddly titled in honor of a subplot) always keeps your interest but doesn't give you that irresistible urge to peek at the last page.	2002-08-01

Clements is articulate, self-deprecating and an able Watson to Miss Marple's Holmes.  The locale is the village St. Mary's Mead; the victim is the detestable Col. Protheroe.  In their proper places are Flighty Wife, Handsome Artist, Ethereal Ingénue, Gruff Physician, Gossipy Maiden Ladies, Timid Curate, and Mysterious Lady.  They need no proper names for they appear over and over in Ms. Christie's novels with new names, but are essentially the same people.<br />Col. Protheroe is shot in the back of head while apparently writing a note in the Vicar's study.  On the face of it, this seems impossible.  Though there are people all about, no one heard a shot from the house.  No one saw anyone go near the study.  The maid let him in just fifteen minutes before the body was discovered.  A pretty kettle of fish! Two false confessions quickly muddy up the waters, and it is discovered that most everyone had a motive for killing the good Colonel, except Miss Marple, who, if truth were told, didn't like him very well either.<br />The intricacies are many, timetables are crucial, but Miss Marple is up to the test.  I particularly liked the leisurely lives and pace of St. Mary's Mead.  Everyone had servants, you could not move from room to room without being announced.  There is some nice humor that runs through regarding the surly maid who runs the vicarage.  She is a diffident housekeeper and appalling cook.  But the vicar's young wife determinedly keeps her on, for if the maid improves, Griselda fears she would be hired away from them.  The vicar bears up as well as he can.  People only call upon the police when they feel like it, usually after much discussion with friends and neighbors.  The lead policeman has the unfortunate name of Inspector Slack, and Miss Marple gently chides him while he disdains her advice (to his sorrow of course.)  The vicar walks everywhere because he cannot master a bicycle.  I guess a car would be unthinkable, because it is never mentioned.<br />It all works out to Prime Dame Agatha.  And lest you get too comfortable, she will definitely fool you once again.  As always---sigh.	2002-07-29

She is a 6-ft. mass of insecurities.  She is oh-so-aware of her parent's compulsive social climbing, yet is branded \\"the debutante\\" by her fellow cops.  She attended all the best schools and parties, but never felt like the \\"in-group.\\"  She has dropped out, dropped in, and is now trying to make a success in the New Orleans Police Department, living in the Quarter, unsure of herself with a totally non-supportive family who look down on her \\"blue collar\\" job.<br />Yet Skip is a likeable, bright gal who knows New Orleans like an oyster knows his shell.  She is on parade patrol at the height of Mardi Gras and is an eyewitness when the King of the Carnival, upper-crust businessman Chauncey St. Amant is shot while waving to the crowd from his float.  In full view of the crowd, a person costumed as Dolly Parton has shot him from a balcony on the parade route. Pandemonium!<br />Rookie cop Skip is quickly assigned to the homicide team on the case because she \\"knows\\" these top-drawer people.  (This seemed a little flimsy to me, but what do I know about the New Orleans Police Department?)  Enter the St. Amant family, worthy of Tennessee Williams.  Fragile, alcoholic wife, Bitty has a tenuous hold on reality; gay son Henry who adores his mother and loathes the late Chauncey; beautiful, perfectly mannered, but oh-so-wild daughter Marcelle; and loyal family friend Tolliver, who might be in love with Bitty, but then again might be gay.  This tattered, aristocratic family takes over the book.  Nothing is quite as it seems, and many twists and turns take place before the conclusion.  Then we have another fillip of a twist that smartly reminds us of just what New Orleans is all about.<br />This is an engrossing story with a few too many side stories that however interesting, divert us from the main event.  Ms. Smith has an excellent ear for dialogue and a good sense of the ridiculous; some of the incidents and confrontations are hilarious.  I would call this a novel with a mystery thrown in.  I would like to see a \\"straight\\" novel from Ms. Smith; I think it would be a success.  \\"New Orleans Mourning\\" is a fun and instructive read.	2002-07-29

Salinger	Books	3	12	12	N	N	Revisting Holden &amp; the Glass Gang	It was a pleasure to see a book published about J.D. Salinger's writing as opposed to a tell-all about the famous recluse.  The editors sent the call out to young (or youngish) writers for their take on JDS.  <br />Essays by Walter Kirn and Renee Steinke were delightful views of meeting up with Holden Caulfield from an entirely different background than the New York, prep, affluent Salinger character.  Mr. Kirn hails from a small town in MN and thought of Holden as a dashing sophisticated fellow while Ms. Steinke is a preacher's daughter from Friendswood, TX and saw Holden as a fellow outsider.  These were fond and enlightening essays that showed &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; was without boundaries.  <br />Lucinda Rosenfeld's &quot;The Trouble With Franny&quot; takes an in-depth look at Franny Glass and how perceptions change when rereading as an adult.  John McNally does an excellent job in discussing and illustrating the minor characters in JDS's work and how perfect the brevity and broad brush make even once-mentioned characters memorable.  Co-editor Thomas Beller made me think about what it's like to live in &quot;Salinger Weather,&quot; a closely reasoned, brilliant piece written with brio!  Jane Mendelsohn has an achingly sensitive article, &quot;Holden Caulfield:  A Love Story,&quot; about how her first take on Holden was a romantic crush, but deepened into a bemused love as she gradually saw the tragedy and despair of Holden.<br />According to the Introduction, the writers were given carte blanche.  Herein lies a problem.  Some of the essayists took this to mean a great deal of talk about themselves with the merest nod to J. D. Salinger.  One contribution was a fairish &quot;New Yorker&quot; type short story that had the heroine carrying a copy of &quot;Franny &amp; Zooey&quot; as the sole link that I could see to the author.  Another most unpleasant young lady was very proud of being young (a temporary condition at best), and allowed as to how she might give Holden a go.  <br />As all the writers are professionals, I was unhappy with the amount of self-indulgence displayed in some (but not all) of the articles.  Almost all of the writers were introduced to Salinger as required reading in the 8th or 9th grade.  Perhaps that is part of the problem.  Discovery by oneself is a much more powerful way to meet a new author, and your insights are your own.<br />The five excellent essays and a couple more I would rate as good workmanlike jobs make &quot;With Love and Squalor&quot; a good choice for a true Salinger lover.	2002-07-26

We have all known the type, but he is elusive as a wisp of smoke.  MacDonald does a great job of nailing him down.  The descriptive scenery was interesting and set forth in a very reader-friendly way.<br />Travis did not behave well and showed some monstrous poor judgment.  Perhaps this made MacDonald grumpy.  Travis's voice was lost through the incessant monologues by the author.  We expect a certain amount of authorly philosophizing in a McGee novel, but this one went so far over the line as to be mere self-indulgence.  Just when things are getting exciting, we get a three-page diversion about the inner-workings of a sand filter.<br />Travis has a few affairs too many, falls in lust with a girl called &quot;Pidge&quot; who has all the charm of a juvenile hysteric, and is so irresistible himself that merely his voice on the phone causes ladies' hearts to beat faster and pour out their innermost secrets to him.  We really can't blame Travis for getting out of line; his author deserted him.	2002-07-25

This maxim is even more true of that most personal of disciplines: poetry.  The choices of Jacqueline Kennedy tell more about her than the most slavish \\"in-depth\\" interview.<br />The book is divided into six sections: \\"America,\\"  \\"First Poems\\" (children's poems), \\"Adventure,\\" \\"Escape,\\" \\"Romance and Love,\\" and \\"In Her Own Words.\\"  Each section has a forward by Caroline Kennedy commenting on the selections.  The collection is diverse and eclectic.  Caroline's observations, though fond and proud, are quietly made.<br />Ms. Onassis shows a great deal of adventurousness, a surprisingly passionate nature, a wonderful sense of fun and wit, and a streak of melancholy.  Some of the poems will be familiar, like returning old friends; others will be a new gift.  She was very fond of Yeats, Donne and Elizabeth Bishop; all of whom can be both giddy and profound.  I have always thought Elizabeth Bishop's \\"The Art of Losing\\" (entitled here as \\"One Art\\") was only a poem for the very tough of soul.  The last verse:<br />--Even losing you (the joking voice, a gesture<BR>I love) I shan't have lied.  It's evident<BR>the art of losing's not too hard to master<BR>though it may look like (Write it!) a disaster.<br />Caroline Kennedy says the following Emily Dickinson excerpt \\"always reminded me of my mother,\\"<br />\\"Inebriate of air am I,<BR>  And debauchee of dew;---<BR>Reeling through endless summer days,<BR>   From inns of molten blue.\\"<br />What an evocation of elegance that is, and what a tribute from a daughter to a mother!<br />I received this book as a gift from my daughter.  It is printed on a fine grade of paper and has a royal blue ribbon bookmark.  I think it makes an excellent gift and is a nice addition to a collection of poetry.	2002-07-25

Travis has finally found true love, and she is snatched from him by death.  At first it appears to be a lethal illness, then horrifyingly a random sophisticated killing.  Trav is almost mad with a desire to find one face to batter and then to execute the killer.  To face the fact that the murder appears to be an organizational hit with no single one-of-a-kind killer seems obscenely unfair.  Travis follows some paper-thin leads, discards his identity, and infiltrates a terrorist camp sponsored by a cult religious group.<br />This is a fast paced book, one of my all-time favorite McGees.  I was struck by MacDonald's uncanny accuracy in depicting the terrorist personality way back in 1979.  The healthy young American soldiers in superb shape confidently believed their next lives would be vastly improved by destroying the civilization in this one.  They disdained, even looked forward to death.  One character tells McGee that the terrorists will not \\"waste\\" their rockets on military vessels. Blowing up a planeload of civilians containing women and children was far more \\"productive.\\"<br />The finale is a fine display of McGee's sniperly abilities, derring-do and just plain luck. (Rambo has nothing on him!) The only thing that dated \\"The Green Ripper\\" was McGee's reluctance to treat the female terrorists as anything but \\"ladies\\" no matter how fearsome they were.  Today no such chivalry (even if misguided) would be allowed.	2002-07-23

Unfortunately, he had little to do with the actual writing of this book aside from use of his diaries and tapes.  <br />Kropp is highly sensible as to what makes good copy and is willing to go the last mile and then some to reap publicity rewards.  It wasn't enough for him to ascend Mt. Everest.  He had to bicycle 7,000 miles from Sweden to Nepal and haul all his own equipment (sans oxygen) to the top.  The man must have the stamina of a bull elephant to even attempt such a feat.  He also has an insanely brave (foolhardy?) sense of justice no matter how dire his circumstances.  His bike trip was truly dangerous at times going through virulent anti-western areas such as Iran.  If kids threw rocks at him, he threw rocks back.  He chased one unfortunate teenager right through his own living room to give him a good pounding.  It's a wonder he wasn't killed.  To be kind, I would say his appearance is only average; yet Goran seems to attract gorgeous women who are willing to slave for him so he can attain his goals.   Many a handsome man might study him carefully for tips on his success.  <br />It was regrettable that Goran's trek to Everest coincided with the fateful May 1996 tragedy when so many people died on the mountain.  The book rehashes the oft-told story plus some basecamp scuttlebutt that I doubt reflects Goran's interest.  This man is so self-involved, I doubt if he would notice a tryst between Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts if it took place before his very eyes.  But the writer (who should pay Jon Krakhauer royalties for all the quotes from \\"Into Thin Air\\") undoubtedly thought these tidbits would sell some more books.<br />Kropp missed the deadly storm.  His first try was right before the storm and he came within 350 vertical feet of the summit before being turned back by the lateness of the day.  He was agonizingly weary and oxygen-starved, but incredibly made a second successful attempt a couple weeks later.  If the book had devoted more space to these two ascents, it would have been far more compelling.  By this time, I was shaking my head thinking he still had to bicycle BACK 7,000 miles to Sweden. This is barely touched upon, but he did it.  <br />His next grand plan is to sail alone (at this point, he does not know how to sail) from Sweden to Antarctica and ski to the South Pole in 2004.  Somehow, I think he will get the job done.<br />I found myself oddly charmed by this driven man; there is a certain sweetness about his eagerness to make friends and chat when it is clear most people find him an arrogant oddball.  There's always an attraction to a guy who puts his money where his mouth is.  I wish him well and hope next time he does his own writing.	2002-07-19

He has a knack of not taking himself seriously, but shining through is his tremendous joy in living to the hilt and exuberant satisfaction of being among the best at what he does.<br />\\"What he does\\" is extreme rock climbing, and these essays peppered with dollops of very good advice tell what it was like in the glory days of the `70s on the big walls.  A large part of John's enjoyment was his fellow fanatics, the beauty of the surroundings and, most of all, the burning desire to achieve the status of the coolest guy on the wall.<br />He starts with his childhood rambles (he had to be a prototype hyperactive child) and some sort of record, never once refers to a deprived misunderstood childhood.  He freely admits most of his parents' gray hairs are attributable to him.  He and his friends did not know the meaning of \\"impossible.\\" They decide to learn the techniques of climbing (but nothing of equipment.  \\"Equipment!\\" Who can afford equipment? and the next year they will somehow get to Mt.

A series of gruesome murders with the victims being left in the gay section of medium sized city have the police at odds with one another.  The higher-ups don't want the word \\"serial killer\\" even mentioned in spite of the brutal similarity of the crimes.  The victims are upwardly mobile, handsome young men who, if homosexual, are deep in the closet.<br />Dr. Tony Hill, a forensic profiler, and Det. Sgt. Carol Jordan are matched up to investigate these crimes.  Profiling was in its infancy at the time and so were women who were more than file clerks in the police department.  The old-time boys in blue had more faith in psychics and their mums than they did in this outsider pair.  The author does a nice job of characterizing this unlikely duo.  Tony, though a rivetingly handsome man, is quietly desperate about what he perceives as his sexual dysfunction.  He has even resorted to phone sex which induces horrible self-disgust.  Carol is a striking woman, used to vigilant male attention, finds herself in the unusual \\"chaser\\" role when she is attracted to Dr. Hill.  The \\"chaser\\" role is  unusually strange to her, and so both are uncomfortable most of the time. <br />The killings and torture are graphically described via the unknown killer's diary that is also sprinkled with red herrings and a few viable clues.  As usual, Ms. McDermid has a cast of thousands, so we are not short on suspects.  The drama of infighting among police officials interwoven with the urgency of the killings and the protagonist's attraction to one another brew up a pulse pounding pace.  The reader may have to take an occasional time out to come to grips with the latest horror, but other than that, it is a non-stop read.  The finale is brilliant if a little far fetched.  I just wanted to see justice served with perhaps a few people still standing at the end.  Recommended for those times when you feel strongof body and stout of mind.	2002-07-15

Their children, Chris and Emily, have been entwined since babyhood.  Under the parents' fond and loving eyes, the two develop into best friends and on to romance as they reach their teens. The children are so close they have a private language and can finish one another's thoughts.<br />Does this sound like trouble waiting to happen?  Indeed it is.  Julie is under claustrophobic pressure that she doesn't understand, and in despair, wants to commit suicide and have Chris help her.  When the police find the pair, Julie is dead and Chris has a head wound and is unconscious.  Suicide pact gone wrong?  Murder?  We don't know.<br />The story is told in two voices \\"Then\\" and \\"Now.\\"  We learn about the childhood, friendships and daily lives of these upscale New Hampshire neighbors.  With the tragedy, the friendship shatters, the marriages are strained to the breaking point, and Chris is arrested for murder.  <br />A well-written tale with a few wrinkles that lift it out of the ordinary:  Chris's defense lawyer is about as far from a father figure as you can get.  He is interested in getting Chris off and his fee.  He has no interest whatsoever in what really happened, thus closing another door in the boy's face at this terrible time.  My sympathies were with Chris throughout, partly because he was the best-realized figure and partly because he was suffering for all the sins he didn't commit, even if in fact, he pulled the trigger that killed Emily.  I stayed irritated at the four parents because I could not believe they would not even notice the deadly \\"fusion\\" that was growing between their two children and what implications this melding of characters meant.<br />This is a good read and the suspense builds nicely until you are totally focused on figuring out what actually occurred the last few minutes of Emily's life.  You know why, but not who.	2002-07-15

We have him in the bosom of his family when eldest brother Gerald, Duke of Denver, is accused of murdering his sister's ex-fiancé.  (The sister in question had not yet been told she was an \\"ex\\" before the murder took place).  The Dowager Duchess Mary makes an appearance and is all things to her hard-luck daughter and two so-different sons.  <br />The setting is a hunting lodge in Yorkshire where Gerald has invited a group for shooting.  Though they are clearly roughing it, servants and surface propriety abound.  The time is in the early `20s and much emphasis is placed on the bravery and experiences of the Great War.  Gerald is discovered at 3 am standing over the body of the late Denis Cathcart, Mary's erstwhile fiancé.  Mary exclaims \\"O God!  You've killed him!\\" in front of guests Col. and Mrs. Marchbanks, and Mr. and Mrs. Pettigrew-Robinson.  (Those names made me feel as if I was playing a game of Clue!)  Lord Peter is wired to come home from Corsica in hopes he can clear up the matter.<br />Lord Peter's task is made more difficult because clearly, no one is giving a true account of either the happenings or their alibis.  Mary, a formerly healthy girl, takes to her bed in a suspicious case of nervous hysterics.  Gerald believes it is enough that he has told officials he is \\"innocent.\\"  It is no one's business but his own where he was at the time of the murder.  It is important to keep in mind that among this aristocratic family \\"honor\\" to one's family, a lady's reputation, or a promise may be more important than life itself.  Somehow they all think they will muddle through.<br />There is much tramping about in the cold and the wet, marching over moors to not much effect.  Lord Peter has a marvelous exchange with a dour Yorkshire farmer as if Lord Peter had walked into a Thomas Hardy novel.  The uncouth and brutal farmer has a beautiful terrified wife.  Peter keeps up a lively conversation trying to stay ahead of the dogs being set upon him.  <br />The climax of the novel is the Duke's trial.  A Duke cannot be tried by just anyone.  The King must appoint a Lord High Steward, and he must be judged by his peers.  This involved all the peerage of England getting out their ermines and robes to participate in the trial.  It is richly described and a delight.<br />The conclusion is somewhat a letdown to the reader, but Lord Peter and family are quite satisfied that their little spot of trouble is over, even if all the questions are not answered.  Of course, I need not even say that Bunter was flawless.	2002-07-04

In a remote unnamed South American country, a world famous diva, Roxane Coss, is engaged to sing six arias (for a huge fee) in honor of fabulously rich Japanese industrialist, Mr. Hosokawa's birthday.  He is known to be an avid aficionado of 1) opera and 2) Miss Coss.  The host country is desperately hoping Mr. Hosokawa will build a factory that will bolster their failing economy.  Miss Coss sings the last bell-like note of her final song and-eighteen revolutionaries swarm out of the air conditioning ducts.  There would be no story if the President had been present as he was supposed to be, but he would not give up his favorite soap opera that showed on Tuesday nights in this land that was without VCRs.  The plan was to snatch the president, spirit him away and negotiate the freedom of imprisoned revolutionaries.  Now what?<br />The revolutionaries now have 191 hostages they don't want and don't have a good idea what to do with them.  Their first order is for everyone to lay down face up, perhaps not realizing that 191 people take up a lot more room laying down than standing up.  The terrorists are discomfited to see the cosmopolitan guests in all their formal finery spreading out from the ballroom, to the dining room, entryways, and alcoves.  The hostages who one would think felt extremely vulnerable in their exposed states, actually \\"experienced the relief of resignation.\\"<br />The character studies are unforgettable.  The kindly, tiny little Vice President, General Benjamin with a horrible case of shingles on his face, Gen the translator who wonders if he is anything beyond a marvelous aptitude for languages; Roxane the total diva with a wide streak of practicality; the soldiers, most of whom are little more than children, Mr. Messner the reluctant Swiss negotiator and surprisingly dreamy Mr. Hosokawa.  <br />The author achieves suspense of the highest order by the fine assimilation of her characters and their situation.  Our minds scream with alarm bells of \\"this cannot last!\\"  The friendships, kindliness and synchronicity must shatter.  The more they adapt, find friendships and happiness; the more I was certain something terrible would happen.<br />I note that some reviewers are very critical of the \\"ending.\\"  I was bemused by the \\"epilogue,\\" but the ending was no more extreme than I expected and beautifully written.  This is a highly readable book with characters who will remain etched in your mind.  \\"Bel Canto\\" is a great reading experience for a wide audience.	2002-07-04

He gives us a brooding sense of place in a Seattle that has seemingly skipped summer this year in favor of rain, fog and more rainliving in Seattle is like being married to a beautiful woman who is sick all the time.<br />Frank Corso, failed journalist and best selling true-crime writer, is obsessively private with an implacable sense of justice. (When did God die, and leave HIM in charge?)  He is coerced into investigative reporting when a witness recants her charge of rape against a convicted serial killer facing execution in seven days.  As her testimony was key to the prosecution, it is more than likely he is not The Trashman, a particularly hideous killer.<br />Sounds like a slam-dunk for a white knight to ride to the rescue, doesnt it?  Well, not quite.  Walter Lee Himes, the man on death row, is about the sorriest, despicable rag of humanity the author could conjure.  Hes ugly, slovenly, a child molester, has a petty crime record as long as your arm with a trash mouth that would even dismay the ACLU.   The City of Seattle comprising the Mayor, politicians, police and general public; plus the victims families are overjoyed that Walter Lee will breathe his last in six days.  It isnt enough that Frank prove Walter Lee innocent; he must find the real serial killer.  We are off on a breakneck, twist & turn yarn.  <br />Mr. Ford draws some interesting characters, first and foremost sidekick Meg, a photojournalist, Goth lady, and victim of a terrible crime.  Megs sadistic ex-boyfriend turned stalker captured her and tattooed her entire body including her face.  For some reason, this chilled and horrified me more than any mayhem ever could. It says much for the authors skill that you become far more interested in Meg than her tattoos.  Robert Boyd aka Fury, the tagger (graffiti artist) who saw something he shouldnt, is perfectly rendered as a kid in the hood who is the despair of his hard-working mother.  The cops and politicians are a little over the top, sometimes their motives and truculence hard to understand.<br />This is a twist and turn brilliantly plotted book, guaranteed to rivet you to your chair.  I thought the last twist was one too many, and a few characters that were uncomfortably close to their real-life counterparts (the newspaper owner a la Katherine Graham), but overall a fine read.  Ill look for more of Mr. Fords stories.	2002-07-04

This is the premise of Nelson DeMille's hefty (575 pages) ambitious thriller.<br />A group of 12 fiery Irish revolutionaries led by charismatic Brian Flynn have minutely planned to take four carefully chosen hostages, seize and mine the cathedral and threaten to blow it up at dawn the following day unless their demands are met to free political prisoners jailed in Northern Ireland by the British.  The hostages are the Archbishop of New York, the British Counsel General, a parish priest, and Maureen Malone, a former terrorist with close ties to Brian Flynn, but now a peace activist.<br />Mr. DeMille pulls it off.  He drives the breath-taking pace by fast cuts from Belfast, to the cathedral, to the desperate workings of the police and government to foil the attempt.  The military precision of the takeover is meticulously described (thank goodness for the map of St. Patrick's!) in fascinating detail.  Precisely drawn vignettes of the supporting cast as well as the major characters inspire the reader's care and interest in the outcome on large and small levels.  The author is wickedly adept at portraying politics at its worst when revealing the tangled motives of the Mayor, the New York Police Dept., the Governor of New York, the British and Irish Consulates, the CIA and FBI.  The revolutionaries are a complex lot, some with fire and vision, others stone killers, and some innocents that break your heart. <br />In one way it reminded me of \\"Apollo 13\\" in that you knew the astronauts would be rescued (historical fact), but you got so wrapped up in the story you feared for their very lives.  I know St. Patrick's is still standing in all its glory, but while reading \\"Cathedral\\" I so suspended belief that I gave 3-1 odds that it wouldn't be standing by mid-morning the next day!<br />The author does a better job of delineating men then women.  The women were not one-dimensional, but enigmatic as to their motives and reactions.  The men were marvelous mixtures of good and bad, bravery and cowardice, humor and madness---until you could see them standing before you.  I did find myself wondering throughout:  where did this rag tag group get the money to mount such a complicated offensive?  This aspect could have been clarified.<br />\\"Cathedral\\" is a satisfying read.  Call it escapism or just plain good ole story telling, I felt as if I was there every moment and had a total investment in the outcome.	2002-06-29

The quality is high, the big boys (and girls!) are represented, and there is all the variety one could wish.  Comedy, whodunit, cozy, wild, psychological thriller-there is something for everyone.<br />James Crumley's \\"Coming Round the Mountain\\" transcends the genre.  It is a story of dignified despair and is immensely moving.  I am going to try and find some other works by this author.  Joe Landsdale isn't satisfied with giving us a good chuckle or two over \\"The Mule Rustlers.\\"  He has to scare and shock us while we insist, \\"this cannot be happening.\\"  Peter Lovesey's intricate little piece of misdirection \\"The Usual Table\\" is very well done.  Archer Mayor's \\"Instinct\\" is a perfect portrait of the psychology of guilt. Mr. Mayor is another author of whom I must read more.  Stuart Kaminsky's \\"Sometimes Something Goes Wrong\\" reads like the nightmare you wish you had never had.  He is compelling and his characterizations are excellent.<br />I had a fine time with this anthology.  I read one and put the book down; then when I picked it up again, I read them all, one after another.  I am sure you will show better discipline.  All types of readers, even if they only enjoy an occasional mystery (I suppose there are people like that!), will get pleasure from this book.	2002-06-25

Box has more than lived up to his high promise of his debut novel \\"Open Season,\\" This time out, the writing is more polished, graceful and the plotting is more tightly controlled.  I also hereby award the author \\"The Best First Line Prize of 2002\\" I was hooked after this: \\"On the third day of their honeymoon, infamous environmental activist Stewie Woods and his new bride, Annabel Bellotti, were spiking trees in the forest when a cow exploded and blew them up.  Until then, their marriage had been happy.\\"<BR>Hard to resist, right?<br />Joe Pickett is called in as game warden for a sighted \\"livestock slaughter.\\"  At the time, no one knew any humans were involved.  This is not the story of golden haired environmentalists vs. evil developers.  There is good, bad and sometimes just plain silly on both sides.  But Joe gradually becomes aware that some seemingly unconnected deaths of major environmentalists have links with his cow explosion.  The action is fast, the violence sudden and graphic and has a gratifying climax.  I felt guilty about feeling satisfied, but I just couldn't help it.<br />The characterizations are extremely sharp.  Though Joe has a very low opinion of his abilities, you have to listen how other people judge and estimate him to get a balanced idea of his true worth.  Someone compared him to a Jimmy Stewart character and I think the comparison is apt.  His wife Marybeth (the consensus is she's a  \\"babe\\") is anything but a dim presence.  She is Joe's other self, and sometimes the wiser one.  The author handles the Wyoming scenery and ambiance like a master.  You feel as if he has stepped on every foot of ground.  <br />An excellent read, and I await my next meeting with Joe Pickett with pleasure.	2002-06-21

There are four main characters and three of them are possible suspects for a brutal murder. In spite of some chase and action scenes, the story essentially takes place in the police station, the police chief's home and in a car.  The secondary characters are hazy and almost faceless.<br />The protagonist, Julian Palmer, is by her own and everyone else's estimation, a babe. She has the usual beautiful girl's complaint that none see her, only her gorgeous exterior.  However, Julian is by no means all fluff; she is a complex slightly eccentric woman.  The reader is privy to her thoughts, but none of the other characters.  The legend-in-his-own-lifetime police chief, Winston \\"Bear\\" Edwards, about 65, is a huge man, powerful both physically and mentally.  He has a perfect solve record for his entire career.  Mrs. Edwards, Estelle, is almost as large as her husband is a commanding woman who keeps a perfect Victorian house.  She is talkative, strange, and repressed.  It appears that Mr. and Mrs. Edwards are almost afraid of each other, have many secrets both together and apart.  The last character is the psychic, Wayne Hill, a peculiar will o' the wisp man with many self-contradictions.<br />Julian has signed up as a winter intern in small-town Cannanville to have the opportunity to observe Chief Edwards in action.  Her first meeting with him is tumultuous first because of her name, he was expecting a man, and secondly because of his unsettling intuitive mind.  He has an unsolved murder of a 21-year old waitress marring his perfect record, and he is obsessed with solving it so he can go off to his retirement in a blaze of glory.  To keep his mind focused, he has graphic photos of the brutally slain girl pinned up across from his desk, so he can more readily concentrate.  He is so barren of clues, he agrees to hire a local psychic who claims to have insights into the crime.  Julian is very sexually drawn to the much older Edwards.  She cannot answer to her own satisfaction if he is deliberately drawing her to him, or if it is her need for a father.  Mrs. Edwards insists that she move from her motel to the apartment in their restored barn.  She has dinners with the couple and is baffled by their relationship and the miasma of tension around them.  <br />Clues pile up and point in different directions.  Julian is in a constant state of flux, first thinking the evidence points to Estelle, then Edwards, then the psychic in rapid order.  I agree that this whipsawing of doubt and suspicion is a very normal human thinking procedure, but when confronted with it on the written page, it is unnerving.  When the climax came, I was more relieved than anything.<br />Mr. Stone has done an excellent job with his four characters.  They are nuanced and intelligently done.  The interweaving of snow descriptions with the action is wonderfully apt.  The problem with the book is Julian's suspicions do not really take shape until the story is half over.  Then it is a helter skelter race to the finish line.  The story was badly in need of pacing and some of these elements of suspense and suspicion should have been introduced much earlier.  I think Mr. Stone has a lot of talent and a great deal of originality, but I believe he loaded his story with more baggage than its fragile frame could bear.	2002-06-21

This time it is autumn in Mississippi, and the mood as well as the weather is darker and more unpredictable.<br />Anna Pigeon has been promoted to District Manager, and though she likes the salary raise, is not quite sure of herself in her managerial tasks.  Throughout the book, she is exquisitely patient with the mostly subordinate Randy Thigpen, and deeply compassionate toward her other ranger, Barth Dinkus, who has grown up in segregated Mississippi and is a troubled, frequently unhappy man.  Anna is confronted with a dead man in his under shorts laid out on Grandma Pollys bed in the historical home that has been renovated on Park Service property.  First appearances indicate he might have been involved in some sado-masochistic game that went wrong.  Investigating the murder in cooperation with the Adams County Sheriff, Anna finds little cooperation from the murdered mans friends and family.  Even the dead man seems to stymie the investigation.  He is sadly the completely forgettable man.  The most common comment about him is there werent any harm in him when trying to describe him.  <br />There are many threads to this mystery, maybe a few too many, and it does get mired down in the middle.  There is a scene where Anna is seemingly pursued by a group of good ole boy hunters in the dark that is chilling in its grotesque imagery.  When Annas car gets methodically destroyed, Barr is brilliant in making sure we are sickeningly aware that the mysterious destroyer is using the car for a substitute for Anna herself. The finale is slam bang absolutely marvelous action.<br />I liked Annas quirky musings better than ever.  She doesnt do romance too well, but this makes her more endearing.  Hunting Season is very good Barr.  The imagery and locale descriptions are excellent as always and most of all, she puts a laser beam of knowledge in her character developments.  Worth the price in hardback.	2002-06-17

If you have been a little discouraged with the last couple of Prey books, now is the time for rejoicing!  Sandford has come through with a beautifully plotted, highly structured roller coaster of a book with enough sly humor to delight us while we are rigid with suspense.<br />The venue is St. Louis, rather than familiar Minneapolis and rather than battling through the sleet and snow, Lucas endures a heat wave.  The FBI calls him in on the case because of his expertise on the notorious hit woman Clara Rinker, who we met in \\"Certain Prey.\\" If there is any doubt of Clara's ferocity, Lucas settles it right away:<BR>\\"What if we busted in with our guns out, and Clara was sitting at the kitchen table eating oatmeal?\\" Andreno asked.<BR>\\"She'd probably shoot us both and throw our bodies in the septic tank.\\" Lucas said.<br />Clara and her Mexican fiancé were victims of an assassination attempt that killed her lover and unborn baby and almost killed her.  She is sure the perpetrators are a cabal of very unsavory (read mob) guys in St. Louis.  She sets out to pick them off one by one in fierce retaliation.  She is monstrously clever, and after all, her victims are highly kill-worthy.  The author smartly kicks around the FBI as they call in more and more agents to have more and more meetings/conferences while Clara goes about her business.  Fortunately, they have Lucas and some retired St. Louis policemen doing some expert sleuthing.  The pace is pounding; Clara's skills are worthy of Professor Moriarty, and the ending total mayhem.<br />There are a few too many characters, particularly the FBI agents whose names all seem to begin with \\"M,\\" and so many mobbed up guys, it's hard to separate the good guys from the bad.  The efficiency of Lucas and his over-the-hill gang strains credulity at times, but I was so taken with them, it didn't matter.  I read it almost at one sitting (very possible if you don't eat, answer the telephone, and can survive sitting in a chair all day).<br/>Join Lucas and bask in Mr. Sandford's cleverness and story telling ability.  This one is a winner!	2002-06-13

It is 1935, the hottest day of summer in a charming country property in England.  Briony has rather arbitrarily assigned parts to her young cousins who will be arriving shortly.  Briony, of course, has the lead.  Older sister Cecilia is readying the house for the party, as the mother as usual is indisposed.  Robbie, the brilliant son of the housemaid, is also returning from University, his education financed by Mr. Tallis.  The stage is set for Briony to put in motion terrible events that will change the lives of every person in this halcyon setting.<br />\\"Atonement\\" is written in four books, The Crime, The War, The Atonement, and The 1999 Reunion.  Mr. McEwen's prose is a delight: languorous, taut, whatever the situation calls for.  The dialogue is crisp and rings true for all characters.  The complete change of pace when we follow Robbie through the fall of Dunkirk is breathtaking.  It is that most excruciating military situation:  the command has broken down; all are on their own.  The Atonement itself has the hard clarity of cold winter sunlight on a city street.  The author has more to tell than the story at hand; he speaks of writing and the duties of authors to their readers, all without ever wandering away from the storyline.<br />I cannot wait to read \\"Amsterdam,\\" Mr. McEwen's earlier novel.  His writing is magical.  - And, oh yes, \\"Atonement\\" has a twist at the end that will shock and upset you for days.  Do yourself a favor, and read it.	2002-06-12

Jimmy Wing, a reporter for a small Florida daily has foreknowledge that beautiful Grassy Bay is about to be dredged by developers into a commercial/housing development.  It just needs to be passed by the Board of Commissioners.  This battle has been fought two years ago and defeated by the altruistic Save Our Bay organization.  But this time, it isn't a wicked outside developers; it is a local consortium, and things look bleak for the S.O.B. contingent.<br />Jimmy spills the beans to young widow Kat Hubble who is all things demure and honorable.  Just exactly why Jimmy does this or why he has a serious case of the lusts for this lady is unclear.  Jimmy is sucked into spying for the local power structure headed by delightful old rascal, Elmo Bliss.  I was so taken with Elmo; I was almost rooting for him in spite of his very non-correct environmental stance.  Elmo was one of the few whose motives were pure; he wanted power and went after it.  Maybe he went a mite overboard, but you always knew what he was about.  The Save Our Bay people were persecuted, blackmailed and put to rout.  Those left standing were sadder and wiser.<br />The story is a slow starter, and creaks here and there, but MacDonald puts in a lot of work on the characterizations, particularly Jimmy.  I saw a few stirrings of a pre-Travis McGee in Jimmy particularly in the latter chapters.  Motivation was seriously lacking.  Much of the time, the characters were not acting in their own best interests, but we are never satisfactorily told why.  MacDonald does shade the opposing groups well; they all have their share of vices as well as some virtues.  My biggest problem was I could not work up enough enthusiasm to care very much about the outcome. Grade C.	2002-06-12

Told in an informal understated fashion; it is a tale of great events and awe-inspiring violence both by man and nature.  <br />The Bas-Thorntons, an English family with five children, eke out a living in mid-nineteenth century Jamaica. (Father is handsome, but not a money maker.)  The children have an enchanted existence in this lush, tropical, faintly oppressive island.  They are busy from sunup to sundown with their own ideas of play, investigation and pretend.  Their lives are changed when a devastating hurricane demolishes their home, killing one of the Negro servants, and their half-wild cat, Tabbie.  The children are quite calm during the ferocious storm and interestingly are far more desolate about the loss of their cat than the human being who died before their eyes.<br />The parents decide the children must go back to safe Mother England to better structure their lives.  Most ships were still under sail at this time, and the children are quite excited at the prospect of magical England.  Mrs. Thornton worries that the children will pine endlessly at being separated from her, but in actuality, they are quite indifferent.  They have no sooner set sail than they are set upon by some of the most inefficient pirates that ever graced that notorious profession.  After a few weeks on shipboard with the pirates, the children are thriving, and the pirates are not.  Two deaths, one an accident and the other murder occur though the pirates are relatively innocent of both.  After the rescue, the pirates are tried, found guilty, and hanged.<br />The children endure great hardships and shocking sights, and the reader is taxed again and again with the merciless survivability of small children.  They resolutely see what they want to see, and believe the adults if it is convenient, but most of the time just plain do not care.  Usually, they have other fish to fry.  The author is careful with hischaracterizations treating the well-meaning mother and the individual pirates with same merciless clarity as he does the children.  This is truly a classic, and I believe every parent who reads it will have an uneasy feeling of humility at the close of the book.  Read and enjoy.  Read it to your children and be ready for them to laugh in all the wrong places.	2002-06-11

I eyed it suspiciously wondering if I had another annoyingly clever animal helping out another scatterbrained girl/woman in a mystery with all the suspense of who ate the last piece of cake.  <br />In reality, P.I. Rachel Alexander is total New York, rough edges and all.  Brilliantly trained pit bull (yes, pit bull) Dash is very refreshingly - a dog.  He snores, begs for treats, slobbers, and steals the covers just like dogs you and I have known.  All right, Rachel does get a little smug about his repertoire of skills, but other than that, he is ok.<br />Dennis Keaton hires Rachel.  His friend and neighbor, an artist, has been murdered via vehicular homicide and his champion basenji is missing.  Dennis feels the police have chalked up the killing as a gay bashing and have lost interest.  It turns out the artist was not starving in a garret; he was a very wealthy young man with a mysterious, handsome lover.  He was to have his debut gallery opening the following week.  Magritte, the basenji, is found under mysterious circumstances.  The clues pile up with the motives apace and the culmination of the action takes place in Madison Square Garden at the annual Westminster Dog Show.<br />The novel is seriously over-plotted with curious loose threads throughout.  She takes the dog with her to do some serious sleuthing, but he is not with her when she comes home.  She eloquently describes a Big Present she had to schlep to her sister's home, but that's the end of it.  Present is neither acknowledged nor opened, at least in our presence.  The good stuff is Rachel herself with her effortless dialogue, somewhat bawdy sense of humor and her easy interaction with all walks of life.  Many of the characters are gay and the dialogue is realistic and brisk.  The author does a good job of capturing New York ambience and just how miserable it can be in the wintertime.  Rachel sees this terrible weather as a test of her devotion to all things New York.  I found the sections on the insider's view of the premier Westminster Dog Show fascinating.  <br />\\"This Dog For Hire\\" is an excellent first effort and I will be looking for more of Rachel.  She never gets on your nerves and is excellent company.	2002-06-05

Who is say how the \\"accident\\" occurred?  Sometimes the body is never found.  A misstep, a quirk of the weather, a piece of rotten rock---all or singly could happen in an instant and be given as the likely cause of death.<br />\\"The Edge of Justice,\\" a debut novel, takes that premise and gives it quite a shake.  Protagonist Anton Burns, Special Investigator for the State of Wyoming and climbing enthusiast, is sent to Laramie to investigate the accidental death of a girl who fell to her death from a ledge in the mighty Vedauwoo mountains.  Anton is carrying a heavy load of baggage: he is under investigation for shooting and killing three men in a police raid, his beloved elder brother is in jail for manslaughter, and he has been exiled to the Cody office far from the action in Cheyenne.  When he arrives in Laramie, the biggest trial in the history of the state is in progress, trying two lowlife brothers for the brutal rape/murder of a young girl.  Anton and his faithful bear of a dog, Oso, after an idyllic afternoon rock climbing investigate the site of the climbing death.  He quickly ascertains that the \\"accident\\" was murder.  While investigating, he realizes a cover-up is in place and it is very likely the brothers on trial are innocent.<br />This is a fast paced novel that keeps our interest engaged.  Mr. MacKinzie is obviously an expert climber and does well in describing the almost lyrical joys of high altitude climbing.  One might say he devotes too many pages to the technical aspects of climbing, but I stayed involved all the way.  The characters are mostly one-dimensional, either very good or very bad with no ambiguity. Also there are far too many subplots and needless diversions.  However, the author has a good tale to tell, and he does it well.  I look forward to further adventures with Anton; maybe the next time will be a little more streamlined.	2002-06-05

Sitting around the fire, someone brings up the idea of presenting mysteries that only you know the answer, and the other friends must solve.  Guess who wins hands down every time? Yes, that little lady with lace mitts who is knitting little fluffy things.<br />This is a fine book of short stories and, as usual, Dame Agatha outfoxed me every time. Though Miss Jane publicly disdains outlandish plots (\\"undetectable poison from an African village\\"), her creator is sometimes guilty of just that.  The very few that left me less than impressed involved entirely too much running around, an outlandish premise, and an overabundance of purple prose.  <br />My hands down favorite was \\"Death By Drowning\\" when Dame Agatha shows her superb ability to misdirect.  Even with broad hints, I didn't come near the answer.  And never be certain that the villain will be punished, at least right away.   \\"The Tuesday Night Club\\" and  \\"A Christmas Tragedy\\" each have her particular brand of cleverness stamped clearly throughout.<br />This would be a wonderful book to have in the guest bedroom, but be sure to read it first!	2002-06-02

He let down and disillusioned everyone who came into his life, but as Ms. Sage says, \\"he didn't live long enough to disappoint me,\\" and she adored him.  Her grandmother, the Harridan, despised (this really is not a strong enough word!) him and never let him forget it.  She never kept house, nor cooked and mostly looked after her asthma.  She never went near him \\"except feet first-when she was buried in the same grave with him.\\"  This unlikely pair produced The Fairy Child, the author's mother who lived in girlish wonder all her life.  Valma had her mother's contempt for house work but also was imbued with the notion it was her \\"sacred duty.\\"  Consequently, her efforts were constant and the results indifferent. She could not bear confrontation, (small wonder!) and was timid to the point of exasperation.   What was important was what was on show.  Thus the public areas of the vicarage and the people in it were reasonably tidy, and the private areas of both body and home were filthy.  Ms. Sage lived with head lice for over six years, because none of the household would admit that she had them.<br />In this ménage, no one wanted to be a parent, the grandparents raged and rowed, the mother was a forever-helpless child.  Ms. Sage freely admits she was an unlovable child.  She whined and pouted and wept; her saving grace was her fierce intelligence and her luck was her beauty, both as a child and adult.  Until she was six, she lived with her grandparents until her father came home from the wars.  Her mother and father were perfectly matched.  He needed someone to protect and she needed the protection, but parenting was not in the picture.<br />I was amazed over and over at how Lorna persevered to get out of the stifling village life.  She made the cardinal error of becoming pregnant at 15, then marrying her 17-year-old lover.  She would not let even this become an impediment in her scholastic journey.  Both she and husband graduated from Durham University with firsts.  <br />Ms. Sage's writing is so personalized, spare with the driest humor, she is a living presence. She died shortly after being notified she had won the Booker Prize for Biography for this book.  I couldn't take in that this vivid presence was gone.  I am so grateful she had time to write this fine memoir.	2002-06-01

He was handsome in an unusual Jean Belmondo sort of way, arrogant, enigmatic, rail thin and intense, spoke little and modestly, dressed like a peacock, and had the gleam of destiny in his eye.<br />He grew up poor and rowdy in Currie, Scotland, was a moderate student, and discovered climbing when a young teen.  From that time on, everybody and everything took a back seat to his ever-widening aspirations.  He was flashy, determined and as ascetic on the hills as he was sybaritic on the ground.  He went from the Scottish Hills, to the Alps, to Everest in ever-increasing adulation, not the least of it from the ladies.  He was killed in an avalanche in Switzerland at age 36.  The stylish scarf he wore choked him.<br />The book gets off to an extremely slow start.  The first third is devoted to Dougal's early days in Scotland.  Intricate details are given of every hill he ever climbed as a lad.  Many of these elaborate facets could only be of interest to another Scottish climber, as there is no map shown, and the reader is not given a sense of the progression of difficulties.  Also, Mr. Connor is strangely ambivalent about his youthful subject.  The author is at great pains to remind us that a contemporary of Haston's, Robin Smith who was killed in a fall in 1962, was Dougal's superior in every way---on the mountains, socially and academically.  At times, I wondered why the author had not chosen Mr. Smith as his subject.  When Dougal gets to the Alps, the book kicks in and becomes a fascinating read about Haston's expanding skills and extreme climbing right on to the Himalayas.  The author focuses on the strong partnerships Haston forged and his hard work as a member of the team.  The book is at its best when Haston is allowed to speak for himself via diaries and journals.<br />Haston, except for his genius on the mountain, was not an admirable man.  He had no particular interest in money, but didn't care how he came by it taking advantage of his friends and forgetting favors. He was a wild drunk (for some reason the author backs off of the word \\"alcoholic,\\" which Haston certainly was).  He was at fault in a fatal auto accident where he ran away from the scene leaving the dead and injured on the road.  He left friends and family behind when they no longer did him any good.  In his own lights, he lived as he had to; his whole being was focused on the next climb, what and wherever it was.<br />Enjoyable and thought provoking with enough technical material to satisfy the climbers and enough human interest for the general reader.	2002-05-27

It is amazingly mature and a first rate police procedural.  Narrator Anthony Ryan is a complex, broody man with a heartbreaking sense of loyalty to his family, his partner, and his job.  When these loyalties are at odds, which they often are, Ryan's suffering is almost palpable.  He drinks more than is good for him, spends too much of his off time with the boys in blue, and gives too much time to the job.  His sensitivity to his patient wife's moods and anxieties is always with him like a rainy cloud hovering overhead.  Exuberant partner, Joe Gregory, is an extroverted, imaginative total cop who has stripped his life of any encumbrance that could possibly stand in the way of his ambition, high good humor, and complete devotion to the job.  <br />Though Anthony and Joe are born New Yorkers and the city itself is a major presence, the book has the flavor of the best British procedurals with its mean streets and melancholy detectives. Nothing is clear-cut and nothing is easy.<br />Anthony and Joe, while on surveillance at the Fulton Fish Market, witness a white barrel being dumped in the river by some very suspicious (read mobbed up) guys.  Joe is convinced a body is in the barrel, and wants full action taken immediately.  Anthony is not so sure, as the last time Joe got this excited, the body turned out to be a dog, and they are still living down the embarrassment.  Joe prevails; divers arrive and locate---the wrong barrel.  The rusty wrong barrel contains the body of detective Jinx Mulgrew, missing these last ten years.  Mulgrew had disappeared under a cloud.  Known as the King of the Bagmen, he had been about to give evidence to the Knapp Commission.  Smart money had it that he had taken the cash and ran.  Was it a mob hit or his fellow policemen?  Neither side wanted Jinx to spill the beans.  Joe sees the case as a shining opportunity to get his gold shield.  Anthony thinks it will be a can of worms.As the case wears on, sometimes it seems they are getting more cooperation from the mob than the police department.<br />Every page of this finely constructed novel has the stamp of accuracy.  Mr. Dee's expertise as a former NYC detective serves him well.  \\"14 Peck Slip\\" is entertaining, puzzling, and an overall good read.  Rating:  B+	2002-05-25

The bad news (for me) is missing out on these delightful stories when a child.  I always try to begin the Moomin tales in the middle of the day because I know I won't stop until the end of the story.<br />Moominpappa decides they all need an adventure, and he is most desirous of \\"taking care\\" of everyone so Moominmamma can rest and all can be safe and protected.  They set sail on an evening in late August to a small island in the Gulf of Finland planning to live in a wonderful lighthouse.  The island is strange, bleak and barren.  The lighthouse appears abandoned and is locked.  The Moomin family consisting of Mamma, Papa, little son Troll, and Little My all go about practical tasks of settling in, first a search to locate a key.  The living quarters in the lighthouse are at the very top only to be reached by a rickety spiral staircase.  Much to Pappa's dismay, the light is out, and he cannot make it work.  The fall storms begin (Pappa never explains why he didn't begin his adventure in the spring) and the life on the island becomes terrifying as well as bleak.<br />Though the Moomins get angry at one another, they are unfailingly polite and cooperative with the exception of Little My who is a cheerful, cynical pragmatist.  Mamma & Pappa are very permissive parents, but always interested in what Troll and Little My are thinking and doing.  The author very gently shows how perhaps there is a downside to sleeping and eating when you want, sleeping where your fancy takes you, and going on any adventure that occurs to you.  There is delightful comedy where the Moomins throw a birthday party for The Fisherman, and he discovers all his \\"presents\\" belonged to him in the first place.<br />Come, enter the world of the Moomins!  You might want to stay!	2002-05-21

In Montana terms, that is almost urban.  Billy Bob closes up shop in Deaf Smith,TX for a three-month visit to the Big Sky Country.  He does not explain how an attorney with an active practice can do this, but ours is not to question.<br />It seems Doc has offended every segment of society in his new home: corporate types, bikers, militia leaders, mobsters and the local law.  Billy's arrival is the catalyst that sets off brutal rape, murder and mayhem.  There are so many differing situations and motivations; it is difficult to keep score.  As usual, Mr. Burke is lyrical in his scenic descriptions, though in this particular book, I could have done with a little less.  There is hardly anyone to like or root for; Billy Bob is carrying such a load of anger and angst, it is hard to accept and sometimes even sympathize with many of his actions.  But there is no one like James Lee Burke to capture an emotion and crystallize it:<br />\\"I knelt in the back of the church and prayed to be relieved of the anger that still throbbed in my wrists and left my mouth as dry as paper and my thoughts like shards of glass.\\"<br />There are many characters and Burke makes each one memorable, if not likable.  The only member of the cast that had my wholehearted support was the local sheriff who retained his sanity throughout.  <br />I was drawn to buy \\"Bitterroot\\" because I enjoyed Billy Bob's first outing in \\"Cimarron Rose.\\"  This book does not have the centeredness of the latter.  There are too many angry people.	2002-05-21

The setting in the Nevada high desert country is well rendered and atmospheric.  The dialogue is crisp, though slightly portentous.  The characters are larger than life, but carefully drawn.<br />Neal is a member of a mysterious group, \\"Friends of the Family\\" who undertake quasi-legal jobs at the behest of a fabulously wealthy philanthropic employer. What looks like a routine child custody abduction  by an irresponsible father develops into a huge conspiracy that could have global implications.  Sound like \\"Mission Impossible\\"?  That crossed my mind too.  <br />Neal goes deep undercover to locate toddler Cody McCall whose father is tracked to a white supremacist group led by an unctuous Rev. Carter.  The group is training on a ranch in a remote Nevada area sponsored by the owner/rancher.  Neal quickly makes friends with some very fine citizens in the small community and begins his infiltration of the group.  <br />Neal has a present identity problem; it is if, as one friend says, \\"he has personality, but no character.\\"  He literally becomes his undercover guise.  The author doesn't pull any punches; Neal betrays his newfound kind friends in order to protect his undercover status, which is very discomforting to read. The villains are just as ruthless, cunning  and determined as the protagonists who include beside Nick a bearlike unflappable Ed, and one-armed father figure Joe.  <br />The action is fierce; the pace is uniformly swift and retribution satisfying.  I'm looking forward to more Neal Carey.	2002-05-19

FBI SAC Mark Beamon is a maverick whiz kid.  Author Mills wisely gives him a few flaws and a healthy dose of humor.  Beamon, a Texan, is a stranger to cold, snow and ice.  While he performs incredible feats of derring do, he is constantly falling down, running into trees when his car slides off the road, slipping on stairs---all of which take their toll in his intrepid chases of the bad guys.<br />Beamon is called in on an apparent double murder of a wealthy couple and kidnapping of their teenaged daughter.  In a small prelude, we are introduced to the family just prior and during the event.  The daughter is an All American dirt bike racer and the parents are devoted, proud and caring.  Mr. Mills has set it up so we care about this family.  Beamon rather amazingly uncovers a religious cult that may or may not be involved.  As described, the cult seems 80% Scientology and 20% Mormon (LDS).  The further Mark delves into the case, the wider and more influential the cult appears to be.  He loses his job, credit cards and is the IRS has frozen all his assets.  He is rumored to be a child molester.  His whole world is in ashes.<br />The story rushes at a furious pace with a few time outs for philosophizing.  Mr. Mills seems uncomfortable with his character's various degrees of belief in the Deity, but has turned most to the story's advantage.  Not entirely plausible and the solution is a little too neat, nevertheless, \\"Storming Heaven\\" is a satisfying read.	2002-05-18

Neither does well under close inspection.  Chief of Detectives Bert Farber has the unenviable job of being point man in investigating the street murder of new Police Commissioner Harry Chapman.  With the unexpected vacancy, Bert and two others are possible candidates for the PC job.  The mercurial mayor must make the appointment within ten days.  Bert hopes for a sensational arrest to cement his worthiness with the mayor.  The problem is the more we find out about the late Harry Chapman, the less willing the higher ups of NYPD are to have the investigation go forward.<br />This is a character driven novel where no one is very nice.  Bert, our dedicated detective, is stubborn, rude, and a bully.  His rivals for the PC job are wily old survivors of a seniority system, masters of the art of covering-your-a**.  The victim, a Kennedyesque figure, is a ruthless politico and womanizer. The ladies are by turns heartless, stodgy, or foul-mouthed, but all reasonably good looking if we are to go by Bert's assessments.  Because the entire cast is so unpleasant, the reader has a glorious opportunity to suspect everybody of doing the deed.  No one is exempt.<br />The book gets off to a slow start because the flashbacks of Bert and Harry almost overwhelm the present day action.  But once the book hits its stride, the tension and suspense are high.  Bert walks an exquisite tightrope between over zealousness and out-and-out criminal behavior, and even Bert cannot fathom his own obsession for the truth.  The ending was a small failure in that the pervading curtain of irony lifts to provide a sunny ending.  All in all, a worthwhile read.  I will look for more books by this author.	2002-05-18

The architecture, politics, and citizenry are bad enough, but my God, the weather is freezing!<br />\\"One Fearful Yellow Eye\\" is an intricate tale of \\"where's the money?\\".  Brilliant, kind, and wealthy neurosurgeon Dr. Fortner Geis had converted all his assets into cash before his death, and left his young wife Glory in a precarious situation.  The cash was not to be found and Glory not only faced the prospect of being poor, but heavy suspicion as well.<br />This is an intricate tale with an excellent whodunit complement.  MacDonald is sure enough of his Travis creation by this time to let Trav display a fine self-deprecating sense of humor as well as the usual speed, strength and purity of purpose.   The many threads to the story are all kept well in hand and dovetail neatly into a grand finalé.  The two stereotyped ungrateful stepchildren turn out to be not so typical after all.  The leading ladies have a hard time in this book, emotionally and physically.  My only complaint is that widow Glory was a bit much with her oh-so philosophical bravery and fawning adoration of Trav.  <br />This is superior McGee-good pace, characterizations and a very twisty story.	2002-05-12

She presents us with a story within a story.  Chapters from her tale \\"Little Mermaid\\" are interwoven with her non-publishable thoughts and actions about the murder of a little girl by Raymond Raintree.  <br />Raymond, a curiously young appearing man and perhaps mentally deficient, has confessed.  The prosecution has him dead to rights with hard, incontrovertible evidence.  The most expensive law firm in the area vigorously defends him.  Can there be any doubts?  Well, yes.  The reader senses something is wrong.  Raymond has no motive, no past, and no present.  It is as if Raymond has been dropped out of the sky to go on trial for murder.  Who is paying for his defense?  Sometimes he is totally withdrawn, other times voluble and fantastical about his past and reality.  Is he lying?  Does he truly not remember anything of his childhood?<br />Ms. Pickard does an excellent job of keeping the story taut and forward moving.  She is dealing with many characters, and they are shot with reality.  The ending is a fine, satisfying climax.  The introduction of the protagonist's missing parents is a mistake; it never goes anywhere and just distracts from the story.  But that is a small complaint.  Because of the child victim, the story could be painful for some people to read, and the violence is graphic.  However, I think most readers will find this intriguing mystery poignant and sad.	2002-05-12

Mr. Knecht has written a highly personal yet unbiased account, focusing on four boats, their skippers and crew plus some rescuers and meteorologists. Six sailors were killed, 55 had to be plucked from the raging sea by rescuers, and of the 115 boats that began the race, only 43 finished-many of them barely afloat.<br />\\"The Proving Ground\\" does an excellent job of giving us some detailed answers as to \\"What Happened?\\"  How could experienced yachtsmen expose themselves, their crew and their boats to a full-fledged hurricane at sea?  In this age of technology, were there not forecasts and why were the boats not seaworthy?  There is blame enough to go around.  The weather forecasts were, to put it kindly, confusing.  First \\"gale\\" warnings were issued, then \\"storm\\" warnings.  Which sounds more ominous to you?  In forecasting terminology, \\"storm\\" is the more dangerous condition.  Almost all the crews took the opposite meaning, i.e., that a \\"gale\\" was worse than a \\"storm,\\" as I believe 99% of the general population would.  Offshore racers are built for speed, not endurance.  After reading this book, I decided these fragile, complex sailboats are accidents waiting to happen.  I was in awe of the skill, quick reflexes and cooperation displayed by the crews.  There was a high level of seamanship in almost all of the contenders.  Only one sailor mentioned, a wealthy domineering man, displayed abject cowardice and only one boat that clearly refused to come to the aid of another desperately crippled contender.<br />\\"The Proving Ground\\" is intensely exciting---I read it in one very late night sitting.  Mr. Knecht postponed publishing long enough to get the inquest results and some later reflections from the people he interviewed so well.  Though he did a meticulous job on the four boats and crews the book spotlights, the other contestants and two sailors who lost their lives were hardly mentioned.  I realize the narrow focus heightened the intensity of the book; however, a little more general information would be welcome.  \\"The Proving Ground\\" is a highly knowledgeable, readable book.	2002-05-01

Could-be, dirty cop John Cardinal has spent a fruitless, expensive five months trying to locate missing 13-year old Katy Pine.  His credibility is suspect with his superiors. When Cardinal finds the missing girl brutally murdered in a mineshaft near an isolated lake, he is given the dubious honor of leading the investigation of this clueless, highly publicized crime.  He is assigned a partner who may or may not be investigating his background.  The killings increase in number along with the frustrations of the police force.<br />The pace picks up a bizarre momentum when the killer is brought into the narrative.  His machinations always are two jumps ahead of the authorities, and he seems hopelessly invincible.  This tale is for the steely of heart, for the violence is graphic and horrific.  Yet there are light moments as when the police are questioning a well-known burglar and asking him about his known associates.  Burglar says in tones of disgust \\"If I wanted to MEET people, I'd be a mugger.\\"  One of Cardinal's fellow detectives is a constant complainer, and his rants about everything from the Mounties to his ex-wife are brilliant, ferocious and unending.<br />\\"Forty Words For Sorrow\\" has an \\"it's not over till it's over\\" gambit that enchants me every time.  The suspense becomes well nigh unbearable, and entirely unpredictable.  I'd nominate this book for best title of the year and certainly one of the very good reads.	2002-04-30

He grabs you on page one and doesn't let loose until a few days after you have closed the book.  Even then, his puzzling client and the multi-faceted contract criminal, Zybo, will stay with you.<br />What begins as a suspicion of highly imaginative jury tampering expands to include Mobile's judiciary, a blue ribbon law firm, and law enforcement. None of the characters are quite centered.  There is not always a clear line between the good guys and the bad.  We get answers that open new questions and drive this highly charged story from climax to climax.  <br />Tom McInnes is a likeable protagonist, but contradictory enough to keep engaging us.  It helps to keep in mind Tom is a member in sometimes not-so-good standing of an Alabama time honored and influential family.  His daddy is a man to be reckoned with and is an important, if unseen, part of Tom's makeup.  I liked the reality of Tom being a reluctant lover.  In spite of psychologist Kai-Li Cantil's awesome perfections, Tom is understandably gun shy from a recent bruising romance.  When plot considerations dictate Kai-Li's hiding out in his house for protection, Tom is faintly irritated at too much togetherness.<br />Mike Stewart brings to mind James Lee Burke's power of describing lush southern scenery.  The tempers and moods of Mobile Bay are part and parcel of this fascinating yarn.  \\"Clean Kill\\" is an excellent offbeat thriller sure to win Mr. Stewart many new fans.	2002-04-29

The author and family lived for a decade in France where they enjoyed the services of their excellent cook, Clementine.  When war clouds broke over Europe, they were somehow able to convince this estimable lady to cross the ocean with them and settle in Marblehead Massachusetts.<br />Clementine braved the culture shocks of 1940 USA very well to hear Mr. Chamberlain tell it.  The mighty American supermarkets, the excesses of packaging, and the difficulties of a one-language nation left her unfazed and French to the core.  Unfortunately for her, the one language was not French.  I suspect Clementine was not as innocent and circumspect as the author believed, and I am sure at times was very lonely.<br />The occasional recipes in the memoir section of the book can be daunting to the American cook who is used to exact measures.  Mr. Chamberlain rather grumpily hints we should use our imagination.  I think I can handle \\"butter the size of an egg,\\" but confess \\"a handful of flour\\" makes me uneasy.  The recipes are not exceedingly difficult, though many are painstaking, and all will make a cholesterol counter wince.  The recipe for Coquille St. Jacques (scallops) is a marvel of simplicity and excellence.  The latter half of the book contains recipes with measurements translated by Mr. Chamberlain's wife and daughter.  Somehow, these lack the charm of Clementine's unexpurgated notes.<br />The book is lavishly illustrated with the author's charcoal and line drawings expertly done.  This is a fun book to own for anyone with a taste for provincial French cooking and warm-hearted memoirs.	2002-04-29

As America becomes more centralized and more anonymous; what do citizens do to give themselves a sense of community?  Mr. Sides shows us one way to overcome facelessness: get a very specialized interest and find some other folks who share it.  Then have a reunion, a festival-a party.<br />These fascinating essays take up the stodgy Bohemian Club (the most private club in the world), Airsteam caravaners, Tupperware Jubilee, Bass fisherman, the Church of God in Christ Convocation, Iditarod-the 1500 mile Alaska dog sled race, Black Hills Motor Classic-the big Harley ruckus in Sturgis SD, and the Rainbow Family of Living Light gathering -a reunion of the flower children held yearly in a U.S. National Forest. <br />The most boring group by far are our captains of industry, military and government who belong to the Bohemian Club.  In spite of their magnificent scenery, it reads like a board meeting.  The Airstream people are a model of organization; participants are color coded down to their socks.  The Rainbow Families pride themselves on their lack of organization and it is a true wonder they all manage to get to the chosen site at all, and then survive the experience.  The year recounted was spent in the stark Jarbidge Wilderness in northern NV.  It sounded about as pleasant as breaking rocks at Alcatraz, but all had a wonderful time.  I wonder that the good citizens of Sturgis don't flee before the onslaught of The Hawgs, all grown older but still with the sense of humor of half-tamed grizzly bears.<br />This is a fun book to read, and Mr. Sides has organized it very well.  He gives us a brief history of each organization, interviews participants, and gives an overview of the events provided.  He is non-judgmental, for the most part, and I commend him for bravery above and beyond the call of journalism for sticking it out in Sturgis SD, and the Nevada wilderness.  In Nevada it looked like you had a good chance of dying of natural causes (sun stroke, typhoid and hypothermia); in Sturgis, your demise would be sudden death by Harley.	2002-04-24

Or has she?  Three bullets? Colonel Tom put Detective Mike Hoolihan on the case instructing her to find something \\"he can live with, but not this.\\"  Yes, Mike is a \\"she,\\" a hard bitten veteran cop, former alcoholic until her liver gave out for good, chain smoker who most people take for a man when they talk to her on the phone.  Luckily for the reader, Mike is also a sensitive, observant, articulate person.  I say \\"luckily\\" because Mike is our first person narrator.  A few of Mike's observations:<br />\\"-Make no mistake, we would see it if was there---because we want suicides to be homicides.  We would infinitely prefer it.  A made homicide means overtime, a clearance stat and high fives in the squad room.  And a suicide is no damn use to anyone.\\"<br />\\"Sometimes I have the look of a grave child trying not to cry. ---it's more like defiance than self-pity.  When I don't understand something, it makes me feel defiant.  I feel: I will not be excluded from this.  But of course, you are excluded, all the time.  You just have to let it go.\\"<br />Martin Amis's edginess and pyrotechnical writing are all in play in \\"Night Train.\\"  But color the book dark, and call it noir.  I think Pelecanos fans might enjoy this one-there is a similar feel of recognition and resignation.  Five stars for the writing, three stars for existential ending.	2002-04-15

In \\"Winter of the Wolf Moon,\\" I thought depression was his middle name.  In \\"Hunting Wind,\\" I am pleased to say Alex has settled in for the long haul with dogged determination, a delightful sense of humor, and a trustfulness indeed rare in a full grown man.  I think Kevin Costner should play him in the movies.<br />While imbibing his favorite Canadian beer in his bar of choice in Paradise, MI, the Glasgow Inn, Alex is confronted with a blast from the past, Randy Wilkins.  He hasn't seen or heard from Randy, a former phenom left handed pitcher, since his minor league baseball days thirty years ago.  Randy has used everything but a dog sled to get to Alex and informs him that he wants help in finding the love of his life, Maria.  He hasn't seen her in thirty years either.  Randy had one idyllic week with her at the height of his career (he'd been called up by the Detroit Tigers).  Do any warning bells go off?  Sort of, but Randy is a silver tongued devil and enchants the entire Glasgow Inn (not an easy feat.)  Joe Lansdale would love this situation.<br />By some impressively slick detective work, Alex does by-God locate the elusive Maria.  Then we get into the \\"be careful what you wish for, it may be granted\\" scenario.  Everyone's character and story goes through massive shape shifting with Alex along for a rueful ride.<br />The dialogue is crisp and frequently hilarious. I have never read of an off-season resort town recounted so well.  I particularly liked the one knot left untied:  Randy.  Maybe I'll figure him out by 2005.	2002-04-14

The story begins with Watson and Anne Armstrong's courtship in December 1844 and takes us through their outwardly quiet, but inwardly evolving marriage for the next 27 years.  I am convinced this murder could only have taken place in the peculiarly repressive Victorian era.  Ms. Bainbridge does a masterful job of placing us in that period; from the household to the clothes they wore to the transportation of the times.<br />Mr. and Mrs. Watson were a match made in hell, both to be pitied.  John was an inward-looking, introspective, self-sufficient, gentle (yes, gentle!) person.  Anne was intelligent, needy, histrionic, and highly intuitive.  She literally and calculatedly drove him mad because of her disappointed expectations.<br />The last third of the book was devoted to actual trial excerpts.  I could have used less of these, as many were repetitious.  However, I found it interesting that the defense was clearly angling toward a temporary insanity plea.  Edward Stanton, later Lincoln's Secretary of War, defending Congressman Dan Sickles, later Union General, in a scandalous trial, first successfully used this defense in the United States in 1859.  Sickles shot and killed the son of Francis Scott Key on the steps of the White House for Keys' improper attentions to Sickles' wife. Sickles was acquitted.  From the transcripts of Watson's trial, you can tell this was a new and extraordinary defense in England twelve years later.<br />Ms. Bainbridge is the type of writer you would like to corner and ask, \\"What made you think this, write in this particular way, and where in the world do your ideas come from?\\" She is, as always, fascinating.	2002-04-14

Little sister is a babe (surprise!) and has her share of troubles.  Her fiancé has just been murdered, and she has found a stash of $10,000 that she fears he scammed.  Nina is distressingly a will you respect me in the morning type of young lady that rings no truer now than it did in the early 60s, and Travis famous philosophizing is really put to the test, however enchanted he is. <br />Nightmare in Pink is worth the price of admission just for the middle third of the book where Travis is captured in a private mental hospital and loaded with psychedelic drugs.  His hallucinatory terrors are brilliantly and horrifyingly described, and the after-effects linger through the entire book.<br />The plot is a convoluted financial scam that MacDonald loves, but doesnt suit Travis too well (Meyer is not yet on the scene).

MacDonald has a wondrous sense of place and you can feel the sensuous breezes and see the spectacular sunsets he creates for you.  There are a few creaky spots:  Nora, Travis's love interest, is so `50's lady-like, you expect her to be white gloved and hatted even in the shower; -- all characters are super sun worshippers while the reader uneasily thinks about skin cancer.  Be that as it may, it's a fine rousing tale with careful characterizations and Travis's philosophies served up painlessly.<br />Old buddy Sam Taggart, a three-year missing person, contacts Travis in dire need of his services as a salvage consultant.  The deal sounds shady at best as Sam claims he is the rightful owner of 28 crude golden idols dating from pre-Colombian times.  The hitch is 27 of the 28 have been stolen from him, and he wants them back.  Sam is down on his luck and appears to be on the run.  When he took off three years ago without a word, he left the beauteous Nora high and dry.  Now he is back to redeem himself.  Before Trav can get Sam and Nora together, or even decide whether he wants to accept Sam's offer, Sam is brutally murdered.  Nora hires Trav to find the killer, but insists on accompanying him (natch) when the trail leads to Mexico.  The action is fierce, retribution is swift and oh-so-well-described, and Trav and Nora find something more in common than Sam.<br />\\"A Deadly Shade of Gold\\" at 434 pages is long for a Travis McGee novel, but moves swiftly.  MacDonald takes great care in setting up his locales, which makes for lovely reading.  Though Sam exits early, he is with us throughout the book, and gradually an entirely different Sam emerges posthumously.  This is handled cleverly by friend's ruminations, and we are allowed to derive our own conclusions.  Travis is not yet fully formed; he's still pretty rough around the edges, but this novel sets the course for the future.	2002-04-11

The ships left, the aircraft flew off and the men were left leaderless without even a protocol to surrender.  Mass confusion ensued; the Japanese had vastly underestimated the huge number of prisoners and had few places to take them and hardly anything to feed and clothe them.  Thus the infamous Bataan Death March.<br />The Japanese culture saw prisoners of war as lesser beings.  The Japanese soldier was taught to fight to the last man, and that last man should commit suicide rather than be captured.  Consequently, the prisoners were accorded little if any humanity.  Also, the elite of the Japanese forces were at the front.  The prison camp guards were the lowliest, least skilled and educated of their troops.  Their treatment of the prisoners was mercurial, harsh, and sometimes unbelievably savage. Thousands upon thousands perished, most of the deaths caused by tropical diseases that felled them in their starving condition.<br />Almost three years later, when Japan was close to defeat, the Americans established a beachhead on Bataan.  The 6th U.S. Army Rangers, a crack force of 121 men were assigned the perilous operation of getting behind Japanese lines and liberating the American prisoners at the largest camp, Cabanatuan before the Japanese could execute the entire prison population.<br />\\"Ghost Soldiers\\" is the story of the liberation and the oral histories of some of the surviving soldiers.  The book is not a military history; it is the story of the men involved. It is told in a time-lapse method with the prisoner's life interspersed with the Ranger's upcoming raid.  The chances of success were slim, and the operation was shot with luck and almost miracles.  <br />Mr. Sides does a good and caring job with the information he has gathered.  The book has an epilogue of the \\"Where Are They Now\\" type that is highly welcome.  By the end of the story, you care for these men as individuals and hope the remainder of their lives made up for the hellish three years in Bataan.	2002-04-08

In his efforts to avoid the girl, Miss Agnes (McGee's blue Rolls pickup) plunges into the ditch.  When the two drag themselves out, the girl has disappeared and they face a long walk to civilization.  First they are shot at, and then arrested for murder.  Cypress is not a friendly county.  Travis hires the slickest of slick lawyers (who, of course owes him a favor) and is hell-bent on clearing his name, avenging a vicious attack on his friend Meyer, and finding the girl who got him into this sorry mess in the first place.<br />MacDonald creates two brilliant female characters, Betsy Kapp and Lilo Perris.  Betsy enters as a one-night-stand piece of southern darlin' fluff.  Travis is almost embarrassed to find himself next to her in bed.  Betsy first grows on Trav (and the reader) by her kindness, fastidiousness, and unfailing optimism.  Gradually her strength of character, bravery and loyalty are revealed and we are desperately rooting for Betsy's welfare.  Lilo is a swamp rat of a girl, possessed of uncanny strength, sensuality and a maddeningly mocking air.  She is the type other women instinctively loathe and men fall like ninepins in her path.  But by no means is she a standard femme fatale; she has streaks of generosity and kindness, but does she care for anyone aside from herself? Is the animal side the only side?  Somehow you want to believe in her.<br />\\"The Long Lavender Look\\" is one of the best of the series and a great place to begin your odyssey with Travis McGee.  If you haven't read it, I envy you your pleasure.	2002-04-07

If it were by anyone else but Jeffery Deaver, I would give it an unqualified five stars.  Unfortunately, JD set such a high standard for his Lincoln Rhyme series, (and lets not forget my favorite Devils Teardrop!) that this latest addition could best be called average Deaver.  The plotting is sharp, but he has done better and, for once, I anticipated most of the fireworks.<br />A ship full of illegal Chinese immigrants is steaming toward NYC and is spotted by the Coast Guard.  Rather than be caught, the snakehead (the businessman who sponsors the immigrants) sabotages the ship, which explodes and sinks leaving only a few survivors.  The Ghost ruthlessly hunts them down and kills them to eradicate any trace of their existence.  While the Ghost gallops through Chinatown and beyond, Rhyme and associates are just a step behind.<br />This time out, Deaver wrote in such a marvelous character, Rhyme/Sachs were left in the shade.  Sonny Li, a wisecracking, cynical, many faceted undercover Chinese cop completely steals the show.  I got bored with Sachs Svengali-ordered crime scene takes and, when not directly under Rhymes thumb, she appeared distinctly flighty.  Omnipresent Rhyme was bested many a time by Sonnys intuitiveness, which put Rhymes character off-balance.  The Chinese patriarchal information was interesting and was well blended into the story.<br />A good read, worth the time and money, but not ultimate Deaver.	2002-04-07

Rightly or wrongly, I always believe I am getting the real insider stuff.<br />David Remnick makes thoughtful selections in this anthology.  He has covered a time period from the `30s to the present, some very famous people and some you have never heard of, and the same is true for the authors of the Profiles.  I fully intended to make a leisurely tour through the book, picking and choosing a Profile here and there for a short read.  Once I read the very first one, Joe Mitchell's \\"Mr. Hunter's Grave,\\" I was hooked and read the whole book from start to finish.  So much for leisurely reading!<br />It is hopeless to attempt to select a favorite; all have their own merits.  I was particularly fascinated by Truman Capote's insightful piece on Marlon Brando.  Capote's flamboyant personality frequently overshadows his tremendous skills as an interpretive writer.  Jean Acocella's study of Mikhail Baryshnikov is an excellent in-depth study of both the man and the artist.  John Lahr's Profile on Roseanne is almost scary (or at least Roseanne is!)  Joe Mitchell's, \\"Mr. Hunter's Grave\\" is so beautifully rendered you can understand why The New Yorker never took him off salary even after Joe suffered the granddaddy of all writer's blocks; he didn't submit an article for fourteen years!  The New Yorker always said Joe had a \\"work in progress.\\"<br />\\"Life Stories\\" is worth it at twice the price.  Some of these profiles are unobtainable (unless you have a roomful of old New Yorkers).  This is a book you will go back to again and again.	2002-04-05

First declared suicide-admittedly a peculiar way to do the deed--- later changed to murder.  Tush owned a small marina whose acreage was a valuable parcel to the big bad business interests, and he was being squeezed out.  He left a shocked and bereft wife and three young sons.  Gallant Knight Travis rides to the rescue.<br />\\"Pale Gray for Guilt\\" was the 8th novel in the Travis McGee series, and I judge it as medium-good McGee.  Published in 1968, it has an excellent contemporary flavor about it that captures the late `60s very well.  The major flaw in the novel is the extraordinarily complicated sting set up by Meyer and Travis as revenge for Tush's demise.  The big businessmen are set up to take a financial bath, and there are pages and pages devoted to capital gains, covering margins, selling short, etc.  This has the effect of confining John Wayne to Wall St., not a happy or even very interesting state of affairs.  However, Travis does get to expound, and wow his usual lusty women. (this one named Puss Killian-would such a name even be allowed today?)  MacDonald allows Travis his special brand of sentimentality, \\"-went into the master bedroom and slipped out of the robe and into the giant bed and wished I wasn't too old to cry myself to sleep.\\"  No other tough private eye would ever be permited to think that way in print.<br />By the time this book was written, MacDonald had found his groove, though it was too bad he had to foist his interest in the stock market on Travis who, as we all well know, cares nothing about such things.  It never happened again.	2002-03-22

His fourteen short stories highlight his mastery of a difficult form of writing.  I particularly liked his down home remarks at the beginning or end of each story explaining a little about how he happened to write it and what he was trying to achieve.  King has the uncanny ability to talk directly to the reader, one-on-one as if you are the only person in the world.<br />The stories have been previously published (I had read the four that first appeared in \\"The New Yorker\\"), but I was delighted to have them in book form and reread them with great pleasure. For all you Dark Tower fans, there is an excellent addition, \\"The Little Sisters of Eluria.\\"<br />Not one of the fourteen stories disappointed me; they were varied: humorous, reflective, and scary.  If you think the Old Master might have lost his touch at scaring you sideways, try \\"The Road Virus Heads North.\\" Some particular favorites:  the title piece \\"Everything's Eventual\\" told by an oh-so-believable teenaged boy made this sinister tale poignant as well as inevitable.  King saw a handsome couple arguing in a fancy New York restaurant and somehow came up with \\"Lunch at the Gotham Café\\" (see cover of book for illustration.

We are inexhaustibly interested, and Daniel Defoe struck gold by implementing #2.<br />In this well researched book, the author tells us about Andrew Selkirk, the prototype of Robinson Crusoe, and his life before, during and after his four and one-half year incarceration on the Isle of Juan Fernandez (now renamed Robinson Crusoe Island.)  The island lays 340 miles off the Chilean coast, far in the southern hemisphere.  Fortunately for Andrew, it was a hospitable place, with fresh water, many goats and seals, and a temperate climate.<br />Andrew Selkirk came from a poor Scottish family and went to sea as a young lad.  Two traits were life-long with him: a violent temper and a propensity to walk away from difficulties.  Unfortunately, he did not keep a diary or journal, so our only direct information about him comes from others.  He was a good seaman, quiet to the point of being dour, and was careless with money.  He displayed remarkable self-sufficiency and physical hardiness when marooned on The Island.<br />The author's research into conditions aboard a ship in the early 18th century is extensive and well done.  To this reader, it seems that no clergyman had to explain hell to a sailor; one seafaring expedition was an ample description.  The provisions were rotten and scanty, the ships were cramped and barely seaworthy, scurvy and all manner of disease decimated the crews, and the work was backbreaking.  To the sailors of the day, the worst punishment was being marooned.  I find this hard to believe; I can't think of anything worse than being confined to one of those ships for 18 months at a time.  In fact, Selkirk begged, pleaded and tried to force his way back aboard ship when left on The Island.<br />Ms. Souhami quotes many contemporaries of Selkirk and weaves brilliant character studies of contemporaneous notables: a piratical rogue of a captain whocouldn't navigate his way out of a paper bag deserves a book of his own.  There was more of the ecology of the island and environmental concerns than I thought necessary.  I felt the book was weakest when the author assigned thoughts and feelings to Andrew during his time on the island.  As he left no writings, it is all conjecture, and I don't think Selkirk was an introspective man.  He probably thought more about where his next meal was coming from rather than contemplating the cosmos.<br />This book will appeal to a wide range of readers: travel, adventure, history and personalities.  Highly readable.	2002-03-15

If the sisters had been born a few generations later, their faces would be as familiar to us as Princess Diana and their lifestyles would be the joy of \\"People\\" magazine.  Even in the pre-tabloid days, they managed to corner an ocean of newsprint.  Any one of the six sisters and their parents merit and have had individual biographies.  Put them all together in one book whets the reader's appetite for more.<br />Lord and Lady Redesdale had to be and were larger than life to produce their remarkable brood.  Lady Redesdale (Sydney), as a young woman looks for all the world like an Edwardian Angelina Jolie.  She was a calm, devoted mother with the sang froid of royalty.  Lord Redesdale (David) was a ruggedly handsome, wildly eccentric, totally English Lord.  He and his entire family lived around and through his volcanic rages.  He could truly be called a tyrant with a heart of a bon bon.   His daughters' suitors were \\"Sewers,\\" and he didn't believe in more than rudimentary education for women causing life-long bitterness in daughters Nancy and Jessica.  Though the family (and Ms. Lovell) insists it was a \\"game,\\" Lord R. would set his bloodhound on his daughters to find them when they rambled the huge estate.  <br />All of the sisters were beautiful.  I realize this is an overworked word, but in their cases, it was amazingly true-not one ugly duckling in the bunch.  All except Nancy inherited their father's blazing blue eyes and their mother's lovely golden hair.  Nancy was a green-eyed brunette, elegant as a greyhound.  All had innate writing ability, and Nancy and Jessica were extraordinarily successful authors; Nancy with novels and biographies (\\"Love in a Cold Climate\\") and Jessica more the journalist (\\"An American way of Death\\").<br />Diana, the great beauty, first married a Guinness heir and then abandoned him for the love of her life, fascist and greatly hated Sir Oswald Mosley.  She and her husband spentthree years during World War II in prison as traitors.  Strange Unity developed a fixation on Adolph Hitler and fascism.  She announced she would kill herself if war broke out between her beloved England and Germany.  When that event occurred, Unity shot herself in the head and tragically lived, mentally impaired for another six years.  Jessica (Decca), the fieriest of the girls, started her \\"Running Away\\" fund when she was eight years old.  When she was 19, she eloped with Winston Churchill's nephew (age 17) to serve with the Communist revolutionaries in Spain.  Heads of State searched frantically for the youngsters, and when they were found, Jessica prevailed.  Pamela was always labeled the \\"quiet\\" one; she loved the country and horses, married a brilliant man and remained excellent friends with him even after they were divorced and he subsequently married five more times.  Deborah (Debo), most like her mother, calm and gracious became the grandest lady of them all, the Duchess of Devonshire.  <br />Ms. Lovell's scholarship and research are impeccable and she writes in a very lively, but even-toned manner.  I felt a little too much space was awarded Jessica; I would have liked Nancy to have equal time.  Deborah was very discreetly handled; perhaps because she was still living at the time the book was written and had strong opinions (and probably control) of what was written.  It is rare that a biography is termed a \\"page-turner,\\" but that is exactly what \\"The Sisters\\" is.  Very enjoyable.<br />-sweetmolly-	2002-03-13

Policeman Tommy O'Conner, a townie who knows every inch of Northampton and can't imagine being anywhere else, serves as the author's master of ceremonies.  Mr. Kidder's depiction of Tommy is so well etched, he comes alive for me in the memory of all the redheaded, rowdy, Catholic boys I knew in another New England town.  Laura, a single welfare mother is a full time student at Smith.  She is positioned between the enlightened guidance of Smith and the humiliating bureaucracy of welfare and the stress is well nigh intolerable.  Admittedly the oxymoron of a Smith student on welfare struck me as bizarre.  Mike Ryan is a District Judge, old family Northampton and like Tommy cannot imagine himself anywhere else, but for entirely different reasons.  Alan, a wealthy man who suffers from an extremely severe Compulsive/Obsessive Disorder is in some ways the town eccentric.  He wears plastic bags over his hands in order not to contaminate himself.  He is also a fascinating, brilliant man and is fortunate that Northampton treats him with dignity and forbearance.  These real people allow us to see different sides of Northampton.<br />I do not think the author gives enough weight to Smith College's pervading influence on the town of Northampton.  It is Smith that draws in the intellectual community, provides much of Northampton's employment, and creates an environment for the growth of community activists, partisans and different life-styles.  The highly praised renovated downtown area would not have come about without the support of Smith and its students.  Downtown has expensive boutiques, fine restaurants, bookstores, art galleries and trendy lofts in which to live.  The \\"townies\\" shop in the strip malls.<br />Mr. Kidder amply describes the beauty of the Pioneer Valley and the jewel like setting of Northampton.  But before you pack your bags (and do remember to bring your snowshoes!) to move posthaste to Northampton, keep in mind it is expensive, hard to find employment and the nearest town of any size is Springfield, MA.<br />A very enjoyable and interesting read.<BR>-sweetmolly-	2002-03-10

Though the basic plot is familiar: an unknown predator is stalking, planning, and killing----nothing prepares even the most jaded reader for what follows.<br />Fifteen years ago, 10-year old Susan Kendall was callously murdered leaving her family who include her twin brother Rouge, devastated with grief.  When two local ten-year old girls go missing, it looks like history is repeating itself.  The modus operendi seems to be that the second child (the Judas Child) is tricked into luring the first child (the princess child) to a rendezvous where the killer summarily disposes Child #2 and keeps the Princess alive until such time as would cause the parents, family and friends the maximum grief.  (Usually Christmas Day)<br />Ms. O'Connell captures the two little girls Sadie and Gwen brilliantly.  Sadie is everything we would have always wanted as a childhood best friend: fearless, inventive, a trickster of the first order, intensely loyal and an expert on every horror film ever made.  Gwen is a highly intelligent, sensitive, very sheltered little girl who is not near the coward she thinks she is.  <br />The adult characters are each so sharply drawn; any one of them could be considered the protagonist.  Rouge Kendall, in his detachment, almost appears Christ-like.  The sensuous, horribly scarred Ali is a driven dynamo (Question: is wearing a long slit skirt, barelegged with very high heels in the winter time really sexy?  I kept thinking how breezy this type of getup would be and wouldn't her feet hurt?)   Dr. Mortimer is so bound in his rigid ethics, is he insane?  The wrongly convicted priest is a symphony in complicated disbelief, and the FBI agent, Arnie, has so many facets, he is a kaleidoscope.<br />The resolution of this strange tale is so subjective and strange; the reader will frenetically go back to chapters to redefine what they have read to reassure themselves their senses are in place.  You can't ask much more from a book than that.	2002-03-08

She has attempted K2, the roughest of the big ones; Gasherbrum II, the north face of Kanchenjunga, and Everest without supplementary oxygen.  In other words, she's won her spurs.<br />The narrative device is the author telling her story and thoughts to a hitchhiker.  This is supposedly the staging area for each chapter.  It is not a successful mechanism and seems needlessly contrived.  The book takes a few scenes from Kanchenjunga where Ms. Howkins found romance with a Spanish climber, a brief narrative of her first K2 climb with her ex-husband, who appears to be a certified mad man, and the remainder is devoted to her second K2 climb, Project K2000.<br />The book badly needs organization; the reader is frequently confused about what expedition she is talking about, and continuity is completely absent.  While reading, I had the impression she was lifting passages from her private journals and entering them in a scattershot fashion.  I later found out that almost the entire section on Project K2000 had first appeared in Mountain Zone.  The author barely characterizes her teammates on Project K2000; she doesn't even give their last names.  It is as if Ms. Howkins was confronting faceless enemies.  I have read many times about how difficult it is for women climbers to be accepted in the male fraternity of mountaineers, but the treatment Ms. Howkins endured was appalling:  ignoring her, referring to her by obscene names, trashing her tent.  I couldn't believe well-educated, civilized men would behave in such a fashion toward the one lone woman on their team.  She states that if she had been a wife or companion of one of the members, there probably would have been less friction.<br />I found Ms. Howkins likeable, smart and perceptive with a flair for the lyrical.  However, the book lacks a focus and seems hastily put together.  C-	2002-03-06

I sincerely hope the series was better than the book and the \\"website.\\"  I am not sure if  \\"author\\" Joyce Reardon is in fact Stephen King, but somehow I doubt it.  Though SK has a fascination with houses that develop their own personalities, and he has highly praised Shirley Jackson's \\"The Haunting of Hill House\\" as the best mystery ever written, \\"Dairy\\" lacks King's cleverness, and his ability to scare you into next week.<br />The title character is right out of a Victorian novel that talks the talk (and then some!) and walks the walk.  She marries a fabulously wealthy Mr. Rochester type whom she eventually despises.  He builds the extraordinary Rose Red that is to be the most magnificent structure in turn-of-the century Seattle, and Ellen is taken there as a bride.  It slowly develops that Rose Red has an appetite for growth that must be appeased or calamity befalls the unwary visitors and certain inhabitants.  Our heroine does a lot of fainting and coping and trying to find her way around the increasingly unwieldy mansion with the help of her Nubian maid, Sukeena.  Sweet Ellen develops a fairly all-encompassing sexual appetite of her own while bravely keeping up her ladylike sensibilities.  Mr. Rimbauer's fears, swinish lust, and poor comportment are in tandem with Ellen's ever-widening perceptions.  Rose Red becomes a monstrosity, and all are ruined (more or less.) <br />\\"The Diary\\" needs to be a little more funny, or scary, or sarcastic.  As it is, it is just a silly story in the penny dreadful category.	2002-03-06

Just when I think I have seen every possible setting, hero/anti-hero, cozy, hard-boiled, police procedural out there; along comes \\"Open Season\\" with something new and fresh.  Joe Pickett is as nice as they come, but prone to embarrassing errors.  His family plays a starring role, not only with him but also as an integral part of the story.  His wife and two daughters don't play cute characters or trite supporting roles; there would be no story without them.<br />Edgar-nominated, Mr. Box's debut novel is set in a Wyoming that could only be written by a native.  Someone said a writer should write what he knows about; Mr. Box has followed the advice.  He makes Wyoming so real, you can smell the air and feel the forest.  He is also honest enough to admit all parts of Wyoming are not nature's paradise, but strikingly ugly.  He understands and depicts the particular politics that are unique to small or under-populated states.  When almost everyone is on a first name basis with the governor, everyone is in on some kind of a deal or another.  <br />Joe is particularly shocked and offended when a body is found on his backyard woodpile.  When three other bodies are found at the victim's outfitters camp, the case is closed quickly and neatly as a falling out among the four of them.  Joe is not satisfied, no one is quite who they seem to be, and corruption at every level is gradually exposed.  The closer Joe comes to a solution, the more his family is endangered until tension is at the snapping point. <br />\\"Open Season\\" has an agenda:  the Endangered Species Act and is it a well thought out piece of legislation.  Mr. Box thinks not, and whatever the reader believes, the book will give them something to consider.  The characterizations are excellent; I was surprised at how much I cared.  \\"Open Season\\" has my vote for the best mystery of the year.	2002-02-26

The New Yorker is also famous for unbelievably long pieces (sometimes taking up the entire magazine) and occasionally being so \\"in\\" that the readers are left \\"out.\\"<br />John Lahr has all of the virtues: elegant, thoughtful writing, and he leaves you wishing for more.  Mr. Lahr specializes in Entertainment Profiles, a difficult undertaking.  He avoids the landmines of sound-bytes, scurrility, fawning and trivia.  He delivers fifteen gleaming, sharp-edged Profiles on disparate personalities.  <br />I feel the best are the ones that are not contemporaries and/or friends of the author with the exception of the lovely word portraits of his parents, father Bert, and mother Millie (who might or might not have had an affair with Joseph Cotton!)  Mr. Lahr needs a certain amount of distance to do his best work.  He is clearly an admirer of Woody Allen, and it shows.  I felt we were seeing the brushed up and shiny side of this highly complex entertainer.  Bob Hope is given the finest dispassionate treatment; Lahr steps back and allows Mr. Hope produce his own cause and effect.  The reader can judge for himself.  I was left thinking, as my grandmother would say, \\"this is NOT a very nice man.\\"  To me, Roseanne was frightening with her rage and skewed perspectives. It wasn't what Mr. Lahr said about her; it was Roseanne being herself.  The Profile on Frank Sinatra left me with a emotion I would never, ever thought possible in conjunction with Ole Blue Eyes:  pity.<br />I read this book straight through, almost at one sitting.

Marty is not, as you might expect, the clever, righteous, hard driving defense attorney; he is a lawyer's nightmare of a client (except he can pay the fees).  Did he do the deed?<br />The tale begins with Marty gazing longingly at the home of his lover, the beauteous Rachel Reinardt who has told him of her wealthy husband's escalating abuse.  While Marty watches, Rachel comes into view disheveled with cuts and bruises on her face. Her enraged husband closely follows her, gun in hand, throws her to the floor and leaps upon her.  Marty grabs a bench and crashes through the locked sliding glass door.  Two shots are fired.  The husband is dead, and Marty vows Rachel will be safe from here on.  He drags the body away from the scene, barely ahead of the police, and buries it.  Within two weeks, Marty is called in for questioning.<br />Marty is introspective, detached, highly imaginative, and he is telling us the story.  He flashes back to achingly vivid scenes with Rachel, while going about his daily life as a highly paid market analyst.  He is screamingly tense while trying to maintain an aura of normality with his friends and co-workers.  When the police pick him up on suspicion, his sole purpose seems to be to shield Rachel, going so far as to \\"confess\\" to one of the detectives.  Then he proceeds to hire the best defense attorney in town.  At the behest of his attorney, he recants his confession and pleads not guilty.<br />Did Marty kill Dr. Reinardt?  Did he really have an affair with Rachel, or is he merely a lovesick voyeur?  If he killed Dr. Reinardt, can it be proved it was \\"in defense of another\\"?  Marty is an extremely busy fellow before and during the trial, and some of his actions are totally mysterious.  But the fireworks are in the courthouse while Marty tries desperately to judge the effectiveness of his high-priced lawyer as if he is watchinga tennis match where the stakes are his life.<br />\\"Line of Vision\\" is engrossing, intricate, and a page-turner of the first order.  Author/Attorney Ellis brings not only drama, but also expertise to his story.  Marty will surprise you over and over again.  This is one book where you can truly say, \\"it ain't over until it's over.\\"	2002-02-26

They cover a time span from 1968 - 1986, and though most are on mountaineering, one of the best is on white water rafting.  Mr. Roberts has divided the book into three sections:  Adventures, Profiles and Reflections.  I confess I wasn't looking forward to \\"Reflections.\\"  Most climbers are not at their best at \\"reflecting\\" on anything.  They find it difficult to achieve that fine balance between false modesty and arrogance.  Dave Roberts is a happy surprise.  He pulls no punches and has a reporter's eye for the absurd.  One of the intriguing Reflections, \\"Boulders and Gunks\\" compares young climbers in the mid-80's to youngsters of his own era, the late `60's. <br />In the Adventure section, \\"Rafting with the BBC\\" tell us the differences between the actual hair-raising exploit and what you see on the TV-sometimes funny, sometimes maddening.  I have read other accounts of sponsorship by the BBC; it must be like finding out your roommate is a strong-minded elephant.  \\"Kilimanjaro:  A Third World Adventure\\" is a perceptive writing of a mountain, not often mentioned by climbers because it is not considered \\"difficult.\\"  Now, to you and me, the thought of climbing Kilimanjaro might be right up there with bull riding, but to climbers, \\"difficult\\" is something like K-2.  Also, the only way the local government allowed you to climb was with a guide and as part of a group, a somewhat embarrassing outing for a world-class climber. <br />My favorite Profile \\"The Mechanical Boy Comes Back,\\" is the story of Hugh Herr, a brilliant, but obsessed 18-year old climber, who with a friend became lost in the New Hampshire mountains and spent three days and three nights in the below zero temperatures.  Hugh subsequently lost his leg up to the thigh due to frostbite.  His comeback was miraculous.  He refused to quit because of his disability and designed various prostheses so he could climb again, which he did with great success.  I was so taken with the account, I had to find out what became of Hugh after 1983 when the article was written.  Checking out the Internet, I found Hugh is now Dr. Herr, a PhD who is well known in his field and has a business designing prosthetic devices.<br />This is not just a book for climbing wannabes, or adventure junkies; all the writings stand on their own, are thought provoking and enjoyable.	2002-02-22

The idea is to give the kids a good education without the cutthroat competitiveness of the Asian school system, and ready them for admission to top U.S. colleges.  The pressure is intense on these youngsters as they are expected to not only maintain the highest of grade point averages, but also take on huge responsibilities of self-supervision and avoid the temptations that are not beyond their financial means, but are way beyond their judgment.  These children are known as \\"parachute kids.\\"<br />The story opens with the murder of 17-year old Marina Lu at the wheel of her Lexus, an apparent car jacking gone wrong in a mall parking lot.  She has been shopping for her ten bridesmaids gowns. Enter Eve Diamond, an L.A. Times reporter, who catches the story.  Eve is a fully realized character, a total professional on the job and very vulnerable in other areas.  Her well-developed libido is somewhat alarming, for she is nothing if not impulsive.  She follows the trail by fits and starts getting to know and appreciate Marina's friends, a dedicated youth counselor that may or may not be a love interest, and running into some high and hard rollers in the Asian community.  Unfortunately, the story peaks prematurely and the last quarter of the book is spent tying up loose ends.<br />Ms. Hamilton gives us a crackerjack portrait of the life of a newspaper reporter.  She clearly knows the ins and outs of the trade.  She draws an excellent picture of an almost 30-something woman and how she lives and dreams.  Eve has an excellent sense of humor and is too imaginative by half.  She has the makings of a good series character, and it looks like this is what is intended.  This good start could have used some tightening up and better pacing; perhaps more experience will give Eve a smoother ride.	2002-02-22

This 51st 87th precinct mystery has all the snap and crackle of a brand new series and is as up to date as the evening news.  Edgar-nominated \\"Money, Money, Money\\" effortlessly weaves an eerily prophetic terrorist plot, a CIA-like sting, a routine burglary, and a complex drug empire into an explosive read.  The dialogue is crisp and frequently hilarious.  The only thing that stays the same is the perennial youthfulness of the continuing characters.  To those of us who have read all or almost all of the series, it does bring a smile to read that Bert Klinger, who was a rookie detective since 1960, has no memory of pop stars pre-1970.<br />Steve Carella displays some rarely seen human failings.  He cannot get over his bitterness at his father's violent death and refuses to accept his family's moving forward with life.  Also, he exhibits a classic case of job burnout.  My secret favorite, the despicable Ollie Weeks carries his non-political correctness to new heights.  The purity of his intolerance is breathtaking; not one minority group does he find acceptable.  His manners and appearance are atrocious, and his one saving grace is he that he is an excellent cop.  It is hard to rank the villains in this story except the amoral, cold-blooded egocentric CIA-types.  The burglar is a quite likeable guy, the drug dealers are frequently funny in their ignorance and casual violence, and even the terrorists are given human faces.<br />How McBain set up Ollie Week's (of the 88th precinct) participation in the investigation has to be an instant classic.  The initial incident is the zoo lions eating a human body.  The zoo, more precisely the lion's veldt, is the dividing line between the 87th and 88th precinct.  One young lion carried off the victim's leg to a private corner. Therefore, it was decided that ¼ of the crime took place in the 88th precinct, Ollie's responsibility.  <br />I would rank \\"Money, Money, Money\\" right up there with my all-time favorite87th Precinct mystery, \\"Kiss.\\"  A real pleasure.	2002-02-22

The big-daddy asteroid is accompanied by a \\"swarm\\" of smaller asteroids that are hitting the planet causing earthquakes, tidal waves and huge destruction.  The main asteroid designated, Shiva, is discovered eleven months before its projected impact.<br />How does the earth's populace prepare for this devastating event?  On balance, not well at all.  NASA and the military are the only heroes, our government gets a grade C, organized religion rates a D, and the general population flunks.  Pandemonium, lawlessness, strange sects and anarchy reign.  As Shiva nears Earth's orbit, the level of civilization declines drastically.  The only hope for humanity is if the massive asteroid can be deflected away from earth.  Enter NASA and the astronauts carrying a bomb load that would make Anola Gay look like a peashooter.<br />More than a nodding acquaintance with astronomy and physics would add to the enjoyment of this book.  The technical passages are many and sometimes too long.  The male characters are well delineated, surprisingly so for this type of book.  The anti-hero, Carl Jagen, is particularly complex; he creates tension whenever he appears. The females, with the exception of the clear-eyed astronaut, are pliant, ...... ravenous, and servile.  The story contains a few dead spots, but provides a rousing, spot-on finale when the astronauts do battle with Shiva in space.  After barely retaining my interest in the opening passages, I was riveted by the last third of the story.  Grade B-	2002-02-19

Shawcross	Books	5	49	51	N	N	Unrelenting Horror	Arthur Shawcross is to be pitied, but you just cannot.  From the time he was a child, he knew he was \\"different,\\" but never knew why, nor did he receive any insights by family or counselors.  Shawcross grew up in a tiny village in upstate New York, quit school in the 9th grade after being held back twice, served in the Army and then his life fell apart.  He brutally murdered 10-year old Jack Blake, for which he was suspected but never arrested.  He subsequently murdered 8-year old Karen Hill and was convicted.  After plea-bargaining, he received a 25-year sentence of which he served 14+ years and was released on parole.<br />Why was he released?  Basically because he was cunning and shrewd.  He did everything he could to be a model prisoner, and none of the mental health team could diagnose him.  Though a few psychologists thought he should never be allowed to live in an open society, there was little they could do to hold him beyond 15 years.  Shortly after his release, he began a two-year killing spree, murdering 11 prostitutes before being captured.  I had the strong feeling there were many more murders that we will never know about.<br />Jack Olsen takes us through Arthur's life via an oral history and taped Q and A interview with Shawcross.  The book is brilliant.  By letting the people closest to Shawcross tell their stories in their own words, interwoven with dispassionate analysis, the author rivets our attention and interest.  At the conclusion, a dogged psychiatrist finally uncovers that Arthur has a severe biological impairment, an extra Y chromosome and a little known compound that is a marker for violent behavior.  The two together were biological dynamite.<br />Arthur Shawcross's story is fascinating. It brings to the forefront \\"nature vs. nurture\\" arguments.  It appears Arthur would have been no different regardless of where and how he had been raised.  Mr. Olson brings Arthur, his family and friends, and his victims brilliantly to life.	2002-02-19

I am convinced he could write about an old grocery list and make it interesting.<br />Lovell, WY, a small insular, highly religious farm community was ripped apart when one of the leading citizens, Dr. John Story, was accused of sexual harassment and rape going back twenty years.  He was a general practitioner with OB/GYN a large part of his practice.  By the time he came to trial, more than 100 former patients admitted they felt they had been mistreated or raped under the guise of a pelvic examination.<br />My first thought was how could this have been so widespread and gone on for so long without anyone knowing, complaining, or accusing?  The answer is the nature of Lovell itself.  The majority of the citizenry belonged to the Church of Latter Day Saints (Mormon) or to a very strict fundamentalist church of which Dr. Story was a founding member.  Particularly with the LDS women, there is a strong bias in favor of male superiority.  They are taught that men (and only men) can become priests of their church and give absolution; rarely is male authority questioned.  Along with this background is an incredible innocence and ignorance about sexual functions.  It wasn't until a leading church member started asking hard questions after her more enlightened daughters complained to her, that the scope of this crime emerged.   The women thought two to three hour examinations were normal and all had taken for granted these examinations took place without the presence of a nurse.<br />It made very painful reading to see how difficult it was for these women to be taken seriously.  The Medical Registry of Wyoming was hostile toward their efforts, but finally gave them a hearing.  The leaders of the church, who did not want the church to formally be involved in the issue, did notsupport them.  It took the dedication and incredible hard work of a local sheriff and District Attorney for the county to finally bring Dr. Story to trial.  The town split in two along religious lines.  The fundamentalist group said it was a \\"Mormon conspiracy.\\"  People who had been friends and neighbors for years were now bitter enemies.<br />Mr. Olsen has created a page-turner with his balanced narrative that includes many direct interviews with the leading participants.  I felt pity for Dr. Story's devoted wife and for many of his well-meaning followers and patients.  However, what stands out most in my mind is the bravery and endurance shown by his victims and their willingness to stand by their beliefs and principles.	2002-02-12

Thorn on a cruise is about as likely as Jay Leno entering a monastery.  <br />\\"Buzz Cut\\" is loaded with fascinating, but highly unlikely characters.  Monica, angry runaway daughter of cruise line owner, Morton Hanson, is full of angst and bitterness.  Why?  Because she is stunningly beautiful and has been raised in luxurious plenty.  Yes, really.  She is trying to make an identity for herself as a maid in a seedy motel.  The monster creating all the trouble is Butler Jack, a brilliant, truly scary guy with a love of etymology (the origin of words).  He doesn't just expire people; he treats them to an hour-long lecture on interesting words.  He is bent on ruining the Fiesta Cruise Line and its owners.  He commandeers the ship and its communication and navigational systems, terrorizing the more than 2000 passengers.  <br />This is a fine, lively read, and I think Mr. Hall had a good time writing it.  It is over the top in a wry and humorous way.  The characters are interesting and sharply defined.  Mr. Hall develops them beautifully, but does seem to lose interest and then neglect them.  Thorn does not play a major role in the book.  It is a well-done ensemble piece.  The author has a fascination with unlikely technology, but it's all in good fun.<br />Die-hard Thorn fans might object to the lightening of the mood, and the lack of philosophizing, but they can rest easy.  Thorn is barely tempted by the crass commercialism and is properly grumpy at his enforced socialization.   A fast, highly enjoyable read.	2002-02-10

It is very real and very ominous last heard from in 1811-1812 in an 8.9 earthquake.  So \\"The Rift\\" is not an apocalyptic fantasy, but a meticulously researched epic of what could happen tomorrow.  You well may ask why isn't the earthquake of 1812 a part of every American child's history book as famous as the Chicago Fire or the San Francisco earthquake of 1906?  The answer is how lightly populated the area was at that time; the number of people who could report on the catastrophe were few, so at present day we have little documentation.<br />Mr. Williams has done an awesome job of investigation from everything concerning an earthquake to nuclear reactor plants.  Every chapter is interwoven with contemporary accounts of the 1812 earthquake.  We read what transpired over miles and miles of countryside, and then the author shows us what the same devastation would be like if that \\"countryside\\" had the City of Memphis sitting on it as it does today.  I learned a little about the Richter scale:  an 8.5 is not just a \\"little\\" stronger than an 8.3, but a thousand times stronger.  An 8.9 (the top of the scale) is just short of affecting the entire planet.  For comparison purposes the San Francisco quake registered 8.25 on the Richter scale.<br />To bring us a story and give us a human's eye view of such mass destruction, Mr. Williams gives us a cross-section of characters, most of whom were sharply defined and realistic.  From Jason, a young teenager who is Kalifornia Kool but displaced by his parent's divorce to Cabell's Mound, Missouri to Nick, an unemployed weapons engineer recently separated from his wife. (For some reason, I pictured Nick as Bryant Gumbel in the middle of the earthquake.)  The hustling dealmaker Charlie struck me as the most poignant.  He only existed in the cyberworld of suppose; when the earthquake hit, all he could think to do was dial 911 on hiscell phone.<br />\\"The Rift\\" is a monumental work in all senses of the word, but unlike many worthy tomes, highly readable and entertaining.

He just looks like a guy that would be wise to the ways of Las Vegas.  Widower Tony Valentine, retired Atlantic City cop, lives the relaxed life in Florida while keeping his hand in with an occasional consulting job.  He has a son who is so annoying, they only communicate via voice mail, and a lovely neighbor lady whose hobby is placing anonymous ads in the local paper, such as:<br />\\"Depressed, overweight, domineering older woman, slight drinking problem, hyper, on food stamps and oxygen.  Would like to meet a cute young professional man with big abs and a foreign sports car, low mileage.  Please send current, blood test results, and nude photo for a platonic relationship.\\"<br />As you can see, there is lots of humor.  The characters are Runyonesque with a dash of Ellroy.  The best part of the novel is the scams; what they are and how Tony detects them.  The ambience is more `50's Las Vegas than the present day.  You expect any moment to see Bugsy Siegal sashay in with the gorgeous Virginia Hill on his arm.  The fictional casino has more than a passing resemblance to the old mob-controlled Flamingo.  The reader has more to figure out than the standard whodunit; with the help of expert Swain, we have to figure out \\"HOW\\" he dunnit as well.<br />A fun and fascinating read.

We, the readers, know Darby has been set up by some vile government types and barely escaped with her life. <br />You would think the World's Best Anyone would be a snap to find, but not so in the case of climbers.  They tend to be poor, with no fixed address and at any given moment, might be anywhere on the globe.  The author gives us captivating information on the lifestyle of climbers, and excellent descriptions of exactly what a major climb is like.<br />The plot is convoluted, but moves well.  Mr. Mills does an excellent job of keeping all threads firmly in hand.  The story moves back and forth between Mike, the hunter, and Darby, the prey.  The body count is high and the action brisk.  With the exception of Darby, who is very carefully sketched, it is hard to decipher the various characters' motivations.  What they say, and how they act doesn't match with what they do.  As the author does not have much use for any politician, none of them mean a word they say and act accordingly; this is acceptable.  But what of an almost suicidally depressed passive character that suddenly leaps up, takes charge and runs the show?  Was he fooling us before and had a master plan all along?  Did he have an epiphany?  We never find out.  The ending was ironic-I think.<br />\\"Free Fall\\" was a fun read, and at times very absorbing, but it needs more continuity.  3-1/2 stars.	2002-01-29

The paper is heavy and glossy, the photographs are fantastic and the makeup is flawless.<br />The content I would have to say is uneven. The electrifying discovery of Mallory's body is well written and in good taste.  The trials and tribulations of getting financial support are well done.  The duplicity of the good and gray BBC is an eye-opener.  No punches are pulled about the various expedition team's strengths and weaknesses.  However, it shows the faults of a book written by committee and the continuity is sometimes poor.  I felt the pages and pages devoted to oxygen tanks were, to put it kindly, far too many.  <br />The 1999 expedition uncovered a treasure lode of documents and artifacts about Mallory and Irvine's last day on earth and can be considered a total success.  The big question:  Did Mallory and Irvine summit Mr. Everest some 29 years before Sir Edmund Hillary?  Maybe.  To this reader the most compelling evidence was what was not found on Mr. Mallory's body:  the picture of his wife that he always carried in his billfold.  He had said he was going to leave her picture on the summit of Everest.  Maybe he did.	2002-01-29

The mysteries pile up, a whiteout type blizzard sets in, the Windigo is afoot, and a crackerjack story ensues.  The central character, Cork O'Conner is a straightforward man beset by complexities.  He was fired from his post as sheriff and, wonder of wonders, deserved it.  The usual mystery ploy is the hero was wrongfully used and was in fact a total hero, if only he had been understood.  Cork is invested with real human frailties.  His marriage is spiraling toward a divorce, and he can't get a handle on what to do about it.  The sheriff who took his place, far from being an illiterate, crooked nincompoop, is actually a competent, honest man-much to Cork's discomfort. <br />The story is well paced with excellent plotting and characterization.  The interplay between the characters, both verbally and emotionally, is exceptionally strong.  There is a whiff of the supernatural (see Windigo above) that the author lightly touches upon and leaves to the reader whether to accept or not.  What is extremely encouraging that as strong a book as \\"Iron Lake\\" is, I feel his latest, \\"Boundary Waters\\" is even better.  Mr. Krueger is an evolving author in the best sense.<br />This highly enjoyable book is highly recommended.	2002-01-29

Every time I&#8217;d read a mystery with a Florida setting, I thought of Thorn.  I&#8217;d question mystery experts about a guy who lives on the Keys, a real outsider who doesn&#8217;t want any ties and cares not about material things.  Recently, I saw a message on the Amazon Discussion Board about &#8220;Blackwater Sound,&#8221; immediately made the connection, and ordered the book.  I was not disappointed.<br />The haunting prologue described young Andy Braswell who, attempting to attach an electronic device on a Moby Dick sized marlin, was dragged and lost at sea.  Ten years later, his mother has committed suicide, his father is still obsessed with catching the marlin, and his brother and sister are emotional wrecks.<br />The story proper opens with a horrendous crash of a commercial airliner   into Blackwater Sound off Key Largo, FL.  Thorn is part of the rescue operation.  The crash, the sounds and the aftermath, are skillfully and almost poetically rendered by the author.  I thought I had read the ultimate in crash descriptions in Andrew Klavan&#8217;s &#8220;Hunting Down Amanda,&#8221; but Mr. Hall is in a class by himself.<br />The story is well paced and the characterizations are excellent.  These are stand-alone type people.  After you have read this book, you will surely agree that dysfunctional families are each different unto themselves.  The technology is a little weak, but is more than made up for by the stirring battles between man and marlin.  Mr. Hall&#8217;s expertise is in fishing not gadgets.  Recommended.	2002-01-26

There is no shortage of suspects or motives for Lauren had led a complicated, secretive life.  A party girl, straight A student, generous to children and friends down on their luck, exquisite personal taste coupled with ugly job skills; Lauren has had bad luck, and it is catching.<br />The strongest area in the book is the incisive portraits of the secondary characters.  The uneasy, almost saint-like Ben Dugger, the highly verbal, artistic gay roommate of Lauren's, the brutish, slovenly but shrewd Lyle Teague just sparkle on the page.  The description of the fictional \\"Playboy Mansion\\" is a brilliant invention.  Even protagonist Alex shows an obsessive/compulsive streak that sharpens up his sometimes-bland character.  The book is well plotted, though the pace uneven.<br />So what was wrong?  First and foremost, I found Lauren unbelievable.  She came across as a set of contradictory traits that never added up to a total person.  As she was the crux of the novel, it was a fatal flaw.  Far too much time was devoted to the wavelets in Alex and Robin's insipid relationship.  A secondary plot was superfluous, distracting from the main story and contributed nothing except a few characters that were not even remotely involved with the main plot.<br />\\"Flesh and Blood\\" definitely has its moments, just not enough of them.	2002-01-24

I understand this is Outing #17, so I predict many enjoyable hours for myself.<br />Brady's good friend/client is devastated at the loss of his teen-aged son in a tragic auto accident.  The boy and his girl friend perhaps took a curve too fast, broke through the guardrail, and plunged into a swift flowing river.  The girl drowned in the driver's seat with seat belt still strapped on.  The boy apparently was thrown out of the car and washed away.  The body has not been found.  Brady agrees to handle the legal and bureaucratic details for the grief-stricken family.<br />Nothing is quite as it seems in this perfect small town with its perfect, civic-minded sheriff.  The pace is relentless, the body count rises, the events are ever more baffling---and the reader is thoroughly hooked.<br />The characters are multi-faceted; not one could ever be called a stereotype.  Brady is a pure delight, a basically nice guy who is a mite lazy, is a walking manual on how not to run your love life, a fond but not too effectual father of grown sons, and doesn't handle stress well at all.  Even if this were not a well-plotted suspenseful story, which it most certainly is, I think I'd read more Brady Coyne books just to spend time with my friend, Brady-and make sure he didn't leave me in mid-story to go fishing.<br />A great outing and highly recommended.	2002-01-23

It is informally called \\"bleached.\\"  This describes the narrator, Samuel.<br />A white man, gruesomely murdered, is found on [the] Hill, which sets the stage for the tragic events that follow.   The town does not \\"divide\\" on racial lines; it seems unanimously convinced that the Negroes living on the Hill are guilty.  Violence begets more violence in spite of the efforts of Constable Samuel and Sheriff Frenchy LeMay.  The climax is a blood bath on the Hill.<br />Mr. Heffernan is obviously a craftsman at setting mood and sparkling descriptions.  He handles dialogue like a master. However, I found the unremitting phonetic spelling of the so-called back woods accent tiresome.  In spite of the dark theme, Frenchy and larger-than-life Jehiel Flood both display a marvelous sense of humor.  Some readers might well be offended at some of the scatological language; however, it rings true and reaffirms the escalating hatreds.  The names conferred on many of the characters are priceless.  I particularly liked Perserved Firman (the name, not the character.  He is the arch-villain.)<br />My main problem was with the narrator, Samuel.  The novel is written in the first person so Samuel is your window to the world.  Samuel is nothing if not complex, but I found him unreliable and basically unlikable.  He is self-absorbed to the extent that he only sees himself through what he perceives as the constant scrutiny of others.  There is no question he suffered hardships and vilification, yet I was fundamentally unmoved.  The lyrical, italicized erotic passages seemed somehow out of place.  I questioned how an entire town could line up in support of an obviously vicious, obscene, mad dog Perserved Firman.  The mysterious Elizabeth remained just that to me-mysterious.<br />I will read another by Mr. Heffernan.  His talent is unmistakable and perhaps I will enjoy it to the fullest in another type of novel.	2002-01-23

The highly honored Ms. Bainbridge, winner of the prestigious Whitbread Prize and short-listed (six times!) for the Booker Prize amply displays what all the fuss is about.  She is that good.<br />The book is hard to categorize.  It isn't a coming-of-age, a psychological thriller, a dazzling Peter Pan parable; it is all these things and more.<br />Stella raised in blue-collar, post WWII Liverpool is a troubled and troubling 15-year old who determinedly washed out of school and has been fixed up as a \\"student\\" (read gofer) at a provincial repertory company.  She has no particular acting ambitions, but is certain she would be very good at it.  We get a many-sided view of Stella; as she sees herself and as she is perceived by the people around her.  Every scene and every word of dialogue interlocks like a jeweled timepiece.  The reader is almost unaware of the ever-increasing momentum until it crashes upon you in a chilling finale.  You think Ms. Bainbridge is through with you, but not quite.  Just when you think you are utterly and completely emotionally drained, Ms. Bainbridge delivers a final twist, and now you know you are.  I was left stunned.<br />An excellent example of fine prose.  Highly recommended.	2002-01-23

This book was 20 years in the making - I suspect the fractious \\"keeper of the documents\\" sister Norma Millay was a good part of the reason for the delay in publishing.  We are fortunate that Ms. Millay kept meticulous diaries, and was so fascinating to her writerly contemporaries, they wrote pages and pages in their own diaries about the incandescent Ms. Millay.<br />I had always thought ESVM must have come from some grand, aristocratic background to have such an imposing moniker.  It turns out she was named in honor of St. Vincent's charity hospital in New York which had saved her drunken Uncle Charlie's life.  She was born in a hardscrabble town in Maine and had a \\"difficult\\" childhood in every sense of the word.  Her mother was a self-taught nurse and took cases far from home, necessitating that her three daughters were often completely alone for weeks at a time.  Vincent (as she was always called by her family and friends) at age eight and the eldest, was in total charge of running the household.  Yet the bonds between the sisters and mother were strong their entire lives.  Vincent was frighteningly precocious, writing poetry and keeping diaries from her seventh year.  Her loneliness must have been appalling.<br />Ms. Millay was tiny, with beautiful flame-red hair, and mesmerizing eyes.  She had a lovely alto voice, and no one could read her works as well as she did herself.  The word \\"charisma\\" was invented for her, and she fascinated males and females alike.  She was so many things: wild and prim, a serious poet who came dangerously close to light verse, a sympathetic friend and an implacable enemy, spiritual with a hard headed business sense, and vulnerable, but manipulative.<br />Ms. Milford has done a spectacular job of winnowing the essence of the poet.  The structure of the book is excellent with occasional asides of conversations between the author and Norma Millay.  Ms. Milford is a compassionate biographer, but an objective one.  The research is excellent and her conclusions well drawn, but free of armchair psychology.  An outstanding biography that I highly recommend.	2002-01-15

Ramsey Campbell's specialty is families: some good, beautiful, and loving; some cold, terrifying, and detestable.  He doesn't allow any faceless victims; you know them all too well and suffer accordingly.<br />Geoffrey Davenport is a moderately famous investigative TV journalist who appears to have it all:  an attractive business-partner wife and a delightful four-year old son.  For no particularly good reason that I can see, Geoff chooses to keep a big chunk of his life a secret-his older half-brother Ben who he has not seen or heard from since Ben left home for good at age 18.<br />Geoff begins getting anonymous phone calls that he fears are from Ben.  He gradually comes to realize that Ben is a serial killer who claims Geoff can stop the killing if he wins a tortuous \\"game\\" of clues, a surreal Treasure Hunt.  Unfortunately, for the reader's peace of mind, we get to know Ben and have a certain amount of sympathy for him.  The parents loved, cosseted, and supported Geoff; yet treated Ben with Dickensonian cruelty.  As the \\"game\\" continues, Geoff realizes the danger is coming closer and closer to home and the tension and suspense ratchet up accordingly.  The finale is slam bang with touches of Dali surrealism, and the imagery is remarkable.<br />I had a few minor irritations with the book.  I think the son's age should have been two at the most, rather than four.  Four-year olds use complete sentences and don't toddle.  I never could satisfactorily figure out why the parents treated Geoff and Ben so differently.  But these were very minor annoyances.  The book has beautiful characterizations, concise but perfect.  Nothing slows down the pace, ever-increasing dread and tension of the story.  For all but the faint-hearted, I highly recommend the book.	2002-01-13

Born to an unwed 15-year old Eskimo girl in a remote part of Alaska, he was adopted, raised and educated in relatively cosmopolitan Anchorage.  Nathan, an Alaskan State Trooper, finds himself stationed at the village of his birth and  is not pleased to be there.<br />If you have murder on your mind and do not care to be brought to justice,  your chances would be good if your were in an isolated part of northern Alaska.  A wave of suspicious \\"suicides\\" hits tiny Chukchi.  Unfortunately, Trooper Active is the only person who sees anything strange about these occurrences.  The locals and his superiors concur that frequent suicides are an Eskimo \\"thing,\\" chalking it up to alcoholism and long winters.  <br />The scenic descriptions, governmental bureaucracy and village politics sound quite authentic and are well done.  The story drags, and the reader is ahead of the plot line most of the time.  My biggest problem was with the protagonist, Nathan Active.  He seemed enormously self-centered and, to me, unlikable.  There are some steamy sex scenes that are unattractive to me because Nathan freely takes advantage of an Eskimo girl, yet has contempt for her intelligence and prospects.  The one thing little Lucy has going for her in Nathan's eyes is her acquiescence.  He hopes to do far better for himself.  Sadly, he appears to be quite a \\"catch\\" to the local girls. <br />Though the book is not over-long, I had a hard time finishing it.  If it were not for Eskimo characters, I probably would have given up on it.  Great title though.	2002-01-13

It takes weeks (that is after you get as far as Katmandu) of walking to even get there.  Annapurna is located in Nepal, near the China border.<br />Ms. Blum led a diverse 13 woman team on an almost three month adventure on the mountain.  The women's ages ranged from 20-50, their nationalities from American to Polish to British (and a few I would just label as \\"extremely cosmopolitan\\"); their abilities ranked from zero to professional level climber level.  <br />The author does an excellent job of relating her feelings, problems and insecurities as a leader.  I was impressed at the cooperative spirit of all the women and their willingness to discuss emotional problems as they developed.  I don't think 13 men would be as cohesive a unit.  Of course, a man's team most likely would not have to worry about someone having a love affair with the cook, either!<br />The black &amp; white climbing photos are excellent and nicely matched with the narrative.  You definitely get a sense of the struggle, the cold, and the tensions that are never-ending on such an ambitious climb.  <br />Ms. Blum imported five Sherpas as high-climbing support, hoping to ensure greater safety with their expertise.  Was this a successful plan?  Yes and no.  The Sherpas were for the most part insubordinate (they had little confidence in female decisions) and temperamental.  However, when the chips were down, they came through and displayed their much praised stamina and resolve.  <br />The triumph of the two women who summited was a rousing adventure-read and showed that their accomplishment was indeed a victory for the whole team.  The two women, one British and one American, that attempted the middle summit a day later and tragically fell to their deaths is still shroudedin mystery.  I cannot help but think their decision making abilities were clouded by the high altitude.  The risks were far too many, and the chances of success, but slight.<br />This is a well-told tale, one of best of the high-climbing books.  It is slightly marred by some feminine defensiveness, but this was 1978, and equality still had a long way to go!	2002-01-12
1696435:US	51197300	R2TTEV9TE6NIO0	0679449868	386796565	My Wars Are Laid Away in Books: The Life of Emily Dickinson	Books	3	66	74	N	N	The Soul Selects Her Own Society--	Miss Dickinson does not yield herself easily to the microscope of biography, as almost every would-be biographer has found.  Mr. Habegger contributes a scholarly missive that requires a good pre-knowledge of Emily Dickinson and her poetry to understand and appreciate the book.<br />The author has steered a firm middle course and refused any idle speculation on ED's sexuality, lovers, and sanity.  However, he is not afraid to make a choice or a decision or two.  He thinks Miss Dickinson had two great loves, but is not willing to confirm whether these existed solely in her imagination or were, in fact, reciprocated.  There are lengthy sections on ED's father and grandfather, which I found well researched and shrewdly presented.<br />I was disappointed in his choice of the poetry analyzed.  Some was obscure even to the Dickinson devotee, and not all was first rate.  Though the book is hefty, literally and figuratively, I felt ED was but a shadow throughout.  There are many well-documented instances of Miss Dickinson's sharp sense of humor, but none appeared in \\"My Wars Are Laid Away in Books.\\"  There is no sense of the entire family's eccentricity.  Brother Austin, when a pillar of the town of Amherst, left his wife to take up with his mistress who lived across town.  Think what a hullabaloo this must have caused in Victorian-era New England!  Sister Lavinia became more and more peculiar as her age advanced.  So Emily had a good background for some unconventional behavior.<br />I enjoyed the Sewell biography more, though it was written in 1972 without the benefit of Mr. Habegger's advanced scholarship.  I believe Emily Dickinson told us all she wanted us to know in her poems.  And thus far, she has succeeded. <br />The soul selects her own society-<BR>Then shuts the door-<BR>On her divine majority <BR>Obtrude no more.<br />Unmoved, she notes the chariot's pausing<BR>At her low gate-<BR>Unmoved, an emperor is kneeling<BR>Upon her mat.<br />I've known her from an ample nation<BR>Choose one-<br />Then close the valves of her attention--<BR>Like stone.	2002-01-12

Web London, Hostage Rescue Team member Extraordinaire, is introduced via interior dialogue enroute to an assignment.  The mission is unusual in that there are no \\"hostages\\" involved, only employees of a drug ring whom the FBI want alive to testify.  As the team files into a narrow alley, suddenly they are attacked with a murderous cross fire.  Of the seven-member team, only Web London is left standing.  He froze at the alley entrance and was unable to move forward.  Did he panic? Suffer a psychotic break?  We don't know nor does he.<br />We are off on a grand adventure that takes us from the seamy side of D.C. to the beautiful horse country of Albermarle County, Virginia.  The characters are interesting---my vote is for the steely warrior Romano whose only fear was of his tiny, peppery wife.  The HRT background is fascinating and detailed.  After reading this book, the FBI HRT will be in your ranks of super tough guys along with the Navy SEALS, Army Rangers, and Marine Special Forces.<br />The twists and turns are many-perhaps a few too many, but Mr. Balducci has set such a good hook, he reels you into the finale.  Some of the suspense is caused by certain character's incredible density at figuring out what is happening to them.  The reader tenses up and is mentally shouting, \\"don't get in the car!\\"  but of course, they do.  The story is enjoyable, and Mr. Balducci delivers the goods.  A fine addition to his list.	2002-01-10

He does include two essays out of ten on fighting wildfires in National Parks, but the other eight take up war zones and, what I would call, extreme hazardous journalistic duty.  Mr. Junger has a compelling voice and a you-are-there style that places you firmly in Sierra Leone, Kosovo and Kashmir.   <br />The strongest and most compelling essay was the last, \\"Lion in Winter\\" a sketch of Ahmad Shah Massoud, leader of Afghanistan's Northern Alliance, who was assassinated two days before the World Trade Center tragedy, probably by the same group of terrorists.  The essay was written early in 2001, and is worth preserving.  The author was clearly impressed with this great non-political general.  Massoud was directly responsible for the misery caused the Soviets in their futile ten-year attempt to subdue Afghanistan.  Mr. Junger catches Massoud at ease, but still issuing orders even as he gave his interview.  It is a disaster that this strong, brilliant leader is no longer present to take part if and when Afghanistan recovers.<br />This is an excellent book that captures the moment, mood, time and countries as indelibly as a photo.  Recommended.	2001-12-31

Abby Zinzo plans to leave his exquisite jewelry collection to her and sets about telling her what it is and what it means to him.  No doubt this sounds prosaic and a bit academic.  Think again!<br />Abby has had an exciting, erotic life, and he is anxious to share the highlights.  Right away, I was nervous---\\"is he really writing all this to a 13-year old girl?\\"  Apparently, yes.  Gender is a very slippery thing to Abby; so much so, I was confused most of the time.<br />His erotic tales of derring-do are intermixed with some solid history on gems and their owners.  The dual emphasis made the story line jerky and fragmented.  He speaks with two different voices, and they never seem to mesh.  I wish there had been some color plates of the jewelry he was describing.  There were some grayed out, fuzzy pictures that were worse than nothing.<br />While Mr. Klein shows considerable jauntiness in his writing, I felt I had boarded the wrong train.  I had the feeling throughout, that I just didn't quite \\"get it.\\"  Other readers might find this more enjoyable than I did.  There is no denying Mr. Klein's cleverness.	2001-12-31

But Christopher's \\"facts\\" are strangely skewed.  He tells us he is not only a \\"famous\\" detective, but has international renown, is celebrated in all the newspapers (front page) for his sleuthing abilities, and has become fabulously wealthy at his trade.  The reader gradually realizes what a multi-layered story this is.  We first see Christopher as he sees himself, then as others see him, and lastly and most importantly; how we see him.<br />The narrative depicts Christopher's vividly recalled childhood in Shanghai, his parents kidnapping when he was nine, his adolescence in England and his quest to find out what happened to his parents.<br />His return to war-torn Shanghai is a brilliant piece of writing.  Christopher becomes almost hallucinogenic, and his experiences become increasingly surreal and bizarre.  As a reader, I was exhilarated reading the fantastic experiences while, at the same time, trying to make factual sense of them.  At a certain point, I became one with Christopher and lived the story with him.  The climax is exquisitely satisfactory.<br />Mr. Ishiguro is a master of prose; there is a rightness and fluidity in his writing style that makes the reading experience transcendently pleasurable.  Highly recommended.	2001-12-31

That is not to say the book lacks scholarship and research, but Ms. Foreman presents her material in such a witty, well-written way; the reader is beguiled.<br />Georgianna was most of all, a very lovable woman.  She was beautiful, stylish, lively, witty and unfailingly kind.  She was a natural politician and was passionately involved her entire life.  Her charisma, cleverness and organization in the political arena bring to mind FDR, JFK and Britain's present Prime Minister Tony Blair.  She used all of her advantages of great wealth and high birth to maximum advantage.<br />Georgianna's never-curbed mania for gambling caused her a lifetime of anxiety and misery.  At one time, in today's dollars, she was $6 million in debt!  She was never free of demanding creditors, and was ever fearful of confessing her great indebtedness to the Duke whom she dreaded would divorce her if he knew the extent of her losses.  She was too loyal in her friendships and distinctly untidy in her love life.<br />I noted one reviewer, in comparing Georgianna with her great (four times) niece, Diana, reported the Duchess never knew the joys of motherhood.  This is incorrect.  Her two daughters and son adored her.  At the time of Georgianna's death, her eldest daughter wrote:  \\"Oh my beloved, my adored departed mother, are you indeed forever parted from me?  Shall I see no more that angelic countenance or hear that blessed voice?  You whom I loved with such tenderness, you who were the best of mothers?  Adieu---I wanted to strew violets over her dying bed as she strewed sweets over my life, but they would not let me.\\"   What parent could want a more loving tribute?<br />\\"Georgianna, Duchess of Devonshire\\" is a compelling biography, not only of the subject, but life and times in Georgian England.  Highly recommended.	2001-12-29

After being stunned with the genius of  \\"Neon Rain,\\" I found most contemporary Dave Robicheaux novels rather gloomy and over-described affairs.  Went back to \\"Black Cherry Blues\\" his Edgar-winning novel and was disappointed.  Now, I feel I've read another gem.  I am doubly pleased because from reading and seeing interviews, I think James Lee Burke is one of the most charming authors around.<br />\\"A Morning for Flamingos\\" begins with the death of Dave's partner while transporting two prisoners, Te Beau, a New Iberia boy to whom Dave has certain obligations, and the menacing Jamie Lee Boggs.  Dave is left critically wounded and remembers little of the actual escape.  The story leads to underworld figures, voodoo, and the sordid, steamy underside of New Orleans.<br />The pace and brooding menace never let up, and Burke allows no loose ends to annoy the reader.  The characterizations are sharp, descriptive, and unforgettable.  The solution is elegant and exciting.  I liked Dave all over again.	2001-12-29

Max takes on Zoe's case to find her \\"mother's\\" murderer for which Zoe is framed.   Max's task is complicated by Zoe's lowly status in the not-so-brave new world.  Critters have no civil rights, are \\"property\\" though are not called slaves.  Everything in this Libertarian government is privately owned, including the police force, which is manned by Bots (trained robots.)<br />\\"Chimera\\" is a lively, fun, fast-paced story with ethical resonance.  Some reviewers objected to the lack of depth in discussing the moral problems; I disagree.  The author allows us to make our own decisions regarding what \\"rights\\" non-human entities should have.  To make it more interesting, critters and A1s can reproduce among themselves and with humans.<br />The story takes place in LA, a ferment of sharply divided neighborhoods well described and plausible.  Radical critters who hate all humans call them \\"skins.\\"  A human who consorts with a critter is a \\"furry.\\" Critters that go inexplicably crazy are \\"wilding.\\"  The characters are sharply etched and most are likeable, some with remarkable (to us) attributes.  Max has an Infinite Pocket attached to his wrist.  You can't see it; it is about the size of a small backpack and holds his 9mm SIG Recoilless that has an infinite clip (he never needs to reload.)  Zoe is amazingly fast, balanced and has a purring sort of voice. (She also has a furry ears that the author finds endearing.)<br />\\"Chimera\\" is good-natured, and I rooted for Max and Zoe shamelessly. The book is clever and highly readable.

Cold Comfort Farm is a hilarious parody on the sometimes overwrought, back-to-nature styles of D.H. Lawrence and Thomas Hardy.  But dont be put off if you are not familiar with these authors.  If you have ever had a giggle or two about a steamy bodice-ripper or an author who goes on and on---- and on with descriptions of the morning dew, the heaving ocean, and the joys of primitivism; Cold Comfort Farm is a perfect antidote.<br />Orphaned, genteel, and somewhat financially embarrassed Flora Poste decides to spend a year living off some carefully selected relatives.  Though her worldly, soignée London friends are appalled at her choice, Flora has her reasons.  She plans to make herself indispensable to her god-forsaken, rural extended family who reside in Howling, Sussex at Cold Comfort Farm.  The Howling, Sussex branch has unforgettable characters such as over-sexed Seth, fragile free-spirited Elfie who scampers over the moors in a scarlet cape, Amos who is called by God and a Ford Motor Van, and Great Aunt Ada Doom who saw something nasty in the woodshed and has been afflicted ever since.<br />Not only is Cold Comfort Farm funny and sly, it is curiously comforting for Flora succeeds famously in exactly what she set out to do.  She never takes a misstep or loses her fastidious equanimity.  I found there has been a movie made of the book in 1995, and I have it on order.  If it is half as funny as the book, it will be a wild success.  A wonderful read and highly recommended.	2001-12-28

I was so taken with Grootka; I was delighted to find the author had devoted a book to him.<br />Young detective \\"Fang\\" Mulheisen, over-loaded with cases, seeks some help from now-retired Grootka because the victim, \\"Books\\" Meldrim, was well known to the old man.  Grootka insists the present murder is tied to an old dead case that happened some twenty years ago.  Mulheisen is under fierce pressure to abandon inquiries into the old case and take care of his present workload.  Grootka dusts off his blue suit and red tie (that has not been unknotted for 20 years), straps on his .45 and goes to work.  Rogue, unorthodox, and brutal, Grootka prowls the mean streets again.  <br />The book is fast-paced, complex, and beautifully plotted.  There is poignancy in Grootka's stubborn unwillingness to give any quarter to his advancing age.  Not a wasted word!  \\"Grootka\\" is available used at a reasonable price.  So do add this one to your collection of Fang Mulheisen stories.  Recommended.	2001-12-28

The photography is beautiful, which is a saving grace for the book.  <br />Perhaps this reader is overly attuned to comfort, but I was dismayed at all the circular stairways, ladders, and challenging skywalks to enter or navigate these homes-away-from homes. Some were set in such boggy, swampy areas, all I could think of were mosquitoes and other unpleasant insects.  If readers are expecting examples in the United States, they will be disappointed; most of the retreats were set in the British Isles.<br />The book illustrates a variety of settings: seaside, desert, mountains, lake and forest as advertised.  \\"Little Retreats\\" is fun to read, but I would not recommend it as a practical guide.	2001-12-28

This isn&#8217;t the type of book in which you can honestly say, &#8220;I can relate to that,&#8221; because every aspect of Mr. Mellon&#8217;s long life is so rarified, empathy is well nigh impossible.<br />His childhood is unenviable.  His father was a very formal, reserved man; and his mother &#8211; &#8220;impossible&#8221; is a good way to describe her.  She was flagrantly unfaithful and had the maternal instincts of a turtle.  She caused the senior Mr. Mellon agonies of grief with her not-so-polite blackmail by threatening him with scandal if she did not get her way.  They were divorced  (think of it---in 1912!) when Paul was six years old.  Mr. Mellon insists it didn&#8217;t have much effect upon him as he was so young, but allows his older sister, Ailysa, bore the brunt of it and grew up to be a shy and reclusive woman.<br />When Paul graduated from Yale and Clare College, Cambridge and put in an obligatory year in the Mellon banking institution; he announced to his father he was not cut out for banking.  What he wanted to do was ---not much of anything in the way of employment.  He collected art, racehorses, and became a philanthropist of the first order.  The word &#8220;dilettante&#8221; never appears on these pages, but it did indeed cross my mind.  This is not to say Mr. Mellon was idle or unsuccessful.  He inherited his father&#8217;s business-like mind and made money with his art collections and racing stables.  He spent his life doing exactly as he wished&#8212;somehow this seems vaguely un-American!<br />Mr. Mellon relates at some length how distant and reserved his father was.  I think he was truly unaware how distant and reserved he was himself.  He was kind and had a closed circle of friends with similar interests (and money), but seemed to see the rest of humanity as his worker bees.  His first wife died tragically young, but he matter-of-factlystates he was not so sure the marriage would have lasted anyway.  He praises his second wife, Bunny, highly, but she never comes to life; it&#8217;s as if he is admiring a monument.  He had four separate residences (all fully staffed, including butlers).  Mr. Mellon was bemused when people asked him if going back and forth between four homes wasn't a bit wearisome.  He said he couldn&#8217;t understand their question because their main home in Upperville, VA has an airstrip.  When he wants to move on to Antigua, he just steps out the back door and gets on the Gulf Airstream IV.  Now what trouble is that?<br />&#8220;Reflections In A Silver spoon&#8221; is a fascinating read, though there is a long section on his various directorships that was not of much interest to me. I was involved enough to check out what happened beyond the end of the book written in Mr. Mellon&#8217;s 85th year.  He died in 1999 at the age of 91 at his home in Virginia.<br />Though this book is out of print, it is easy to obtain used through the Amazon Marketplace.	2001-12-16

Our heroine, Marie Lightfoot, is not a lawyer, police officer, private detective or journalist for starters.  She is a best-selling True Crime novelist.  What vistas this opens up for a series!  She has every reason to be nosing around the crime scene, the courtroom, the witnesses and families of victims; and she has no boring boss to slow her down.  She has a highly comfortable life style, easily explained.  Marie has no background, so the reader is sure to exercise his/her own imagination.  I have always felt Kinsey Mahone was far more effective before Sue Grafton hung a back story around her neck giving her a plethora or relatives and details about an ex-husband.<br />Marie switches from first person observation to chapters from her current manuscript with the lackluster title, \\"Anything To Be Together.\\"  It is the story of a charismatic minister convicted of beating his attractive wife to death, probably with the aid and assistance of his girlfriend.  Rev. Wing is awaiting execution on Death Row.  Ironically, the rector has received much local publicity in the past for his anti-death penalty activism.  She has just completed the text, but feels dissatisfied with parts of it, particularly the lack of background and insights on the principal players.<br />The plot is excellent, complex with a labyrinth of twists and turns.  There are a few attitudes that boggle my mind, but perhaps that is just me.  Ms. Pickard is a fine writer and has created a thoroughly likeable heroine.  A fine read.	2001-12-14

The human clone theory has been around for a long time, at least as long ago when someone came up with the word doppleganger.  <br />Jude meets his exact double in his New York apartment's entryway.  His pitifully naive twin Skyler, has escaped from a mysterious island off of the southeastern coast of the U.S.  It quickly becomes apparent, powerful forces are looking for Skyler.  Jude shelters him because he hopes to write a career-enhancing exposé.  Skyler (who made me think of Luke Skywalker) is introduced to girl friend Twizzie who is an exact replica of Skyler's now-dead friend, Julia.  The coincidences are piling up, but this is by no means the end of it.  The chase heats up to boiling, and the reader is carried, more or less happily to a slam-bang finale.<br />The explanations of DNA, chromosome, gene therapy for life-extending purposes are clear and fascinating.  Mr. Darnton is to be commended for making these sections so understandable and plausible.  There is an interesting subtext on Gullahs who are an encapsulated community in the southeast.  <br />If you don't mind a little déjà vu, a fun read.	2001-12-12

First and foremost, the king must be kept enchanted and amused at all times.  Friends and enemies must be dealt with.  Relatives must be cared for.  Appearance must be perfect.  Taste must be exquisite.  <br />Little Jeanne-Antoinette Poisson was not exactly born for the role; she was a bourgeoisie, rather than the aristocrat, which automatically made her a poor candidate for the King's intimate favors.  She was not a sensual woman, and the Bourbon kings were known as lusty.  She overcame all by her total devotion to the king, her kindness, savoir-faire, and brilliant taste in décor, art, and architecture.  Luckily for the Marquise, Louis XV was a man of habit.  Once he became fond of Madame, his eye might stray, but he saw no reason whatsoever to change his arrangements.<br />Madame is Nancy Mitford's kind of girl.  Her biography is affectionate and admiring while not being a puff piece.  Her history is good and her style is light hearted and charming.  Ms. Mitford gives us a vivid picture of Versailles at its apex, yet does not gloss over the hardships and realities of the day.  Court society was sterile in that none of its members had anything to do but be amused by gossip and frivolity.  Banishment from Court was a small death because their lives were engineered only by pleasure, and pleasure was only to be had at Court.<br />This is a fine biography with an excellent contemporary view of the times.  Highly recommended.	2001-12-12

She did not commit the murder, and has been meticulously planning her revenge for these twelve miserable years when she finally receives a conditional parole.<br />Everything about this tale is very Irish, including the judicial system.  American readers will be surprised to find Rachel was convicted by a \\"majority\\" vote of the jury, 10-2.  Rachel was totally convinced she would be acquitted and made no mental preparations for a prison sentence.  Her descent into the life of a penitentiary is harrowing.  It was so profoundly shocking to her, I could not see her living a month.  We gradually realize Rachel has an inner toughness and determination that permits her to make use of her time in prison.  We know she has a well-formulated \\"plan,\\" but we don't know what it is.<br />As Rachel's character unfolds, our admiration and apprehension increase in equal measure.  We revise our picture of Rachel as a downtrodden drudge to something like Medea or La Belle Dame Sans Merci.  Yet we have pity for her when she tries to re-establish a bond with her highly troubled daughter.  All of the personalities are carefully drawn in depth.  Not one is a stereotype, and each has a compelling part to play.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this tightly plotted psychological thriller and look forward to future books by Julia Parsons.	2001-12-12

He&#8217;s not a conventional hero&#8212;a mite too heavy, too old, and too curmudgeonly.  He wins us with his strength, humor, and doggedness.<br />The true villain of the piece will chill.  He is patient, resourceful and completely focused.  The author does a wonderful job of describing near misses by the villain while the characters are blissfully unaware of their brushes with death.  The gradual discovery of what is killing these victims raises the suspense level and contributes to fast page turning.  The New Orleans descriptions are done with the eye of a native; no bland touristy snapshots intrude.<br />The autopsy scenes are quite intense (read before eating).  The plot has some extraneous genealogy that I found tiresome.  (...) However, it&#8217;s a good, fast, interesting read, and I look forward to reading more about Andy & Kit.	2001-12-12

A bucolic summer scene in quaint Hunnicutt, MA and then, <br />\\"A white-hot light spilled wide across the face of heaven ---as if the sky had been obliterated by a blinding stain.\\"<br />A commercial aircraft has exploded in mid-air over the town center, and it is raining metal, fire and body parts.  A little girl runs amid the falling debris to find her mother.  Thus we are introduced to Amanda who is the epicenter of a desperate search by the government and a pharmaceutical company (all bad guys).   Why?  It seems Amanda is able to \\"sparkle\\" people, to use her words.  She can heal by touch.  This gift is neither occult nor spiritual, but the result of drug experimentation.  The catch?  Amanda is depleted by her \\"sparkling,\\" and if overused, will die.  Her street-smart mother has been on the run for a year.  The rest of the novel is the chase by the bad guys and the obsession for the mother, Carol by haunted musician, Lonnie.<br />The characterizations are expertly done and highly believable.  Each player is etched on your mind.  This is the strongest part of the book.  However, the plot becomes so fantastic, it is almost ludicrous.  I can suspend belief for maybe three impossible escapes, but not ten or twenty.  The pace is pounding, and the ending is poignant; but I had left any believability behind.  Grade B-	2001-12-12

Somehow I missed his acclaimed \\"Iron Lake,\\" and I intend to correct that as soon as possible.  This is a fine story with the added bonus of magnificent descriptions of the great forests and lakes between the borders of Minnesota and Canada.  An added plus is the author's obvious expertise as a hunter, tracker and outdoorsman.<br />The heroes of this story are the Ojibwe Native Americans.  They are known for their story telling abilities, and Mr. Krueger shares a few fascinating tales.  The Ojibwe characters are not stereotypical (though maybe a mite noble) and are carefully drawn.  The lead character, Cork O'Connor, is a troubled, but satisfyingly invincible man.  I particularly liked the characterization of a professional hit man, a stone killer.<br />Shiloh, a celebrity country singer, is missing after a month's stay in a secret and remote part of the wilderness called the Boundary Waters.  The search parties are not all benign and want to ensure that Shiloh stays missing permanently.  The hunt is fast, furious and not for the faint hearted.  The casualty rate is high and the painful injuries are many.  Meanwhile, Shiloh is doing her own level best to get to civilization in one piece.  The wait on the home front is agonizing as the body count rises.<br />Mr. Krueger delivers a hard-hitting, fast paced novel without sacrificing some lyrical prose.  Recommended.	2001-12-04

We travel from Greece to the British Isles (a map of the UK would be a nice adjunct).  The cast of characters in another author's hands would be cumbersome.  A tribute to Goddard that even the minor characters are crisply delineated, and not once was I confused as to who was who.<br />Harry Bennett, a professional failure, has to be one of the more depressing heroes of all time.  He has no confidence, few social skills, and not one yearning desire to better himself.  He glumly concludes he is not worthy of success.  His stylistic sense is so poor; his rumpled appearance causes comment in even an average restaurant.  The late Carroll O'Connor could play the part to perfection.  On Harry's watch, the young and fragile Heather Mallender disappears while they are hiking up sinister Profitis Ilias Mountain in the Greek Isles.  Predictably, Harry has petered out slightly below the summit and elects to wait for Heather to complete the climb.  And that is the last he sees of Heather.  <br />The rest of the novel recounts Harry's painstaking search for Heather.  Harry is nothing if not persistent, and even his wrong turns forward his search.  Nothing is quite as it seems, even Harry.  Mr. Goddard has given us a story laced with irony.  As in a previous Goddard novel \\"Caught in the Light,\\" I had a good idea \\"who\\" was the main villain; I just had no idea \\"why.\\"  This is a finely crafted novel, and the characterizations are delightful.  A very satisfying read.	2001-12-04

The strongest area of the narrative is characterization; the extremely sympathetic Dr. Maslow Atkins, the thoroughly distasteful over-privileged teenagers, the self-absorbed parents, and the homeless bum, PeeWee.  The regulars:  April Woo, Skinny Dragon, Mike Sanchez, and Jason Frank remain fresh in this series.<br />The tale hinges on Dr. Atkins disappearance.  He takes off for his regular jog in the park at dusk, not even carrying his billfold, and drops from sight.  He is known as a man of very regular habits, and when he fails to show up for an appointment, Dr. Frank is concerned enough to call in his friend Detective April Woo.  The suspense notches sharply upward when we find out the would-be killers were interrupted in their attack on Dr. Atkins, and have hidden the wounded man in a culvert in a remote part of Central Park.  Will the killers come back and finish the job?  Will the police and K-9 dogs locate him first?  Will Dr. Atkins somehow effect his own release?  I found the scenario a real page-turner.<br />I get exasperated with April, who goes from a splendidly efficient police officer to giggling girlishness over her infatuation with chauvinistic Mike.  However, this is an ongoing trait in the entire series, and I put up with it as you do with a friend who seems to have a glaring weakness.  A larger theme of the story is how children who \\"have everything\\" can go so disastrously wrong.  Unlike some other readers, I had sympathy for the parents who, while gravely flawed themselves, had such monstrous offspring.  Most troubled children do not have the advantages of the best schools, and the best counseling money can buy.  In their inept and offhand way, these parents did love their children and surely, whatever their faults, did not deserve to be saddled with these juveniles from hell.<br />This is a worthy addition to a good series with an added bonus that it gives you something to think about after you close the book.

Rather than a novel experience, the reader brings preconceptions, prejudices, awe and maybe a whiff of resentment to a well-known book that is not entirely new to him.<br />Mr. Shute delivers a slow-starting novel, liturgically paced with an inexorable conclusion that is with us from page one.  This is the power of \\"On the Beach.\\" It has the inevitability of a Greek tragedy.  The characters and the reader self-deceive, twist, hope, pray and promise-all to no avail.<br />I would not call \\"On the Beach\\" timeless.  The behaviors seem quaint and dated fifty years after the writing of the book.  I doubt the characters had much believability even in 1957.  Moira Davidson goes from dissolute debauchery to saintly status without even a pause for proper redemption.  I can see the lovely Ava Gardner as the Jezebel, but it is quite a stretch to imagine her as St. Bernadette.   Mr. Shute casts an American as a central character, but unfortunately he has not much an ear for American speech.  For some reason, he believes American men, when addressing marriageable aged women leap from \\"Miss Davidson\\" to \\"honey\\" and then never call her anything else.  (I don't know, maybe \\"Moira\\" is hard to pronounce.)  Also, I fear Mr. Shute had little affinity for our youngest humans.  The Holmes' baby girl Jennifer, was always referred to as \\"it\\" by Mr. Shute.   These were small irritations, but jarring.<br />Nevertheless, the power of the book is undeniable.  There is a certain rightness that the events are larger than the humans involved.  The humans respond with an orderliness that is astonishing, but perhaps Mr. Shute was trying to be kind in a very unkind world. Grade:  3-1/2 stars.	2001-12-02
1749425:US	51197300	R1VNULUUR0QFGG	0802136036	83667253	Man with an Axe (Detective Sergeant Mulheisen, Book 7)	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Boppin' With Cool Jazz	\\"Max With An Axe\\" is Mr. Jackson's 7th \\"Fang\\" Mulheisen's novel.  The story is soaked with music and is pure Detroit.  As a first-time reader of Mr. Jackson with no knowledge of Detroit and not near as much jazz intelligence as I thought I had; I felt very much the latecomer to the party.  This series is one that definitely should be read in order.  However, this may require some perseverance because many of the earlier books are out of print.  The endeavor would be worthwhile because Mr. Jackson is a writer with a difference.  He has a smoky, almost opaque flavor that is very addictive.<br />The story has a good hook, i.e., \\"what really happened to Jimmy Hoffa?\\"  The tale is very plausible; one that getting there is half the fun.  The characters are indelible, not a hero in the bunch.  \\"Fang\\" so-called because of his wolverine smile (?) is an edgy cop, always faintly dissatisfied with himself.  He'd like to be totally stone (he loves his nickname), yet be seen as a cultured man.  He tries to quickly and subtly convince an educated acquaintance of his equal intellectuality.  Unfortunately, subtlety is not Fang's long suit.  You need to acquaint yourself quickly with many of the characters, because a goodly number are not going to be around very long.  Mr. Jackson doesn't telegraph his punches, and you are as surprised as the victims at their sudden demise.  The author has a knack for women characters; he is one of the few who lets them first develop as people, then gradually develops their feminine aspect, first and foremost how it affects themselves and secondly its effect on others.  I consider this unusual.   <br />This is an enjoyable multi-layered novel.  It requires some thought and insight by the reader and engenders empathy with some fairly low-life types.  Recommended.	2001-12-02

She is surely one of the great storytellers of the century and one of the most diverse.  She writes intricate mysteries, comic scenarios of Science Fiction buffs, and her lovely, haunting Ballad series.  <br />\\"Songcatcher\\" is anchored by Malcolm McCourry, the forefather, who is shanghaied from Islay, Scotland at age nine to become a seaman, lawyer, and early Appalachian mountaineer.  His legacy is an obscure Scottish ballad, \\"The Rowan Stave.\\"  His story, continued by his descendents, is interwoven with the modern day protagonists.  The early McCourrys are so vivid; the modern folks frequently seem pale in comparison.  The \\"curse\\" Malcolm passes down is his first born child and succeeding generation's first born children will be unloved and unappreciated.  The subsequent narrators are all first-born children, each baffled and hurt by the McCourry parent; yet they in turn unconsciously carry on this harsh legacy.  <br />The tale is full of ghosts, faeries, and things that go bump in the night.  The reader can believe or not believe; but they are there in a most matter-of-fact way.    There were a few too many storylines in the present-day world.  Joe LaDonne being trapped in the forest under old plane wreckage did not forward the story, and was a needless distraction.  There was no \\"mystery\\" per se, yet everything was a mystery.  Like the expert she is, Ms. McCrumb entices us with every new revelation and delivers a fast paced and gripping story. <br />\\"Songcatcher\\" is a worthy addition to the superb Ballad series.	2001-11-27

Mr. Mullen tells an engrossing tale of the odyssey of four young men striving for berths on the Olympic team, Australia 2000.  Most Americans are unaware of the depth, strength and long tradition of the USA's predominance in Olympic swimming.  US teams are so strong that unfortunately, we have to leave at home as many deserving finalists as those who go.  Only two representatives of each individual swimming event are allowed for each country.  (It used to be three, but the powers that be were tired of the US taking gold, silver and bronze in every event.)<br />The lead actors are All-American Tom Wilkens, multi-faceted Kurt Grote and everyone's dream or nightmare of a coach, Dick Jochums.  Supporting roles showcase super controlled Dod Wales, son of an acclaimed Olympic swimmer, and burn out Tate Blahnik who has it all, but is tired to death of competitive swimming.  The author follows these magical four for eighteen months culminating in the 2000 Olympics.  The front cover calls these four \\"ordinary men.\\"  I strongly disagree; they are unique and extraordinary athletes.  Tom Wilkens, in particular, grabbed my attention, affection, and awe.<br />This book is a page-turner; I read it in one sitting.  It is not just for swimming aficionados, but also for anyone who likes to read about what it takes to become a champion and the inevitable burdens on the strength and psyche of the contenders.  A glossary of terms would have been helpful, but the author is masterful in his explanations.  As a parent of a former age group swimmer, I can attest that this is no puff piece; Mr. Mullen tells it like it is.	2001-11-25

He didn't let me down; \\"Protect and Defend\\" is all of that and more.  But look in vain for a murder or whodunit, usual mainstays of Patterson's books. This novel, beautifully and painstakingly researched, stars the legal ramifications of parental consent for abortions; when, if ever, a late term abortion is lawful; the rights of minors; and the political morass involved in advise and consent of a Supreme Court Justice. <br />The courtroom scenes are masterful and brilliant.  Patterson sympathetically portrays the anguish and honor of good parents and the youthful poignance of a teenager caught in an unbearably stressful media circus.  When we are out of the courtroom, the novel is less even-handed dealing with conservatives and liberals.  Lobbyists get a very short shrift from Mr. Patterson; they are all wicked and venal.  In fairness to the author, I noted in Acknowledgements that his requests for interviews were refused by two of the major Christian Conservative groups.  So if the book lacks depth in their portrayal, it is understandable. <br />Some of the characters have played major roles in other Patterson novels, notably the admirable Caroline Masters who is the nominee for Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.  She is a complex figure, not entirely sympathetic because of her glacial reserve.  I consider this a good thing for otherwise, she would be too perfect for anything but a morality tale.  The storyline for the conflicted Republican senator whose daughter was pathetically fragile psychologically was predictable and overly dramatic.<br />The book gives the reader all sides of explosive issues, and engages our thoughts and makes us question pat assumptions we have in place.  If nothing else, our horizons are expanded.  An excellent work by a thoughtful author.	2001-11-25

Read \\"24/7.\\"  For us uncomplicated souls who are slaves to \\"Survivor,\\" we will enjoy competition to the max and a fine fix for our need to see ordinary people cope. (Though these characters are far from ordinary!).  For those who despise the whole concept of such entertainment, you will get a cackle or two out of what happens when everything goes as wrong as it can on a reality show.<br />I read the book as if an animated film were unfolding and the dialogue was voice-overs.  What happens if the hero climbs a flimsy radio tower to escape the inferno below him?  Why a helicopter just happens to fly over, drop a ladder, and whisks him away from the leaping flames!<br />The book is good-natured with more story lines than a daytime soap opera, but somehow the author manages to control his story.  With the exception of the principals, who come off like Tess Trueheart and Dick Stover, the characterizations are interesting and well done.  I particularly liked a former Miss Universe who has the survival instincts of a cornered cobra.<br />Though not for the faint of heart, the author delivers an exciting story that has more than its share of twists, turns and surprises.

The characters are out of the ordinary and multifaceted.  The locale is an integral part of the tale and never far from our mind.  There are many players, yet the author makes each so distinctive, the reader never has the dismaying problem of trying to remember who is who and why are they are appearing or disappearing.  <br />The inbred inhabitants of Scardale may have some genetic degeneration, but lack of shrewdness isn't one of them.  Also their ability to close ranks when one of their own is threatened is awe-inspiring.  I felt there was a little too much agonizing and soul searching on the part of George Bennett, the newly minted Detective Inspector on the case; however, his doggedness was presented well.  He was both appealing and exasperating.  There were a few clunky clues, and I had a strong suspicion of the guilty party, but was mystified throughout as to how the author was going to resolve the mystery.<br />Recommend this thoughtful, exciting book for anyone, particularly a \\"cozy\\" lover who would like to expand his or her horizons.	2001-11-25

The stock is heavy and glossy and the colors sharp and clear.  Many watercolors included have not been publicly seen for years, as many private collectors contributed their paintings for this exhibition.  The dates of the compositions range from the early 30's through the late 90's.<br />The two most recognized American artists of the 20th Century are Andys-Wyeth and Warhol, and they have more in common than their initials.  Both are controversial and neither is as \\"realistic\\" as accused and/or categorized.  <br />My enjoyment of Andrew Wyeth was never diminished by the fact that I had a lot of company.  Popularity does not necessarily mean inferiority in spite of what the self-consuming art world tells us.  True, you have to have a certain fondness for bleak settings to properly take pleasure in most of the paintings.  I often idly wondered if Wyeth ever painted landscapes in spring or summer and why he was so enamored of bare earth and beige and brown compositions.  I have never seen as many abstracts as are contained in this book.<br />The essays in the book are interesting, but not so prevalent as to overshadow the marvelous prints.  My only complaint is the book is an unhandy shape, longer than it is tall, making it difficult to shelve.  However, this is minor.  Many hours of viewing pleasure are in store.	2001-11-18

Lou, the 12-year old principal story mover, is many faceted.  She is far from perfect; has a propensity for arrogance and holds grudges like a bad-tempered Missouri mule.  Her devotion and loyalty to her family and friends and her sincere contrition when she has hurt someone ultimately tip the balance in her favor.  What I liked best was the author allowed her to be a child with a child's quick enthusiasms and wonder.  I am tired up to here with child characters/actors who are 10 going on 40.<br />The story moves along, but creaks in a few places.  Overall, I felt it was more a young adult book.  Many reviewers compared the book to Harper Lee's \\"To Kill A Mockingbird.\\"  I did not see much similarity, given these were orphaned, uprooted children living a hard hand-to-mouth existence in the rural mountainous south.  I found the story more like a hard-edged \\"Walton Family.\\" The goodness- will-triumph parallel was there.<br />\\"Wish You Well\\" is not a disappointment.  The story is engaging and well detailed, but the solutions are a little too easy. When all else fails, slip in a miracle or two.  Grade C+	2001-11-18

During a normal business day, which for Freddie is robbery/burglary, he runs afoul of two young research doctors.  They capture Freddie, and decide he will be their human volunteer for an experiment they are conducting for a tobacco research institute.  The experiment inadvertently succeeds beyond any expectation, and Freddie is invisible-and escapes.  Everyone: doctors, tobacco industry, and crooked cops want Freddie for all the wrong reasons.<br />The author has given careful thought to all aspects of being invisible and uses them well.  In a nutshell, invisibility has few advantages and many woes for the hapless victim.  Freddie must either be naked (including shoeless) or done up like a scarecrow with a fright mask, gloves, and every inch of him covered.  He must modestly distance himself from the public for at least two hours after dining while his food travels down his intestinal track.  Freddy fortunately has a sunny disposition and a great deal of patience.  He also is blessed with a cheery, beautiful, slightly skewed girlfriend who reminded me of Elaine in Seinfeld without the neuroses.<br />The book has many humorous moments and some excellent insights, but it seems erratically paced.  There are slow moments and repetitious action.  I felt the author got a little weary of his own edifice.  The ending was so abrupt; I actually looked for a few more pages.  I don't know if it was Mr. Westlake's intent, but the last scene seems melancholy and wistful.  The farce turned into a melodrama without a connecting passage.  I was left vaguely unsatisfied.	2001-11-17

Protagonist Dr. Claude \\"Luke\\" Lucas is a true man of his time.  The story revolves around our first space launch, treachery, double agents, just the right amount of romance, and a satisfyingly non-telegraphed whodunit.  Particular praise to British author Follett being so right on in telling a uniquely American tale.<br />Luke's autobiographical amnesia (he retains his skills and knowledge, but has no memory of who he is or any of his interpersonal relationships) is well done.  I just wished we had been kept in suspense longer regarding his true identity.  The story was riveting while he logically tries to piece together, using every faculty left to him, just who he might be. <br />The characterizations are good, if a few too many of them.  Cape Canaveral is well depicted and we catch the excitement of a space launch that no longer exists today.  I didn't think the premise that if this particular launch was not successful, the USA was forever doomed to be in the backwater of space technology, was overly compelling. Old pro Follett delivers on crackling suspense in the final countdown.<br />I was introduced to Ken Follett via \\"Eye of the Needle\\" and was completely blown away by this wonderful story and went on a tear reading other Follett tales.  He's a consistent good storyteller, but there is no denying there is an uneveness in quality.  \\"Code to Zero\\" is no \\"Eye of the Needle,\\" but it is certainly very fine Follett.

(We blush for him.)  I was surprised that the \\"Reader's Digest\\" was the source for some of the material, and a few (very few, to be fair) of the brilliant thinkers were Oprah, Erica Jong, and Marlene Dietrich.  Delightful ladies all, but Most Brilliant Thinkers of All Time?<br />I am a junkie for books of quotes and maxims, though I freely admit this shows a certain lack of depth. There are many quotes included that you wish you had for ready reference, such as Ralph Waldo Emerson's <br />\\"People seem not to see that their opinion of the world is also a confession of character.\\"<br />My, wouldn't I just like to spring that one on some of my more pessimistic friends!  However, unless you memorize the ones you like, \\"Most Brilliant, etc.\\" is not user-friendly.  It has no subject or line index, which I find very irritating and a major drawback.<br />The sections are vague, and quotes are repeated in different sections.  It could be Mr. Shannahan thought one quote applicable to many situations, but it seems like padding.  The book is handsome, with the quotes well spaced and easy to read.  I met a few I had never seen before, and am stirred to further inquiry on some of the authors.  Grade: C-	2001-11-17

He woke up in the middle of his Winter Sleep.  He sees a world he never saw before.  He is by turns frightened, lonely, persevering, and at times just a mite irritated.  Thus begins this charming tale told with subtlety and grace by the talented Tove Jansson.<br />The creatures may be strange and wondrous, but somehow we feel as if we might have met them before someplace.  Haven't we all known someone like the Hemulen:  large, cheerful, energetic without a mean bone in his body who always wants us to enjoy the cold brisk air and strenuous sports with him-and why is it we don't exactly like him very well?<br />The descriptions of Moomin world are lovely and fanciful.  Early spring clouds are \\"scatterbrained\\" rushing along.  The Great Cold is beautiful, but ominous.  This is a book for all ages.  It saddens me my children are not young enough to be read to anymore.  The Moomins, like Winnie the Pooh, are perfect read-alouds with assured discussions afterward.<br />A lovely book.  Highly recommended.	2001-11-13

Mr. Pears proves he cannot be pigeonholed into one writing category.<br />Jonathan &amp; Flavia are a delightful twosome headquartered in Rome, but over half the action takes place in a small village in England.  The author is obviously well grounded in the style and flavor of both places.  His descriptions of the wiles of Italian bureaucracy are priceless.  He has a fine ear for dialogue (see following) and wittiness in comparison between the English vs. Italian spirit:<br />Flavia:  \\"Why would anyone sneer at someone being charming?<BR>Jonathan: \\"Because this is England, my dear, and that's what we do here.\\"<BR>F:  \\"Why?  I like people to be charming.\\"<BR>J.: \\"But you're Italian.  In this country charm means you're superficial, have a tendency to flattery, are probably a bumptious social climber and, moreover, the term carries very distinct implications that you like women.\\"<BR>F: \\"What's wrong with that?\\"<BR>J: \\"A ladies' man,\\" Argyll said darkly.  \\"Few things can be worse.  It suggests a propensity to slobber over people's hands and pay compliments like some continental.  You can do that sort of thing with dogs, but not with the opposite sex.\\"<br />It is rare that a mystery makes me laugh aloud and even rarer that I want to, but Mr. Pears succeeds on all counts.  My only problem with the book was most of the characters had a fastidious disinclination to become involved in the plot.  I kept thinking I must get them back on track some way or another.  Also, Mr. Argyll was so full of moral considerations, I feared for Flavia's financial well-being.  What Jonathan would or would not do with ill gotten gains ratcheted up the suspense for me considerably.<br />This is a fine, clever and cunning read.  Recommended as a mood lifter.	2001-11-12

She's still on Long Island, thankfully financially \\"comfortable\\" (I couldn't bear for Judy to be poor), and girlishly romantic.<br />As always, Ms. Isaacs is witty, clever and frequently hilarious.  Her detailed take on victim Courtney is at once brilliant and hauntingly familiar of over-achievers we have known.  The plot is cunning, and I guarantee you will have a hard time getting ahead of the author.  I could have done without the resurrection of the 20-years dead affair with policeman Nelson Sharpe.  Judy is surely too smart to get hooked up with a multi-married, none-to-faithful, uninteresting guy.  For this I have to subtract a star.<br />\\"Long Time No See\\" is a fast entertaining read, not as brilliant as my favorite \\"After All These Years,\\" but nonetheless, a lot of fun.  Recommended.	2001-11-07

I have a special place for Vidal; in spite of his monumental conceits, his brilliance sweeps one along.  On the conceit front, he actually gives himself a cameo part noting that poor fictional Peter Sandford has gone to fat, but Vidal is imperially slim.  I had to smile, as the real-life Vidal has always had a weight problem.<br />Most of the publicity on this book concerns whether FDR \\"knew\\" in advance of the attack on Pearl Harbor.  There is a nicety here that the publicists overlook.  Vidal maintains President Roosevelt \\"knew\\" there would be an attack in the Pacific, but not where.  His best guess was the Philippines.  To me, this is an important difference and casts a much more kindly light on FDR.   Vidal's unusual take (negative) on Harry Truman is worth the price of the book.  As always, Vidal is waspish with historical characters that do not meet with his approval.  I vividly recall my shock at his unfavorable view of Thomas Jefferson in \\"Burr.\\"  He has satirist Dawn Powell, in a two-page monologue, doing a non-stop hilariously wicked take on Ernest Hemingway.  I don't know if Vidal is quoting Powell direct or if we are hearing Vidal speaking through Powell, but whatever it is, one of them (or both) are masters of invective.<br />\\"Golden Age\\" is an entertaining and thoughtful read.  The history is precise and the conclusions are compelling.  If you like your history with a dash of wry, this is the book for you.  Recommended.	2001-11-07

Michael Palmer does well with female protagonists, making them human sized and interesting.  The Boston terrain is well handled and should be a pleasure for locals to read.<br />The CIA agent, Alex Bishop, is a bit of a problem.  He has no visible means of support, has been drummed out of the CIA, yet somehow get cooperation and spending money from where we do not know.  He gets shot and an hour later is chasing a villain through the streets of Boston, pounding up stairs, leaping through traffic and hurtling fences.  By rights, he should be dead, but he barely draws a deep breath.  Some editing was needed when Alex starts a chase early in the a.m., only to have twilight descend two hours later.<br />There were too many impossible situations; luck can carry one only so far.  However, Mr. Palmer sketched the scenes vividly and kept the readers interest involved to the very end.  I never doubted for a moment that good would triumph.	2001-11-07

Picture this:  Parker and friends have pulled the perfect heist and Parker is holding the money till the heat cools down.  Then an AMATEUR sneaks in, kills Parker's girl friend of the moment, finds and takes the stash, takes a couple of shots at Parker, and sets him up as the patsy for the murder. --- Parker is less than pleased.<br />From here on in it is non-stop action with all seven members of Parker's team hunting down the Amateur (who has a phobic fear of gunfire-someone else's, that is.)  The cops get in the act and chase everyone while the body count rises.  <br />Parker's partners are well drawn and each is sharply defined.  By getting to know them, like in many Parker novels, you find yourself rooting for the bad guys.  \\"The Split\\" like \\"Slayground\\" is almost total action, but Stark somehow gives us a sense of people and place, on the fly as it were.  The Amateur, who is being stalked relentlessly, pauses for breath and thinks, \\"That's what death is; getting your heel caught in a crack of time.\\"<br />This is an elegant, dark side of Donald Westlake.  He should write the manual on anti-heroes.  Highly recommended.	2001-11-06

Some reviewers seem upset with the book exactly as they would a child who changed from attractive and lively into teenage angst before their eyes.<br />There is more evidence of Mary Karr the poet in this book.  She is not chronicling so much as experiencing.  Her kindness and tenderness toward the boys who touched her life is a fine strength in \\"Cherry.\\"  Rarely have I come across such lyricism in describing the beauty of a young male.<br />\\"His surfer cut hung in a bright wing across his forehead. He stood stock still in his pedals for the entire strip of road past my house like the figurehead on a ship's prow, and his thoughtless beauty dragged from me the faint tug of something like desire.  His body was thin-muscled as a greyhound's.  Maybe his hurtling motion made enough wind to cool him off, but he didn't look to suffer from the heat I felt so squandered in.\\"<br />I winced with Mary when she looked back with pain at her own self-centeredness, her dismissal and uncaringness for anyone's pain but her own.  Her descriptions of life as lived and hopefully survived in High School USA are right on the money.  She had a fierce independence that most teens lack, but she certainly did wallow in her rebellion.<br />The last quarter of the book was self-indulgence, I know no other way to describe it.  Ms. Karr distances herself by abandoning the first person \\"I\\" to the second person \\"you\\" for her drug induced psychedelic outing.  It went on too long.  Weird tripping is only fascinating to the tripper; it was like having someone go on and on about their strange dream last night.  I felt as if I had been dropped into a bad David Lynch movie.  This segment spoiled my enjoyment of an otherwise fine book.<br />I look forward to Mary Karr's next outing and recommend \\"Cherry\\" for anyone who doesn't mind taking a wild ride through the early `70s.	2001-11-04

A mysterious group headquartered in Washington D.C. who call themselves \\"Locard\\" (in honor of a 19th century French policeman) and specialize in solving old murders, have called upon Alan for some specific services.  This peculiar society (why do I keep thinking of Peter Straub?) apparently has some clout as they can freely access old records, and investigate at will.<br />Alan is to do \\"psychological\\" background on an unsolved murder of two teenage girls that took place a number of years ago in the Boulder, Colorado area.  Wife Lauren is to investigate the legal aspects.  With this rather unlikely premise, White gives us an intricate plot but not too many shocking revelations.  I was impressed with his knowledgeable and precise description of just what happens when a character suffers a full-fledged panic/anxiety attack.  It was so vivid; I suffered right along with him.<br />My favorite Stephen White novel is \\"Higher Authority\\" where all his strengths (good plotting, strong characterization) are in place without the flaws of over emphasis on his wife's fragility, extraneous characters, and overly minute descriptions of how he gets from Point A to Point B (street directions, vehicle, scenery, road conditions, etc.).  <br />\\"Cold Case\\" is a little overlong, neither his best nor his worst, a fairly pleasant read with few surprises.	2001-10-28

I am in awe of Stark's (Donald Westlake) skills at placing the entire action in a closed-for-the-season amusement park with only one exit.  Parker is trapped not only by crooked cops, but the bad guys as well.  What a kaleidoscope of rides, color and strange machinery!  Yet it is all aslant.  Rather than crowds and summertime weather, it is empty, cold and bleak. <br />The tension never lets up.  Will the bad guys find Parker's stash?  Will they corner him?  Can he pull another trick out of his bag?  Will the scaffolding hold?<br />I am always baffled when people complain of lack of characterization in Parker novels.  To me, the beauty is being right inside Parker's head when he meticulously plans his heists, revenge, and plans.  True, we never read of honor, sensitivity, introspection, and love for the very good reason Parker possesses none of these traits.  I always think Parker would be a totally successful CEO of a giant corporation if he had taken up another line of work.<br />\\"Slayground\\" is vintage Parker, hard-boiled, violent and as perfectly crafted as a fine watch.	2001-10-28

Rochefort is lively explaining the Parisian character and habits.  I started to wonder if she had a deeper agenda, a subtext of \\"now you see what I have had to put up with for the last 20 years.\\"<br />To this American, the book was not a beacon to make me want to take up residence in Paris.  I guess it is a relief to know that the French are not just rude to us tourists; they act that way with everyone they don't know personally.  Cold comfort indeed!  The reserve, cattiness, the infinity of detail, cold suspicion, and boredom of only associating with one (and only one) set of people left me certain I would perennially be a total outsider.<br />The author has an interesting section on French education vs. U.S. education methods.  There is certainly a lot to be said for the French no-nonsense, draconian approach.  I am sure it would be horrifying to many U.S. parents; however, I believe if we could strike a balance between French harshness and U.S. permissiveness in education, we would all benefit.  Mme. Rochefort, an educator herself, is well satisfied with the education her two sons have received in France.  This says a great deal for their system.<br />Ms. Rochefort is a thoughtful, amazingly tolerant woman.  Think the book should be taken a little more seriously than its frivolous cover.	2001-10-28

The comet that destroys the earth is a starkly \\"random\\" event.  One more orbit, one less piece of debris, and we could have had a miss.  I enjoyed the science aspects of the book, which is unusual for me.  Almost all the astronomy is clearly presented and easy to understand.  <br />\\"Lucifer's Hammer\\" is the first apocalyptic novel I have read that takes up famine as a major factor in surviving.  It is explained convincingly and is horrific in its implications.  The general behavior of the survivors (poor) seemed much more realistic to me than the God-like heroism in most such novels.  Cannibalism would not be unusual at all, but it would probably be done in a clandestine way, everybody's \\"dirty little secret,\\" not an article of faith, as depicted in the book.  The horrendous geographical upheavals-earthquakes, tidal waves, and volcanic eruptions are handled expertly and realistically.<br />The start was slow and the setting of characters was haphazard.  There were too many, and the similarity in names was confusing:  Hardy, Harry, Harvey-and the two major females Maureen and Eileen-give me a break here!  Some reviewers have painted the authors as racist, particularly objecting to a black leader flaunting cannibalism and discussions of \\"slaves\\" in the new world order.  No one black, white, yellow or brown behaved with complete honor or integrity.  It is realistic to imply that no one performs well when they are terrified, whatever their racial makeup.  A good point was made when one character vehemently objected to the use of the word \\"slave,\\" but agreed that \\"prisoners of war\\" would have no rights and would have to undertake the most menial and disagreeable tasks.  Ah, what a difference a \\"word\\" makes!<br />The paperback copy I purchased (new) fell apart, so I now have a collection of unbound pages.  Most irritating.  I found the writing somewhat uneven, often the case where there are collaborators, rather thanone author.  Overall, \\"Lucifer's Hammer\\" is a rewarding read, clear in its intent, and often thought provoking.	2001-10-16

We are never certain if it is the school that is so odd or Jacob.  He decides the other teachers \\"either do not exist, of they are still asleep, or they seem to have forgotten their profession\\" for the teaching responsibilities are taken solely by Herr Benjamenta or his dying sister Fraulein Benamenta.<br />This slim novel is Jacob's soliloquy to us.  He is charming, buoyant, perhaps mad, and never intimidated.  He reflects upon himself, his fellow students, his family and the Benjamentas with interest, sympathy, and occasional sadness.  <br />Even when Jacob is frightened (rarely), he is intrigued and fascinated at what is happening to and around him, as when he incurs the ire of Herr Benjamenta:<br />\\"I'm writing this in a hurry.  I'm trembling all over.  There are lights dancing and flickering before my eyes. Something terrible has happened, seems to have happened, I hardly know what it was.  Herr Benjamenta has had a fit and tried to-strangle me.  Is this true?  I can't think straight; I can't say what happened is true.  But I'm so upset it must be true-\\"<br />I ended this novel very fond of Jacob.  I know I will find him unforgettable.  I believe the translation must be very good as the prose is fluid with Jacob's idiosyncrasies of speech intact.  Highly recommended.	2001-10-15

Richard Stark (Donald Westlake), where have you been all my life?  Yes, I have read and enjoyed the Westlake capers, and particularly liked the deft and humorous touches.  Who would have dreamed, this same man could come up with Parker?<br />Parker is impersonal, a completely professional robber and sometimes murderer.  He rarely murders with any passion, unless you consider \\"irritation\\" a strong enough emotion to rate as \\"passion.\\"  We are not told where Parker comes from or how he became the way he is.  However, he is by no means a robot.  He is skillfully presented with many shadings of character. <br />The title refers to Parker's new face.  He has undergone plastic surgery to make himself more anonymous to anyone looking for him.  He is quite indifferent to this new face with not a thought to whether it is an improvement or otherwise on the original.  The story is a caper that begins dubiously (\\"too many things to watch out for\\"), and he is right to be doubtful.   In spite of his meticulous planning (a joy to read for sheer professionalism), more and more factors clog up the works.  We are saved from a bloodbath because Parker is not a vindictive man.<br />I marvel at the perfection of the writing; the story flows, everything fits and there are no loose ends (Parker would not stand for that.)  It's a fast read, and I am now totally addicted. The Parker books are just coming back into print, and those that are not are usually available used. Come join the fun if you like your mysteries and humor very noir.	2001-10-15

The government is a combination of brutal dictatorship with a Luddite cast of mind.  Women have lost all rights and are to think of themselves as pure vessels of procreation-that is when they think at all.<br />The book is presented in diary form, one that has been written after the fact.  We never know our heroine's birth name.  She, like her fellow handmaids, is christened anew when she is posted to a new assignment.  A handmaid's job is to get pregnant by the high-ranking husband-of-the-house who hired her.  If there is a resulting child, it belongs to her employer and his wife.  The birth rate is very low and live births are few.  If she succeeds, she is given another post.  If she fails after three posts, she is banished or worse.  Her present singularly ugly name is \\"Offred.\\"  Her employer is \\"Fred\\" and she is merely \\"of Fred.\\"<br />Offred is an intelligent, sometimes lyrical woman, who in the very recent past had a husband, child and career before the upheaval.  She is often suicidally depressed, but tries very hard to resign herself to the present without completely losing her sense of the past.  She is lyrical and evocative and has a shrewd eye for her fellow humans.  She accepts but does not respect the laws and persons she lives under.<br />Many of these reviews are by students that were forced to read this novel on assignment.  I was fortunate to come by it by happy chance.  I sympathize with being directed to read; I have never enjoyed George Eliot or William Wordsworth for that very reason.  However, Offred has much to proffer and does so in an engaging manner.  Her situation is dire.  Her description of sexual intercourse with her employer vividly emphasizes her shame and the low caste she has been assigned.  The customs surrounding the birth of a child are repulsive, prudish nonsense.<br />I did not see \\"Handmaiden\\" as a feminist tract.  It seemed to me the men were just as regimented and unhappy as the women.  I enjoyed this well-told futuristic story and recommend it. You can even provide your own ending.	2001-10-10

Mr. Wertheim writes sensitively of the various players, and describes their playing styles with flair.  The book starts with the first of the Grand Slam Events of 2000, the Australian Open, and takes us through the competitive year.  The book is so contemporary, you get the feeling you are reading up-to-the-minute sports coverage.<br />Each Grand Slam event has its own personality.  Why do all the players dislike the U.S. Open?  Love the Australian?  Ambivalent about the French?  Some of the authors observations about the Sainted Wimbledon will surprise you.  <br />The players:  the lady in the title and her sister Serena Williams get extended coverage, but other players are not slighted.  The Williams sisters come off as well brought up girls, frighteningly mature on the courts, yet almost typical teenagers in their off-court interests.  Their closeness is exemplified by an oft-repeated childhood exchange:<br />Venus Serena whispers<BR>What is it Serena?<BR>Dont go to sleep before me.<BR>Im tired, Serena.<BR>Well, Im scared.<BR>OK.<br />The over-hyped Anna Kournikova is not given a single brownie point for grace or personality.  She damns herself every time she opens her mouth reinforcing her stupendous self-absorption.  However, as the author points out, she is no George Hamilton who is famous for being famous and a good tan.  In spite of the fact she has won no tournament championships, she was at the writing ranked #8 and deservedly.  She has individually beaten the best, but seems to clutch in the end game.<br />It seems Womens Tennis is more and more a game of the giants.  The top players are Big Girls and totally buff, into strength and power.  Venus Williams 2nd serve is regularly over 100 mphone fears her 1st might exceed the speed of sound.  Most of the girls are topping out over six feet, more than half a foot over the norm.<br />The book is a fast and interesting read.  I completed it in one sitting.  The author is knowledgeable with a sassy journalists edge.  Recommended for the non-tennis buff as well as the Total Fan.	2001-10-10

Science Fiction enthusiasts have gathered at a hotel in a southern city for a conference on the latest happenings, gossip, and technical advances in their field.  They are stratified between professionals (authors), gamesters, Trekkies, hard science and fantasists.  Ms. McCrumb spares no one; yet is sympathetically insightful to many of society's misfits who seem drawn to these events:<br />\\"Children stared at Brenda when she passed on the streets; people made remarks about her in public, seeming not to care if she heard them   They seemed to think they were giving her constructive criticism, or perhaps alerting her to a hitherto overlooked fact-as if it had somehow escaped her notice that she weighed two hundred and sixty seven pounds.\\"<br />With all the fantabulous people and their jaw-dropping activities, it doesn't seem of major importance that a particularly successful, acid tongued author is dispatched.  There is speculation as to how much his autograph might now be worth and some scuffling over the rights to his last manuscript but few are interested in who did the dastardly deed.  The voice of sanity belongs to a Scottish folk-singer who just was passing through and was bewildered by and sometimes appalled at this strange group.<br />I confess I was at one with the conners in not caring particularly whodunnit.  I didn't want to take time out from the party and seriously investigate.  A fun outing, and you will learn something new-the easy way.	2001-10-09

Conversely, he is willing to go all sails unfurled into vast global matters.  There is a great deal more politics in the collection than I expected.  Mr. Barnes must be former Prime Minister Thatcher's bête noir for he ever so elegantly lacerates her at every turn.  However, since the political letters are highly topical and they were written between 1991 and 1994, it is a bit like reading yesterday's newspaper.<br />He fares much better when musing over a small happenings or events.  Somehow he sparks our interest and amusement in such unlikely subjects as Building Mazes or the First World Championship Chess Match Held in Great Britain.  I think he is at his best and wittiest when discussing traits of his fellow Englishmen.  In his letter \\"Froggy, Froggy\\" talking about the lack of understanding between the average Brit and the French cast of mind:  \\"The bickering legacy of history is exacerbated on the British side by the poverty of geography.  Britain has only France as its obvious neighbor, while France may divert itself with three other major cultures-Spain, Italy, and Germany.  Beyond France's southern shore lies Africa; beyond Britain's northern shore lie the Faeroe Islands and many seals.  Small wonder, then, that we think about the French much more than they think about us.  The British are obsessed by the French, whereas the French are only intrigued by the British.\\"<br />\\"Letters From London\\" can be enjoyed in small parcels, a letter at a time or read straight through.  Highly pleasurable for anyone who is even a minor  anglophile.	2001-10-01

It has some excellent recipes-her Savannah Red Rice on her Gumbo Dinner menu is a worthy addition to \\"things to do with rice.\\"  The menus were thoughtful, and something I had never seen before: The Bereavement Buffet.  Ms. Villas suggests a good friend or family member take charge of the after-the-funeral gathering and have it at their home rather than the close friends and family, covered dishes in hand, troop to the home of the bereaved.  Makes a lot of sense.<br />The problem with the book is evident on the front cover: A very handsome picture of various cooking entries placed on a white tablecloth.  The picture features the food and no attention is paid to the setting.  The book has sketchy comments here and there as to types of china and crockery used or maybe what flowers were picked from the garden to dress the table.  I expect a book on Entertaining to have a few (hopefully many) lavish pictures of table settings.  Schedules are a boon and things that can be cooked ahead are a must.  Invitations and how they should be communicated is a big help.  For instance, Martha Pearl does not give us a clue how people at the funeral are going to know where the buffet is.<br />The book is an extension of \\"Southern Kitchen\\" with barely a nod to Entertaining.  However, the recipes are good, precise and easy to follow.  It is written in an entertaining manner.	2001-10-01

While never doubting her talent, reading her was frequently as pleasant as drinking a glass of vitriol.<br />Mary indeed had a childhood, and unusual it was.  I am sure it marked her forever to lose both her parents within a week of one another to influenza at age six.  To add to the horror, the family was traveling by train to start a new life in Minnesota.  Mary, herself, was deathly ill with the virus, and that colored her impressions of the tragic event.  <br />Some reviewers and the book jacket describe her childhood as \\"Dickensonian,\\" I presume referring to Oliver Twist.  I disagree, as Mary came from a well-to-do family that didn't lack for the material things of life.  She lived with an aunt and uncle from her 6th to 11th year and was tremendously unhappy, claiming she didn't have enough to eat, was dressed in hand-me-downs and frequently beaten.  Yet all photos of this time depict a well-dressed, well-fed child. At age 11, she was taken to live with her benevolent, wealthy grandparents in Seattle.  From that time on, she received the kindest attention and was expensively educated.  My doubts about those five early years are because Ms. McCarthy all her life was an implacable, unforgiving enemy when her feelings were aroused.<br />The memoir is beautifully written with sharp and fascinating characterizations of her family.  She appends each chapter with an epilogue taking an adult's eye-view of her childhood impressions.  It is most effective.  You are constantly reaffirming her brilliance.  Well worth reading.	2001-09-24

I have never read a more harrowing inside-the-mind of a totally subjugated woman. Rose Daniels is at the complete mercy of her abusive husband, Norman who is a highly regarded police officer. Rose is convinced (probably rightly) that she has no possibilities of escape. Norman is an expert tracker and can count on the cooperation of his fellow police officers. The reader agonizes with Rose to just get the nerve to go out the front door. When Rose finally winds up her courage, she escapes with just what she is standing up in and the \\"family\\" bankcard. She leaves as if the hounds of hell were pursuing her (again, she's right), and takes a bus to a large city that sounds like Chicago. I was amazed SK let us out of Maine!<br />The book is a hefty one and takes us through Rose's happy readjustment, fantasy segments involving a mysterious picture she purchased, and then the horror of Norman closing the distance between them. No one can get more mileage than SK in using a popular song, saying, or nursery rhyme to scare us to death. (Remember \\"Heeere's Johnny!\\" in \\"The Shining.\\") In \\"Rose Madder,\\" it's \\"The Name Game.\\" The last third of the book Norman metamorphizes from an understandable, if despicable human being into a full-fledged monster, part Cyclopean bull. I know Stephen King has a wonderful time with his monsters, but I found Norman more chilling when he was human and Rose was an intelligent woman trying to survive, rather than an Amazon-like goddess.<br />Highly entertaining; however, I would have preferred less fantasy. \\"Dark Tower\\" fans will love it.	2001-09-24

If I had to use one word to describe this book, it would be \\"cautious.\\"  Ms. Smith is ever-mindful of what goes around can indeed come around and therefore, the book has an \\"I Will Not Be Offensive\\" air, particularly to mega stars, publishers, and the like.<br />Ms. Smith must be a lady who lives in the \\"now.\\"  There is no past, no future, just today.  She entertainingly writes of her childhood in Texas, but once she has left home, Texas and the family disappear.  She had two marriages, both unsuccessful, and she writes as if she doesn't remember them very well.  She doesn't complain, she doesn't reflect, just moves on.  She never tackles the power/respect problems, i.e., how many of these glittery people are really her friends, and how many merely fear the power of her column?  How does she feel about her entire literary reputation is based upon a gossip column?  I think it would be a lonely and uncertain life; however, I don't even know if Ms. Smith has considered such things.  In her excellent last chapter, she discusses frankly what goals she had had and whether she had met or exceeded them.  Perhaps she did not reach high enough.  <br />The writing is snappy, and moderately interesting.  Grade: C	2001-09-24

In actuality, the book is a suspenseful tale along the lines of the classic movie \\"Night of the Hunter\\" with Robert Mitchum.  However, \\"Absence of Nectar\\" has a bonus in sassy, thoughtful 11-year old narrator named Alice.<br />The characters are Alice, her mystical brother Boone, simple-minded mother Meg, and the slimy intruder Simon Jester.  No. 1 Supporting Role goes to Persely Snow, the girl who poisoned her parents and has a popular cult status for her continuing success in escaping from the lunatic asylum.  Boone (the \\"saint\\") collects Persely's  newspaper clippings and moonily writes her letters.  To round off this odd-ball cast of characters are the 5-year old Laird twins, a gnomish duo who like anything they can kill, their beautiful sister Lucinda, whose mind stopped when in an accident at the age of nine; and Spencer Kotosky, a neurasthenic child who Alice adores for reasons no one can fathom except Alice.<br />The author excels at setting up a lyrical scene only to bring the reader up short with terror.  The children are excellent in their inventive independence but only too aware of their helplessness in a hostile adult world.  I particularly liked the author's sympathetic portrayal of the mother Meg.  We read of mothers who take on boyfriends and stand by while said boyfriend abuses their children.  Meg is one of these women.  She loves her children, but is more child-like than they are.  She feels as if she will disappear without a man, and to keep this man she thinks is essential to her survival.  I went from anger, disgust, to pity for this woman.<br />I recommend this novel as an entertaining read.  The prose occasionally gets a little purple, but is consistent with the story she is telling.  And a very good story it is.	2001-09-11

His credentials are enormous. Not only is he one of the top climbers of his generation, he writes with great force, grace and originality. His previous books \\"Nanda Devi: The Tragic Expedition\\" and \\"Stories Off the Wall\\" belong in any enthusiast's collection.<br />The attempts on Himalayan peaks Tawoche and Menlungtse are the foundation of this book. What? Not Everest, or at least K2? Been there and done that. With John, it is the Route, the Complexity, and the Satisfaction of Solving the Problem. His writing is so clear, he can write of very technical maneuvers and be interesting. But this book is more than just a recapitulation of the climb. He has strong opinions on many facets of the sport and the people who take part. He strongly favors alpine style climbing, which is basically climbing light (small team, little equipment as possible and minimal \\"porter\\" help). The large \\"expedition\\" style (think 1996 Everest) does not win many points with the author. He is at his strongest when he writes of the interaction between teammates on the climb; he puts a human face on the endeavor like no other mountaineering author I have read.<br />Just when I have about given up on mean, tough John Roskelley, he writes a passage of such grace, I have to do an instant re-evaluation:<BR>---\\" Tibet has a beauty all its own. It isn't found in a single rock or within a village or even along a meandering creek, no more than a single brush stroke in a Renoir captures the mood of the painting. No. Tibet's beauty, its inner soul, is in the depth and breadth of a distant horizon, the magnificence of time and space, of peaks and valleys and plains that never seem to end. When I look out upon Tibet's endless views, I dream of riding a horse into the distant hills forever and never coming back.\\"-<br />Highly recommended.	2001-09-10

Jane is a bit over the top tough and lustyperhaps she wouldnt have seemed quite so in-your-face if Mr. Iles had not chosen Jane to narrate his tale.  <br />To my mind, it is not as focused as Mortal Fear.  Some of the tension dissipates when the locations keep changing.

New York and its society are made magic by her eyes.  The opening sections of this memoir are a delight as Mrs. Wharton recounts the sights and feel of New York City in the 1870's.  I liked it that she gave us a knee-high view of taking a walk with her beloved father and meeting his friends along the way.  (She could never tell what the people's faces looked like, as her view only extended to their knees).  Her total recall of her very best bonnet is amazing, and a very pretty bonnet it must have been.<br />If there is such a person as a \\"born writer,\\" Edith Wharton is that person.  Before she could write, she made stories, and situations \\"flew around her head like mosquitoes.\\"  The world she lived in had no place or interest in a writing lady, so she made her own world, and it was a life-long undertaking.<br />When Mrs. Wharton received her first acceptance of publication, she was so excited she \\"ran up and down the staircase in glee.\\"  I couldn't have been more surprised if I had read that George Washington played kickball in the back yard.  Mrs. Wharton rarely lets you see anything but a very reserved and proper Victorian lady.  Yet she did get a divorce (though it is never mentioned.), she lived almost her entire adult life abroad; she compartmentalized her friends like a butterfly collector, and had no interest in being part of the New York society she describes so well.  When she was well into her writing career on a family visit to New York, she was invited to a dinner party where she was told a \\"Bohemian\\" would be one of the guests.  When she got there, she discovered that she herself was the \\"Bohemian\\" in question.<br />The book has a wonderful introduction by that fine author of New York manners, Louis Auchincloss, who is obviously fond of Mrs. Wharton, but not intimidated.  Mrs. Wharton has a couple of insightful (and often hilarious) chapters on Henry James that are alone worth the price of the book.  But then there are the \\"friends.\\"  I felt I was being buried in endless pages of formal introductions to people I had never heard of, who wrote books that were never read, who gave parties which are long forgotten, and men who were great conversationalists according to Mrs. Wharton, though the witticisms she quoted were so arch and refined, I felt they belonged in bad drawing room comedy.<br />The book reads well, except for the stretches of introductions.  Mrs. Wharton firmly believes that if you can't speak well of someone, you shouldn't speak of him or her at all.  Not a bad idea at that	2001-09-10

Many of the stories brought forth the visions of the proper Englishman dressing for dinner each night in the jungle.  Ms. Hickman grew up in the diplomatic service and displays much affection and admiration for these unsung ladies.  The letters diary excerpts are interesting, sometimes poignant reminders of how isolated and far from home the ladies were.<br />The book has a peculiar organization, not by date or individuals, but by their duties.  I found this annoying and difficult to follow.  We meet a lady on page 6 and do not hear of her again until page 200.  It skips between the 17th century to the 20th and back within two paragraphs.  Consequently, I had never had a clear idea of who they were and when their stories were taking place.<br />Ms. Hickman is almost too discreet.  Some of the incidents beg for clarification. (She is not a diplomat's daughter for nothing!)  I didn't expect a tell-all tabloid style, but neither did I expect an almost Victorian reticence.  The author clearly had done a great deal of research and took advantage of her own and her mother's recollections, but was in great need of a good editor.	2001-09-09

The moody, broody Dave Robicheaux collects a clue concerning the long ago murder of his mother while trying to get a friend off death row.  The steamy Louisiana bayous are an ever-present background to Dave's search.  The story is quickly paced in spite of the subplots and diversions.<br />The characterizations are unforgettable:  Clintonesque Governor Belmont Pugh, sidekick Clete Purcel who has no sense of proportion (if a little disturbance is good, a full-scale riot is better!), more than slightly mad Mrs. Cora Gable, and John Reneta, a hit man like no other.  The low life scum of New Orleans and New Iberia are delightful cameos.  Sometimes they are far more attractive than the citizens who are the pillars of the community.<br />Though there are a few places where the solutions are a mite slick, the overall strength and great story weaving overcome any minor flaws.  Best of all, Dave Robicheaux makes a good companion and friend. You get to do all the talking, as Dave is a man of very few words.   A great read.	2001-09-06

This opens her up to sniffy comments by academics who think no history can be written unless it done in the dullest way possible.<br />In spite of the fact Ms. Picard did voluminous research and adequately footnoted and indexed her book, she still came in for some sniping.  In my mind, it is most unfair for she has produced an entertaining, interesting, breezy account of times during the reign of George III. (1740-1770)<br />Though Ms. Picard is clearly no fan of the revered Dr. Johnson and has a very poor opinion of biographer James Boswell, they do weave in and out of the text.  She divides the book into three sections, The Poor, The Middling Sort, and The Rich.  She gives us what they wore, ate, with what they entertained themselves, and how they lived with great immediacy.  You will wonder how anyone survived to grow up in filthy, smelly, incurious London.  Most surprising to me was the Gin Wars and how pervasive this cheap form of alcohol was among the poor.  It had a huge effect on a great portion of the populace for an extended period of time.  The ladies' three-foot high hairdos forced them to sit on the floor of coaches when traveling to balls.  I couldn't help but wonder if they just slid out the door when they reached their destinations.<br />\\"Dr. Johnson's London\\" is a lively read with interesting details.  Ms. Picard does a good job of getting us into the sensibilities of 18th century London.  Recommended.	2001-09-06

They plan on a long weekend of hiking, sight seeing and general fun.<br />Shades of \\"Deliverance,\\" there are some bad folks out there!  The tale becomes grim and violent as a repulsive, half-crazed mountain man and a strangely obsessed brother of a defendant Ms. Crow successfully prosecuted for murder track the three women.  The mayhem is nonstop and sometimes gruesome; this is not a story for the faint of heart.  Yet the women develop amazing courage and inner strength through their ordeal.  The terror trip seems to be endless, yet I read the book in one hypnotized sitting.<br />The book has excellent pace, and the descriptions of the mountain scenery are excellent.  Some of the dialogue is stilted, particularly when the women are bantering back and forth, but this is a small flaw.  The characterizations are solid if not inspired.  I look forward to the next Mary Crow outing.	2001-09-06

This is the story of their 15,000-mile odyssey, the goal being to break the Guinness World Record.<br />Tim is his usual exuberant, one-of-guys, self-deprecating self. There is no one who can recount an anecdote with quite his flair. While speeding across Honduras, a flock of birds crossed the windshield while Cahill was driving. \\"Garry had snapped bolt upright from his slouching position in the passenger seat. He was holding his belly as if he had been shot. `Wah' he said in his strange, sleep clogged voice-----there seemed to be a dead bird in his lap. `I reached down there,' Garry said, `I felt something warm and wet. I was sure I had been shot. I thought I was feeling my own intestines. Then I started wondering why my intestines would have feathers and bird feet on them.\\" Stories like this made me laugh aloud.<br />The book was nonetheless claustrophobic. By the time, Tim and Garry had reached Central America; my only thought was \\"let me out of this truck!\\" All but about 20 pages are devoted to South and Central America. The last 5,000 miles of the US, Canada and Alaska are barely mentioned. I suppose this is because the last third of the trip was without incident or terrors. But it did give the book an unbalanced feel. The section regarding how you get yourself considered for setting a Guinness Record was very interesting. Hint: If you plan on setting or beating a record, check with Guinness before (not after) you do it. There were about 35 pages devoted to how one went about getting sponsored, i.e., raising money (in this case about $350,000) that I found tedious.<br />The book was enjoyable for the most part, but I did get the impression Tim Cahill was as glad the trip was over as I was.	2001-08-27

She had a penchant for marrying artistes. Her first marriage was to savage, wild man artist Lucian Freud, grandson of Sigmund. Her third and last husband was Pulitzer Prize winning poet, Robert Lowell. Lady Caroline became a fine writer in her own right. She began writing seriously while married to Lowell and continued to do so for about ten years after his death. This accounted for 15 years of her 65 years on earth. She lost her father at age 13, and was sadly neglected (emotionally) during her childhood.<br />To an upper-class English or Irish reader of her generation (1931-1996), her childhood would sound fairly normal with the nannies and the governesses and seeing her parents once a day for an hour at teatime. But Mother Maureen, a Guinness heiress, was a singularly spoiled, vain woman who had almost no interest in her children. There is no doubt Lady Caroline suffered and had almost no parental guidance. After the proper coming out and a debut year in London, she immediately embraced the bohemian life in Soho. Men fell at her feet, homo and heterosexual; all were in her thrall. She was a girl of great silences and steady gazes out of her magnificent eyes. She was also a drunk and slovenly her entire life. As she grew older, her beauty could not stand up to her lifestyle. She began to look like a ravaged Jeanne Moreau; yet never lost her tremendous appeal to men.<br />Ms. Schoenberger has done a beautiful job of detailing Lady Caroline's life. She is meticulous in her research and scholarship. Her writing skills are admirable; she neither intrudes, nor is she stiffly reserved. She at all times appears tolerant and non-judgmental. I see on the book jacket that the author is a poet as well as a writer. If this book is any example, I hope she continues her writing.<br />My problem with the book was I found the subject most unlikable.  Lady Caroline never losther sense of entitlement in that however objectionable she looked, smelled or acted; she felt she was God's chosen. She emulated her mother in irresponsibility and neglect of her own children. Her outlook on life was pessimistic in the extreme, but she was stand-up proof for the adage `living well is the best revenge.' Recommended for the excellent writing and scholarship.	2001-08-27

Coben also catches the brass ring and shows new depth and sensitivity. (Though I always think of Myron Bolitar as a very sensitive guy.)  David Becks love defines him and drives this novel through every turn.<br />As always, Coben loves his quirky characters: Shauna the plus-sized super model who is Lindas (sister of Beck) not-too-faithful partner, Hester the attorney from hell, and Tyrese the multi-sided drug dealer/fond father. When Coben describes Fein, the rapacious district attorney, all I could think of was Hamilton Burger of the Perry Mason TV series.<br />The twists and turns of the plot made me wonder if Coben was trying to out-Deaver Deaver.  I notice that Deaver gave him a big send off on the back cover, and well he should.

The feat of being the first man to climb an 8,000-meter mountain is a matter of great pride to France and to all the people of France.  Now what if the story was not true?  What if Mr. Herzog's tale was full of lies and deceits?  What if you wrote a book exposing these falsities and set the record straight?  If that is what you are expecting, you bought the wrong book.<br />Mr. Roberts, in this slim book, definitively shows that:<br />  1.  Maurice Herzog was a fine climber, an idealist, a leader of men, and a gracious individual who was very partial to publicity and glory.<br />2.  Louis Lachenal, who summitted with Mr. Herzog, did not get his share of the credit.<br />3.  The profits from \\"Annapurna\\" went to Club Alpin François.  None of the team members, including Mr. Herzog, received any monetary benefits from the book's publication.<br />4.  Fellow members Lionel Terray and Gaston Rebuffat were absolutely indispensable to the success of the climb.  Their bravery and generosity were extraordinary.<br />Other reviewers have mentioned that one must read \\"Annapurna\\" before reading this book.  I did so, and found it highly readable, spirited and Mr. Herzog's enthusiasm shows through every page.  I thought a lot of the book was taken up by just finding a route to the mountain, but all in all, an interesting read.  Most of the points Mr. Roberts makes are implied in \\"Annapurna.\\" Though there is no denying Louis Lachenal is the forgotten man.<br />Mr. Roberts makes a large point of how all team members were forbidden by contract to write a book about the expedition for five years.  These rights were given solely to Maurice Herzog.  Such a contract is common to this day for large sponsored expeditions.  The only reason we have had such a plethora of books starting with \\"Into Thin Air\\" about the 1996 Everest expedition is because there were no corporate or government sponsors for thattrip.<br />The book leaves a bad taste.  It smacks of profiteering by unfairly dragging down Maurice Herzog who does not deserve it.  Not recommended.	2001-08-19

The story's effect hangs on our thorough understanding of Timothy's point of view contrasted with how others see him.  Tim is atrociously self-absorbed yet almost without personal vanity.  He is a recreational liar, but never to himself.  It takes a good and sufficient time to develop this young man, and if he were not developed, the story would have no meaning.  The reader must see beyond Tim's startling beauty.  Given the visuality of Ms. Rendell/Vine's prose, it takes a long lead-in for readers to see Tim plain and unadorned.  Think of  young Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt.  I have always been convinced those two would stop traffic whether famous or not, and not one person would be aware (or care) if they were sensitive, caring, or struggling.  They would be thinking: \\"Wow!\\"  This is Tim Cornish.<br />When Tim meets Dr. Ivo Steadman, (who else but Rupert Everett?) he is certain he must be in love because he has never felt this way before.  He has had a few dilatory girl friends that didn't stir him, only occasionally \\"scratched an itch.\\"  So what was this?  The shortness of breath?  The obsessing for Ivo's presence? This was something startlingly new and different, and it must be love!  Tim found it also had a very short duration.  As soon as Ivo dropped his Rochester/Heathcliff airs of arrogance and disdain, Tim was quickly out of love and into contempt.  Alas, poor Ivo who made more and  more frantic and futile efforts to entice and ensnare the errant Tim.  I couldn't help but sympathize with Tim at this point.  Have you ever had anyone (be it a discarded lover or your great-aunt Sally) shower you with attentions and pleadings of which you wanted no part?  It makes monsters of us all.  The stage is set. <br /> Ivo more or less forces the reluctant and sulky Tim on a cruise of the shores of Alaska.   Tim meets the beauteous Isabel in Juneau while Ivo is off lecturing.  And now the story quickly picks up a headlong pace. Ms. Rendell/Vine has us hooked good and proper, and we are in for some mind-boggling surprises.  The key to this book is obsession, not romance.  The author deftly ties up the loose ribbons and presents us with a nicely wrapped finished package.<br />Though I don't believe this book is as powerful as \\"A Dark Adapted Eye,\\" it does demonstrate the author's great versatility and goes way beyond \\"well developed characterization.\\"  You can't help thinking, \\"there, if not by the grace of God, go I\\" I would recommend it for when you are in a pondering mood.	2001-08-19

It goes without saying; &#8220;Hostage&#8221; is a page-turner.  Any halfway competent thriller writer can make this type basic plot exciting.  What Mr. Crais does is give us a myriad of views from the angle of the negotiator, mobster, penny-ante punk, not one, but two psychopaths; an immature but kind teenage girl; and a detestable but oddly heroic 10- year old boy.  The suspense keeps ratcheting up as each of the players take the stage and insist we walk hand-in-hand with them for a while.  Rattling around in the head of a stone killer is unnerving, and so tension producing that I was actually relieved when Mr. Crais turned our attention to the thoughts of an ignorant, whiney, third-rate punk.<br />Apocalypse is staring at us, but we don&#8217;t know how and from which direction it will come.  This is not the sort of novel where you just know the good guys are going to win and ride off into the sunset while the grateful family smiles and waves from their now-safe home.  You know everyone will be scarred, but in what way?  And who will be standing or at least alive at the end?  After Mr. Crais has so masterfully involved you in the lives of all these people, the reader&#8217;s anxiety is acute as to what will happen to all of them/us.  No one is faceless, and no one is a stereotype.  I even developed a certain fondness for some very bad people, i.e. a mobster who is very entertaining, but no Damon Runyon lovable bad guy.  I particularly liked the 78-year old boss of bosses, full of all the aches and pains that flesh is heir to, spent the entire book in his favorite bathrobe which was emblazoned on the back: &#8220;Don&#8217;t Bug Me&#8221; (given to him by his grandchildren).  A very practical man... <br />&#8220;Hostage&#8221;is a comment on man&#8217;s inhumanity/humanity to man, a powerful reminder of &#8220;no man is an island,&#8221; and ---- a rip roaring thriller!  Highly recommended.	2001-08-11

The Frenches don&#8217;t let us down in this character-driven novel of suspense.  A homeless teen-aged girl, only known as Lianne, is murdered near a canal in a seedy part of London.  The police are certain they have their perpetrator, Michael Doll, who freely admits he was at the scene.  Michael is a disturbed young man who has been convicted of minor sexual offenses.  Have you ever met someone who you found disgusting and repulsive, but yet you found yourself pitying him or her?  Meet Michael, a perfect example of the breed.   The authors play the reader like a violin to elicit these contradictory emotions.  This is one revolting guy, and yet---<br />Enter Kit Quinn, a psychologist who has an unpleasant background with Michael.  The police want her to &#8220;sign off&#8221; on his ability to stand trial.  Dr. Quinn thinks there is much wrong with Michael, but doubts very much if he is a murderer.  And so our story begins.<br />Kit, an efficient appearing lady, who has a soaring imagination, captivated me.  She is one of those people who have an aura of beauty and civility in everything they do.  She gathers flowers, but does not garden.  She is a fine appreciator of the smells, colors, and satisfactions of the freshest, simplest food&#8212;yet she claims she never has food in the house.  I particularly liked that Kit is nobody&#8217;s fool; her awareness is very keen for both the faults and virtues of her friends and lovers.<br />The novel overflows with wonderful characters.  Julie who descends uninvited on Kit and stays for the entirety of the book, is a free spirit and borrows food, clothes, and space shamelessly.  Yet we forgive her because of her innate generosity, her charm and her humor.  The middle-aged Detective Chief Inspector is convinced that Julie and Kit are romantic partners, and fumbles manfully to be sophisticated about his misapprehension.<br />The suspense buildsand builds, the tension all the greater because we care about these people.  We want the best for each of them and know it will not work out that way.  The authors do not let us down and keep the intensity high through the last page.  I liked this book and believe it ranks with my favorite French novel &#8220;Killing Me Softly.&#8221;  Read it and enjoy.	2001-08-08

In spite of 1916 assurances that \\"there had never been a shark attack on any United States coast,\\" the merest rumor set off a full-scale panic.  <br />\\"Close to Shore\\" is a delightful picture of life in these United States circa. 1916.  The author has done his homework and recreates the fashions, habits, and lifestyles of the new novelty: a day (or week, or month) at the beach.  Though we may dress differently, even think differently than our relatives of 1916; I venture to say we would react to the thought of a man-eating shark(s) prowling our shores in exactly the same way.<br />This is not a blood and guts tale of gore.  It does not depict the great white shark as a monster, and for this I give the book full marks.  It has interesting information about sharks in general, and is honest enough to admit there is a lot we do not know.  What surprised me is we don't know a great deal more about the great white today than we did 85 years ago.  <br />The perpetrator of all this mayhem was a juvenile shark about nine feet and 300 lbs.  Makes you wonder what would have happened if the shark were a 20-foot adult weighing 1500 lbs?  Thanks to Peter Benchley and \\"Jaws,\\" we have a pretty good idea.	2001-08-06

He sees the real, the unreal, the delusions, the illusions and the hallucinations in stark, living color.  He is a falling monument to the truism, \\"you're only as good as your last save.\\"  When the \\"saves\\" stop being meaningful, where is your existence?<br />Frank careens through this story like a fading roman candle.  He is funny, brilliant, and full of bleak despair.  The backdrop of Hell's Kitchen, St. Misery, filthy alleys, and unspeakable tenements pervade the desperate emergencies that are personified in shrieking sirens, wild driving, and life running out.<br />Frank is an expert in what he does, but he has lost his confidence and zeal to excel.  He wonders at the meaning of standing in the way of death and the times when he made a mistake and death wasn't meant to be.<br />The author walks the thin line of taking us and Frank to the edge of madness, then stepping back - just barely.  The book moves at a frantic pace; we have rags and leavings of old torments while being plunged into new ones.  Mr. Connelly's technical skills make It hard to believe this is a first novel.  Very fine work.<br />After reading the novel, I saw the film. When I noted Scorsese directed and Nicholas Cage stepped onscreen, I thought  \\"of course.&quot;	2001-08-06

At the outset, I couldnt quite get my mind around the premise of trying to hitch rides in an area so desolate, a day or two might go by before a car was even seen, let alone a driver that would extend the courtesy of a ride.  Tony is here to tell you it can be done with a lot of determination on his part and friendliness and compassion on the part of his Australian hosts. (At certain junctures, I would call these affable drivers life savers as well.)  <br />The author has unique encounters with the real people of the Outback: truck drivers, farmers (cockies), Aboriginals, and opal miners.  I enjoyed his laid-back sense of humor, his insightfulness, and most of allhis willingness to be human like the rest of us.  He dislikes spending the night under the stars, cant pitch a tent, is agonized by flies and mosquitoes and becomes violently sea-sick while catching a ride in a crawfish trawler.  <br />The chapter Pearls Before Matzo Balls describes trying to find a Jewish family with whom to celebrate Passover in the delightful town of Broome in Western Australia.  He looks in the telephone book in vain for a Jewish name, but finally gets steered in the right direction by an unusual Catholic priest.  This chapter epitomizes the hilarious strangeness of his entire trip to the red hot center of Australia.<br />It is a good idea to read the glossary at the back before you begin.  I found that a Pub is called a hotel in the Outback, and I kept wondering why in world all these Holiday Inn/Marriott-types were sitting in the middle of nowhere.  Another warning, the Outback is awash in beer.  In the Western Territory, the average yearly consumption is 52 gallons (!) for every man, woman and child.  Distances between hotels are measured in six-packs rather than miles or kilometers.<br />A fun, sprightly read, though when you reach the end of the journey, you mightlike Tonyhave a bit of a hangover!	2001-07-30

You don't read about Martin Amis' life, you \\"experience\\" it.  The occasional letters home written while he was in school anchor the structure.  The letters are bracketed by his fierce criticisms of his own past writing styles.<br />Mr. Amis has brilliance, humor and intellect, all bursting like fireworks off the page.  He also has quirks that he freely indulges.  You have to get past his obsession with his teeth. (Yes, teeth.)  He can start on any subject and get waylaid by dental experiences he has had.  You almost forgive him these tirades, as he describes them so vividly.  No one who has served a sentence or two in a dentist's chair can help but agree \\"the drill, capable of making your vision shudder.\\"  Then there is the issue of his phantom obesity.  He continually worries about the past, present and future size of his \\"bum,\\" yet every single photo in the book depicts a slim boy/youth/man called Martin Amis.<br />One of the strongest areas in the book is his loving tribute to his family, particularly his father, the renowned Kingsley Amis.  The family is eccentric-twenty years after his parents' divorce, Kingsley moves in to the upper story of his happily remarried ex-wife's residence where she cares for him the rest of his life.  The reason for this move is Kingsley does not and will not stay alone at night.  His sons take this as an absolute given and grown up Martin and brother Philip discuss whether they will have to move in with Dad to quell the night frights.<br />Mr. Amis' descriptive powers are a marvel as they drop effortlessly through his narrative, such as, \\"There is a slushy crush outside the British Airways terminal.  Everyone is enlarged, fattened, baggy with impedimenta, with winter coats, padded, air-bubbled, taking up a lot of space, and bumping into one another.\\"  He gives you instant mental snapshots and then races off to something new.   Some parts of his life he takes for granted youmust know and never bothers to enlighten the reader.  A photo of Saul Bellow, the author holding a baby and an attractive woman standing by his side is captioned  \\"---For structural reasons, the baby I am wielding cannot be named.\\"  Mr. Amis never sheds any light on who this baby is or what the \\"structural\\" reasons are.<br />Though the author can be a cynic, waspish and impatient; his best portraits are of those people he admires and loves.  His mentor Saul Bellow and close family friend, poet Philip Larkin, are marvelously well drawn and prescient.  Martin feels Larkin was horribly maligned by his biographer, Andrew Motion and does what he can by drawing a poignant portrait of his father's dearest friend.  <br />This book draws you in until you are completely absorbed and involved in Martin's usually frenetic, but always interesting life.  Highly recommended, particularly for anyone interested in modern English literature.	2001-07-30

Briefly stated, leader Fritz Wiessner was the only member of this six-man team who had any business setting foot on savage, unforgiving, unrelenting K-2.  Yet Wiessner handpicked the team himself, except for one-Jack Durrance, who was a last-minute replacement.  That is the crux of the controversy.  Wiessner, who never admitted mistakes, was all too willing to make Durrance the fall guy.  The odd part is with the exception of Wiessner; Durrance had the most mountaineering ability.  The other members either had no experience, or only had climbed with the assistance of guides.  After enjoying unusually good weather, Wiessner and the doomed Dudley Wolfe were within 800 meters of the summit.  The mystery was why with two men at this level, were all the camps below stripped of tents and all equipment, leaving them totally exposed on the descent?  Why did Wiessner leave the helpless Wolfe alone and unattended?  Why were three Sherpas the only ones to attempt Wolfe's rescue?  What happened to the four of them who were never seen again?<br />The book has some excellent photos depicting the team in their suits and ties, a luncheon served with great elegance in the heart of the Himalayas, and some very clear pictures of their primitive climbing equipment and clothing.  It truly makes you realize what odds they overcame to be so high with leaky boots, soggy woolens, and waterlogged tents.<br />The authors have the advantage of Jack Durrance's diary, heretofore unseen and unknown.  This is also a disadvantage because the Kaufman &amp; Putnam seem to rely entirely on the veracity of this diary.  It is given far too much weight in making their conclusions.<br />The book is maddeningly repetitious. Whenever Wiessner is faulted, the authors assure you (in detail) what a fine mountaineer Wiessner was---over and over again.  Though the authors are not shy about projecting psychological insights onto the team members, they make no efforts to explore and recreate the violent disagreements that took place.  Wiessner and first assistant Eaton (Tony) Cromwell started out as the best of friends.  Yet in the aftermath of the climb, Cromwell bitterly attacks Wiessner as a \\"murderer.\\"  Why?  What happened to the four men who disappeared?  Were they ever found?<br />The book has merit for it's strong descriptions of the personalities involved and being able to interview living men.  However, the style is stilted and the impartiality suspect.  Recommended for die-hard mountaineering fans only.	2001-07-30

That being said, don't expect any handsome, sensitive Hell's Angels riding through this book.  Their powers of evil are limitless and are international in scope.  <br />Forensic anthropologist, Tempe Brennan has an emergency call to Montreal.  She is given the grisly task of identifying the bits and pieces of identical twin bikers who were blown up while carrying a bomb. I was baffled by the \\"emergency\\" nature of separating the remains of the two who had identical DNA.  I agree it would be of professional interest, but couldn't make the leap of believing such niceties would make it critical to the investigation.<br />Most of the action is in Montreal, and the tie-in to Charlotte, N.C. is tenuous. I was disappointed in this book and feel it is the weakest of the three Tempe Brennan novels.  The commute between NC and Quebec is beginning to box in the series.  There are just so many logical connections between Quebec and North Carolina, and I think Tempe has used them all.  <br />There are some excellent descriptive passages, particularly of Montreal and some sharp fast character takes.  However, there are too many characters to keep track off, and most of them no one you would want to know or care what happens to them.  I was uneasy with Cornwell-clone aspects (an unruly nephew who worries Tempe to distraction-shades of Lucy!) and I hope this will not increase.<br />I enjoyed Ms. Reichs' two previous novels, and have by no means given up on her.  I look forward to Tempe's next excursion and wish for an intriguing investigation.	2001-07-30

The mood is dark as the skies and as retro as an early Ross McDonald novel.  The main plot is diffuse with unattractive, complex characters taking the center stage.  A beloved elderly physician has disappeared.  His eccentric but charmless ex-wife wants him found.  His present wife, a former stripper, thinks he is dead.  Nobody and nothing are quite as they seem.  The missing doctor has a drinking problem and some quirky sexual needs.  The ex-wife in her unfinished, stark and bare art deco home calls to mind Gloria Swanson in \\"Sunset Boulevard.\\"  The trophy-wife, aptly named Crystal, seems fragile and dependent.  She has a strange m&eacute;nage who consist of an utterly repellent 14-year old out-of-control daughter, her 18-month old son and his ghostly male nanny, and an ever-present friend who happens to be the daughter's school counselor.<br />\\"Peril\\" is a decidedly ambitious book, and succeeds on many levels.  The sometimes lyrical descriptions of weather, architecture and mood show growth and depth in Ms. Grafton's writing.  However, she tries to do too much and the story sprawls.  A secondary plot, though entertaining, is a diversion and fragments the reader's interest.  She interjects a hilarious interlude with a hidden Kinsey trapped under a desk, a reluctant witness to a lovers' tryst.  Again, funny and clever as this is, it does not forward the story.  I had the feeling Ms. Grafton threw these in to placate her legion of Kinsey fans.  Kinsey's regular pals, Henry and Rosie seem out of place in this setting.  Think Ms. Grafton should bite the bullet and write a book without Kinsey, not in the alphabet series, and see how it goes<br />The ending is subtle but clear if you mentally review what you have read.  The clues are all there.  I had to smile at the cleverness.	2001-07-21

Greg Iles lives up to his \\"master storyteller\\" title in \\"24 Hours.\\"  The brilliant first chapter summarizes the Perfect Kidnapping-exactly how it's done and the terror it generates.<br />The characterizations were excellent, particularly five year-old Abby.  At last, a five-year old who is neither an overly wise little owl, nor a series of clever one-liners.  She is a delightful, vulnerable little girl, which makes her kidnapping all the more chilling.  The author devotes considerable care to make his three kidnappers life-like.   The mastermind Joe terrorizes with his unpredictability.  Joe is shrewd, brutal, kind, violent, and petty by turns and is most dangerous of all when cornered.  The female who acts as a lure and a keeper is more to be pitied than to be scorned and has flashes of earthy practicality and humor.  Huey, 400 lbs. Of muscle and very little brain completes the trio.  Huey is a gentle giant with total loyalty to Joe.<br />I would have been happier without the little side-story that makes this an unusual caper for the threesome.  I believe the story would have been stronger if the attention were focused on a Kidnapping Gone Bad.  The FBI gets raked over to a well-done turn by Mr. Iles.  It's safe to say standard law enforcement does not meet with his approval.  It stretches the limits of belief that all of the FBI is completely entrenched in bureaucracy and overkill.  Usually, the author's southern settings give off a flavor of Mississippi, but \\"24 hours\\" could just as well have taken place in Cleveland or Omaha.  <br />The story has a thrilling climax (just aching to be filmed-car wrecks and all), and the author keeps cranking up the velocity until you are almost begging for a little peace.  A recommended page-turner.	2001-07-19

The first thing you have to wrap your mind around is the incredible estimated weight (10,000 tons) of the meteorite.  The second is the proximity of Tierra del Fuego to Antarctica.  I was grateful for the map, because I had difficulty grasping the idea that where they were going is very cold indeed!<br />Preston and Child deliver on this thriller.  The characters are three dimensional, particularly the billionaire.  The engineering feats are well written for the laymen.  The storm at sea is stupendous; you have a true feeling of doom at your doorstep.<br />However, I subtracted two stars.  The first because the book is a slow starter.  It took 150 pages to set up the story.  The second star is withheld because of the ending, which is reminiscent of a 50s horror movie.  I wanted to say oh puh-leeze!  These two faults are not a major deterrent; its 60% fine entertainment.	2001-07-19

Though death was ruled \\"death by misadventure,\\" Mrs. Ranelagh is certain it was murder.  Her obsession with the death of a woman she barely knew leaves the reader doubtful of her credibility and sets the tone of this ambitious novel.<br />Ms. Walters is the past master of designing all of her well-drawn characters with shades of deniability.  We are never allowed to assure ourselves that any one character is the hero and has right and might on his or her side.  The neighborhood of Graham Road where Miss Butts lived and died was a mixed bag of up and coming young couples, retirees, and a few families that were on the dole.  We come to know them well.  Some are vicious, violent bigots or appear to be, some are secret and not-so-secret philanderers, and all have reasons to not be forthcoming about the events leading to Miss Butts' death.  Mrs. Ranelagh seems the most straightforward, but we doubt her stability and motives.<br />The cruelty and persecution that Miss Butts endured is hard to stomach; I was wrenched with pity.  In this respect, the book is difficult to read.  However, Ms. Walters wends her way in such an absorbing manner, giving us a new puzzle or twist every few pages that we constantly have to shift our preconceptions and let her lead us where she will.  Once involved in her tale, she has you hooked.<br />\\"The Shape of Snakes\\" meets and sometimes exceeds Ms. Walters' previous fine books.  She takes on social issues and makes them an integral part of this story.  For new readers, you are in for a fine read. For those familiar with Ms. Walters' excellent work, you will not be disappointed.	2001-07-19

But such is the skill of Ms. Hildenbrand and the charm of Seabiscuit-what can I say? This charming book, beautifully written and carefully researched, is far more than a horse story.  It is America in the midst of a grim depression that looked for diversions from the stark realities of surviving.  It is a biography of the three men who had faith in Seabiscuit: his owner, his trainer and his jockey.<br />Seabiscuit was an unlikely champion.  He was small, short-legged, knobby-kneed,with a rough coat.  He was trained in California, which, at the time, was considered a very low class place to be for a thoroughbred.  The power and glory were in the hands of the Eastern Establishment.  Seabiscuit had one thing going for him.  Once his interest was engaged, he was the fastest horse in the world.  Thoroughbreds are noted for their foul dispositions and though Seabiscuit liked to taunt and tease the competition, he was a well-mannered and affectionate fellow.  He did enjoy a good snooze and hated to get up in the morning, and he loved to eat.  When put on an enforced diet, he would scream his displeasure.  He adored the camera and when he heard the click or pop of flashbulbs, he immediately fanned his tail, batted his eyes and faced front and forward, which I presume he thought was his best camera angle.  Seabiscuit was made to order for Americans who love to love the underdog.<br />The author devotes an entire chapter to Seabiscuit's famed match race with War Admiral, the champion East coast thoroughbred.  War Admiral was a magnificent horse with speed, fire, and a ferocious temper.   It took years to arrange this match and protracted negotiations went on right up to the starting gate.  Ms. Hildenbrand's recounting of this Race of the Century (and it truly was!) is a masterpiece in nail-biting suspense.  I never knew I could hold my breath for an entire chapter.<br />This is my Book of the Year.  Highly recommended.	2001-07-15

The first problem is Ms. Kocour's exaggerations and misinformation diminishes the very story she wants to tell. <br />The second problem is Ms. Kocour herself.  Her own words make her sound like an arrogant, bigoted,self-satisfied, braggart.  Her lack of charity toward her teammates and fellow climbers is breathtakingly insensitive.  She has a fawning regard for her professional guides and an almost girlish awe of chance meetings with elite climbers Jim Wickwire and John Roskelley, but a rare good word for her fellow amateurs.<br />The author continually refers to being trapped in the \\"Death Zone,\\" a height where humans cannot acclimate to the altitude, and the human body deteriorates.  This \\"Zone\\" is above 26,246 feet.  The camp where the author was stranded was 8,000 feet below this extreme.  To give a comparison, Everest's base camp (the beginning of the climb) is higher than the camp at which Ms. Kocour was stranded.  The entire route her party took has fixed lines, and they were roped to their guides at all times during their climb.  It was not what anyone would call an intrepid, daring ascent.  The \\"ledge\\" where her team bivouacked accommodated six tents, a ranger hut and a large medical station, more resembling a mall parking lot than a ledge.<br />The descriptions of the storm are good, and it is easy to imagine the fear, the claustrophobia, and the boredom of being confined to such close quarters in the monstrous elements for such an extended period of time.  It is a cautionary tale for anyone who thinks Denali is a walk in the park.  It is not.<br />I awarded the second star for Ruth Anne's self-portrayal of a lady you'd love to see get her comeuppance.  Makes you want to see a book by oneof her teammates describing the trials and tribulations of climbing with Ruth Anne.	2001-07-15

It ends in 1992 when she left Washington to move to New York City and \\"60 Minutes\\" fame.<br />Her story is well told with no whining and much humor.  The political stories are many and deftly presented.  She gives a primer on what it takes for a woman to be a top White House correspondent.  It is not for the faint of heart.  Think 12-hour days, constant traveling, stress to the max, keeping your adrenalin and aggressive instincts at a fever pitch at all times, and make sure you look glamorous no matter what. <br />At times, I felt Ms. Stahl was too hard on herself.  She reiterates that her husband, child and family are perfect; she caused the only clouds on the horizon.   She and her mother are very close, and there is no mistaking the senior Ms. Stahl is a formidable lady.  Her husband had some career problems that deeply depressed him.  With the unbelievable pressures of her job, it's hard to see how she could cope with a family life at all.  She is a wonderful mix of utmost aggression and high femininity.  <br />This is not a tell-all book.  She admits to a rather staid romance with Bob Woodward and radiates a certain fondness for all the Commanders in Chief she served (with the exception of Richard Nixon).  Her description of her interview with Margaret Thatcher is priceless.  Let's just say Ms. Stahl did not come out victorious.  <br />Ms. Stahl is careful to credit all her colleagues, though she gives the CBS brass quite a pounding.  Her comments on her boss, Dan Rather, are always supportive, but it is easy to see Mr. Rather is a difficult man to work for.  <br />The book is well written, as you would expect from a good journalist.  It reads quickly and well.  The author's cheerful compassion is hard to resist.	2001-07-12

The reader's interest is speedily engaged in the \\"who is this happening to and why?\\"  Somewhere around page 150, the book becomes a chore.  The writing and pace become uneven and dead spots occur with more and more frequency.<br />The collaboration between Peter Gethers and David Handler doesn't seem to gel and become seamless.  Sometimes I had the feeling I was reading a rough draft.  It is difficult to accept a hero whose nickname is \\"Granny\\" and all that word implies.  One of the two \\"deadly\\" assassins is an overweight, not-to-bright rogue ex-cop whose main concern seems to be furious bigotry.  We are expected to believe the richest, most powerful man in the world could do no better in the assassin market than to select this dim bulb.  The choice of victims is ludicrous. Those that are truly dangerous to the powerful man's schemes are overlooked in favor of innocents who have only the most tangential connection with the plot.  The surprises are telegraphed so far in advance that the only person still in the dark is the hero.  <br />There are curious lapses, as if the fact checker took a holiday.  How often can one draw $1000 from one ATM machine?  Why is a broken down Subaru with DC plates entirely invisible to police and FBI?  <br />The strongest element of \\"Gideon\\" is the following of clues as the hero and his ever-loyal former girl friend get closer and closer to the answers.  Their odyssey through the Deep South is well done, particularly a chapter dealing with what has to be the ultimate Elvis Presley fans.<br />\\"Gideon\\" has it moments; there are just not enough of them.	2001-07-08

I compare everything he writes to his own best efforts (\\"Devils Teardrop,\\" \\"Maidens Grave\\"), rather than judging his books against the background of other authors.  That being said, \\"The Blue Nowhere\\" is imaginative, twisty, and scary.  If you have an ounce of paranoia-beware! <br />The computer is king of this novel; I might even say Deity, with all its endless possibilities.  It takes the idea of information gathering to the ultimate horror of \\"social engineering.\\"  I was not troubled by its being far-fetched.  If I had wanted facts, I'd have bought a manual.<br />Deaver delivers on the plotting and suspense build-up.  There are a few too many characters which slowed me down some, and most were prototypes:  The Geek, The Nerdy Kid, The Perfect Cop, The Red Herring, and the Comic Relief.  I couldn't understand why, when Mr. Deaver provided a glossary of computer terms, he found it necessary to ponderously define each and every one of them in the novel.  I was not enchanted to hear for the 42nd time that Good Cop cannot keep his shirt tucked in.  I wondered how an eight year-old child could be completely fooled by a man who claimed to be her uncle when she had seen the real uncle only a week before.  Never, ever have I heard a computer whiz refer to a hard copy as a \\"dead tree.\\"  That bothered me, just like I wonder if real cops say \\"perp.\\" <br />The villain, Phate, gets a great deal more sympathy than he deserves, but in certain ways, this strengthens the book.  The reader is forced to pause and reflect on Phate's entire character not just his actions.  He is the most complex character in the book.  <br />Mr. Deaver has tried for a tour de force, how to make staring at a computer screen for 426 pages into a thriller.  For the most part, he has succeeded.	2001-07-03

James and I.  I am struck anew by her facility with language.  She uses words that are almost, but not quite, archaic and does so with grace and perfection. (Though I scurry to the dictionary quite a bit!)  Adam Dalgliesh is a mite monkish these days.  The baroness will have to find him a love interest.<br />The setting is a remote theological college in East Anglia.  The descriptions are impeccable of this wild and desolate area.  The characterizations are full dimensional, mostly quirky, but always interesting.  It is a credit to Ms. James' skill that I felt great sympathy for the Archdeacon though he was, in fact, a very disagreeable man.  There is no bump or wart on a personality that manages to shock Ms. James.  Incest is not judged or hinted at, it just is.  <br />I noted an editorial review described the murders as \\"horrifying.\\"  I disagree.  In fact, though we, the readers know; some of them didn't look like murders at all, and one of them wasn't.   The book was well paced and plotted.  Though I felt there was overmuch on \\"missing keys\\"-it was rather like Button, Button, Whose Got The Button - and the college was so High Church that I kept thinking I was in a monastery, my interest did not flag.   For those who enjoy \\"the locked room\\" type mystery, this will give them enormous satisfaction.	2001-06-30

It is an account of one man, not just facing the abyss but being in the abyss and having his very being stripped to a raw struggle, not to survive but to want to survive.<br />Simpson and a climbing partner in an excess of youthful bravado planned a new route up a monster Andean peak in Peru.  The area was remote and civilization was somewhere else.  After an arduous ascent, Simpson fell and broke his leg while descending.  The reader gradually realizes what a chilling horror has befallen the pair.  They have no possibility of rescue; the mountain was almost unclimbable for two superb athletes with two good legs.  How can they possibly get down when one of them is unable to walk?<br />Partner, Simon Yates, ropes Simpson to himself and tries to guide Simpson down who is forced to crawl, slide, and inch himself forward.  Then Simpson goes over the edge of a cornice and is dangling with only the rope holding him over the void. Yates heroically digs in, but gradually he himself is being inexorably drawn to the chasm.  He finally, with shuddering reluctance, cuts the rope, and Simpson falls many feet into a crevasse.<br />The rest of the book is Simpson's six-day excruciating journey down the mountain: his thoughts, hallucinations and agony.  Simpson is a powerful writer without a trace of self-pity.  He doesn't try to impress us with his stoicism - far from it, at times he is almost mad with fright.  There is nothing lurid here; the book is exhausting, but thought provoking. You won't forget it easily, and you cannot help but wonder what it is like beyond the edge and into the maelstrom.	2001-06-30

This slim book was originally published in 1961 and by now, we may safely call it a classic. The title is taken from her poem \\"What is White?\\"  A series of poems each entitled \\"What Is--- (Green, Gold, Red, Blue, etc.)\\" describes in ways you have never thought of what exactly the color is.  I have never found the child who was not fascinated by the ideas presented and usually had a few additions of his/her own to add.  I always thought this vivid book would bring much pleasure to a blind person who had never \\"seen\\" a color.  Ms. O'Neill brings the feel, the taste and the mood of each color to a shimmering life of its own.<br />--the purple feeling<br />is rather put out.<br />The purple look is a<br />Definite pout.<br />But the purple sound<br />Is the loveliest thing<br />It's a violet opening<br />In the spring.	2001-06-30

Due to a gigantic bureaucratic snafu, criminally insane Felix Zrbny just might walk out of the courtroom a free man after being institutionalized for 15 years.  He brutally murdered three women in his 15th year for reasons he has never divulged and claims he was \\"interrupted before his work was complete.\\"<br />The action is fast and furious set during the worst snowstorm of the century. The flashbacks are many but work well in the context of the story.  There are long sections told first-person by the deranged Felix, which are amazing because he doesn't seem amazing, merely logical.  Dr. Frank is a colorful protagonist, retired, crusty, irritable and a technophobe of the first order.  (He even hates to use a telephone.)  The pace never lets up and some of the scenes are grim.  It is cleverly plotted, but Dr. Philpen still has a tendency to telegraph his surprises.<br />This is a fine addition to the Lucas Frank series, not as strong as \\"Dream in a Key of Blue,\\" but nevertheless absorbing and well worth reading.	2001-06-26

Most of us met him in &#8220;Act One&#8221; his best-selling autobiography published in the late &#8216;50&#8217;s.  Apparently, he tidied up his life a mite in that story.  But that&#8217;s what playwrights do; give us the best story possible.<br />&#8220;Dazzler&#8221; is a well-done biography that is a treasure trove of show business history as well as a deep and compelling study of Moss Hart.  I would call this a &#8220;definitive&#8221; biography except for some reason Mr. Hart&#8217;s widow, the charming Kitty Carlisle, did not cooperative with the author.  Therefore, there are probably many papers that still can be brought to light.<br />I was a little put off by Mr. Bach&#8217;s tone at the beginning of the book, it seemed lightly touched with superiority toward his subject.  Yes, Moss Hart was extravagant, a bit of a dandy..., and sometimes&#8212;very rarely&#8212;forgot to credit the people who helped him on the way up.  When the author hits his stride, this tone disappears, and we see Moss Hart clearly as the energetic, generous, brilliant man that he was.  He left whatever he touched more colorful and replaced the humdrum with magic.<br />The description of the complete, astounding success of &#8220;My Fair Lady&#8217;s&#8221; opening night, which Hart directed, is the stuff of which movies are made.   This was a pinnacle of life experience for everyone who participated.  Reading about the making of &#8220;My Fair Lady&#8221; alone is worth the price of the book.<br />When the book was over, I wished there were more triumphs to reveal, and that Mr. Hart lived to write &#8220;Act II.&#8221;  A highly readable book with a dazzling subject.	2001-06-26

His credentials are awesome, and he is alive to tell the tale. He is a rarity: a great climber who can also write.  Usually the two do not go together; the only other exception I can think of is Austrian great Kurt Diemburger.<br />Mr. Roskelley's snapshot-style autobiography is a delight.  Beginning in his 16th year as a wild child with incredible energy and no focus, he discovered, with the help of his father, the Spokane Mountaineers Club.  He never looked back.  They treated him as an \\"adult,\\" which was of vital importance to him, and after his first trek up Mt. Rainier, he knew he had a \\"forever longing to be above those clouds.\\"<br />He found himself an unlikely partner who was as preppie, straight arrow as John was wild and rebellious, but they made a perfect team.  Both were impatient to a fault, resolute and absolutely fearless as you can only be when you are that young.  They rock-climbed at Yosemite, climbed icefalls in Idaho and attacked Dengali (otherwise known as Mt. McKinley) in Alaska.<br />At an age when most climbers are totally unrecognized, he was invited on a climb up Dhaulgiri, a 26,800 ft. monster in Nepal, Himalaya.  He wasn't quite sure what it was; he just knew he wanted to go.   The team's successful ascent was only the third that had ever been made.<br />Mr. Roskelley brings a lot of practicality, bluntness and a touch of the poet when he recounts his adventures and the friends he has made along the way.  I am sure he can be a difficult friend.  He never minces words and has an appalling way of \\"laying it on the line\\" letting tender sensibilities fly where they may.  His tenacity in achieving his goals is sometimes like being confronted with a charging Mack truck.  He has a reputation of being the worst of the macho, MCP (male chauvinist pig) in a group that is famous for these traits.  I don't think this is an entirely a fair evaluation.  He doesn't like anything to interfere with the dedication and concentration it takes to successfully climb a difficult peak.  Romances and groupies are prime distractions.  He has no patience or tolerance for either.  Yet he displays in his fine writing a romantic, lyrical side that would probably amaze his good buds on the mountain.<br />I recommend this book highly to anyone from the armchair adventurer to the skilled climber to someone who just wants a highly entertaining read.	2001-06-19

Therefore, it is puzzling why it seems he slotted his visit between more pressing duties like book tours, taking a hike in the Middle East, and attending to business in London.  I felt curiously stranded when I was left at long-gone Surfer's Paradise in Queensland while Bill winged off to Africa cheerily telling me he'd be back in a while.  When we next met up, we were in an entirely different part of Australia.  These departures and arrivals make reading the book a disjointed experience.  You never know exactly where you are.<br />The writing is vivid, clever and frequently humorous-what we expect from Bill Bryson.  He describes the capitol Canberra: \\"-reminded me less of a city-much less-then say, a preserved battlefield.  There was that sense of spaciousness and respectful greenness that you would expect to find at Gettysburg or Waterloo.\\"  This was delightful and gave an instant picture.  His keenness for the small oddball wonders and places is always diverting.<br />Bill travels happiest when alone.  He meets with a few old friends and travels awhile with a buddy who mostly annoys him, but seems truly content when solo.  As a reader, I felt marooned from the day-to-day encounters one has with real live people when traveling.  I would have liked more interaction with the people who are justly called the \\"friendliest on earth.\\"  Instead, there is far more natural history and botany than I bargained for.  I was informed, but not particularly entertained.<br />I think Australia is too enormous and complex to cover in such a haphazard manner.  He needed to spend less time on his homework and more time being there, feeling it, and absorbing its uniqueness.	2001-06-18

Her name (which, I believe is pronounced Owna), her playwright father, Eugene; and her startling marriage to Charlie Chaplin, 38-years her senior made a curiously exotic package.  Once that marriage took place, it seemed like she had fallen off the face of the earth occasionally emerging to be photographed with a flock of handsome children within a backdrop of the Swiss Alps.  <br />Ms. Scovell has great respect for her subject, fairly objective but a little too much the apologist for the reclusive Oona to come to life.  The book holds few surprises.  It is not a shock to learn Oona had a fairly unhappy childhood with a distant mother and a hard-drinking, volcanic tempered, totally selfish father.  I was mildly astonished that Oona was a determined, stubborn, even slightly wild teenager who went to the best schools and was actually Debutante of the Year.  Her father disowned her when she married, never to speak to her again though she tried as long as he lived to make amends.<br />After her lively beginning, it is as if her life's goal had been reached by marrying Charlie, and she could now retreat into invisibility behind the enormous shield of Charlie's egoism.  True, she had all those children but seems not so much a mother as a child producer.  She enjoyed being pregnant, but didn't seem to take much interest after they arrived.  There is a certain kind of woman, Ethel Kennedy comes to mind, that takes enormous pleasure in bringing children into the world as if this affirms their husband's masculinity.  I think this was also the attraction for Oona Chaplin.<br />When Charlie died at a great age, Oona had left over life to live.  She drank heavily and was dead of pancreatic cancer fourteen years later.  I suspect the drinking was a problem before Charlie died, as he was invalided for many years preceding his death.  This surely must have been difficult for Oona who had gone from child bride to caretaker without a serene maturity in between.<br />Ms. Scovell gets the most that she can out of the material available.  Oona O'Neill Chaplin was what our computerized society would call a WYSIWIG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get).  She drifted through life in the towering shadow of the fame and renown that only belonged to her father and husband.	2001-06-18

Our eyes and ears are 7-year old Luke, a very nice little boy who would more believable as a 12-year old, but that's a quibble.<br />Poverty, hard work and struggle are the bones of this book with strong characterizations overlaid and Grisham's fine story telling as the glue that holds it all together.  I have met some of these people, and so have you.  Particularly strong is Hank, the fearsome tempered strong boy/man who has developed bullying and cunning to an art form.  Hank is a perfect example of the person who acts out our worst nightmares because no one dares tell him he can't.<br />Luke has a very real moral dilemma, seldom seen in modern writing, that makes the reader pause and ponder, \\"What advice would you give to this boy?\\"-and it was impossible to come to a fair and honorable solution.<br />The story is paced and crafted beautifully, a testament to Mr. Grisham's steady improvement in his writing.  The \\"painted house\\" parable is a little slick, but works well.  An enjoyable change of direction from this author.	2001-06-18

Well educated, from a loving family and happy in his professional life-what could go wrong??  Apparently, a great deal.  James was born bad and develops from an evil little boy into a kinky, self-congratulatory serial killer.<br />This is Sandford's funniest novel in the darkest sense.  Love interest Weather is using our hero Lucas Davenport for her own personal sperm bank.   She is brisk, unsentimental and awash with one-liners.  Lucas is somewhat baffled, pride a little battered, but still willing.<br />Discussing the falling crime rate in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Lucas and a fellow detective worry about their job security as homicide rates decline.  After some thought, the St. Paul detective notes that \\"rape is holding up nicely, wouldn't you say?\\"  <br />This is Sandford's charm, if you enjoy very hard-boiled, deadpan humor.  Only Sandford would make a victim-to-be so sexually curious and active that our exhausted serial killer is almost worn out by her never-ending demands and seriously thinks of abandoning her for a more passive type.<br />This isn't the best of the \\"Prey\\" series.  There are a few dead spots and some dangling loose ends.  But as always, it's quite a ride and well worth the time.	2001-06-04

It could be the authors wanted to stay off the beaten track, and draw attention to the less familiar.  The result is quotes you don't particularly want to quote.  It seems as if a computerized word-search was done, and this was the outcome.<br />Surprisingly, there are not too many Shakespearian Quotation Dictionaries available.  If you wish to have such a reference, you will not find many alternatives.  I would give Arden's a lukewarm recommendation in that it could fulfill a need, and there are not many choices.	2001-05-28

The story takes place in Anytown.  It sounds like the U.S.A, but was originally published in the UK.  The book has an uneven pace mixing thrills with tedium.  I think the story will hold the interest of the 9-12 group though a few might balk at the stereotypical parents.  The interesting adults are the freaks and vampires.  Darren is good, kind, resourceful and properly adventurous.  He is marvelously cool about spending a day in a coffin underground.  (That section had me hyperventilating.  As a child, I would probably have had nightmares.)  The dialogue is very uneven; I cannot imagine a 12-year old boy ever saying \\"I was positively terrified\\" to a good buddy.  The author has difficulty holding the child's-eye view and slips back into adult-type observations.<br />Long ago, this type of book would have been called a \\"penny-dreadful\\" the precursor of scary comic books.  It leaves the hero hanging, and the last words are \\"To Be Continued.\\"	2001-05-28

Much has been made of its 50's, suburban setting; yet the characters are timeless.  Frank &amp; April, Shep &amp; Molly, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Givings are alive and not-so-well and among us today.  One thing that struck me was the characters have been described as \\"materialistic.\\"  Compared to Americans of the 21st century, they only had the smallest notion of what true materialism is all about.  They seem curiously innocent in that respect.  <br />Richard Yates is a giant of a writer who will make his way to the short list of great authors of the 20th century.  His capturing of the momentary feeling, the basic sham of the faces we present to the world cut very close to the bone.  Frank Wheeler receives the worst drubbing from readers and critics, I believe because we all see ourselves in Frank, and do not like what we observe.  Frank is a man capable of introspection, and his small façade as an intellectual, brilliant misfit in a dead-end job is not despicable, only mediocre, and he sees his own mediocrity.  This is what makes us uncomfortable, and what is painful, we dislike.  Shep is the flip side of Frank, but his face to the world is one of a regular guy, straight talking, practical and dependable; he is truly a sensitive romantic who has thrown his life away to be someone he doesn't even like very well.  Somehow we forgive Shep, but not Frank.  Mr. Yates does not have the same sure hand with the females; they do not come to life like the men.  The use of John Givings, the mad man as the catalyst and truth-sayer is a brilliant novelistic device.<br />I thought of John Marquand and John Cheever who were roughly contemporaneous with Richard Yates.  They had many of the same concerns, but did not have the incisiveness, humor and depth of Yates. You not only will enjoy the read, but I am sure will want to re-read and reflect upon this powerful novel.	2001-05-26

He is a masterful storyteller nailing time, place, and people with bulls-eye accuracy.  The narrative and dialogue flow, and the pace never flags.  He captures the child's eye view with all the authority of Stephen King or Harper Lee.<br />Harry is an honorable boy caught in a dark story of racism, death, and folklore.  The events gradually close in on him and his family creating an almost unbearable suspense.  The characterizations are sharp and multi-layered.  I particularly liked the non-message in dealing with racism.  Mr. Lansdale is an unblinking recorder; all the indignities and intricacies are out there with no apology; for we are hearing a story as it was, not as we would like it to be.<br />\\"The Bottoms\\" transcends the mystery genre.  It is a particularly fine coming-of-age story.  Yet mystery-thriller fans will not be disappointed.  Harry's and sister Tom's search and confrontation of the killer stretch the suspense until you feel as if you are humming like an overtaxed wire.<br />I would rate this book the best I have read this year, and it has a permanent place on my bookshelf.  Highly recommended.	2001-05-20
1992188:US	51197300	R19ORTB0RD7AEL	0898866065	889502653	The Kurt Diemberger Omnibus: Summits and Secrets : The Endless Knot : Spirits of the Air	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Larger Than Life	The author's awesome attainments in mountaineering:  the only living man with two first ascents of 8,000-meter mountains, are matched by his boundless curiosity and his enthusiasm for every new experience.  He is a man of high good humor, tenacity, and independence with remarkable communication skills.<br />The autobiography is three books \\"Summits and Secrets\\" written as a young man, \\"The Endless Knot\\" takes up his ascent and harrowing descent of K2 in 1986 and the loss of his beloved partner, Julie Tullis who died there; and \\"Spirits of the Air\\" written in middle age. <br />Though \\"Summits and Secrets\\" covers interesting material about Diemberger's childhood and early manhood, I found the translation to be stiff.  I fault the translator because the other two books are so free flowing and at times lyrical.  In these autobiographies, you get a sense of the complete man, not just his genius on the mountains.  He loves to sing (he claims it helps him breathe better on the mountain), can and does swear thunderously in German when thwarted, has small vanities, and a never failing appreciation of the charms of the ladies.  Unlike many of the climbing fraternity, he doesn't appear to have a double standard where women climbers are involved.  He judges everyone on his or her merits.  I became so attuned to his storytelling, I felt as if it was all directed to me personally, that he wanted me to be entertained and share his wonder and delight at all he had seen.  I am glad to report that as of this date, Kurt is still going strong lecturing, climbing and doing camera work.  The story ends at 1991, and I had to follow up to see how he has fared this last decade.<br />The much-traveled Mr. Diemberger for some reason had never been in the United States until his 40th year.  (Maybe because we cannot boast of any 8,000 meter peaks!)  He was an enthusiastic tourist as is shown in the following excerpt from \\"Spirits of the Air.\\"  His awe and amazement during his helicopter flightthrough Grand Canyon is infectious:<br />\\"I am staggered!  Overwhelmed is no word for it! And anyway, there's no time to be overwhelmed when new sensations are continually bombarding you, shaking you, grabbing your attention, whetting your appetite for even more unexpected thrills.  You are looking ahead, back, down, as gigantic buttresses sweep past, pillars and palaces of red rock, side valleys opening and closing, the terrific gorge agape below you--- You are flying through the biggest trough on earth.  All the pictures I have ever seen of the Grand Canyon are forgotten.  They are tiny facets, mosaic pieces, nothing more - I see that now.  No human brain can comprehend this intricate labyrinth that is the Grand Canyon.  It is a world!\\"<br />Let Kurt take you on his journey.  You will never regret it.	2001-05-20

This is a fine compendium of southern recipes most of which are served at Ms. Deen's highly regarded Savannah restaurant.   The book is spiral-bound so it will lay flat, the print is large and the margins are wide.  The author doesn't mind a short cut or two, and neither do I.  The recipes are not taxing, but many are ingenious.  When making meatloaf, Ms. Dean lines a jellyroll pan with slices of bread that soak up all that nasty fat. When the meatloaf is done, discard the bread.  I was so grateful she didn't demand I use the soggy bread for something I had no intention of making; I decided she was my kind of lady right there.<br />Her recipe for tomato pie was a hit with my family:<br />4 tomatoes peeled &amp; sliced, 8-10 fresh basil leaves chopped, ½ c chopped green onion, one prebaked 9-inch deep pie shell, salt &amp; pepper to taste, 2c grated mozzarella &amp; cheddar combined, 1 c mayonnaise (Hellman's or make your own)<br />Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Layer tomato slices, basil, and onion in pie shell.  Add salt and pepper.  Mix together grated cheese and mayonnaise.  Spread on top of tomatoes.  Bake 30 minutes or until lightly browned.<br />This is an excellent side dish and a good helper when you have planted a \\"few\\" tomato vines only to find you have wheelbarrows full come July.  I would have given the book five stars except a few recipes listed garlic powder as an ingredient.  Don't use it!  Fresh garlic is cheap and doesn't have a chemical taste.  With this small quibble, I recommend the book highly.	2001-05-20

The story grows, expands and explodes like the fires that are that are the bedrock of the tale. Jack Wade, the fire investigator for the titled insurance company, is as terse as his name.  He works hard, gives value for the dollar and owes nothing to anyone.  He is as unengaged as Lew Archer.<br />There is a lot of fire technology interspersed throughout the book.  I was fascinated by all the information and feel it lent credence to the sometimes mystifying plot line.  The characters are broadly drawn; this is a plot-event driven tale and has a gruesome factor of +3 out of 5.  We aren't looking so much for a particular villain as a conspiracy.  Just when the reader thinks he has things narrowed down and is ready for the grand denouement, the clues expand and become more inclusive.  Remember \\"The Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\"?  By the time the movie is half over you suspect your neighbor, wife and sister of being in cahoots with the bad guys.  This is true of \\"California Fire &amp; Life.\\"  Everyone and everything begins to look suspect.<br />A good fast read where you learn a few things in spite of yourself!	2001-05-20

It does an excellent job of cataloging Mitchum's films and acting methodology.  I would have appreciated less repetition of \\"understated, natural, stole the film\\" etc., and more insight to the particular strengths he brought to his best movies.  The author tells us the movie might have been bad, but Mitchum-never.  I have seen almost all of Robert Mitchum's films, and I am here to tell you, there were a few that he strictly walked through his part.  This is true of almost any actor that has had a 30+-year career.<br />The book is severely limited by the lack of access to the principal players in Mitchum's life: his wife, sons, and many of his closest relationships.  There are disadvantages to an \\"authorized\\" biography if the family wishes only the positive virtues of the subject to be included.  However, without their input or cooperation, it is almost impossible to get any realistic picture of the man.  Before I read this book, I knew Mitchum was a drinker, a brawler, a womanizer and a bad boy.  When I finished the book, I didn't have much to add to that impression.  His early life though sketchy, was interesting.  His famous detachment is easily understood when you read about his childhood.  His mother, though a hard worker, was a drifter and her children more or less raised themselves.<br />The direct sources are questionable.  His sister is an unusual woman who claims \\"ESP\\" with Robert; though her view of him is so laudatory I sometimes wondered if she was speaking of an entirely different person.  The tales from \\"barroom buddies\\" are just that - highly questionable.  He seems to have been aloof toward his children and slightly skeptical.  Mrs. Mitchum is a mysterious character throughout the book.  Why did he stay with him?  Why did he keep coming back?  We never find out.   According to the book, he had a long relationship with Shirley MacLaine, yet the author did not have one conversation with her.<br />Robert Mitchum remains an enigma.  The definitive biography remains to be written.	2001-05-14

The reader must be engaged in long ago happenings yet have a sense of immediacy and urgency about a victim and contemporaries who are long dead.<br />The book is poorly paced, too long, and the plot sprawls.  The victim is not found until page 166, and by that time, my interest was flagging.  The heroine is resolutely young, young, young.  I had the feeling she has never visualized a life beyond 30.  <br />However, Ms. Saulnier deftly characterizes supporting players and obviously has insider knowledge of community theatre.  Because so much of the plot involved the architecture of a crumbling historical theatre, a site map would have been welcome.  The characters, with the exception of the heroine, are lifelike and attractive.  She stays away from the oddballs, who are basically dull except for their quirky lifestyle or appearance.  All are recognizable human beings.<br />What I found most interesting were Ms. Saulnier's thoughts on preserving historical buildings.  She is thoughtful and presents both sides of the question in an appealing manner.  I would have liked more sense of location; the place could have been Indianapolis just as easily as New York State. <br />I found the solution to be a letdown; the present is handled better than the past.  The motivations of the cast of 1926 characters are slim and shadowy. Grade: C+.	2001-05-14

She was the powerful editor of the editorial page on the Washington Post and had a weekly column in Newsweek.  She counted among her friends Post publisher Kathryn Graham, many powerful politicians and fellow journalists.  Her political inclinations are hard to pin down because of her diverse opinions, her friends from all sides of the political spectrum and her even-handed reporting.<br />This is not a `tell-all' book.  If you are looking for scandal and in-the-know tidbits on the famous players, you will be disappointed.  She writes what it is to be in the middle of the whirlwind of national politics.  The first danger is losing yourself, not your ideals.  The role politicians must play to survive (and get re-elected) is for public consumption, and all too often the human being behind the spin ceases to exist. She likens D.C. to high school with twice the stress and all of the infighting necessary to be one of the Golden Boys.  In D.C., there is no relaxing and reaping of rewards when you reach the exalted Senior status.  You must constantly build your warehouse of favors owed to you while not alienating the voters or your peers.<br />Miss Greenfield has not written a memoir.  I think that would have been impossible for her, as she was a completely private person.  She maintains she had to be or she would have \\"lost\\" herself.  Her writing style is economical and clear.  She comes across as humorous, amazingly approachable with a very clear and unblinking eye on what has gone on around her.  She has an ease with writing that only the best journalists can carry off.  The book raises questions and answers others.  <br />Unfortunately, Miss Greenfield died before completing the last chapter.  I believe it was her wish that it not be published in her lifetime.  When I completed the book, I felt as if we were such good friends that she wouldn't mind at all having lunch somewhereand clearing up any questions I might have.  Perhaps she knew there would be many just like me.	2001-05-06

It was as if each member of the expedition had a predestined role to play.  Devi, the young namesake of the mountain; Roskelley, the savage achiever; Elliott, who left in fear; Evans, who arrived too late; Willi Unsoeld, leader, father divided in his role; Marty Hoey, who was saved for another day; and Andy Harvard, more romantic than mountaineer.<br />The portents were grave from the outset. Their goals were unsettled, organization was poor, and the players were disparate.  Devi is phenomenal in her energy and drive with a mystical connection to the mountain.  The upper climb was fraught with endless avalanches, monsoon inspired storms and vertical rock faces.  Roskelley miraculously achieved his summit goal.  Two days later at Camp IV, Devi suddenly sickened, became drastically ill, murmured, \\"I am going to die\\" and expired.  Her father had her wrapped in her sleeping bag, and after a short prayer \\"consigned her to the mountain.\\"  She has never been found.  There are more than a few local people who think their goddess came back to them in living form to dedicate herself anew to the mountain.<br />Roskelley tells this tale well, sometimes struggling to be fair and not always succeeding.  The technical passages can be difficult for the average reader. (The book could have used a glossary of terms.)  His writing style is passionate and driven, but wastes no words. It is his story and Devi's.	2001-04-30

It is equal parts evolution of Helene Stapinski and family and the history of Jersey City.  <br />Jersey City had an illustrious founding by Alexander Hamilton, and it was downhill from there.  The descriptions of the city are bleak, ugly with the worst of the aging industrial northeast.  The present day prospects are brighter with gentrification, and renovation of the riverfront, which the author views with mixed emotions.  She has a reverse sense of pride in the Jersey City in which she grew up.  As if to say, \\"you want ugly; I'll show you ugly.\\"<br />Her family on both sides had and have a number of petty and not-so-petty criminals that go back three generations, and the tendencies are still alive and well in the present generation.  Her central question is: does the general moral decay and corruption of the city politic infect the citizens, or does her particular family have a \\"bad\\" gene for crime?<br />She was a tough little girl, though very much protected and shielded by a devoted mother.  She sees more crime in the streets in her first five years than many people see in a lifetime.  Her family is poor but not deprived.  They eat and dress well.  She attends parochial schools and is never neglected.  The extended family has more than its share of explosive temperaments, and anti-authority types.  But they seem to take individual paths to crime, don't seem to influence each other and are in no way joined together by any criminal operations.  She takes it for granted that \\"swag\\" is ok, but theft is not.  Swag is what falls off the truck she explains.  What most people would call it would be pilfering from your employer.  Dad works at the cold storage and brings home steaks and lobster tails for dinner.  Aunt works in a clothing store and brings home sweaters, blouses and jackets.  But dishonesty is all around them; to do city business in Jersey, you have engage in corruption, and graft is a way of life.<br />The scenes fromher childhood are well realized.  She has a brisk and wryly humorous tone with an underlying resentment for her stark habitat.  Would she have been more forgiving if Jersey City just looked a little better?  A few more trees and greenery, better maintained buildings, streets and rivers?<br />She presents her case, and does it well.  It is a worthwhile read on more than one level.  The history of Boss Hague and city politics from the top down plus the story of one sprawling, but close-knit family is excellent.	2001-04-29

Gather round while Sharyn McCrumb weaves another of her Ballads.  \\"Hangman\\" has it all: Fire, Flood, Murder and Pestilence race through this plainspoken tale.<br />Ms. McCrumb deftly guides alternating voices through the high-speed story.  The tale is a page-turner, not as reflective as the other ballad stories.  Nora Bonesteel, who has the Sight, is almost swept aside in the swift-moving events, both God and man-made.  <br />Ms. McCrumb's near poetical characterizations are a delight, particularly the Ophelia-like, fifteen year-old Maggie Underhill.  Maggie etches herself in your mind, though she is elusive as a fairy child.  Stalwart Sheriff Spencer Underwood's not-so-secret devotion to country singer, Naomi Judd, weaves lightly in and out of the story.<br />I was troubled by the medical course of action advised for Laura Bruce, pregnant minister's wife.  I can't see where it furthered the plot, and it seemed grossly erroneous.  It is difficult to fathom how a closely-knit community can leave two teenagers whose family had been massacred so completely on their own.  Surely, the church and neighbors would visit and attempt to assist them.  All the characters intend \\"to stop by,\\" but never get around to it.  These were my only two reservations about the story line.<br />\\"The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter\\" should be started early in the day, because it's bad for your health and disposition to stay up all night reading a book.  Enjoy.	2001-04-22

Mr. Parker's characterizations are sharp, and in-depth.  I feel Mike McNally, in particular, is a totally realized character.  Grief, the mind-numbing despair, and mind-destroying sense of loss are well and sympathetically done.  Many mystery writers do not allow their characters to get hot, tired, and dirty like the rest of us; Mr. Parker does not make that mistake.   The whodunit is masterfully concealed.  I guarantee you will be surprised.<br />I had problems with Merci.  I can take a central character that I totally detest; what is unsettling is one who continually annoys me.  Merci has to be one of the most self-centered creations around.  She wreaks havoc because she has to be \\"true\\" to herself, yet never seems to question whether her \\"truth\\" is somewhat bloody-minded.  I understand that some types of women rarely have girl-friends; what I fail to understand is how Merci has any boy-friends either. This is not a failing of the book; Mr. Parker does his work too well.  I know Merci better than I want to.<br />The book should have been edited; it was far too long with meandering drives and non-clues.  There were too many places where one of the characters would say, \\"Call me right away!  Important news!\\"  And it wasn't important and it wasn't news.   Then there was the confrontation with the murderer.  Does he or she do away with Merci in an expedient manner as any sensible predator would?  No.  He or she talks and talks to explain motivations and cleverness.  This is a very stale and clunky device, and I am surprised Mr. Parker used it. <br />The flaws notwithstanding, Mr. Parker is a fine writer.  I look forward to his next book.  Maybe Merci will take a well-deserved rest, and it won't be such a lengthy outing.	2001-04-21

The book is impressively noted and indexed, but with distressingly small print.<br />Mr. Finnegan has an uncanny ability to arrive in a completely strange town and somehow immediately bond with perfect strangers who confide in him, ask him to dinner, and if necessary let him bunk down and move in.  This \\"intimacy\\" gene resides in the authors of \\"Cold Blood\\" and \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.\\"  If you and I were in that strange town, we would be lucky to get directions to the nearest gas station, let alone an invitation for dinner.<br />If you automatically assume this underclass exists only in the inner-city ghettos, your comfort level is going to go way down.  The subjects ranged from New Haven, CT, east Texas, central Washington state, and a suburb of Los Angeles.  All of the youngsters had bleak, dangerous, unfocused lives.   Their intelligence ranged from average to highly superior, their connection to their schools was tenuous or non-existent, their ambitions and dreams were either unrealistic or pitifully cynical.  They seem to know far better than their parents that the road to the middle class is not a broad, welcoming boulevard, but an almost unreachable goal.  <br />Supportive, loving, responsible families do not appear to be the panacea we are all led to believe.  Juan admires, approves and loves his parents; he just believes their lives have nothing to do with his.  Sadly, he is right.  Mindy has a strong, loving mother who cannot fathom the world Mindy is almost forced to live in.  The lack of impact of a strong family shocked me.<br />The author pulls no punches and in his summary states, \\"What price are Americans willing to pay for social peace?  This seems to me a central question.  We jail the poor in their multitudes, abandon the dream of equality, cede more and more of public life to private interests, let lobbyists run government.  Those who can afford to do so lock themselves inside gated communities and send their children to private schools.  And then we wonder why the world at large has become harsher and more cynical, why our kids have become strange to us.  What young people show us is simply the world we have made for them.\\"<br />This is a worthwhile, hard-hitting book.  It will stay with you.  You won't easily forget Terry, Lanee, Juan and Mindy.	2001-04-21

I was reminded of Stanley Holloway, the rascally father of Eliza in \\"My Fair Lady.\\" The supporting cast of characters are lively individualists.  Rowan is hired to 1) conduct a two-week Murder Mystery tour through England and 2) to eliminate one of the members of his group.  Now Rowan is not normally a lawbreaker, but he has three ex-wives, a son in an expensive preparatory school and a rundown houseboat that he calls home.<br />Fortunately for all concerned Susan, the proposed victim, is unlikable enough that all the tour members have murderous thoughts involving the best way to rid themselves of Susan.  It is a near thing whether Rowan will do the deed or will one of the tour members beat him to it.  Susan is from Minneapolis.  Before I read this book, I had nothing but admiration for this fine city.  After hearing Susan compare everything from airports to monuments unfavorably with Minneapolis, I could cheerfully go a long time without hearing Minneapolis mentioned again.  That's what Susan does to you.<br />The novel tidily begins and ends with a Jack the Ripper tour through Whitechapel.  You may think you have everything figured out, but Ms. McCrumb has a few surprises in store for you.   A good, fast enjoyable read.	2001-04-16

As much as I enjoyed the previous books, they were stylized mysteries.  There are many good mystery writers out there who have the private detective with a love interest set in an individualistic locale.  The setup is almost a clich&eacute;.  Mystic River breaks new ground, and the reader has no familiar signposts to mark the territory.<br />Three boys, not so much friends as accidental acquaintances, are threatened with abduction by two phony \\"policemen.\\"  One lives in the right place, one is silent and guarded by nature, and one tells the truth and is taken away by the molesters.  Four days later, the abducted child returns from a horror he never reveals.  The event was the collision the three could never quite escape.  Twenty-five year pass and their lives again collide with the murder of one of the boy's daughter.  Sean, who lived in the \\"right\\" place, is a state policeman; Jimmy, silent and guarded, is the father, and a reformed ex-con; Dave, the abducted child, has a marginal job, a son and is related by marriage to Jimmy.<br />The murder has a profound effect on the three men, as if before they had been dormant chessmen.  The chess master arrived, animated them and played the game and them to a draw.  Who murdered Katie Marcus?  All of them and none of them.  You will see for yourself.	2001-04-10

We are immersed in an atmosphere of crowds, colors and lively people.  Ms. Rozan has a light and delicate hand with prose.<br />Lydia Chin, the unlikely private investigator, is appealing in a girlish way.  She is bright, protected, enjoys her creature comforts, and is well behaved in a child-like way.  Where Lydia shines is in her fleeting observations of what she sees around her.  She has an artist and poet's eye for color and description.  Her sometimes partner, Bill Smith, is a series of one-liners in this dialogue-driven book.  He clearly adores every word and gesture emanating from his beloved Lydia.  Her kittenish behavior would drive the average man to the nearest hard-drinking lady rugby player, but not Bill.  Lydia's mother is well drawn and humorous, but I met her first in an Amy Tan book.<br />The plot revolves around stolen export porcelain. I wish we had been given more education about this little known art market.  It would have been interesting and helped us understand the motivations of the thief and killer.  We have plenty of likely suspects and the story moves briskly.  The characters are deftly drawn (except for the hapless Bill) and were interesting in their own right.  Ms. Rozan's debut novel displays skill and originality.	2001-04-09

A long-time writer for The New Yorker, these sketches were featured in the \\"Talk of the Town\\" section of the magazine always beginning with \\"Our friend, the long-winded lady, has written us as follows:\\" I always looked forward to them and vaguely thought the author was likely to be a well-heeled matron of impressive family lineage with a flair for turning words.  My impression was totally incorrect.  Ms. Brennan emigrated from Ireland at age 17, never had much money or security and viewed herself as \\"a traveler in residence.\\"<br />She gave personalities to streets, buildings, and stores as well as people.  \\" Sixth Avenue possesses a quality that some people acquire, sometimes quite suddenly, which dooms it and them to be loved only at the moment they are being looked at for the very last time.\\"  Her focus is keen and unblinking, but she sometimes infuses the scene and the people with the magic of her imagination.  Her word portraits are so incisive, I often felt that I was sitting beside her seeing a man \\"morose and dignified, as though humiliation had taken him unawares, but not unprepared.\\"<br />There is a certain sadness and loneliness in Ms. Brennan's peripheral outsider remarks, but you never feel pity only admiration for an author that always looks outward to keep from looking inward.	2001-04-09

Mr. Stewart's ease with prose and dialogue is masterly.  The book is moves very well, keeping you at keen attention throughout.  You get a double bonus; not only is the book a page-turner, the plotting is particularly clever and intricate.<br />Brother is killed.  Big brother seeks vengeance.  Sound familiar?  How about if big brother gradually realizes that he better forget about revenge and just concentrate on staying alive?  I liked this segue into practicality.  I liked Tom McInnes' all too human reactions.  After he has spent a lifetime trying to get the best of his controlling, powerful father; Tom pauses and thinks, \\"Doesn't he LIKE me?\\"  The typical adult child amazed that his own surly attitude might engender a certain distaste in the parent.  In Mike Gerrard, Mr. Stewart has created the most awesome villain I can remember.  He is so well drawn that sometimes I actually liked him.  My only reservation was the women were not believable.  But perhaps we were to see them through Tom's eyes who thought girls just naturally smelled better and always had a gentle touch at their command.<br />\\"Sins of the Brother\\" is one of the best mystery-thrillers of the past year, sure to be an award winner.   Highly recommended.	2001-04-03

The book reads like an all-inclusive diary and plays out like a small town Southern farce.  Miss Julia has firm notions of how she should believe and behave but, she tells us sometimes with misgivings, what her realities are.  She is recently widowed, or perhaps liberated, from the imposing and wealthy Wesley Lloyd who directed her every move during his lifetime.  She tentatively is spreading her wings and savoring the first taste of freedom she has ever had.  Then she is presented with Wesley Lloyd's mistress and 9-year old son.<br />That Wesley Lloyd, a pillar of the church and the community, would take up with a woman who \\"wears her skirts too short and her heels too high\\" is a stunning revelation.  To drive home the truth of Wesley Lloyd's secret life is the fact that Little Lloyd is the spitting image of his daddy, not entirely a good thing.  As Miss Julia points out, Wesley Lloyd was not a handsome man.<br />\\"Miss Julia\\" has a strong flavor of \\"Driving Miss Daisy\\" with the wise and loyal servant and the impressive house and standards to keep up.  But Julia is not as rock-ribbed certain as Miss Daisy, and is all too willing to ask for advice that she rarely takes.  Sometimes Miss Julia's wide-eyed innocence is overdone, but easily forgiven.<br />This is a feel-good book, excellent for a relaxing read.  It doesn't ask a great deal of you, but gives much back in return.	2001-03-30

He is still an accident waiting to happen, but he's getting a grip.  The action again takes place during winter in Michigan's Upper Peninsula right on Lake Superior.  The author can and does give us a whole new definition of cold.<br />The story line is a stretch at times, and some things are never satisfactorily explained.  It is more than surreal to meet a cultivated Russian gentleman in an ice shack in the wilds of upper Michigan.  We are never told how and why he is there.  Mr. Hamilton is a very good writer and paces the story well.  There are no \\"dead\\" spots where nothing happens and the story stagnates.  The reader's interest is engaged at all times with the interesting characters, Alex's actions and reactions, and the descriptive passages.  What I needed is a more coherent plot that doesn't fall flat at the end.<br />I'm looking forward to Steve Hamilton's future efforts.  He is too good a writer to disappoint us.	2001-03-29

This Brit, who came fresh from the glitzy \\"Vanity Fair\\", was to be at the helm of our elegant New Yorker? I felt her tenure was a disaster, and the only thing of which I approved was the addition of a much-needed Table of Contents.<br />Mr. Chancellor, an English journalist, recounts his recruitment by Ms. Brown and his subsequent year as the editor of the Talk of the Town segment of the magazine.  Why Ms. Brown selected a fellow-Englishman for this task is a mystery to us and Mr. Chancellor.  The \\"Talk of the Town\\" is the heart of The New Yorker, and it is well nigh unimaginable for an editor who is not only a Brit, but had no familiarity with New York City to be in charge.<br />The book is enjoyable written with a light, deft, slightly acidic style.  Alex is fond of Tina in an edgy way.  She is damned with faint praise.  He is intrigued by the peculiarities of the New Yorker staff and general outlook.  This is nothing new, for the ways of The New Yorker are passing strange. <br />Mostly the book recounts the author's adventures, which were first class in every sense of the word.  He is on a chummy basis with the richest, the most social and powerful Americans.  He is a guest in their homes, on their party lists, and an intimate confidante.  When he wishes to have a weekend home in the country, a cottage is provided for him on a huge estate.  I read and reread Mr. Chancellor's description on the book jacket and still could not make a connection between his modest attainments and background and his scintillating friends.  I am sure he is a very appealing man as he writes in an attractive manner.  That charm must carry him a long way.<br />If you ever wanted to live the high life for a year on an unlimited expense account, this is your book.	2001-03-28

His centerpiece is Ettie Washington, a 72 year-old black lady who narrates colorful stories from her checkered past all spent in a five-block area of Hell's Kitchen.  A suspicious fire erupts in her tenement injuring her and burns the building to the ground.  Arson is suspected and Ettie is the suspect in chief.<br />Deaver sets the mood of the neighborhood and skillfully sketches some interesting characters.  The history is presented in a lively manner  (have fun while you learn).  The dark humor breaks out in a sneaky manner when you least expect it.  That's the good news.<br />The bad news is the story lacks focus and consequently does not have tension.  There are too many aimless threads.  Though Pellam's goal is to find the arsonist and get Effie out of jail, many of the paths he takes have nothing to do with her.  I felt as if I were traveling from NYC to Washington DC via Denver and Omaha.  There are corporate high jinks, yards of bureaucratic red tape, and worst of all a prevailing pessimism that it really isn't important whether Effie is innocent or not.<br />The last 30 pages are pure Deaver.  He twists and turns, the good guys have feet of clay, the villains are actually heroic.  You think the action is over, but wait!  That was only a prelude to even greater action.  No one can set a finale like Deaver.  The problem was getting there.	2001-03-28

She is an admixture of a great privilege, passionate beliefs, lover of literature, keen social observations and amazing fortitude.  Her Civil War was dangerous, turbulent and life changing.<br />Brokenburn was a large plantation containing over 150 slaves in Madison Parish, LA.  From 1862 on, it was in the center of the Union Army's fierce assault to gain control of the Mississippi River and divide the Confederacy in half.  Plantations were commandeered and slaves were encouraged to revolt.  The civilian population was helpless before the demands of military control.  Madison Parish had a population of approximately 9,000 of whom 7,000 were slaves.  After 1861, the Parish was emptied of able-bodied white men, most of whom had been sent to far-off Virginia and Tennessee, leaving none to protect the civilians.<br />In 1861, Kate was 20 years old, her immediate future being beaus, courtship, and a gay social life before she settled down to become a proper southern matron.  She was unsure whether this route was ideal, as she remarked, \\"women grew significantly uglier in wedlock and ignored and abandoned their former female friends.\\"  This comfortable world was turned upside down, never to reappear again.   With great enthusiasm and some trepidation, she watched her three older brothers go off to war.  Her widowed mother made it clear that 14-year-old James was now in charge of the running of the plantation and the protection of the rest of the family.  I was amazed at the serene assumption that a young teenager was thrust in this role, but it seems that was the custom of the times.  If you had to grow up fast, you did.  Yellow fever was a constant in the area, and longevity was not a norm.  Both Generals Grant and Lee wanted their troops out of these areas during \\"the seasons of pestilence.\\"  This was not to be, and both armies suffered devastating losses to disease.  Kate treated the \\"fever season\\" as a fact of life, and planned around it with remarkable briskness.<br />By 1862, the Stone family was desperate.  The Federal leadership demanded that they stay on their property; yet there were serious slave insurrections that threatened the lives of the plantation holders.  Those slaves who were not hostile were running off, and there was no labor to farm the crops.  Many southerners could not believe that their \\"loyal\\" slaves would run away.  Kate was not among them, saying, \\"If I were in their place, I'd do the same.\\"  She was by no means sympathetic, just practical.<br />The family finally escaped through the bayous in a rickety canoe with nothing, not even underwear, and finally made it across the border into Texas.  They were refugees along with many other prominent Louisiana families.  Kate was convinced they had arrived at \\"a dark corner of the Confederacy.\\"  Upon noting the barefoot but hoop skirted frontier ladies, she sniffed \\"there must be something in the air of Texas fatal to beauty.\\"<br />Kate agonized over the increasingly bad war news and was devastated by Lee's surrender.  Kate is one of the most vivid, perceptive diarists of the Civil War.  Her diary is one of social history, a time of calamitous change and invaluable for understanding this crucial time in American history.  Kate is a natural writer and observer.  A highly enjoyable read.	2001-03-26

The good news was they were rich and very determined.  The bad news was they were middle-aged and novice climbers.<br />The seven summits vary in difficulty.   Australia's Koscuisko is only 7,310 feet and families regularly hike to the top. Mt. Kilimanjaro in Africa is not a dangerous challenge.  But there is also Mt. McKinley, known for its vicious storms; Mt. Vinson in Antarctica, mind-numbingly cold and a logistical nightmare, and then the one Dick Bass christened \\"The Big Mother,\\" Mt. Everest.<br />This is their story, and it is inspiring.  Before it is over, you feel as if Dick Bass is one of your best friends.  He combines high good humor, tenacity and perseverance.  The man is a modern miracle.  Frank Wells is a more reserved, executive type, an excellent organizer with will power to spare.<br />Rick Ridgeway, a writer and world-class climber, tells the story.  The pace is good while they are on the mountains, and the book has excellent descriptive sections on the difficulties of the ascents.  Unfortunately, Mr. Ridgeway does not have an ear for dialogue.  Direct conversations have all the informality of a voice mail menu. There are unbelievable frustrations and red tape when preparing and mounting an expedition.  I could have done with fewer blow-by-blow accountings of each and every hurdle that had to be overcome before the expedition could take place.  This was especially true of Everest and Mt. Vinson.   The last chapter is the successful summiting of Mt. Everest by only one of the pair.  It is beautifully written and very satisfying.   \\"Seven Summits\\" is a motivating read.	2001-03-20

To quote Donald Hall she was a `soul-flasher.' She was passionately engaged in living and tormented into dying.  Her flight through life was one of breathtaking bravery in the face of crippling odds.    The letters date from 1944 when she was sixteen, through 1974 a few days before her death.  Full credit should go to the editors, Linda Gray Sexton, daughter of Ann, and Lois Ames, Ann's closest friend.  The commentary is sensitive, knowledgeable and readable.  The necessary biographical linkage is there.<br />There have always been unfortunate attempts to link Ann Sexton and Sylvia Plath.  Their similarities are their age, their sex, their birthplace in the Northeastern United States, and their self-inflicted deaths.  And there the similarity ends.  Ann was a fragile child who emerged a tormented woman.  She was creatively brilliant in a very natural sense; yet she worked feverishly all her life to improve every word she wrote.  She once said,  \\"I am tearing at the stars.\\" Ann enjoyed a large circle of devoted friends and repaid their devotion in kind.  She was supportive and free with advice to younger struggling poets when she could barely survive her own despair.  Ann was a naturally beautiful woman who seemed completely unaware or disinterested in her own breathtaking countenance.<br />I am astounded at how helpless she became at the end of her life.  I truly do not comprehend how her friends and family could bear her onslaughts of misery and self-paralysis.  They must have loved her very much. These letters are appealing and a pleasure to read.  She was a wordsmith as well as an incredible poet.  Following is a stanza from \\"All My Pretty Ones\\"<br />Never loving ourselves,<br />hating even our shoes and our hats,<br />we love each other, precious, precious.<br />Our hands are light blue and gentle.<br />Our eyes are full of terrible confessions.<br />But when we marry,the children leave in disgust.<br />There is too much food, and no one left over<br />to eat up all the weird abundance.	2001-03-19

Kinley is closed off from all but logical deduction, yet not a Sherlock Holmesian mock-up.  He clearly has done all one man can possibly do to remove himself physically, emotionally and mentally from his birthplace Sequoyah, GA.  He has one of the most unusual occupations I have happened across in the mystery genre.  He successfully writes in-depth true crime books about the horribly depraved killers.  Why he does this would make an interesting side topic.<br />When Kinley returns to his hometown for the funeral of his best friend only a month after he has buried his grandmother, he is hoping his stay will be a short one.  However he is drawn into the investigation of a 30 year-old trial that his friend has been researching before his untimely death.  Just to stay off the beaten path, Cooke assures us (via the narrator) that the friend did not come to an untimely end; he died a perfectly normal death.<br />The mystery of a man executed for killing a teenaged girl is meticulously unraveled.  Kinley studies trial transcripts, interviews witnesses, visits sites all presented in an appealing manner.  As usual, Cooke gives people instant recall of events that happened 30 years ago, which I found implausible.  But this is a small quibble.  The book builds in intensity until the entire community is in some way involved.  Always in the background is the gray malevolence of the person or persons who schemed to execute an innocent man.  Cooke forces us to think logically along with his narrator, and we join him in his repeated thought: \\"Do you really want to know?\\"<br />The finale left me with a few unanswered questions; but this is typical of the author and makes his books star material for discussion groups.  Everyone will have a slightly different take on the ending.  I recommend this engrossing book.	2001-03-16

For the most part, it was a first-rate effort of combining politics, homelessness, and a 28-year-old unsolved mystery.<br />I found no part of the novel far-fetched.  I might have done so before April 19, 1995, (Oklahoma City Federal Building explosion), but no more.  A well-designed plan to release lethal nerve gas in the State Senate Chamber was shocking, but by no means unbelievable.  The chilling non-personage treatment of homeless people is an everyday occurrence.  In Texas, unusual politics is politics as usual.<br />The characterizations are superb, and the story is tightly plotted.  Balancing two main stories, the homeless Sarah Jane and Molly's self-mutilating investigation of her father's death 28 years ago, is a tough assignment, and is not always successful.  I found myself deeply involved with homeless Sarah Jane who seemed to me more interesting than Molly.  It could be that crimes committed 28 years ago lack in immediacy.  I would find myself drawn back to Molly's story by the repulsive former Sheriff Crocker.  The worst part wasn't his disgusting persona, it was that it was so familiar.  We have all met a Sheriff Crocker, and been far the worse for the encounter.<br />The story was taut, leading to an unbearably suspenseful showdown.  Even if the house were burning down, you wouldn't move till you finished the last ten pages.	2001-03-12

His was a powerful, angry voice that could sing some of the most beautiful love poems of the past century.  His art was violent and primitive; usually he incorporated poetry into his painting.  His strongest influence was William Blake, e.e. cummings was a mentor. He moved easily among the San Francisco poets, a contemporary of Lawrence Ferlinghetti of the famed City Lights Book Store.  He was truly a poet's poet and never compromised his art. <br />I don't know if was influential; he certainly didn't care.  His public, his peers sought him; never the other way around.

The title is somewhat misleading.  Author Janet Malcolm was drawn to the subject because her former classmate Ann Stevenson was taking a terrible drubbing for her (Stevenson's) biography of Sylvia Plath  \\"Bitter Fame.\\"<br />Malcolm went about interviewing Plath-Hughes sources, family and biographers.  The world of biographers is a cruel and incestuous one, particularly if the subject still has living friends, enemies, and families.  Stevenson, Malcolm believes, had no idea what she was getting into and was bombarded on all sides mainly because she was an outsider.<br />I was predisposed to enjoy the book because of my pleasure in Malcolm's writing.  I like her no-nonsense, take-no-prisoners style.  She is surgically precise in her judgments. Some readers this may find her intolerably high-handed, and if so, will end up annoyed. <br />Sylvia Plath is not an easy subject from any standpoint.  Would she have had such fame if she had not killed herself at 32?  If she had not been married to Ted Hughes?  Will her poetry stand up?  I think we are still too close to give definitive answers.  I disagree that this book is strictly for biographers, academics or Plath-buffs.  It has a strong appeal to the general reader who has some interest in poetry and expatriate American writers.  I left the book with a better knowledge of the dynamics in which Plath spent her last years and strong sympathies for the enigmatic Mr. Hughes.  <br />Ms. Malcolm could have used more structure in the book; I found myself flipping back and forth among the pages.  Also, some of the statements need attribution.  However, in Malcolm's defense, I don't think she planned this as a scholarly work, but more impressions of the closed world of biographers.  It is not overly long, and I read it in one satisfied sitting.	2001-03-06

She quickly and efficiently introduces her characters making them stick in our minds.  There is a shattering incident in the first third of the book that for most authors would be the grand finale.  My first thought was how was she going to top this?  Unfortunately, she doesn't.  The rest of the book is professionally done.  The denouement is Hollywood-Special-Effects worthy, but we are not jarred as we were before.  The tension level climaxed before the book was half over.<br />Irene is a likable, if jittery, protagonist, but she doesn't seem to be the same independent lady she was in \\"Goodnight, Irene\\" a few books ago.  The strain of multiple homicides has almost done her in.  While this is a likely scenario for a typical human being, we expect constant pluck from our serial heroines.  She cries and trembles constantly.  She has flashbacks that are harrowing, and some of this gets in the way of the story.  I had sympathy for these normal, if repetitious, emotions.  However, she rambles on about her \\"guilt\\" (for what, I could never figure out.)  Also there is always a crowd around to \\"protect\\" her, therefore, every scene had to account for five or six people which made for confusing reading.<br />Nicholas Parrish, the mad serial killer, was an extremely campy over-the- top character who seemed left over from some old horror movie.  Maybe we have had enough of \\"serial killers\\" for awhile.  It could be we are jaded and unable to work ourselves up to a good scare.<br />I'll look forward to meeting Irene Kelly again-after she has fully recuperated.	2001-03-05

I came to this book in a dubious frame of mind 1) I'd just read a really bad \\"first\\" novel 2) I had doubts about a woman author doing espionage.  3) Spies can be boring.  I was pleasantly surprised on all counts.<br />Ms. Ramthun uses a fast intercut method of whizzing us from D.C. to Colorado Springs to the Middle East and the wilds of Russia without dropping the ball or our interest.  The characters are interesting, life-like and have recognizable human traits.  The drop dead gorgeous girl is not a cardboard cut out; she is also pregnant, has morning sickness, and is becoming compulsive about beef jerky, Twinkies and moon pies.  <br />In spite of the many threads in the story, it was easy to follow.  My interest intensified as the plot developed, and I found I was in the \\"can't-put-it-down\\" mode.  (My favorite reading stance).  The war games are so well described; even this novice knew what was going on.<br />The book was a real pleasure and I am looking forward to Ms. Ramthun's next novel.  I'd bookmark her if I could.	2001-03-04

When done well, there is a satisfying feel of surgical precision and great cleverness.  \\"Bad Memory\\" does not fill the bill.  It is a sprawler with a mass of corporate types and thugs.  The premise is industrial espionage of a huge computer company.<br />The characters are flat and uninteresting.  So many threads are begun, and then curiously dropped and never explained.  The daughter of the hero is very slow in school causing her parents great worry.  We never find out if the child is a late bloomer, retarded, or emotionally upset.  It is dropped.  The number one villain has a father obsession.  We never find out why or who the father is.  The corporate bad guy might as well wear a sign around his neck that said \\"I did it.\\"  The story line has little coherence.<br />The book was written in 1996, and seems oddly dated.  There are pages and pages of computereeze and most of the strategies seem obsolete.  Realize that tremendous changes have taken place in the computer industry, but a techno writer should not inhibit himself to what is 1996 cutting edge.  A discussion between two techs endorses the plan to give the big boss 32 mgs of memory.  Today 128 mgs is common and 256 mgs is the farsighted choice.  The cell phones are primitive and fiber optics are unmentioned.  A true computer maestro, which I am definitely not, would find the book frustrating.  I did not expect the author to be clairvoyant, but I did expect him to have brilliant solutions and some futuristic capabilities.  <br />This is Mr. Frankjet's first novel, and I don't think he received the editing necessary to tighten up and give his book more focus.  I do not recommend the book.	2001-03-02

Mentally add 6,000 feet to K-2 for sheer meanness.  Everest is considered a \\"snow\\" mountain; K-2 has everything.  Snow, ice, rock, constant avalanches, loose shale and a generally evil disposition.  <br />In 1953, an eight-man American team attempted to summit K-2.  The book tells us of their meticulous preparations, financing and outfitting.  I was struck by the fact the cost estimate for the entire 8-man expedition was $25,000.  I recently read the cost for one ~person~ to join an Everest expedition is $80,000!<br />The two authors come across as fine, honorable, decent men.  The entire team's bravery in adversity is inspiring.  After a spell of fine weather during the first part of their ascent, all their luck went against them.  One team member became seriously ill and a bitter storm locked them in their \\"camp\\" for seven days.  The camp was a mere outcropping on a rocky ledge.  The wind almost blew them off their fragile platform.  They were determined to carry out their dangerously ill member.  The task was almost impossible to contemplate, let alone carry out.  They were not successful only because the storm was so unrelenting.  <br />I will not spoil the book for you by describing their descent.  The authors will astound you with their story.

The articles were written as far back as 1971 when Tim was a young man indeed.  And it shows.  Youthful high spirits prevail, and there is much cheery bravado interspersed with excellent journalistic essays that display a remarkable maturity.<br />Ever wonder why people chase all over the earth to view a solar eclipse?  Find out on a rollicking trip to find the absolute best place to get an unclouded view.  Discover what all the shouting is about.<br />I am used to Tim somehow bringing me back alive, laughing all the way from the wildest, strangest parts of the world.  I have always credited him with fine introspection and lyrical prose that sneaked into whatever he wrote. The guy is just incapable of bad writing.<br />The essays include a fine thought piece on the late Dian Fossey, the \\"Gorillas in the Mist\\" author who was murdered apparently by poachers.   The essay on \\"reprogramming\\" of children who were enmeshed in cults is harrowing.  Cahill has no use for the cults, but the rationale and methods of reprogramming are chilling.  He infiltrated a California cult and lived there while developing his story.  The living conditions (except for the leader who lived in a mansion on the hill) were unbelievably bad, yet the morale was high among the young converts.  Tim presents a balanced, sometimes humorous, article that shows empathy for all except the leader.<br />The premier essay, which should be required reading, was his on-the-spot reporting of the Jamestown Massacre that took place in Guyana twenty years ago.  The immediacy and power of his word pictures, the horror of 900 dead supposedly suicides, the incredible remoteness of the site crush with a pervasive sadness and dismay.	2001-02-19

The lush imagery, the pervasive humid heat, quirky characters wrap around this story like the ever-present kudzu.  Anna Pigeon may say she feels most at home in the high deserts of the southwest, but she has a strong feel for the south.  Her affectionate, good-humored descriptions of teenage girls in Mississippi are priceless. Try as she might, she's too much in the know to be a yankee!<br />The story has a good pace and never lags.  Her characters are sharply drawn (as usual, a few too many).  Anna's predicaments are well imagined and briskly carried out. You will be amazed at Anna's recuperative powers that surpass the toughest of the hard-core detectives.  I hereby nominate \\"Deep South\\" for my Scariest-Scene-of-the-Year Award:  the alligator in the carport.  I was hyperventilating and muttering to myself.  <br />I withheld the fifth star because the motivation was a little confusing.  Maybe she had one twist and turn too many.  If you haven't read Nevada Barr's Anna Pigeon series, \\"Deep South\\" is a good place to begin.	2001-02-15

First I read just the cartoons, then the reviews, and finally an obsession with the entire magazine.<br />Ben Yagoda is the first account I have read that does not have a personal agenda or bias.  His research is meticulous and presented in such a lively manner that the reader never feels bombarded with dry facts and statistics.  He brings to center stage a fabulous cast: from founder, Harold Ross, A. J. Liebling, E. B. White, James Thurber, Lillian Ross, John Cheever, Ernest Hemingway, J. D. Salinger, John Updike to the last \\"real\\" New Yorker editor-William Shawn.  Mr. Yagoda's talent brings them to life, sets them in the context of The New Yorker, and they greet you from around every corner.<br />Mr. Yagoda lets us see why and how The New Yorker wielded such a remarkable influence in its heyday from the `30's through the early `60's.  The standards set for fact checking, daring fiction, and in-depth \\"fact\\" pieces were hard to emulate.  I well remember entire issues set aside for arcane subjects.  I always gave the prize to Ved Mehta for writing excruciatingly long articles about subjects of which I had absolutely no interest.  Yet I eagerly awaited Mehta's biographical sketches.  That was part of The New Yorker's charm; they gave their writers the freedom to try different venues.  The magazine was famous (or infamous) for their ruthless editing.  One of my favorite quoted memos was from Vladimar Nabokov who wasn't so much outraged that The New Yorker had tinkered with his text, but amazed.  \\"Never in my life has such a thing happened.\\" said the bewildered Mr. Nabokov.<br />\\"About Town\\" is a fascinating read that can also be used for a reference book.  It is scrupulously indexed and cross-referenced.  This is the definitive biography of The New Yorker.  Highly recommended.	2001-02-05

His descriptions are lush; his characterizations have clarity and depth.  His Houston Police Department detective Stuart Haydon is a many faceted, sensitive man, perhaps too sensitive to be a homicide cop.  Haydon's helpless, nightmare flashbacks were vividly, realistically done.<br />The plot is unusual.  The crime is not a crime: the obsessive collection of violent scenes and film footage.  Mr. Lindsey is skillful enough that we feel as repelled by the violence as we would child pornography.<br />This was my first outing with Mr. Lindsey, and perhaps \\"Heat from Another Sun\\" is part of a series, but I never caught any reason for the fabulously wealthy Stuart Haydon to have a motivation for being a member of the Police Department.   I became weary of the continual street directions \\"right on Main, left on Elder, cross Jessamine---\\" This may be fascinating to Houston residents, but is numbing to outsiders.  If you never know another thing about Houston, you will be thoroughly convinced after reading this book; it must be the hottest, most humid place in the USA.  <br />I thought the book should have been slimmed down.  It occasionally dragged and felt padded.  The pace was uneven; at times I was so lulled by the scene setting and the minute descriptions of apparel that I had to wake up and sit up straight when a graphic, hard-hitting passage popped up.  Mr. Lindsey has a unique style; and I will try another book, as the author was recommended to me by a highly respected friend from the Amazon Discussion Boards.	2001-02-05

When it comes to the authorship of Shakespeare's plays and sonnets, the passions run high and the lines are rigid.  John Mitchell's \\"Who Wrote Shakespeare\\" is a delightful departure.  If you are expecting a definitive answer at the conclusion, you will be disappointed.  Mr. Mitchell lays out a case for each of the main proponents in clear, non-academic (thank you Lord!) prose.  He presents his modest open-minded conclusion, and lets the reader do the same.<br />The book is for the non-specialist who has a passing knowledge of Shakespeare's work and times.  It led this reader many to other books; in other words, I was hooked.  It is loaded with illustrations, many of which I'd never seen before.   I read Ben Jonson's  \\"Ode to Shakespeare\\" with fresh eyes.  When I kept in mind that Jonson was a satirist, punster and humorist as well as a poet, I saw his Ode as less than straightforward.<br />Kit Marlowe is a constant thread through Shakespeare's early writing period.  As always, Kit is mysterious, elusive and roguish.  At the very least, he and Will collaborated and perhaps much more.<br />If you like a mystery, with as many red herrings as there are clues, this is your book.  I don't think you will be disappointed.  Grade A	2001-01-30

Porter Alexander gives us one of the finest memoirs of the Civil War.  His prose is lean, lacking the ruffles and flourishes so beloved by the Victorians.  He had none of the false modesty that makes such reading tiresome.  His book was not intended for a general audience, as were his \\"Military Memoirs.\\"  Hence there is great frankness and frequent passion in his story.  He gives honest accounts of his immediate superiors, Longstreet and Lee; and criticizes as well as praises.<br />Gary Gallagher, a noted historian, is to be thanked for rescuing these papers from oblivion.  Alexander was a well born 25-year old West Point graduate when the war began.  His career was quickly advanced because of his mental agility and military astuteness.  During the Peninsula campaign, he was in reconnaissance.  He was one of the first to use hot-air balloons for surveillance of the enemy.  This makes for exciting reading.  It was relatively easy to get UP in the balloons of the time, but getting Down was a chancy business!  He was transferred to Artillery where he remained throughout the war.  It was Alexander who laid the artillery charges at Gettysburg on that fateful afternoon of July 3, 1863.<br />Alexander's prose is never dry, often humorous, and sometimes luminous.  Following is his impression of the burning of Richmond, Monday, April 3, 1865:  \\"-It was after sunrise of a bright morning when from the Manchester high grounds we turned to take our last look at the old city for which we had fought so long &amp; so hard.  It was a sad, a terrible &amp; a solemn sight.  I don't know that any moment in the whole war impressed me more deeply with all its stern realities than this.  The whole river front seemed to be in flames, amid which occasional heavy explosions were heard &amp; the black smoke spreading &amp; hanging over the city seemed to be full of dreadful portents.  I rode on with a distinctly heavy heart &amp; with a peculiar sort of feeling of orphanage.\\" (pp 529, \\"Fighting for the Confederacy\\")	2001-01-24

The novel is strange yet straightforward, lyrical yet precise, passionate yet unforgiving.  The locales are partners to the story, not static scenery.  The blossoming of obsession takes place in lush, bloom bursting central England with a brooding asylum amidst this riot of growth and sun.  The earthiness, wild passion, and disassociation happen in the seediest, scummiest part of London.  The breaking down and the dissolution are surrounded by wet, desolate Wales.<br />This is Stella's book.  All that takes place is dependent upon her responses, beauty, ruttishness, and clinical depression.  Yet \\"Asylum\\" is not claustrophobic.  Her husband, lover, son and narrator are well-drawn, stand-alone characters.  But they are there because of Stella and have no meaning without her.<br />\\"Asylum\\" is a freight train speeding down a mountain to a shuddering crash in the valley.  And then there is a great stillness, and the reader shakes his head, still dazed, and says, \\"Is it over?\\"<br />I recommend \\"Asylum\\" without reservation.  It is well-crafted literature.	2001-01-22

There are  at least four characters who could/should have been eliminated.  Take your pick. (Claire, child, preppie young man and Maisel are mine).<br />If you are a die-hard Deaver fan (as I am), read \\"Hard News\\" as a curiosity to see how the writer evolved.

If I had to go all or any of these places, he's my pick of a companion.  Funny, quirky, compassionate and I suspect a lot more competent than he lets on.  An added bonus is his lyrical writing; his descriptions are magic.  His analysis of bringing stone age people into the age of technology is thoughtful, insightful and all empathy.<br />In the essay, \\"On the River of Cold Fire\\" I have never read a better description of a totally cold, wet miserable journey.  All the times, we have said \\"If I ever get out of here---\\" are summed up in this article.<br />I've decided I will forgive him for accusing Emily Dickinson of over-editing and even his titles.

It is fast paced, driving, and some nice family scenes to relieve the tension. It has some holes in the plot you can drive a truck through, i.e., the villain rapes a victim early in the book. A seman/DNA test is never mentioned, yet this would go a long way toward identifying the bad guy.  I don't think Mr. Patterson does well in child-characterization.  They seem too mature and sophisticated.  Also, Alex had better get busy and truly resolve some of these cases.  He has a passel of monsters running around loose.<br />I don't have as high of expectations from Mr. Patterson as some of the reviewers.  I think he delivers the type of book he is known for.  I am so grateful he didn't write another &quot;Cradle and All,&quot; I will forgive most anything.  I don't think most of his fans will be disappointed.

Her very physical confrontations with evil make we wince; Anna gives new meaning to the word &quot;resilliance.&quot;  Her alcoholism is a very real factor in her makeup; the author is deft in her understanding and descriptions.<br />The plot is somewhat loose and scattered.  There are enough characters to be confusing, though Ms. Barr is careful not to make them interchangeable.  Because the physical landscape is loose and sprawling, the reader is more forgiving of a plot with the same features.<br />Ill Wind has some wonderful humorous dialogue, very clever, wry and funny.  Frederick Spalding is a delightful personality, about as far from your average FBI agent as you can get.<br />This is a feel-good, satisfying read.	2000-12-31

I saw a kindly, tolerant, gracious lady.  <br />Well--not exactly.  Ms. Cooper does a very even-handed, non-obtrusive job.  I was somewhat put off by the &quot;authorized&quot; biography part, thinking it might be only what the family saw fit to print.  Happily, Ms. Cooper had a free rein to use any and all materials.  The brief section dealing with Mrs. David's childhood sets the scene of a very well connected family who are not anyone's idea of favorite relatives.  I didn't get a clear picture of Elizabeth, and wondered if perhaps the author didn't depend too much on one person's casual comment to attempt to define a large part of Elizabeth's character.  She did not seem like a particularly happy child.  When she was 17, she embraced life and never looked back.  By turns an actress, student, stage manager; she had very little direction and non-existant discretion.  She had a series of lovers, spent WWII very precariously mostly because of her own poor planning and finally when she was in her late 20's found she could write passionately about food--and the rest is history.  Though the author is sympathetic, Mrs. David was not a pleasant person.  She was egocentric, morbidly suspicious, overbearing and very conscious of class (her own).  But was was an excellent teacher and drew acolytes to her all of her life.  She was beautiful and not particularly discriminating so had a romantic life that was hectic, but not particularly fulfilling.  I admired her scholarly dedication and her lifelong disdain for the second rate effort.  There is no question she deserved all her success.  She worked at it and earned it.  <br />An excellent read you won't forget.  For anyone interested in food or food writing, this is one you will want for your library.  For general interest readers, it is well done about an interesting subject.	2000-12-27

If it hadn't said Jeffery Deaver on the cover, I never would have guessed the author. It doesn't have the pace, the painstaking clues, and the twists and turns in the plot that you expect from Mr. Deaver.  What it does have is a fascinating group of characters, tremendous humor (most of it rather dark), and an interesting setting.  The hero, John Pellam. is likeable, quirky and reminds me of many characters Harrison Ford has played--the average guy who is pushed too far and resorts to action.  Donnie Buffett, the cop who was paralyzed by a gunshot wound early in the book, is no stereotype. His reactions to his terrible injury run the gamut and strike true.  The only female in the cast is mysterious, but not in a femme fatale way.  You keep wondering &quot;what is she *doing* here??&quot;  The setting is Maddox, MO, a economically depressed river town whose only claim to fame is FDR once mentioned it in a Fireside Chat as an example of towns hard-hit by the depression.  In this hard-scrabble town, a movie is being made.  Hollywood lurks in the background.<br />I recommend this enjoyable book highly.	2000-12-23

I feel each of his books since the &quot;Bone Collector&quot; have shown increasing skill and maturity.  &quot;Speaking in Tongues&quot; is not up to his present standards. The characters are implausible, the action is not cohesive and the pace is uneven.  If this were a first novel, I'd say it showed promise, but was flawed.  <br />The first scene where daughter Meagan visits the psychiatrist is an excellent beginning: very taut using dual voices (her own and &quot;Crazy Megan&quot;) to great effect.  Her substitute therapist at first sounds brilliant, and then the reader gets uncomfortable.  Something is *wrong* with this man.  The rest of the novel does not live up to the fine first scene.<br />Deaver's famous plot twists failed to surprise or were telegraphed.  The really excessive gore reminded me of Harris' &quot;Hannibal;&quot; so over-the-top and unbelievable.  A good writer, which Deaver and Harris most certainly are, does not need such crude tricks.<br />I would sit this one out and wait for the next one.	2000-12-21

Everything you have read about Proper Bostonians is true.  George was born with a silver spoon and three strikes against him.  He wasn't to grow; he was to be molded. He wasn't to feel; he was to behave.  He wasn't to love; he was to honor.  That he somehow managed to do all of these things makes him a shining hero.<br />Marquand uses a brilliant narrative device using two voices: the ever-so-proper Bostonian diarist and George's black sheep son.  The two frequently write each other disputing the type of memoir to be written about George.  You grow very fond of both these completely different narrators.<br />This is one of my all-time-favorite novels.  Reading it once is not enough	2000-12-17

It's sunlight and innocence and young laughter.  I thought all characters rang perfectly true.  For years, I got this title mixed up with &quot;Wings of a Dove&quot;  because that's how I thought of Daisy. She was all sunshine and certainty and credulity.  I loved her.  I disagree it was &quot;America vs. Europe.&quot;  Wherever Daisy grew, I believe she was destined for difficulties.  Her optimism, her lack of parental guidance, and her tolerance would have done her in wherever she was.  This was a singularly oppresive era, it could be that if Daisy existed today, she might have lasted longer, but not appreciably.  Daisy is timeless because she is unforgettable.	2000-12-17

She is a quirky, vibrant character, very well-developed.  I would like to read a non-mystery about Blanche in a non-me-against-them setting.<br />The book, though short, is slow to develop; it's half over before anything happens. With the exception of a young man suffering from Down's Syndrome, all of the white people in the book are despicable.  Though Blanche has phone conversations with her friends and family, the people physically present are caricatures of various degrees of evil ranging from worthless to monstrous.  We are stuck with a lot of one-dimensional characters and no action to distract us.  I found the plot centering around the rich old aunt quite unbelievable.<br />Ms. Neely is a very good writer.  I think Blanche needs wings to fly out of the constricting mystery-whodunnit category.	2000-12-17

Just as Scarlett O'Hara instantly brings to mind a well-defined personality, so does Julian.  O'Hara (John, that is) is that good.  His eye and ear for time and place are uncanny.  I can see and hear the characters in their surroundings, like seeing a movie and reading a book at the same time.<br />&quot;Appointment&quot; is inevitable from the time Julian throws a drink in the face of the town's leading businessman.  Its tone is elegiac as in a Greek tragedy.  I always think of Caroline English as the Chorus.  She sees the path Julian is on, but there is nothing she can do or say to change a step he takes. I don't think there is a word wasted in the entire novel.<br />O'Hara still has not been quite forgiven for being too successful in his own lifetime.  His sin is that he is too readable, too good a storyteller and; therefore, his books sold like hotcakes.  He had the temperament of a wounded grizzly bear which alienated almost every friend he had.  I believe he will find his way back to his reader's affections; he writes too well to be ignored.	2000-12-17

Ms. Garritsen delivers on fast pace, good characterizations (some a little overdrawn),and a hig-tech tension in the Emergency Room scenes.  The season and locale (late fall in northern Maine) are well done and key to the story.  Her teenage males have a realistic ring. I don't confer the phrase &quot;page turner&quot; often, but &quot;Bloodstream&quot; meets the criteria.  Admittedly, I am a fast reader, but completing a 324 page book in 1-1/2 sittings is clipping right along, even for me.<br />The story did have loose ends (a fine scene describing an enraged teen aged girl from her little sister's terrified viewpoint; then you never hear of them again.  An unexplained local doctor who is beyond snide, tumbling into malpractice.  We are never told any reasons for his behavior.  He sounds as if he is central to the plot, and again, we never hear any more about him.)  Also, it is unexplained why retesting by other labs is never considered.<br />Most mystery readers who have a weakness for medical thrillers will be delighted with this book.	2000-12-10

Very reasonably priced, and it's all there.  The plays sweep you along (I always envision darkening Puccini-like chords in the background) images and crackling dialogue abounds.  My problem is: 1) I have never seen the plays produced.  This is *such* a handicap.  I actually yawned through Shakepeare's &quot;Tempest&quot; until I saw a fine production.  Now it is hands-down my favorite play and 2)I have to get in the swing of reading Elizabethan English for every reading.  Therefore, I do not recommend reading in short snippets if you are also dialect challenged.<br />Do keep in mind Marlowe (as Shakespeare) was trying to make a living, not write for the ages.  He's trying to entice you to buy a ticket and be charmed.  He succeeds admirably. There is something for everyone: action, derring do, comedy, and sharp insights.<br />Marlowe is your mysterious, wild, sometimes trecherous friend; brilliant, but can you trust him?  Probably not.  If he was a vintage southern American, he might say &quot;I didn't take you to raise.&quot;  Would he lie to you? mislead you? Of course. But in everything I have read of Marlowe's I hear his voice; he is *there.*  With Shakespeare, I do not have that certainty.<br />  Recommend reading &quot;The Reckoning&quot; by Charles Nicholl for an excellent biography on Marlowe. It reads like an excellent mystery, which he was.	2000-12-07

Mike has a sly, dry sense of humor mixed with dispassionate common sense that emphasizes the need to size up your opponents.  All the technical skill in the world will not save you if you misjudge who is sitting to your right and left.  Mike has an enormous ability to get through to the reader what it takes to be effective.  I recommend this book and the similar &quot;Play Teams with Mike Lawrence&quot; (my favorite) as an introduction to his more serious books.  I own most of them, and through the years I would say every one of them has improved my game, some enormously.  <br />Some years ago I wrote to Mike about a hand that I was proud of the result, but my more traditional player/friends scorned my wizardly thinking.  I held S-QJ10, H-XX-D-XX C-A10XXXX.  Partner opened one heart.  For various systemic reasons the bid 1NT was not available to me.  I cleverly bid 1S; confusion reigned, and we received an excellent result--but my purist friends were horrified at my bid.  Mike's response to my letter was &quot;did you ever hear of the word 'pass'?&quot;  I loved it.<br />To serious and non-serious bridge players, get this book.  It's a treat!	2000-12-04

But not until you have read a few other accounts (Catton, Friedman, &amp; Foote or whoever else strikes your fancy) and visited the site with one of their experienced guides.<br />This is a massive book, written by a scholar and sometimes the writing is dry, but never passionless.  It is meticulously researched and foot noted.  I use it as a reference constantly; therefore, I'm nearly at the place to buy another copy for show and hide my battered, much thumbed (eye tracks all over it!) much beloved book where only I can find it.<br />I find it very balanced with no hero worship for either side.  He does go into detail about Meade that I find invaluable.  Meade is the forgotten man at Gettysburg.  Ask any average citizen who was the winning general of the battle--I'll save you some time.  They don't know.<br />Some very minor quibbles.  He refers to Col. Chamberlain as &quot;Josh.&quot;  Chamberlain vastly preferred to be called &quot;David,&quot;  and I am sure would never have answered to &quot;Josh.&quot;  Longstreet is treated somewhat harshly (I am a Longstreet fan), but, as the general himself defended his actions in print until his dying day, he is not in need of rescuing from Coddington.<br />A fine definitive work.  I am saddened that Dr. Coddington did not live to see his fine work published and praised.	2000-12-04

I particularly wanted an American publisher so I would have more American entries.  The material is detailed enough to begin referencing.  The print is adequately sized--just barely(approx. 8 pt. headings and 6 pt. entries).  It is easy to use, though I would have liked a thumb-guide.  It's a very good price.  I am quite satsified with my purchase.<br />A note on the choice of entries.  A biographical dictionary does not contain living entries.  For that sort of information you need a Who's Who type of publication that has constant updates.  It is usually a very expensive purchase, and the buyer has to be meticulous to be certain he is getting the &quot;type&quot; of persons in which he is interested.  In this day and age of 15-minute celebrity, to include everyone anyone has ever heard of would take a constantly shifting entire library.	2000-11-26

Ms. Schwartz does an admirable job of setting time and place.  Life was hard work on a small farm in Wisconsin during the first part of the 20th century, and you never got away from it.  I liked the evolving Ruth from the wild, outsider small girl to the competent young woman she became.  The characters were well drawn, even the minor ones.  I did have trouble with Amanda; I don't know if the author intended it or not, but she struck me as humorous.  The more she tried to &quot;fix&quot; everything, the worse it got, yet basically she was a very efficient person.  She is one of those people you know you *should* like for all her sterling qualities, but don't, and you feel guilty about it.<br />This book is not intended as a mystery with a surprise ending.  Most readers will have a good idea of the events surrounding the drowning by the time they have read 1/3 of the book.  The switching of the narrative from Ruth to Amanda and back is a good device.  My problem was their voices were too much alike, there was not enough contrast between them.  The book does not have a good pace, it lags at times.  The plot is a little creaky; the machinery shows.  It's been a long time since I read a modern author who will write that a brief, one-time sexual encounter will result in pregnancy. Of course it is possible, but very unlikely.<br />I look forward to Ms. Schwartz's next novel.  I have the feeling she is growing all the time.	2000-11-26

It was a pleasure.  I developed an immediate rapport with his crusty, technophobe, dryly humorous hero.  The broody late-fall Maine location sets the tone of this psychological thriller.  His characters (a few too many) are well drawn and the pace never flags.  The book is not for the faint hearted, but it is not shocking for the sake of shock.  Realism stalks throughout. I felt the events had really happened, probably due to Mr. (Dr.?) Philpin's long career in forensic psychiatry.  The man has walked the walk.<br />My only reason for withholding the fifth star was a few too many clues.  The reader got ahead of events, always a bad mistake in a mystery.  The hero must have more aces of his sleeve than the reader can fathom.  This flaw is not fatal; you are in for a great read with a highly likeable guide.	2000-11-25

The characters are well drawn,the writing is crisp, and the plot moves briskly.  I owe a vote of thanks to a friend on the Amazon Discussion Board who recommended this series.  I hope he reaches the audience due him.<br />The picture postcard Concord MA serves him well as a backdrop.  I particularly like his characterization of Police Chief Korvich.  He and Harry play well against one another, and for once the author doesn't deal our hero all the good lines.  The book has crackling humor, a bit on the wry and dry side that I enjoyed very much.  Mystery fans, give yourself a treat and give Harry Kline a read.  If you enjoy Jonathan Kellerman, this book is a must.	2000-10-16

Kate is 30-year old woman, yet sounds like a teen age fantacizer when trying to decipher the &quot;meanings&quot; of her strong silent Torrance.  The author is a police professional.  What police force on earth would assign a male officer to 24/7 bodyguarding of a female officer?  I don't just mean surveillance, we're talking about nose-to-nose, never more than an arm's length away body guarding.  I don't think so.  Her zero batting average understanding him made me seriously question her fitness for her job.  <br />That said, I felt I should take notes to keep track of all the plots and subplots.  There were so many, I couldn't develop a strong interest in any.  However, everything works out in the end, and that I like--nice and tidy.  Best character development was the ex-husband--a many sided, semi-villain.  He was rather wasted on Kate who dismissed him as &quot;too possessive&quot; and looked no further.  Kate does have a certain charming naivete, always thinking &quot;surely, he/she doesn't want to *kill* me&quot; when that is exactly what he/she has in mind.  I'm reminded of the character who sails through fire, flood, bombs and devastation--emerging without a hair out of place and a smile on her face.<br />I see from other reviewers Ms. Burcell is up for an Anthony award.  I certainly wish her well, but I must conclude the pickings must be slim this past year.	2000-10-14

The author is passionately loyal to the Marines and Vietnam veterans.  This a flaw and a virtue.  A flaw because he sanctifies, hence simplifies, the Marines as an organization and Vietnam vets as individuals.  A virtue because it binds his story and strengthens his portrayal of the repressed and anguished John Dietrich.  I had a hard time suspending disbelief.<br />I awarded the 3rd star because the first quarter of the book moved very well, set the scene quickly and entertainly, and had good momentum.  The other 3/4 slowed down, and I found myself skipping areas that consisted solely of impassioned speeches.  I just couldn't credit a recovery group that contained all loyal, subservient and committed members.  Surely, there must have been a bad apple or two.  I have known many former and present Marines.  I have never met one who was not proud of his service, but I also have never met one who was completely obsessed with his &quot;Marineness.&quot;  Oddly enough, the tormented John Dietrich did come off as a &quot;real&quot; person.  I felt pity and admiration in equal parts for this man.	2000-10-10

The outsider status of an American-Japanes person is deftly handled.  I particularly liked the problems Rei had with reading Japanese.  It is perfectly understandable that a girl educated in the US would not be adept with Japanese symbols, if you think about it.  I just never did.  This affects Rei's everyday life, and Ms. Massey never lets us forget it.  Not only did Rei have to solve the crime, she had to run around and get someone to read the newspaper to her.  When she went out to dinner, she couldn't read the menu.  This gave the story an added bit of realism.<br />The mystery was not as well done. It was diffused by the romance, the family, the shop-till-you-drop (dare I say airhead?) personality of Rei.  She put forth some offbeat potential villains, but didn't put in the effort to make this a rousing whodunit.  By the time Rei solves the mystery, I didn't much care, and I don't think she did either.	2000-10-08

I was intrigued by the title and the construct, same as &quot;Wuthering Heights.&quot;  First, Mr. Tully never finds a voice; the lawyer Coutts is a credulous fool, and Martha has to be the maid from hell.  His very shaky unsupported premise would be laughable if not so insulting to the reader.  Mr. Tully should have been aware his title alone would attract some Bronte experts (I am not one), and that his gee-whiz revelations would be slashed to pieces.  I felt sorry for the long-dead Brontes for having been treated so shabbily in print. Mr. Tully calls himself a &quot;criminologist.&quot;  What a joke.  I agree with another reviewer who would like to see Monty Python make a skit from the story.  I see John Cleese or maybe Harvey Corman as the evil curate.  Then again, Stephen King could tidy up the plot and scare us all to death.	2000-10-02

I respect and appreciate her deft handling of her mother's problems (a bipolar manic-depressive with no sense of responsibility and some very strange quirks about what people should or can eat.)  I found it alarming that an 8-yr. old child 1. had to keep an sharp eye to make sure her mother didn't kill someone with rotten food.  2. was a good cook at that age, mainly in self-defense.  Her father was passive.  Ms. Reichl is touchingly loyal to him, but I was outraged at his not taking an active hand to protect and to be responsible for his daughter.  <br />Ms. Reichl was a perfect 60's/70's girl--filled to the brim w/idealism, courage, curiousity and yes, arrogance.  All that being said, I had a hard time relating to this book. I like cooking memoirs such as Micheal West's &quot;Consuming Passion&quot; and Laurie Colwin's &quot;Home Cooking.&quot;  Funny, but friendly and no sharp edges.  Also I loved their recipes.  Ms. Reichl favors complicated French creations and places them rather haphazardly throughout the book.  I couldn't get a sense of occasion from them. She has an excellent knack for describing the effect food has upon her, but it is so far from my reality, I felt that I must be very insensitive.  I think many readers will thoroughly enjoy this book; but for myself, we were not too good a match.	2000-09-22

To paraphrase e.e.  cummings,--down we forget as up we grow--.but not so with Ms. Settle.  The  author draws sharply defined characters except for her own mother,  interestinly enough.  I sense a lot of unresolved feelings where her own  mother is concerned; she's angry but tries to be fair.  Addie, the  grandmother,  is in bright relief in contrast to the sharp and shadowy  mother.  Addie's self-righteous neighbor snorted over the misbehavior of a  certain attractive young women.

New York City is not the place to get it.  This is not one of the author's best efforts.  Her style seems crabbed (and crabby!)when she cannot luxuriate in her rolling descriptions  of open spaces and bare land.  I couldn't get a sense of focus in the  story.  She traveled and traveled via subway, ferry, and cab, but was never  pleased at where she'd been or where she was going.  There were a few too  many characters and subplots to keep track of.  I like Anna, her stream of  consciousness chiding herself (she really thinks some bad thoughts), her  humor and her sense of self and reality.  I don't get bored with her  skittishness toward romance, booze and intimacy.  That's her.  I wish she'd  at least be an ex-smoker.  I'd enjoy her remarks.  It seems all  contemporary female crime/mystery writers rigidly require their heroines  not only to not smoke, but condemn, deplore, and excorciate anyone who does  or has been in the room ahead of them. Ah well. In conclusion:  I think it  very plausible to write an entire book about a person you heartily dislike,  but not a place.  Anna's antipathy toward New York City could have been  covered in a few pages.  Repetition does not strengthen the argument.	2000-06-26

I read the Customer reviews and agree there could be less yachting, but as one reviewer said,&quot;it's his book.&quot;  Peter is a charmer, and his obvious love  and sensitivity toward women is well-written and described.  Nowadays, he  would be called a &quot;hyper-active&quot;  child, no doubt suffering from  ADD.  A gradually disappearing mother and a cold, stern father were  devastating to such a sensitive child.  As a reader, I tried to be  empathetic with Peter always resorting to tears. (In my family, you die  before you cry!)<br />Remember all the times you have been humiliated and  later you think &quot;what I shoulda said--&quot;  The Germans call this  &quot;the wit of the stairway&quot; meaning your swift retorts when it is  long over.  I think Peter recalled many incidents the way he'd have LIKED  them to turn out, but the truth might be a little different.  But hey, it's  his book.  I don't doubt for a minute, he is very impulsive, feisty, loud  and belligerent when the mood, the drugs, the drink, whatever are upon him.   I remember I heard Peter had taken to roaring past his sister's home on  his motorcycle after she married Tom Hayden, screaming what a worthless  hanger on Hayden was; who couldn't afford breakfast unless Jane bought it  for him, etc., etc.  I don't know whether this is true or not, but after  reading the book, I certainly believe Peter is capable of such  behavior.<br />I was surprised he never mentioned his father's last film  &quot;On Golden Pond&quot; which his sister Jane worked so hard to put  together and Henry won an Academy Award.  I don't know if Jane exercised a  heavy editorial hand on his writing, or Peter didn't want her overshadowing  him.  I doubt the last because with all Peter's problems, low self-esteem  does not seem a part of him.  And it shouldn't be.  He is a brilliant man  and writer.  It is definitely wrong to say he was gypped in  family brains  dept.  He was not as visible as sis and dad, but he is strictly A-list.	2000-03-10

I didn't know if the hero was going to make it to the end and be able to tell us whodunnit.  I agree with the reader from Berlin who puts it so well.  Alex teeters in and out  of reality, obsessions, compulsions and never sleeps.  This last reminds me  of P. Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta, but she never bathes either, and Alex is  faithful to long hot showers, Thank God.  He certainly doesn't inspire much  confidence.  The scene with P.I. Prudmore displaying Alex's lack of  sleuthing ability is worth the price of the book.  I liked everything but  how he handled the plot.  When Alex is obsessively following a train of  thought, the author should remember that Alex is dragging the reader right  along with him.  I admire the skill, but I felt I wanted off the train  every now and then.  His handling of location was superb.  I'll be looking  for more books	2000-02-22

I just don't understand why he is not better known.  His plotting is superb, he has an excellent ear for dialogue, and he is a stylish writer. Mr. Blum  shares a wonderful trait with Ed McBain, i.e., an economy of words; just  enough but not too much.<br />&quot;The Face of Justice&quot; moves right  along.  I liked David Nova and hope he returns.  Don't begin the book at  bedtime; you'll be up all night!	2000-02-11

Ms. Flagg has a good ear for dialogue but not much for reality. The heroine is confused and confusing.  I couldn't understand how she inspired such devotion if she was, in fact, as distant,  reserved, untruthful as described.  I felt Ms. Flagg did a hurry-up job on  this novel.  She never explained how the penniless 15-year old Dena  supported herself for the next 4 years after her mother deserted her.  She  rents a house that has supposedly been occupied until a few months ago and  finds a 1954 calendar hanging in the kitchen.  I realize this was supposed  to be nostalgia time, but what of the previous tenants?  Did they live in a  time warp?  I found it hard to believe that a girl with small town  relatives had no idea what a pot-luck dinner was.  The big mystery was some  letdown.  Book seemed very hasty, tangled, and I will never understand the  fictional conversation with Tennessee Williams. I'm sure he would be  mortified to be credited with so many cliches	2000-02-10

Books on &quot;class&quot;are best handled by a) real insiders like Louis J. Auchincloss, Edith Wharton or Henry James; b)light-hearted, perceptive types with tongue firmly in cheek such as 1) Stephen Birmingham and  Cleveland Amory; and c) sociologists (sorry, I don't know any names.)  Mr.  Graham is none of the above.  Worst of all, he's not even a good gossip!   He leads us to think we are going to get the *real* lowdown on Mr. Logan  and Mr. Hunt of Memphis.  OK, I'm game.  I've never heard of either  gentlemen, but am always up for a good story.  Sorry, that's it; no  conclusion, expose, nothing--why bring it up in the first place?<br />There's  so much wrong with this book and Mr. Graham that's been taken up by your  other reviewers, I won't beat that horse anymore.  But was anyone else  *embarrassed* by Mr. Graham's undisguised longing and fawning?  I'd catch  myself thinking almost protectively &quot;now DON'T tell me what kind of  car. I already KNOW he's the 'former president of American Express.' Don't  repeat the credentials(clubs, sororities, fraternities, etc.) Don't  embarrass your mama further by any more references to her worshipful social  climbing.&quot;<br />Our Kind of People need a basic course in genetics.  If  perfection is light skin, straight hair, light eyes and narrow noses; get  out there and marry white people! preferably Scandanavians!<br />Last thought,  perhaps Mr. Graham was the right man for the job.  Maybe it takes a fool to  adequately encompass the fools he wants to become.	2000-01-05

Fisher	Books	4	32	39	N	N	MFK'S GREATEST HITS	The potential reader should beware that much of this journal has appeared elsewhere.  It has the advantage of a chronological life progression. Though I've read a great deal of MFK, I can't say I especially like her;  the person that is.  I always think of her as a female Ernest Hemingway in  her writing style.  She is overfond of such words as &quot;sturdy,&quot;  and &quot;true.&quot; As in, &quot;we shared our honest stew, simply and  truly.&quot; She makes me feel apologetic for ever longing for damask over  burlap.   MFK was a beautiful woman, a skilled writer, and a brilliant  gourmand.  She took the foregoing as a given and for granted.  I was struck  by one statement she made about an occasion where she took  particular care  with her dress, so that her entrance would &quot;stop the room cold.&quot;   Her attitude was that anyone could do this if they merely took the time and  effort, as she had done.  She frequently had an impatient attitude toward  the rest of the world.  I have this feeling she has everybody fooled.  We  have taken her at her own self-evaluation.  And yet--and yet---she didn't  whine, she soldiered on, and wrestled her life into her own design.  I do  not know if her essays will be remembered, or if she will be a footnote to  cookbookery.  It is certain we will not get another like her soon!	1999-11-15

I came to this book without an agenda.  Being neither Catholic nor Jewish,  it was the &quot;situation&quot; that interested me.      Mr. Dubner is a  thoughtful, humorous man and an excellent story teller.  Given all of that,  I was becoming quite hostile toward him for what I perceive as the  browbeating of his mother.  She is an outstanding example of steady and  profound faith.  Her son is a searcher for knowledge.  He is so annoyed  when she sends him coffee-table book of the &quot;Life of Jesus  Christ;&quot; yet he bombards her with clippings, phone calls, articles  that show the superiority of Judism over Catholicism.  Then Mr. Dubner said  &quot;She had been backed to the wall by her petulant child.&quot;  I  forgave him, reflecting that he had some understanding of how he was  behaving.  Mrs. Dubner senior's behavior toward her youngest son's barrage  of new found knowledge exemplified that almost archaic term  &quot;lady.&quot;  The motives he ascribes to his parents for their  conversion are trivial; his conversion he presents as profound.  His  parents provided him with a warm, loving, rowdy family life; he cannot  perceive the distant, cold familal relationships his parents had as  children.  I *know* Mr. Dubner is a nice man, so be nice to your Mama!	1999-11-01

Do other people besides my family name their cottages after their children?  Ours  was Tomberher, and it still embarrasses me to say it.<br />I perceived  backbone and stoicism in the author.  She will become a fine, undomnible  Boston matron herself someday.  These are people that know how to  Pull-Up-Your-Socks. No one ever seems to give up.  I amend that, the family  will not *allow* anyone to give up.  Poor Robert Lowell.  His poetry must  have kept him alive such as it was.  The author makes an excellent point  when she expresses amazement that he &quot;lasted until he was 60.&quot;   He seemed so gentle to be so mad.  I couldn't resist smiling when I noted  that only the Lowells would unfailingly be &quot;God&quot; in their deluded  or &quot;manic&quot; states; other manic depressives might be Sam Spade,  Peter Pan, or Theodore Roosevelt; but the Lowells went for the whole  enchillada. My only complaint is the author neatly sidesteps giving the  reader anything but broad outlines of what she was up to when the maelstorm  whirled about her.  Most younger writers cannot get out of the way; you are  buried under their angst, but Ms. Stuart quotes her brothers to give us an  idea what is going on in her generation.  She's oddly elusive.  I think she  uses her fine sense of humor to deflect us from coming to close.<br />I'm  going back to reread Robert Lowell.  That's my idea of a successful book,  one that sends you on a quest for further knowledge.	1999-10-26

She (and Alice Roosevelt Longworth) have a shared sentiment: &quot;If you have absolutely nothing good to say about anyone, sit right down here next to me.&quot;  Her story is a witty frolic.   She pokes marvelous fun at the staid British virtues of bad food, bad  weather and cold country houses.  Usually I am very unamused at some Brit  writing in a condescending manner about us colonists other wise known as  American citizens. But Ms. Mitford catches an intelligent, but-oh-so-boring  American perfectly.  You can even hear the corporate cadence.<br />I did not  find it dated, it wears well, and now I'll have to go on a Nancy Mitford  hunt.	1999-09-07

What more could you ask? If I'm taking a mental trip to wild, exotic, fearsome places; I don't want a cranky guide.  Bill Bryson (Walk in the  Woods)preaches too much--wants everyone to walk everywhere and eschew all  drive-throughs.  Tim is absolutely tolerant, apologizes for his wackiness  and agrees fervently that taking a nap 250 yards from a grizzly bear takes  a lot of explaining.  His essay on llamas was worth the price of the book,  informative (I didn't know llamas spit at you because you came too close to  them.  They just look like they'd love to be petted.  Not so.) and funny.   I found his descriptions lyrical.  My curiousity was so aroused, I was  looking in atlases and encyclopedias.  I've passed over his other books  probably because of the god-awful titles.  I won't make that mistake again.   P.S. The last book I thought deserved 5 stars was &quot;Catcher in the  Rye.&quot;	1999-07-20
