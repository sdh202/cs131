Honestly...reading this book really made me think long and hard about being a wife and having children.  It reads like the harsh truth.  The best part of all, it shows that even in trying times there can be a happy ending.<br /><br />The book tells the stories of 4 women (3 whom are pregnant), each of different lives and circumstances who happen to become friends when one of them goes into labor after a yoga class.  One after another they give birth and their lives are never the same.  From dealing with husbands to mothers-in-law to the babies themselves; life is anything but picture perfect or happily ever after.  However, the power of friendship succeeds it all.<br /><br />I have enjoyed all of Weiner's books, this one included.  It was quite different from the others, which was nice as well.  Her characters quickly endear themselves to you, making it hard to put the book down.  If you haven't read her before definitely get Good In Bed, as that is my favorite so far!	2005-03-29

Like most authors, his first writing effort left something to be desired.  However, given a bit more time and experience, I think he would really improve.<br /><br />The Hottest State is a short novel, from a male point of view.  It's about his falling in love and getting his heart broken.  It's about his absentee father and his trying to cope with this most of his life.  It's about a 20 year old, turning 21 and trying to figure out what to do with his life.<br /><br />After finishing the book, I was left a little bad taste in my mouth.  The book wasn't quite what I thought it would be, or could be.  And the ending was a bit odd.  However, I did enjoy much of the story and the characters.  Even though the characters did get on my nerves at times...I'm not decided yet about reading his next book, but I've heard it's better, so I'll probably give it a try!	2005-03-23

I liked the characters and the story.  It was nice to read a book where you don't just get to see the character at one moment or time in their life; instead you're getting to see them through-out their lives.  However, I struggled to find meaning or a purpose for this novel.  Usually after I finish with a book the moral or the lesson is pretty clear, however with this book, I'm not sure I grasped why it was written or why I'm any better for having read it.<br /><br />In part one we find Ruth at only 4 years of age, with her father horny and selfish like a school boy and her mother screwing around with a 17 year old assistant of her husbands.  They're all living in a home that is a shadow of what was, before the death's of her older twin brothers, years prior.  In part two we find Ruth thirty years later, a writer with a life that seems to be missing something- perhaps it's her mother who left her at the end of the summer she was 4, or a father who can be counted on, or a committed relationship.  We see the woman Ruth has turned into and how the past shaped who she is.  In part three, 5 years later, we find Ruth at a time when it seems her life is finally falling into place.  And we see if there's any healing in life or any happy endings.<br /><br />Again, I did for the most part enjoy the book.  But I'm still not sure the theme is apparent as it should be to a reader.  I'd have liked to really come away from this book with something more than I did.  And suffice it to say, I'm not compelled to read more of Irving's books, as this was my first of his.	2005-03-14

It has inspired me to pick up a few more of her books, anxious to read the other stories she's woven.<br /><br />The Amateur Marriage was pretty much what I'd expected: A story of a family, a marriage.  Their ups and downs.  Some lessons along the way.  Characters with many sides to them.  Pauline and Michael are the married couple, with their 3 children Lindy, George and Karen.<br /><br />The funny thing was, that even though it's about a \\"marriage\\"- it's just as much, if not more, about a Family!  It's about meeting someone and struggling to make a life together, learning to live together.  It's about raising children in rough times, during the fights and the spats, as each of you grows older and less patient.  It's about watching the children grow and the affect a marriage can leave on a family.  The affects that any one member can leave on the family- for the entire existence of the family.<br /><br />I enjoyed the story, the characters.  I did have a hard time at first relating to George and Pauline, just because it was hard to see where they were coming from.  However, I read along, anxious to see where the future would take them.  Hoping that Pauline would learn a lesson, or George would soften up a bit.  And of course I had my hopes for the children as well, but I don't want to spoil anything here.<br /><br />All I can say is, I'll be picking up more of her books soon!	2005-02-24

And over all, compared to his other works, I was still quite impressed with By the Light of the Moon.  While it's not my absolute favorite of his, as I reached the ending I found myself quite pleased with the whole of this book.<br /><br />We find Dylan and his autistic brother Shep in the middle of an average day of their lives, in a hotel room, in town for Dylan's art show.  Quickly, an average day turns into the strangest, scariest day of their lives- as Shep stands by helpless as Dylan is accousted and injected with an unknown substance by a seemingly crazy man.  Minutes later in another part of the hotel another random victim (Jilly) is injected as well.  The three of these people find themselves in the middle of a strange nightmare- fighting for their lives and trying to figure out what has happened to them and what's to come.<br /><br />When I read Koontz it often times comes down to whether I enjoyed  the characters and their lives.  And in that regard, this book did not disappoint- I would certainly enjoy a sequel- which I don't say often.  Shep, Jilly and Dylan were all well-developed, unique and \\"real\\".<br /><br />As for the plot itself...I realize  some readers do not like books that are about either the supernatural, or other topics that are seemingly unusual, possibly unrealistic and definitely \\"out there\\".  However, this IS one of Koontz's books that I felt was NOT too out-there, not too corny or unrealistic.  The story kept me turning the pages, dying to know what was going to happen next.  As for the final chapters and ending- those were the best part to me!  This was one of Koontz's more recent stories that I did enjoy, there have been a few that did disappoint (Tick Tock, Winter Moon).  If you're looking for other books of his that are newer are worth the read, add these to your reading list: The Face, Odd Thomas, One Door Away From Heaven.  And as for some classic Koontz, try: House of Thunder, Hideaway, The Bad Place, Key to Midnight & Watchers!classic Koontz, try: House of Thunder, Hideaway, The Bad Place, Key to Midnight & Watchers!	2005-02-22

I can spot a good Koontz story vs. a bad one.  I can spot one that drags on & on; and one that might be long, but it's completely enjoyable.  Koontz has come up with forgettable characters & many that are unforgettable.  \\"The Face\\" is most definitely one of his best books that has come out in the past 5 years.  Yes, it's long at 600 pages, but not once was I bored! And believe me, I'm not shy to say when I did not enjoy a Koontz book, which has happened on occasion.  So I can't understand why some of the other reviewers did not seem to read the same book I did.  I didn't agree with a single thing they said...which is odd.  But I honestly couldn't find one comment I agreed with.  I especially disagree that this book had a lot of \\"flowery\\" commentary; to the contrary, this book stayed on track MUCH more than other recent works of his!<br /><br />On to the PLOT:  We meet Ethan, who is head of security for a famous movie actor (\\"the face\\") and his son Fric.  He's been receiving threatening and weird packages for \\"the face\\", and is currently trying to decipher them.  Within the house we meet a cast of characters from a cook, to a chef to a guru...And we meet Fric, who has also begun receiving strange messages via the telephone from someone who seems to know his every move and swears Fric is in danger.  At the same time this is going on we read about Corky- who is an anarchist and seems to have many plans of disaster up his sleeve...At the height of suspense we wait to see if whoever is out to destroy \\"the face's\\" home and family will be able to succeed.<br /><br />Like I said, this is a long book, and at 600 pages there's a lot going on to keep you busy & in suspense.  What I wrote above is just the beginning of the plot.  Many of his recent novels have many sub-plots and underlying stories, and The Face is no different; which makes it hard to quickly sum up in a few words.<br /><br />Like most Koontz books, underneath all of the murder & mayhem, the heart of the story was about the human spirit and survival.  That's why I enjoy him, there's always much more to the story than what would be in the average \\"horror novel\\".  And when I finish, I can't believe that I often find myself disappointed in the fact I will be missing the characters- they can be that special.<br /><br />If you like Koontz, or you like suspense, I don't think this book will disappoint!

I have to say, it was odd reading a book of his where romance wasn't 99% of the book!<br /><br />In this book we meet Julie, whose husband recently died of cancer.  Her life pretty much consists of a few close friends, her job at a hair salon & her quirky dog.  Julie, afer a few years of being a loner, decides it's time to get out & date again.  And that she does...unfortunately she meets Richard- who turns out to be a little scary.  In the meantime her close friend Mike is there to help her pick up the pieces...<br /><br />Overall I did like the book & loved the characters!  I think most Sparks fan will appreciate this book for what it is- his attempt to put a twist into his formula & keep his readers guessing.	2005-02-10

Silver Wedding strikes me as one of her more unique stories, one that goes out on a bit of a ledge.<br /><br />The book is comprised of something like 8 different parts; each with it's own narrator & we get a glimpse into that person's life.  We start out with the eldest daughter of the anniversary couple, Anna, and then to her two other siblings- Brenden & Helen.  We also read about her parents and their friends.  In the final part we see them all reunited for the anniversary party.<br /><br />The book was not exactly what I was expecting- it wasn't really a very \\"happy\\" book.  In fact, the stories inside it were quite sad & depressing.  I did enjoy though what almost seemed like a book full of mini-stories all coming together at the end.  So far it's not my favorite of her's, but I enjoyed it just the same.	2005-02-05

I have to say, I've already went out and bought a few more of her books, because if they're as good as \\"Bet Me\\"- I'm a new fan & I'm hooked!<br /><br />We first meet Min Dobbs as her boyfriend is breaking up with her- in a bar- for not sleeping with him.  Thank god her friends are there for support, and so are some good looking available men.  Cal catches her eye and she's definitely interested, until she sees him talking to her now ex-boyfriend & making a bet that he can't get her into bed in 1 month!  No longer interested in his good looks, out of spite she does agree to leave the bar with Cal.  Only, this casual acquaintance seems to take a life on of it's own...and Min & Cal begin running into each other where ever they go.  Their love/hate relationship becomes irresistable, even though both of them try to deny it.<br /><br />This book was such a pleasant, fun read!  Very quickly I became attached to the characters in the book, the friends of Cal & Min, their families, even their conspiring Ex's!  I think this is one of the best romantic comedy books I've read in a long time.  As another reviewer put it, the dialogue and situations in the book are realistic, they do not come off as contrived or fake- as some books do.  I'd certainly love to see a movie version of this book- and like I said, I'll be reading much more of Crusie in the future!	2005-02-02

This 4th installment to the Shopaholic series leaves readers happy and begging for more- at least I am!<br /><br />In this book we find Becky & Luke finishing up on their honeymoon- arriving home with much more than they took- thanks to Becky's shopping.  Coming back home is a bit of a downer for Becky though as her best friend has a new friend, her parents are acting weird and Luke has thrown himself back into his work.  And once Becky finds out why her parents are acting strange- that she has a long-lost half sister...things don't improve much for her.  While she tries everything she can do to get close to the sister she never had, it's obvious that they have nothing in common & are complete oppisites.  They don't even get along...<br /><br />I really loved this book.  Kinsella always does a wonderful job of bringing new characters & situations into each book that keep the story interesting & enjoyable to the very last page.  And the very last page has a great surprise that has me anxious to read the next installment.  If you haven't read this series- you have to run out to the store & buy them all, this is an excellent series that's a lot of fun.  Enjoy!	2005-01-31

However, as much as I love Koontz, this story was way too long!<br /><br />In this book you've got two lonely people who find each other, and find out they have similar pasts, each running away from something.  They get tangled up in a mess and are now running for their lives against a master force out to destroy them.  It's spooky, the characters are likeable, there's many great passages that provoke thought, you'll find yourself biting your nails until the end.<br /><br />My main complaint about this book is that the story is nearly 600 pages and I feel Koontz could have summed it up in 350-400.  The adventure is exciting, but at times it just drags out and you're ready for the end.  Anyway, I still enjoyed the story & found it to be in line with a lot of Koontz's older works.  Great book!	2005-01-26

After having read most of Koontz's catalogue 5-10 years ago, I've saved a few of his older works for later consumption & enjoyment.  Mr. Murder was one of those books, and pulling it out last week & reading it reminded me why I was such an avid fan of his!  There's nothing like \\"classic Koontz\\".<br /><br />Mr. Murder is about Martin Stillwater and his family.  The book opens as Martin begins to have a weird sense that something is going to happen to him.  And sure enough, it does!  Within a few days a dead-ringer for Martin walks into his home, claiming Martin stole his identity & then tries to kill Martin.  The majority of the book is Martin & his family which consists of a wife & two young girls, on the run from this being that claims to be Marty.  We also watch as \\"The Other\\" is getting closer & closer; and not too far behind him is people who are after him as well!<br /><br />The book was full of action & adventure.  And of course nail-biting suspense & curiosity of what will happen next.  The only thing that could be improved on would be the pace- I think the book could have moved a bit quicker- especially the ending.  As usual Koontz's characters take the cake, they make the book.  He has a special talent for creating likeable characters & getting the readers to really care about them.  Recommended!	2005-01-20

I think she was trying something new, but it didn't quite work as well as her other stories have.<br /><br />The story of a father & daughter begins when they find an abandoned baby in the snow.  As they get her to the hospital, are questioned by the police and wait to see if she'll live- we get a glimpse into their past and the tragedy they've endured.  I don't want to give anything else that happens away, but I will repeat what the book description says about a girl entering their lives afterwards and bringing change into it.<br /><br />The story was poetical at times, and the suspense kept me flipping the pages.  I did enjoy the characters and come to care what happened to them.  I do agree with one other reviewer who mentioned the book ended on a flat note- to which I also mostly agree.  However, the pages in between the first & the last were pretty satisfying- so I would recommend this book with the statement that it's not her best.  I'd whole-heartedly recommend: Fortunes Rocks, Eden Close, Weight of Water & Sea Glass.	2005-01-15

I mean sure- we're all waiting for the book that deals with Ariel's amnesia- where she finds out about her \\"past life\\".  But- that shouldn't stop us from enjoying the books that come before that.  That's IF the author ever writes another book for the series that is.  I certainly would like to read a final book about Ariel where she regains her memory!<br /><br />Once again Mercer takes on two mysteries in one book- One dealing with Ariels friend Laya who has been blinded by what appears to be a very dangerous person.  Of course Ariel steps in trying her help Laya figure out who is after her & catch this guy before he does further damage.  The second story deals with a mysterious letter Ariel receives from a friend- one she knew before her memory loss.  Here we see Ariel trying to dig up how she knew this woman and to get to the bottom of the meaning of this letter.<br /><br />I enjoyed both plots- but here again I felt that Mercer is not talented enough to handle both well.  I think perhaps trying one main plot might be best.  The ending was not one I figured out, but I guess many did.  The only thing with Mercer's endings is even though I don't guess them- they often leave me a bit disappointed.  Like her explanations were a bit flimsy or cheap.  It's the character of Ariel though that kept me reading the series.  Overall I did enjoy the 4 books- even if they weren't the best I've read.	2005-01-10

And like a previous reviewer said, Mercer struck Gold!<br /><br />Whenever we meet Ariel Gold (TV producer turned host) she is in the middle of solving a crime or two. This book is no different- only this time it seems she may have been taken in by the criminal- or not- was he wrongly accused?  While friends & family can only sit by as Ariel seems to get more & more wrapped up at finding the killer.  Only, it may not be who she thinks it is and her very life may be in danger.<br /><br />I felt like Mercer really found her voice with this third book in the series and became a much better writer over-all.  The story is very tight, easy to follow, characters developed and the suspense is enough to drive you crazy!!  The only thing that disappointed me was that I'm still waiting to learn more about Ariel's amnesia & her life beforehand.  I'm hoping the 4th book- Blind Spot- may deal with that.	2005-01-05

I expect a bit of amature while reading the first book from an author, but I was hoping the second would get a bit more honed.  I felt that both books were a bit sloppy and not yet up to par with other writers in the field.  However, both books did keep me reading til the end, and especially after DT, Ariel is starting to grow on me.<br /><br />Double Take picks up where Fast Forward left off: Ariel is getting to know her grandfather, and her newest problem is that people keep mistaking her for her dead twin sister.  Just as she's trying to get away and relax, she finds herself in the middle of a mystery.  An old friend of the family has committed suicide, or so it seems.  While Ariel is investingating what has happened; her friend Henry is back home watching her dogs and uncovering a mystery himself.  The book moves with a slow pace at times, and as you get to the end of the book you're ready for the conclusion and to know both \\"who dun-it's\\".<br /><br />Mercer's characters and plots are interesting and worthwhile, it just seems she doesn't quite know how to impliment them.  One of the things that irked me while reading the book is the way she goes from scene to scene- often she starts a chapter at the end of what happened & goes back to tell what we missed.  This gets to be quite annoying.  She also seems to jump around a bit, which makes it hard to follow what's going on.  However, even with these flaws, the book was still a decent read.  I do plan on reading the next book- Split Image.  Make your own opinions from there.	2005-01-01

At just over 330 pages it seems we wait forever through mysterious discoveries, budding friendships, interesting personal revelations until the end.  Just when I was starting to get antsy for the end, the story really pulled me in & finished strong.<br /><br />I am looking forward to reading the next novel in this series, and I'm betting I will even enjoy it a bit more than this one- as some of this book got tedius with character development that might not boggle down the next book.	2004-12-27

It was a book I searched high & low for, and finally got a copy of.  It was pretty much what I was expecting from the few comments I'd read- a mystery novel that was not spectacular, but decent.<br /><br />This book is about 4 college roommates who are now graduated and living on their own.  One is married, others are executives and one has not been quite as successful as the others- working at a Hallmark.  When the book opens we meet Lisa, the narrator, and she's reading a newspaper article to her college friend Melanie about their mutual roommate Penny who has been murdered.  The shocking part is that Penny was recently married, has a high-powered job as a Brand Manager, everything seemed to be going right for her: But then why was she found dead in a Drug Dealer's apartment, with naked pictures of her taken?<br /><br />We watch as the cops investigate, interviewing Penny's friends & family.  And we also watch the 3 roommates left behind deal with her death, all of the questions surrounding it and the scandal it's brought about.  But surprisingly, the death toll does not stop with Penny, another friend will soon be murdered, which leaves more questions than ever.<br /><br />Overall I did enjoy this book.  I am a huge fan of Bohjalian, I've loved each of his other novels.  This one, is probably my least favorite, but none the less I enjoyed the characters and the story.  The ending was almost predictable, but I would be lying if I didn't say it still surprised me a bit.  What I most enjoyed was that there were several occasions that the scene was so tense that I was flipping through pages quickly to see what would happen next.  Additionally, some scenes were so scary, that I was biting my nails.<br /><br />I would recommend this book, mainly to Bohjalian hard-core fans.  I was glad I made the effort to find the book & read it.  If you're not so into him, I'd recommend something else of his such as The Buffalo Soldier, Water Witches or Past the Bleachers.  I actually read his preceeding book to this first, HangMan, which was Bohjalian's only other mystery novel- and without a doubt, if you haven't read that you need to!!  It was one of the best mysteries I've ever read (and I've read a lot!), a Killing in the Real World was his practice shot.such as The Buffalo Soldier, Water Witches or Past the Bleachers.

While this may not have been Grisham's most original or exciting novel, I happened to enjoy it.<br /><br />The plot is simple: Two brothers are summoned to their father's house, to discuss his will and dying wishes.  But when they get there he's dead, and there's over 3 million dollars hidden throughout the house in shoe boxes...Ray, the eldest finds the money, doesn't tell his brother & begins trying to figure out where it came from when he begins getting threats to hand it over.  The question is who knows about it, and where did it come from.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book, it was a quick read at just under 400 pages.  The quiet suspense of where the money came from and what would happen to the brothers kept me turning the pages.  I thought the characters were also likable and fun.  I venture to say that most Grisham readers would like this book, but not as much as his \\"classics\\" like The Firm or Time to Kill.	2004-12-18

Will the wishes come true?  Will there be a happy ending for these love-birds?<br /><br />I won't spoil the ending for you, but I will say: you'll either hate it or be ambiguous towards it.  However, I can always appreciate it when an author takes a chance.  And this book did that, I truly enjoyed the story & the characters.	2004-12-16

The characters lack depth, and are as boring & one dimensional as a piece of cardboard paper!<br /><br />Angels & Demons has a phenomial plot- explosive substance has been planted in the Vatican, while they are choosing a new Pope after the other has just passed away.  With 75 Cardinals, some of the world's most famous & valuable historical monuments and with half the world watching- you're in for a rollercoaster of a ride!  Would make an excellent movie.  It's non-stop excitement.  Twists & Turns.  Over all enjoyed the story.<br /><br />But here's the nitty gritty:  While I like Angels & Demons better than the DaVinci Code...I still couldn't find myself liking or caring about Langdon.  BUT- this book did at least give us background on Langdon, much more than the DC.  Furthermore, I agree with the reviewer who said this book was a bit lengthy.  Even through the excitement- you had to wonder when the final ending was coming.  Overall, I don't think I'd recommend any of Dan Brown's books- while they were enjoyable, they do not make me want to pick up more of his books.  I only read this one because a friend gave it to me.  Also, both of the books I've read of his- the plot's are carbon copies of each other! It wasn't a waste of time, I was just a bit disappointed.	2004-12-13

From beginning to end; it's unique & mysterious.  These qualities keep you reading up until the most suspenseful page of all- the last.  However, the last page leaves something to be desired.<br /><br />At times this tale that is woven for a baby of a sister, is hard to grasp.  Other times things seem to come into focus.  Through out all of the stories of sisters, brothers, mothers & fathers, the ending is looming and is what the reader anxiously awaits- in order to get some clarification on events.  Unfortunately, I felt that clarification never did come.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book, but was extremely dissapointed with the ending.  I felt like I was left hanging, waiting for answers that never came.  I don't think I would recommend this book to anyone.  The only reason I gave it three stars was because I did enjoy the stories so much and the suspense.  But overall whatever the author was trying to pull off did not work for this reader.	2004-12-07

It took me years to finally get around to reading this Oprah book, but I'm glad that I finally did!<br /><br />The story of a preacher, his wife and 4 daughters ministering in Congo- The Poisonwood Bible is a fascinating read.  Seeing life from not just one person's point of view- but 5 pov's- gave this book it's movement and life.  The stories woven throughout, the experiences, are unforgettable.  You come to care for each person as they are going through the most trying and difficult experiences- trying to survive in a foreign country so different from their own.  And also during a time of much strife in Congo alone.<br /><br />I'd certainly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in not just a novel of life experience, but also of history.  The words are woven together not un-poetically and this makes a novel of over 500 pages hard to put down.	2004-12-06

Taking on vegetarians, vegans and gun control, this book tackels a lot of topics and does so with finess.<br /><br />Underneath all of the central topics, as in most of his books, family and relationships are at the heart of this book.  And what tragedy or difference can do to a family, a relationship.  What I enjoyed about the book was that Bohjalian did not clearly make a stance on whether he thought hunting was wrong, or that people should not eat meat.  Although, it was obvious that gun control, and learning how to properly care for a gun was foremost in his mind.<br /><br />Overall, another great book by Bohjalian!  I enjoyed the characters and their development.  I especially enjoyed the ending which was well worth the wait and truly made the entire book for me.  If you're new to his writing- I think once you read this you'll do what I did and devour his entire catalogue!  Happy Reading!	2004-11-27

Then again, supernatural stuff usually isn't for me- I just don't enjoy it.  Of course, I always try, but it always seems so silly and fake.  Which is kind of how this story came off.<br /><br />The story is about a group of children that were genetically engineered to be half bird, half human.  Their lives are in danger, along with the two people who discovered them in the previous book and became like mentors.  Together they try to figure out why a certain doctor who owns a underground medical facility is after them, and to uncover what's going on at that facility.  The characters are weak, as is the story and the ending.<br /><br />While I love James Patterson's other novels like Kiss the Girls and Along Came a Spider- the Lake House has got to be one of his worst.  I'd recommend skipping this one.  In fact, if I'd read the reviews here BEFORE I started reading the book, I would have skipped it myself!  At least it was a very quick read at under 400 pages with very short chapters.	2004-11-24

While I LOVE Luanne Rice and her writing ability, her wonderful characters and memorable backdrops; Silver Bells was disappointing.<br /><br />The story of a man who's wife died a few years prior, and now his son has run away while in New York...leaves something to be desired.  While the descriptions of the stars and the nature all around us- and the specialness of Christmas time is excellent; the characters leave something to be desired.  I had a hard time really getting into the story and the characters, which usually comes very natural for me with a Rice novel.  While I did care what happened to see if Christy would ever find love, if Catherine would ever stop mourning her husband, and if the brother & sister would ever be reunited- something was missing.<br /><br />I DID enjoy the ending though.  Maybe it was just too early for a Christmas story for me.  I don't know...but I do hope her next book goes back to her old formula's.	2004-11-23

While the book started out very slow for me- trying to become acquainted & care about the character of Trudi, a dwarf.  I found the first 150 pages long and a bit boring.  However, once the story got going, I was very glad I finished it.<br /><br />The plot of the book is a bit hard to describe in simple terms.  Basically it's the story of Trudi's life: her childhood, her relationship with her parents, her struggles with her size, her difficulty in making friends, and what her life became when WWII came about.  I very much enjoyed when the book came to the central plot which was life during WWII in Germany among both the Germans & Jews.  When the ending of the book came about, after nearly 525 pages, I felt like I'd read something of a epic.<br /><br />I will warn readers that there are a lot of characters in the book, and especially in the beginning I wished I'd made a list of who's who.  Mainly because of the German names (Mr. & Mrs.) which made it difficult at first to follow if you didn't know.  One other greivance was that in the first 100 or so pages it annoyed me greatly that Trudi was only 3, 4, 5 and she literally spoke and thought like a 20 year old.  It was quite the irritant.  Ms. Hegi really should have edited that part that make it fit a child's mind.  Overall though, I am glad I stuck it out and did enjoy the journey back in time with vivid characters & lives.	2004-11-14

With a similar formula of the Shopacholic series, Sophie Kinsella comes up with a new character who steals our hearts from page 1!<br /><br />Emma Corrigan is an average girl, 20-something who's trying to find her path in life.  I think she's someone most of us can relate to with job woes, boyfriend woes, family issues etc.  The best part of Emma is that she's honest, and funny.  The things she says, the things she does and the way she thinks has you almost laughing outloud!  The whole story you're hoping, waiting for something to go right for her, and for her to get her happy ending.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the story of Emma.  Nearly as much as our beloved Shopaholic Queen.  I think Kinsella managed to create another winning character and I wouldn't mind a sequel to this at all!  For a quick read over the weekend, a pick-me-up or something to read in between those more heavy novels- Sophie Kinsella's books do the trick!	2004-11-08

However, I knew that some of the things discussed in it were based on true things, or things some people believe.  With those things in mind- I enjoyed the book very much!<br /><br />The basic plot was about Sophie and Robert, two people that fate threw together who were now on the run from the police and on a search for the Holy Grail.  Secrets abound!!  People are not who they seem!  Interesting theory after theory is discussed as these two race across Europe to avoid being not only losing the secret of the Grail and find out it's true meaning- but to avoid being murdered.<br /><br />The book was quite fast paced, with short chapters- which I liked.  I also began to like the characters in the book and began to wonder how it would end- would they find out the secret of the Grail?  With many twists and turns up until the very end, this book kept me on the edge of my seat.  It was worth the read, and it certainly made me think about my religion in a different light.  Again- if you go into reading this book with the mind-set that this is fiction, I think you'll enjoy it as you would any fiction mystery or suspense novel.	2004-11-05

And this story I enjoyed!  It had me on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next, who was the killer.  It gave me goosebumps picturing the gruesome murders that were taking place.  I even found myself liking the characters and caring about what would happen with them.<br /><br />If you enjoy suspense or thrillers, I'd recommend this book to you.	2004-11-01

I guess I was expecting it to live up the first two books which I found refreshingly comical.  Unfortunately, Ties the Knot, was one long storyline drawn out, and it wasn't very funny!<br /><br />In this book we see Becky engaged to Luke and planning their wedding.  Instead of the funny scenes I was expecting, perhaps similar to Father of the Bride with experiences trying to find the right dress, interviewing DJ's and photographers...We found Becky with pretty much one big problem, where to have the wedding.  She's got both families planning, and like her usual self, she waits to the last minute to sort things out.<br /><br />Part of the reason I enjoyed the other books so much was that there was funny scene after scene.  Even her internal dialogue left me giggling.  However, in this book, maybe it was just too played out- as I read all 3 books in a row.  Or maybe it was that this book was lacking in humor all together.  We found much more serious scenes really...But what got on my nerves the most was that from about page 50 to page 300 we were waiting for Becky to make one big decision.  It got dull quick, I just wanted a resolution & was hoping for more things to take place.  If you're a fan, I think you'll agree this was the worst of the 3 books, but I suppose it was worth the read.  I'm hoping the next book is much better!	2004-10-28

Again- with her classic formula of non-stop hilarious situations, this book began with a bang!<br /><br />Her family doesn't believe she's really dating millionaire Luke, her next door neighbors think she's out to ruin their son's wedding day, arriving on holiday without her luggage, sneaking off to go shopping...Becky Bloomwood is up to her old antics again!  In this book we see her in Manhattan with boyfriend Luke, the city of possibilities.  But will her dreams come true, or will her bad spending habit get in the way?<br /><br />I'd recommend this series to anyone who enjoys a good girls story, a fun light read.  With characters that are unforgettable, and situations that make you laugh outloud, you'll tear through this book and be ready for the 3rd in the series.	2004-10-23

I have read few books in my life that have made me laugh outloud as Confessions of a Shopaholic did.  With funny situation on top of funny situation- this book was a non-stop joyride!<br /><br />Becky Bloomwood is the girl next door, the one who is a bit silly, a bit unlucky, but she tries hard.  She's like many of us, in a job we may not enjoy, but she has her hobbies to keep her going- shopping!  We enter her life in the stage of the mid-twenties, and like most of us, she's just finding her way, one mistake at a time.  And in a universal subject- shopping and debt, this story is one I think many people can relate to.  However, under the humor and the spending, the story of an average girl, a nice girl, is one we're all rooting for.<br /><br />I have to say, I LOVED this book!  I loved all of the characters as well.  In fact, I think I loved every single situation in this book, not once was I bored.  I do a lot of reading, and of course I do consider this book a bit of \\"candy\\", however, I'm so happy I gave this series a chance!  I can't wait to see if there's a movie on the horizon.	2004-10-23

Right from the very beginning, the \\"voice\\" of the little girl pulled me in.  I wanted to know what happened to her baby sister, what happened to her father, grandfather...what would become of her friendship with \\"the old man\\".<br /><br />We find Clara winter, our narrator, a very unique 11 year old.  Her thoughts and actions are really more that of a 18 year old.  However for me, I didn't mind, I just accepted this and read on.  Clara is a girl who is questioning life.  She wants to know what happened to her twin sister who died at birth, what the real story was.  She tries to get her mother to give her answers on that & other subjects, most of the time to no avail.  So she develops a friendship with an older neighbor and this seems to give her a bit of an outlet and she begins making up stories about her families life, and his life.<br /><br />This book is unique in that it takes you on a journey, and you're not sure where this is leading a lot of the time.  You want answers, the answers Clara is seeking, and you wonder if you'll ever get them.  Or if you'll ever find out why Clara is the way she is.  Over-all I enjoyed the \\"journey\\", I'm still left with a few questions...but this is definitely a book I won't forget any time soon!	2004-10-20

We get to see them before the diagnosis, and after.  We get to see her point of view, and can vividly imagine his.  Most of all, we see a different type of love story.  I'm hesitant to call it JUST a love story, but especially the first half, you can't ignore the romantic side amidst the tragedy.<br /><br />Over-all I loved the book.  It was a quick read at only 300 pages- perfect length for the story told.  I enjoyed the characters, who I did NOT feel were stereotypical at all- and I read constantly.  The only thing I would have liked to see more of was relationships with other people developed more.  We got to see the couple, Eric & Alex, we met their parents, siblings, friends- but we didn't really get to know the other people.  However, the vivid descriptions of feelings and surroundings made up for what was lacking.  There were sentences & paragraphs I felt like highlighting, they moved or touched me so.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this book to someone.  Although, if you're not comfortable with AIDS, as some reviewers didn't seem to be, this might be a book to skip.	2004-10-16

After looking at the cover & reading the description on the back I expected a book about friendship and relationships.  I also had an inkling that religion would be featured in this book.  This did not bother me, as I'm semi-religious.  But if you're someone who isn't open/comfortable to talk/read on religion, as I can see by past readers comments, I'd say this book wouldn't be for you.<br /><br />I was right on target on what the book was to be about.  I thoroughly enjoyed peeking in on these 5 ladies lives as they were each struggling with something- whether it be a marriage, a job, financial status or religion.  I thought the subject of religion was tame enough- I don't think it would offend most people.  It was a change of pace for sure to read a book that in a way gave advice to the reader about how to handle the situations in their lives from a religious perspective.  It was in a way motivational and inspiring- since the difficulties these ladies faced, many of us also face.  If nothing else- I think the religion perspective written about will make the reader think.<br /><br />I enjoyed each of the characters and their personal stories.  I'd recommend this book, again, as long as your open to religion discussion and if you enjoy reading about women's friendships.  Nice novel for a first-time author!	2004-10-15

Even though the topics and themes in The Good Earth are basic, the reading is enjoyable.<br /><br />A story of a man and his life of farming is the basis for this book.  But his relationships with his father, wife, children, neighbors, and extended family are really the back bone of the book.  Work-ethic, pride, love, strength, perservernce,  ingenuity, loyalty...these emotions are all explored in this book.  And each is done with finess.  I also quite enjoyed learning a bit more about life in China in the early 1900's.  It was all so interesting!<br /><br />Overall I loved the book!  Again, even though the topics might sound ordinary, the characters and the obstacles in their lives keep you interested and reading.  I think it can also be said that a lesson or two might be learned!	2004-10-10

I've only read one other book by Delinsky- Coast Road- and now Lake News, both have proven to be great books and keep me coming back for more!  And not only are they good books, but they also have great stories inside of them.<br /><br />Lake News is about Lily, whom the press has attacked recently for a scandal involving the church.  Frustrated, outcast, and not having anywhere else to turn to hide, she returns to her small home town to try and recover, get things together.  It's here that she reunites with an old acquaintance, who happens to work for the local newspaper with a past of his own.  She's also reunited with her mother whom she has had a rocky relationship with in the past, now, made even more rocky be recent events.  This book is about coming home and learning how to put the past behind you.  It's about learning to trust people again, after they've betrayed or disappointed you.  It's about finding strength within yourself to handle all that life throws at you.  And it's about learning to appreciate the small things in life, like the nature that surrounds us, but that we often take for granted.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book and the characters.  It was a quick, fun read with an ending I was pleased with.  If you haven't read Barbara Delinsky before I highly recommend you check her out!	2004-10-06

At first I was putting off reading this book- I'd heard so much over the years about how Tolstoy is such a difficult author, how his books drag on and you'd need to be a Harvard grad to \\"get him\\" etc.  Well, I'm happy to say that none of the above is the case with Anna Karenina!  I'm an avid reader, not a Harvard grad, but I had no problem comprehending this book or it's characters.<br /><br />The story itself is amazingly not just about Anna- and her struggle as a woman in Russia during the 1800's.  It's also about certain family members and friends and the things they experience in their life.  There's really no quick way to sum up what this story is about- other than to say it's a portrait of life for men/women in Russia during the 1800's.  A time of war, of social struggle & change...It's about love, death, betrayal, forgiveness, intellect, faith, religion, government, having the courage to question the meaning of life...Tolstoy takes us into the minds of each of his characters and what they are struggling with personally.  It's a very fine story with profound concepts he tries to get across to his readers.<br /><br />Anna Karenina is a huge story- it's a lot to take in, I'll say that for sure.  However, if you have the time to dedicate to reading 800+ pages and either the Oprah book mark with the characters names or a decent memory- you'll be in fine shape!  Honestly, the bookmark came in handy, but the characters were not all that overwhelming- the hardest part is that Tolstoy has several different nick-names for each character- so that keeps you on your toes at times.  I will say that I can see why many readers get discouraged in the political dialogue that sometimes takes over the story- but I can also say I found it interesting.

There's many twists and turns along the way, and you'll enjoy each!<br /><br />The book really is just a story of a group of people trying to make it in ND in the early 1900's- after WWI.  Each character is memorable, unique and comes to life before your eyes.  The ending won't leave you disappointed.<br /><br />Overall I did enjoy the story.  It was SO involved though, I almost feel like I can't pick one thing the story was about- or one person.  The weirdest thing is that the title is a bit misleading, not until the last 50 pages does the author mention much about the \\"singing club\\".  Nor is Fidelis really the \\"main character\\"- I felt there really was none.  This is the first I've read by this author, this book does not compell me to read more, but I'm glad I read it.	2004-09-21

I was expecting a marvel of a book based on some of the reviews here; but found I related a bit more to those who were confused about why this book was so special.  And let me say as an avid reader I have read many books I'd consider masterpieces- and I know they do not come in all one form.  However, I felt whatever Julia Glass was trying to do when creating her \\"work of art\\", escaped me.<br /><br />The book is divided into 3 parts- 3 Junes.  The first is a summer vacation that Fenno's dad- Paul- decides to take where he is with a group of travelers all trying to connect.  He is reliving his past life- his marriage to his deceased wife, while also intrigued with his present situation and companions.  These first 60 pages let me down the most, I had a hard time getting into the story and enjoying it.<br /><br />The second part of the book featured Paul's family- including the 3 sons- dealing with their parents deaths and the things going on in their own lives.  Fenno, the eldest son is the centerpiece- as we see his life lived out through memories of his past and through the present.  I found his relationships very interesting, but also lacking in really getting to know some of the characters- and understanding them.  Towards the middle of this part the book picked up.<br /><br />The final part features Fern, a woman that Paul met on his travels and became fascenated with.  We see her now as more of an individual and the things she has gone through in the years since she met Paul.  In her present- she's become acquainted with Fenno.  I found this part of the book the most interesting.  I think it was because I finally felt like I was beginning to know some of the characters.<br /><br />Over-all, if I could go back, I don't think I'd bother to have read this book.  While it had redeeming qualities, I don't think it fully outweighed the rest of the negatives- I felt some of the writing very sloppy.  Also, I agree with the other reviewer that the ending leaves you short-changed.  I will say though that there were some very poetic paragraphs included, several things that did make me think.  I guess I'm half and half with this book!ery sloppy.  Also, I agree with the other reviewer that the ending leaves you short-changed.

It wasn't my favorite of hers, but better than a few of her older books.<br /><br />I'm always excited to read a new Luanne Rice book, as they always inspire me.  However, it has started to strike me how similar they are becoming.  I think perhaps a bit of a new direction is needed.  Regardless of the similar pattern of the love story, the details are worth it.<br /><br />I enjoyed the story of the friendship between the 3 original beach girls.  I loved the description of the scenery in the beach town.  The story of loss, betrayal and forgiveness kept me reading on, when towards the middle the momentum seemed to slow down...But the ending was redeeming.  If you like Luanne Rice, or you enjoy stories of love/frienship conquering all, this book is for you!	2004-09-07

However, this book was a disappointment to me.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting any great literature novel, I was anticipating a light, fun read.  But after I finished, I was left feeling tricked.  In no way did this book live up to the hype of how wonderful, innovative or edgy it was said to be.  What this book is, is a mediocre story of a nanny.  With no backbone.  Working for an upper-class family who treats her like a slave.<br /><br />While there was a bit of humor and shock value through-out the story, it just wasn't enough to save it.  And while the relationship between the nanny and the little boy is endearing, it wasn't anything spectacular.  The authors tried to inject the story with a little romance, however that failed as well.  It was barely developed.  Each of these things helped save the book from being a total disaster, but didn't do nearly what this book needed to make it a must-read or even barely memorable.<br /><br />To sum it up:  a very mundane, plain story that anyone could have written.	2004-09-03

Now, still handcuffed to the bed and her husband dead on the floor while the keys to the cuffs are across the room...what can she do to escape?  What won't she do?<br /><br />Terrorized by her past memories as much as her current reality- this woman is in for the most frightening experience of her life- if she can survive.  And like any King book, anything CAN happen WILL happen to prevent that.  As suspenseful as climbing a flight of stairs when you don't know what's at the landing above to push you back down, this novel has your heart racing.  It only took me 2 days to complete, I was that engrossed.<br /><br />This is now near the top of my favorite King's book list!	2004-08-30

If you're expecting a horror story, take that out of your mind.  You won't find any supernatural things going on in this book.<br /><br />DC is told in first person by Dolores herself as she sits at the county police station as she's being questioned in the death of her employer, Vera.  Vera's death looks like a murder to the police, with Dolores as their main suspect.  Not to mention the fact that Dolores is well known around town for supposedly killing her late husband.  In this book Dolores tells us her side of both stories in a way that is very page-turning and suspenseful.  You wouldn't think that one confession could fill up nearly 400 pages, but this one does and there's not really one boring moment.<br /><br />What propels this story is the anticipation to see what is going to happen next.  That, and the VIVID story that Dolores weaves with such detail and humor.  I really enjoyed the book and now I'm on to Gerald's Game, which is kind of a sister to this book.  Even if you're not a big King fan, I'm sure any mystery reader will enjoy this book!	2004-08-26

However, in this book, it didn't seem that good won out.  We did however get a good look into the life of grandmother Culter who we met in the first two Cutler novels and get some back ground on her life.  Why she became who she was...<br /><br />It was a very good read, giving us readers a chance to actually get to like grandmother Cutler- who we all hated previously.  There are moments in this novel that are so horrifying, you will be shocked.  The whole time I was reading, I just wanted to get to the end and reach the conclusion I was waiting for.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed the Cutler series.  I'd recommend it to teenagers and adults alike, if you like a good juicy, fun read.	2004-08-20

It was also fun to see \\"new\\" characters take on the evil role.  However, something just didn't click for me in this book as it did in the others.  Maybe it was just that Dawn wasn't present for most of the book.<br /><br />I'd recommend this series though as a whole if you enjoy VC Andrews or if you enjoy books of this genre.	2004-08-16

VC Andrews may be no literary genius, but just try to put down one of her books.

And as each secret or development is revealed, you'll be shocked.  If you've read other VC Andrews books, I'd give this series a chance, starting with Dawn.  Or, if you like books with deceit, surprises and family struggles, I think you'll enjoy VC Andrews.	2004-08-16

What better than a VC Andrews book to get you to fall in love with the unlucky heroine and despise her cruel tormentors?  Plus shocking secrets and revalations galore!<br /><br />This is the 2nd book in the Cutler series, featuring Dawn.  Here we find her trying to cope with her new family, who doesn't exactly welcome her into their lives with open arms.  But she also gets a chance to go to a special school and make some extrodinary friends and some speical memories.  Of course, her happiness is shortlived...<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book.  VC Andrews books are a bit of a guilty pleasure for me, since I'm in my 20's, but as you get into the books, you're so swept up you don't even notice!  Liked the book, it packed a few surprising punches and left me itching to read the next in the series...	2004-08-08

I have never forgotten the magic of Flowers in the Attic.  The Cutler series has been on my book shelf for years needless to say, and finally I've decided to pick it up.  And so far I'm pleased that I did!<br /><br />Dawn is the first in the 5 book series and a decent start.  The story is a little slow at first, but picks up quickly towards the middle and end with many shocking secrets revealed.  As we meet Dawn she's a 14 year old from a poor family who due to a new job her dad received now has the opportunity to go to a private school.  This foreshadows what her life is about to turn into down the road and is kind of a transitional phase between her poor life full of struggles to her new life full of opportunity and the unknown.  You won't be able to guess where her life takes her...<br /><br />I would of course recommend this book more to teens than to adults, even though I am an adult who did enjoy this guilty pleasure and easy read.  VC Andrews is famous for writing detailed stories that pull you into her web and this series appears it's no different, I'm already half way through the next book Secrets of the Morning.	2004-08-05

I don't know, maybe it's me- but A Time to Kill is one of my favorite movies and one that I've watched often- which made reading this book a bit tedious.  I kept comparing it to the movie, picturing scenes from it, but when I was finally able to get beyond that- I did enjoy the book- one that I've always been meaning to read.<br /><br />If you don't know, the story takes place in rural Mississippi where a 10 year old black girl is brutally raped and tortured.  She survives, but the event was too much for her father- who took a gun and shot and killed the two boys who did that to her.  Now, he's on trial for his life, facing the gas chamber.  And while many juries might be sympathetic to his ordeal, where the racial lines are drawn, it's not easy for a white jury to sympathize with a black man who has just killed their own...<br /><br />Overall I did enjoy the book.  The last 200 pages really picked up the pace, while the first 200 or so dragged a bit for me.  As the forward by Grisham says, he does ramble a bit, but some of his description and story are priceless.  The overall theme of the book is commendable and unforgettable.	2004-08-01

An older one of Grisham's collection, showcases his true talent for writing suspenseful stories.<br /><br />The Chamber is about Sam Cayhall who is on deathrow for a bombing he took part in 30 years prior- when he was a part of the KKK.  Now, in the early 90's, his grandson has become obsessed with trying to save his life and uncover the truth about who his family is really made up of.<br /><br />The book kept me interested from cover to cover.  I noticed some people did not enjoy so much of the legal stuff, but I found it quite interesting and very easy to follow.  I will admit the character of Sam is a hard one to grasp, you hate him for the crime he committed, yet the book is written so well, you can't help but feel for his fear at being put to death.  It also raises a lot of questions on whether legalized killing should be allowed.	2004-07-23

I'd read Tara Road as a part of the Oprah book club several years back, and I'd always wanted to read more.  Well, I finally got around to it and was satisfied.<br />The story starts out with two girls, ages 10.  Their mothers were friends when they were little, but now with one family in Ireland and the other in London, they aren't as close anymore.  That is, until the war forces one mother to ask if her daughter can live in Ireland until the war is over.  That's where the friendship of the two little girls begins.  The novel spans approximately the next 20 years of their lives.  The ups and downs.<br />I enjoyed the book, I suppose mostly because of the fascenation I had with the friendship the two girls shared.  Binchy also throws in twists and turns along the way that keep you interested to know what will happen next.  Great book!	2004-07-19

Here, he's paired together with Rachel who worked on the original Poet case, trying to catch The Poet once and for all.  The story is certainly interesting reading, with each of the main characters technically not supposed to be working the case.  Plus, just the suspense and dynamic of the famous killer who got away adds to this story.<br />As all of the previous books, I enjoyed this one.  Connelly books always fly by for me, they're hard to put down.  And the character of Bosch is probably my most favorite character in all of fiction.  I always have a hard time waiting for the next novel to see what is new with Harry!  This is definitely a book I recommend.  I would also recommend though if you have not read Connelly before, to start with the first book in the Bosch series, it takes a while to complete, but I think it's worth it- to watch Harry's life and cases unfold in chronological order.	2004-07-02

If you're like me and have read every one of her newer books, and enjoyed them all tremendously and you're looking for more...her earlier works are worth reading.  Obviously with the knowledge in your mind that usually an author's earlier works are not as polished.  Now that I have read ALL of her books, I can say I did enjoy her earlier works, although not as much as her newer.<br />This book is almost like an anatomy of a marriage.  We see the things that can drive people crazy, the feelings they don't talk about, the things they keep inside.  It's also an anatomy of a family, it's structure and the roles each person fufills.  While the marriage of Georgie and Nick is at the center of this book and we watch the two try to keep their marriage close while Nick works ungodly hours- it's about so much more.  It's about Georgie trying to find a bit of her own independence and her beginning to examine what is it that drives her to be a jealous, worrysome person.  It's about the tight-knit relationships she has with her sister, mother and senile grandmother.  At the heart of the book you have a woman searching to find peace and happiness within herself.<br />Again, I did enjoy this book.  The beginning was a bit slow, however the story and the character development really picked up about half way through the novel.  I am glad that I've had a chance to read all of Rice's books, seeing how she really polished her writing ability into the dynamite author she is now. If you haven't read anything by her before, I would recommend starting at one of her newer books like Dream Country, Perfect Summer or True Blue.	2004-06-28

If it doesn't have Harry in it, it usually doesn't have the same spark.  However, The Poet definitely had a spark!<br />The book is about what appears to be a serial killer, murdering innocent citizens and then moving on to the homicide cop investigating the case.  Throughout the whole book you don't know if it's one killer or two, why they're doing it or where they'll strike next.  With the twin brother of one of the murdered cops investigating and the FBI's help, the search is on.<br />This story is a thriller.  I find some of the reviews saying that the ending was predictable or that the killer/s were, but I find that hard to believe.  I've been reading mysteries and thrillers for about 20 years, and this one came as a shock to me!  That doesn't happen much.  Anyway, I found the characters very likable and the story exciting, hard to put down.  I'd recommend this book to anyone.  It's now one of my favorite Connelly's and I can't wait to start on The Narrows!	2004-06-24

This is quite rare, so this book is a valuable find.<br />Here we have the diary of Bridget Jones, a 30 year old who is still single, not happy with her job or her weight.  She's someone a lot of us can relate to- and that's what makes this book so compelling and likable.  We watch her try to quit smoking, cut down on drinking, try to stop obsessing over a crush and lose weight. But whether she's winning or losing the battle, she keeps on (even with a sense of humor), giving us something to admire her for.<br />I actually enjoyed the movie a bit more than the book.  But if you liked the movie, I think the book is worth reading.  It won't blow you away, but you'll enjoy it.	2004-06-21

I've enjoyed them all, but of course the older books aren't as &quot;polished&quot;.<br />Secrets of Paris is like an anatomy of a marriage.  We see two people who are going through a rough transitional time in their lives, and trying to get through it and stay together.  They thought moving to Paris for a year might help, but of course it brings about new issues as well.  This couple makes friends, move forward in their careers, but will they make progress in their marriage?<br />Again, this is not Rice's best work.  I did however enjoy the story and characters.  I cared about them and what would happen.  To me, that's a good story.  If you haven't read Luanne Rice before, I would recommend some of her newer novels first though- like Cloud 9, Firefly Beach and Safe Harbor.	2004-06-14

Maybe that's just my bias though...Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy this novel, just not to the same extent.  It just felt like it was missing the magic.<br />In this book Henry Pierce is a chemist who owns a computer technology company that is working on a modern day innovation to the computer world that would have huge consequence.  In the midst of his life-changing discovery, his longtime girlfriend leaves him, putting him in a bit of a tailspin.  Always being a workaholic, but now knowing he has noone to come home to beings to affect him.  This makes him react to a random wrong number to his phone in a very odd way.  Suddenly he's getting wrong numbers in the multitudes for a girl named Lilly, who is obviously a hooker.  Finding the mystery of who is Lilly and what has happened to her irresistable, before he knows it Henry is tangled up in a mess he may not be able to get out of alive.  Still, risking his career and company that he's worked his whole life for- is something he's willing to do.  It's an obsession.<br />I do agree with some of the other reviewers in asking the question WHY Henry puts everything on the line for this woman he has never met.  However, I do think the book goes at trying to explain that to some degree- whether you buy it or not.  I did enjoy the character of Henry, finding him fascenating.  And for at least over half of the book the story was pretty thrilling, keeping you wanting more.  However, there were a few slow periods, that I think could have been fixed with editing.  All in all, I'd say this book was worth the read, but if you really want to get into a great Connelly novel to also read Blood Work (the only non-Bosch book I truly enjoyed), Lost Light or The Last Coyote.  Really- any Bosch novel you pick you can't go wrong!	2004-06-11

I'm so glad I picked up this book on amazon, seeing as I couldn't find it anywhere else.<br />This story is not just about 1 marriage or two people.  This story is about all of those who become involved in the web of this families lives, the children, the lovers, the friends.  Even though you watch these characters make mistake after mistake, because of the great way the author has of putting us inside their heads, you LIKE them.  Even if you hate what they do.  Now that's amazing!<br />The Great Pretender was hard to put down.  On every page there was another part of one of the stories: Reggie who's the main pretender- juggling two women and 3 children, Tracy his wife of 18 years who has a secret of her own that she'd do anything to protect, Olivia their oldest daughter who thought she found love in a man- only to be betrayed, Valerie their youngest who is struggling with adolescene, sexuality and her parents, Renee who is the \\"other woman\\" and a bit unstable, Denise the child who has kept them together for 6 years, but suffering for it and Frank who is Reggies best friend who not only keeps Reggies secrets, but a few of his own, including his true feelings for Reggie.<br />I highly recommend this book.  It's well-worth the money spent.  I think not only do you enjoy the read, but you also learn a bit along the way.  Written very simply and eloquently, The Great Pretender is destined to be a hit and it's author Millenia Black to be a success!	2004-06-07

BUT- you like her.  You sympathize with her, you enjoy her.<br />Void Moon takes place in Las Vegas and is about Cassie Black, who was recently released from prison and who is now on parole for involuntary manslaughter. The death took place while she and her partner were robbing a man who had just won thousands, only to find that a crime they were veterans at, went awry.  Now, struggling between a &quot;normal&quot; life and the fast-paced exciting life of crime is where Cassie finds herself.  Then enters an offer to make money she's never known, in a crime that's taylored for her...but the gamble is huge- will she survive or ruin her life trying?<br />Void Moon is not my favorite of Connelly's, but I certainly enjoyed it.  It is fast-paced, and with a setting like Las Vegas, the tapestry is rich and filled with quirky and memorable characters.  Definitely be sure to check out other books by Connelly in his Harry Bosch series- including Angels Flight and A Darkness More Than Night.	2004-06-07

I always come here first to read reviews BEFORE reading a book...if you're doing so, be warned because several reviewers gave most of the story away!<br />So...on to the book.  After reading both of Nicholas Evan's other novels, this one was a bit disappointing.  However, I did enjoy it, it was written beautifully, it just didn't move or inspire me like The Loop or The Horse Whisperer.<br />Without giving too much away, this story is about Ed, Connor and Julia.  Ed and Connor are best friends and smoke jumpers in Montana together each summer.  One summer Ed brings his new girlfriend Julia along, as she's a counselor for troubled teens in a near-by camp.  What ensues is much adventure, as they all have jobs that lean towards the dangerous side.  After the summer fades, their lives all take very unpredictable turns, leading them each in their own direction.  Will they all stay friends, down these roads life leads them?<br />What I enjoyed most about this book was that the story was so unpredictable.  Evans did a good job of taking us down a path that was amazing as it was surprising.  Again, it's not my favorite of his, but he took a chance with something slightly different and did a pretty good job of it.	2004-06-01

And how sometimes to heal, you need to look within yourself and find the strength that you can't get from anyone but you.<br />I enjoy all of Nicholas Sparks' books.  This one is no different.  From page one I was glued to the story, I finished the book in 2 days.  As always, it was easy and fun reading.  In this book Miles and his son Jonah are still dealing with their wife/mother's death 2 years prior.  Two years might have passed, but the world of their grief has not. Until they finally meet someone who might be able to change all of that, Jonah's teacher Sarah, who is getting over a broken heart herself.  Mixed in with the romantic love story of these 3 people coming together to heal, the mystery of who killed Miles wife plays itself out.  Will they ever be able to be happy?<br />If you enjoy romance novels, you need to pick this one up.  Reading about some of the characters emotions put real tears on my face.  I'll admit- I did recognize who the &quot;killer&quot; was as soon as we were introduced to him, but that was probably a lucky guess for me.  Go get this book!	2004-05-25

Being a big fan of criminal thrillers, horror and suspenseful mystery books- I was hoping to find a new author to sink my teeth into.<br />Thin Dark Line was about a man that was acquitted for a stalking/murder that his whole town believe's he's guilty of.  We get to know the police force who after the trial is over, is outraged, along with the whole town- and everyone's on the edge.  But there are 2 cops more dedicated than all others, and while they try to get further evidence to convict the suspected killer- they put themselves in the middle of a web of deceit.  And put their own lives on the line, and maybe even fall in love.<br />I did for the most part enjoy this book, however it did not impress me to the point that I'm planning on reading any further Hoag books.  I might end up picking up another, maybe not.  I enjoyed the characters, the suspense and the ending that was unexpected.  What I found annoying though was how LONG this book was- with 600 pages- 200 could have easily been edited out.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not usually one to complain about the length of a book...it's just there seemed to just be way too much &quot;stuff&quot; in this book.  Unnecessary details, conversations and things going on.  I enjoy a great mystery, but I think what makes mysterys so exciting is that they stay to a length that is fast paced and only filled with necessary details- and I think this book went beyond that point.	2004-05-23

I read this book a few years ago and still vividly remember the haunting story of a saddistic killer...<br />This book got me hooked on Alex Cross, a detective I found very likable and whose life I became interested in.  In this book his niece is one of the victims he's trying to save from an insane psychopath that is abducting girls.  Alex is on a race against time to see if he can save her.<br />For those who say that the characters in this book are not believable, I totally disagree.  And as for the plot, I read approximately 100 books a year, and only remember the full plot of very few, and this is one of them-  That tells me the story is memorable.  It might not be deep-thinking, Pulitzer prize worthy, but most crime thrillers are not, that's not why people read them, they're for entertainment value.<br />After reading this I picked up every Patterson book I could find...and I'm still a fan today- if that's not a recommendation for you, I don't know what is!	2004-05-19

Jack &amp; Jill proves that James Patterson's previous success with the Alex Cross books are not flukes.  Patterson is a great writer and Cross is a fun character.<br />Trying to solve two crimes at once and see if they are in any way related- is no sweat for Alex Cross!  With two story lines going on at once, you won't be able to put this book down.  There's no shortage of suspense or excitement.  And the ending is always the best part.<br />If you have never read James Patterson and you enjoy crime thrillers, you need to give him a try!	2004-05-19

Again, another novel by James Patterson in the Alex Cross series that will get your attention- and not let go!<br />This is one of my favorites of Patterson's, having read it a few years ago it still sticks out in my mind as a fast-paced thriller.  And the more I read of Alex Cross, the more I like him.  With two mad-men out to get Cross, you can't guess what will happen in this book!  Never a dull moment.<br />If you're looking for a new author to try in the crime thriller genre, you should definitely add Patterson to your &quot;to-read&quot; list!	2004-05-19

This was my first by him, and it did seem a bit hard to get a handle on some things.<br />I did enjoy this book, but in trying to sum it up...I'm at a loss.  This book had SO much going on!!  There's a murder of a black man 40 years ago that is still unsolved and now his children are back in town to possibly resolve it...there are numerous criminals in and about town of a big stature creating a fuss...there are several local's who have issues of their own that need resolving...there's just SO much!  There are so many characters, that I had a very hard time keeping them and their pasts straight.  While I enjoyed some of the individual stories, it did get to be too much.  I felt this book could have used some heavy editing.<br />Over-all, I did enjoy this book.  It kept me on the edge of my seat to see how it would end and what all of the big cover-ups were.  One thing to note-pay close attention to everything, if you miss something, you'll miss a lot.	2004-05-16

He's quit his job, moved and not given any friends his forwarding address...he's in a deep depression trying to cope with his families demise.  That's when something strange starts to happen: people appear to be following him, a bizarre lady is at the graves of his family taking a picture and friends of his are committing suicide for no apparent reason.  He's in a race against time to figure out why he's being hunted, what this lady has to tell him and how this relates to the fatal plane crash a year prior.<br />One reviewer commented that they did not like the character of Joe, that he was whiny and annoying- for me, Joe was a likeable character and well-developed.  I think his feelings of loss were realistic- what do you expect after he just lost his entire family- to have moved on in 1 year's time?  I thoroughtly enjoyed Joe's ponderings and the deep-thought that was put into this character and his feelings put into words.  There were many sentences and paragraphs that I wanted to take a highlighter too, they seemed so profound.  I can't say the same for every Koontz book...<br />I'd recommend this book for Koontz fans.  I enjoyed every last bit of this book, up until the ending, which was not as exciting as I expected...but still worthwhile.	2004-05-14

I'm such a fan of Patterson's, I wanted to include my review.<br />In the first of the Alex Cross series, this story is a race against time to find a kidnapped girl of a famous actress.  Cross is called in to help, and in only the way he can, he finds his way to the end of this suspenseful ride.  Not only will you enjoy the writing which propells the suspense and mystery, but you'll also enjoy the character development.  It leaves you wanting more of Alex Cross, one of my most favorite detectives of all time!<br />I definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading thrillers.  I'll warn you though, like me, after you read this book, you'll be off to the store or library to pick up many more books by James Patterson.	2004-05-14

After hearing everyone's glowing reviews, and being so excited to start reading this book- after reading Part 1 of this book, I was ready to give up.  However, I'm glad I picked it up again a few days later &amp; finished it.  Still, the book was not quite what I envisioned, and it does not make my list of favorite books.  But I realize I'm not much of a &quot;classic novels&quot; reader, so that probably had a lot to do with how I felt about this book.<br />I enjoyed the premise of this town full of misfits; a drunk, a bar-keep, a teenage girl who's an outsider, a deaf mute and a repressed black doctor- all of which who made excellent characters.  And once the stories of these people really got going, in part 2, I was enjoying the reading.  It's just that part one really sets the stage for each of these characters, so it's not very exciting reading.  And also, it took me a while to get into Carson's writing style, which is a bit unique- for instance, there were times when her sentence structure was kind of backwards.  I'm not sure if this is because that's how they spoke in the 40's, or if it's McCullers's dialect.  I will say that this book did have some very poetic thoughts and prose.  There were several profound things, and it made the reading all the more worthwhile.<br />I do recommend this book for reading- just with the warning that part 1 is slow going, but if you make it that far, you'll be rewarded in part 2 &amp; 3.  I don't want to give anything away about this story, so I'll leave it there.	2004-05-10

You really won't be able to believe that the same person who wrote Kiss the Girls &amp; Hide &amp; Seek wrote this book.  At first I wondered if I'd have a hard time believing this love story...but I didn't at all.  I was immediately drawn into this story.  I could not put it down!<br />Unlike any of his stories before, this is a story solely about love.  Of course, there is the mystery about the diary that the mother Suzanne wrote for her son Nicholas- what happened to her?  So as you're reading, there's an urgency to know what will happen, as well as you're enjoying the sentimental romance.  Neither disappoint.<br />This was one of the best romance books I've read in a long time.  It was a perfect size, quick reading with a story that leaves you begging for more.  When I finished I cried in a way that a story has not made me cry in a very long time.  You must pick up this book- you won't regret it!	2004-05-08

However, it's a good book.  Especially if you enjoy romance with a little bit of intrigue.<br />This is the story of two people who have each individually been through a lot of tragedy and conflict in their past.  The question is, once the find each other, and a love they never thought they would find, can they make it work?<br />I enjoyed the book, Sparks writing always pulls you in and tugs at your heart strings.  I don't think I've ever read one of his books and NOT cried.  I especially enjoyed The Notebook and Message in a Bottle.  His books are also always &quot;fun reading&quot;, great to take on a vacation or to read at the beach.  If you haven't read him before, you should give him a try!	2004-05-04

This book will knock your socks off!  I guarentee you've never read anything like this before.  Christopher gives Rain Man a run for his money!<br />Mark Haddon has done a superb job of creating the character of Autistic Christopher.  What's more, as you start reading, he's not a character any longer, he's real...In this book Christopher has found his neighbor's dog murdered, so he decides to play detective, like his idol Sherlock Holmes, and find out who killed him.  So begins the journey, which actually leads into ta much larger adventure, as Christopher begins to uncover that things in his life are not as they seem.  You see, Christopher may be autistic, but he's a wiz at math and science and he's also unusually perceptive.  The way Haddon goes through Chris's thought process and daily activities is pure genius.  And to add depth to the story, I found his parents &amp; some of the other characters in this book, also very &quot;real&quot;.  There aren't any perfect people in this book, this is real life.<br />I sincerely recommend this book to you.  It's a quick read at only 220 pages, and the wit at which Haddon writes, makes those pages fly by.  Very rarely does a book make me laugh out-loud, and this book did that several times.  Bravo!	2004-04-30

But one thing about Spark's books, you can always count on a read that will take you away to another place &amp; a story that will inspire you.  And most definitely, you'll cry!<br />This is the story of Andrienne &amp; Patrick who fall in love over a weekend they spend together.  They fall in love during a time in their lives that they're most unhappy and alone.  Now, years later Adrienne is telling their story to her daughter Amanda, to help her with a difficult time in her life.  Thus, the lesson is revealed.<br />I truly enjoyed this book.  I enjoy Spark's writing for a bit of the break in the heavy dramatic novels or crime stories I usually read.  This did the trick!  Not as good as Message in a Bottle or the Notebook, but still a wonderful read.	2004-04-28

No authority to investigate, no badge to impress the people he's trying to gather data from, and the FBI breathing down his neck!<br />This book features Bosch looking into a case he started 4 years ago, but never solved.  With one woman murdered, 2 million dollars stolen, 2 policemen who were shot- one dead and one left paralyzed and one missing FBI agent...there's a lot of work ahead!  But, do all of these things tie in together, or are they just coincidence?  And most importantly, who's responsible?<br />I enjoyed most of this book.  I do agree with one reviewer in that it was a little hard to get into at first, I can't pin point why, it just was.  Once you get into the story &amp; the players, you're propelled along at a very quick pace.  This is a great mystery, it will have you reading late into the night to figure out what happens next.  However, I do have to say that the ending was not as clean as I think it could have been.  I felt the conclusions were just a little shaky.  It was a pretty good surprise towards the end though, so that makes this reading very worthwhile.  Also, a few characters from other Bosch novels pop up, which is always cool, including his ex-wife!	2004-04-26

Not one has disappointed me, including City of Bones.<br />In City of Bones Bosch is working on a case where human remains have been found after buried for nearly 20 years.  This book is very fast paced and step by step through his detective processes, you find yourself not being able to put the book down.  Trying to figure out, who did it and why.  Another great aspect of this book is that some of the background players in the series, like his partner Edgar, are given time, the relationships developed more.  Which is very satisfying for those who have been reading the series for years.<br />Overall, I loved the story and the twists and turns in the plot kept me guessing until the end.  As always, I wasn't able to guess the ending.  My only complaint is that I think the resolution of who murdered this person wasn't as good as it could have been.  I don't want to give anything away, so you'll just have to read it!  Do check out this book- but if you've never read the series before, I would recommend starting with the first book (The Black Echo) and working you way through, it's not necessary, but I think it's very worth it- as I said, they're all excellent reads!	2004-04-23

This is the first book I've read by Joanne Harris, and it won't be my last! Harris writes with such poetry that involves you fully in the story, you can't put the book down.  You're IN the story, it's so vivid, you can see the town market, taste the oranges, smell the fresh air, hear the laughter and touch the river...<br />The story is about a family that was torn apart by the war and it's cruel ways.  A mother and her three children are struggling to get by; in a constant battle for control, freedom and happiness.  Deeply embedded in the story is a secret, one so volitle, it's been hidden for 50 years.  But now it's time to confront the past.  It starts with the main character, Boise, going home, only due to her past, no one knows who she really is.<br />I really enjoyed this story.  It's not a long book, but as you reach the end, you'll be wishing it were a bit longer.  And I have to say, being a very avid reader, Joanne Harris is quite a unique writer!	2004-04-19

This is truly one of the best books I've read in a long time!  It has everything; prose, poetry, endearing characters, an entertaining plot, suspensefulness, excitement, couragousness...<br />The Time Traveler's Wife is about Henry, who ever since he was 5 has been traveling through time.  BUT, he has no control over when this happens and when it does, he has lands somewhere in time completely naked-with nothing else.  He may be somewhere 5 minutes or 5 hours.  We meet Henry at 5, but the story takes us from one time to the next, we see Henry grow up, but we also see the story of how him and Claire meet, when he's mid-30's.  As we watch their lives unfold, in the most untraditional of ways, you can't help but become so involved in their lives and how they deal with their unique situation.<br />I enjoyed everything about this novel.  The writing was superb!  The story did not get dull or drab once, which is an amazing feat for a 520 page book.  AND, it also did something few books do, and that's move me.  I highly recommend this novel, even though it's long, the pages fly by with such speed, you'll be sad to see it end!	2004-04-17

I think it was because it was so built up for me with all the hype and the movie, I had high expectations.  Runaway Jury did not live up to them.<br />I agree with a previous reviewer who said that if you've read Grisham before, this is nothing to write home about.  It's his regular type plot and story.  And honestly, that makes this a bit of a plain book.  I loved the premise of this book, almost comparing it to the movie 12 Angry Men.  The thought that one person can sway a group in a trial situation is fascenating to me.  However, this book did not keep me on the edge of my seat.  Yes, there were a lot of sub-plots and things going on, but this book was just not successful in capturing my undivided attention.<br />The ending was ok.  Like a few other Grisham books, the ending isn't his strong point.  I'd recommend this book, but I guess I'd just say, reader beware.  Don't expect a non-stop thrill ride with a shocking ending.  This book isn't that at all.  But for a solid story about trials, juries and schemes, this book does ok.  For a much stronger story by Grisham read: The Street Lawyer, The Partner and The Firm.	2004-04-13

That book was one of the best books I've ever read.<br />The follow up to it, which is this book, wasn't as good, but was great in it's own right! The story of Hannah, the Queen's fool, is really about more than just her, it's about that whole period of time in England and about the royal family and it's enemies.  I found everything quite interesting.  And although at some points the story dragged for me, it didn't last long.  There was always something new going on to catch your interest.  I enjoyed most of the characters, but do be ready to memorize who is who- there are a lot of players involved!<br />I'd recommend this book, it was long, but worth every minute!

The Brethren did not get many good reviews.  I gave it a chance anyway and I'm glad I did.<br />While this is not Grisham's best story, I thought this was an over-all good book.  I enjoyed the story of the 3 judges in prison, running their scam.  I also enjoyed the story of the man running for President and the crooked people involved.  They came together in a predictable way, but still, I was enjoying the story.  I enjoyed it up until the end, and that's what I did not enjoy.  The ending.  It did lack excitement or any type of climax.  And other than seeing a few characters that could have been edited out, I liked this book.<br />I guess I'd leave it up to the reader- I think this was worth the read.  But maybe you won't if you're a big \\"ending person\\".  I'll leave that decision up to you.	2004-04-04

I am a long-time Koontz fan and have read all but 5 of his books, so I'm a good judge, I think.<br />While Icebound is quite different than most Koontz books, I found this to be a refreshing change.  I thoroughly enjoyed the action and suspense.  The whole plot of being trapped on a huge iceberg in the middle of the Artic with bombs set to detinate in 12 hours and you're awaiting rescue...how much more thrilling can it get?  The description of things around these 8 people, the cold, the ice, the water, the wind, really made me feel like I was there too.<br />I thought the book flowed smoothly- not too fast or too slow.  While at times it was hard to keep the characters straight and their development was not the best, I still enjoyed some of the central characters.  Koontz did fill us in on some of their pasts as well, which I enjoyed- almost as subplots, something to take us away from the story at hand and engage the reader.<br />I'd recommend this book to fans of suspenseful or action packed books.  It's not an average horror/scary Koontz book, but I think if you know that going in, Koontz fans will also enjoy this book.	2004-03-31

I tend to enjoy his earlier works more than his later, they're all good, but the earlier books are more of a &quot;fun&quot; read.  They're not extremely long and they're really more pure horror.  I love it, definitely a guilty pleasure.<br />Nigh Chills is about a scientist that has discovered a way to brainwash people, to open their minds using subliminal ads and then program them to do what you'd like.  The concept is chilling.  The story is interesting and you're kept on the edge of your seat most of the time.  And the characters are enjoyable. If you're a fan of Koontz's earlier works, you'll enjoy this.	2004-03-29

However, as I started plugging along, I just could not get into the story and narrator at all.  I rarely ever put down a book, only when I feel that I will not enjoy any reading of it, and I did put this book down.  It was so bad, I just couldn't go on.  And judging by the other reviews, seems I'm not the only one.  Very disappointed.	2004-03-25

It's the story about how he came to be that way, his familys past.  It's about what it was like growing up, knowing something was unusual, but not being sure what.  It's about struggling to overcome self-hate.<br />This story was much more than I thought it was going to be.  I truly enjoyed the generational stories from his grandparents coming to the US to his parents, falling in love.  And most of all I enjoyed Cal's story, his prose, his description, his feelings.  This was an extremely well written book.<br />And for anyone who might not think this book is for them because of it's central premise, reconsider.  Middlesex really is about so much more.  It's about innocence, survival, tragedy, betrayal, inadequacy, lust and love.  And if you're from Michigan and the Detroit area, you'll thoroughly enjoy the descriptions of home.	2004-03-25

Steel is trying to find some new magic to maintain her readership and capture their interest...give them reason to keep hanging on.  Does she succeed?  Not quite, but she doesn't fail entirely.<br />Ransom is one of the first times that I can think of (after reading all 60 of her books) that she attempts a bit more of a calculated and complex storyline- merging 3 into one.  She does ok at this, the central story line is about a family who's near poverty after the father lost his millions in the stock market and committed suicide-leaving the mother and her 3 children on their own.  And with all of that to handle, the change from living as millionaires to saving every penny and selling off all of their belongings; now they have to handle the threat that someone is out to committ a crime against the family, testing them further.<br />Of course, like any D. Steel book there's a bit of romance, but actually not too much compared to the suspense that she tries to create.  She really does make an effort to make this book different from her others and she half-succeeds.  Yes, I enjoyed the stories and the ending.  I even liked the characters, but yet again, I just felt like something was missing.  This book is not my favorite of hers, not up to par with her previous books Heartbeat, No Greater Love or Jewels. Perhaps in an effort to pump out a large number of books, she's sacraficed quality.	2004-03-22

Inside the covers, they each hold something special, magical- a tale of love, family and redemption.  And they always keep me coming back for more!<br />Dance with me is about two sisters, Sylvie and Jane and their ailing mother.  Even though they are both about 30 years old, in so many ways they've never grown up.  But now is the time to face the past and start anew.  For Sylvie it's dealing with a mother who has Alzheimers, who she's built her whole life around- but now it's time to start a life of her own.  For Jane, it's about forgiving her mother for encouraging her to give up a baby she had when she was 20 and finding a way to make up for lost time.  And then we get to know the family of the little girl Jane put up for adoption, Chloe, and her family- who have their own secrets and problems.<br />Again, Luanne Rice takes topics we've read about a million times before and some how still manages to hold our interest.  And she never gives us a cheesy ending, anything forced or fake.  It's as real as real life can get.  I'd recommend this book for anyone who enjoys romance or family stories.  The story keeps you interested and the characters endear themselves to you.  Also- read any of her other books, they're all wonderful!	2004-03-16

When I picked up this book, I didn't know what I'd think of it.  It's not the normal kind of book I read, but as this month's book club selection, I gave it a chance.  And I was quite impressed.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed the story of Cedric.  Coming from middle-class white suburbia, but not far from Detroit, I was familiar of the struggle for inner-city kids to strive, but not with their perceptions of it.  This book opened up my eyes to some realities and feelings, I never had thought about before.  For instance, how it's not only very difficult to get a good education or good grades in the inner city, but how you're ostracized by your peers for trying.<br />This is a story of how Cedric ignored the taunting of fellow students, how he earned a chance at the Ivy league and then we learn the struggle doesn't stop there.  For a boy who was salutatorian at his high school, his education level is still far below most of those in the Ivy leagues.  The story is about his efforts to make the grade, fit in at school and become comfortable in his own skin.  Just reading about his obstacles made me tired for him!<br />I enjoyed the book, especially how we did get to see the world by more than just Cedric's eyes, but also by his mothers, his fathers and friends.  I think this gave the story a pick-me-up when otherwise it would have gotten boring. To anyone who is interested in this topic, I'd recommend this book.	2004-03-15

Ann Packers writing style, poetic at times, drew me in, as well as the story itself. Even if one of the main characters, Carrie, was hard to like most of the time!<br />Mike and Carrie are engaged and have been together 8 years when they hit rocky times.  The passion seems to have fizzled out for Carrie, but not for Mike, who tries with all his might to save their relationship.  In trying to do anything to win her heart again, he decides to dive off a pier, into water he doesn't realize is shallow, breaking his neck.  With a long road of recovery ahead of him and learning to live with the damage done, Carrie is still in the process of deciding if she wants to be with him.  It's now or never.  And in a rash decision of a person cornered, she takes off to New York- for an uncertain future.<br />Like I said, Carrie is hard to like a lot of the time.  You can relate to her some times and others, you just want to slap her and wake her up!  You'll feel compassion for Mike in his struggle, which makes you like her less.  But the story, of having to decide what you want to do with the rest of your life, that is compelling.  Most of us have been at a point where we don't know what to do, and Carrie is there, probably stuck worse than most of us ever get.  And at times, you can't help but feel badly for her, in trying to decide what she wants to do and who she is, it really is like she doesn't know who she is at all.  Ann Packer did a wonderful job of making us feel and see Carries position.<br />I'd recommend this book for one reason- the journey.  The story Packer tells is so all-encompassing, you really feel like you're &quot;there&quot; and that you've learned a little about human nature and maybe even yourself.  While I was not satisfied with the ending, perhaps other people will be.  Overall excellent reading!	2004-03-10

In this book, you're not sure who you like more.<br />In an ironic twist of fate, Bosch is the main suspect in a murder that McCaleb is investigating as a favor for an old friend.  And if that weren't enough, Bosch is in the middle of an important trial, where his testimony could make or break the case and puts the responsibility of a killer punished or set free on his shoulders.  With two suspenseful stories playing out, with characters we know and love, this book proves yet again Connelly's talent for writing.  As of yet, I haven't been able to guess an ending yet- he keeps you on your toes!<br />I enjoyed this book, as I've enjoyed all that came before it from Connelly.  The only thing that was a little strange, was that it seemed Connelly had a hard time juggling the two characters and giving them equal time in the book.  In a book that is considered part of the &quot;Harry Bosch&quot; series, it really was more about McCaleb and that left a little of a bad taste in my mouth.  Even though I enjoy both characters, Bosch is still my favorite and I was looking forward to a book that again, focuses more on him and I didn't quite feel I got that.  However, that's the only let down, BUT surprisingly, I did begin enjoy getting to know McCaleb more and more through out this book.  I do hope Connelly writes another one featuring him, I just think it might be better though to keep the two characters separate and give them each their own stage.	2004-03-08

I really enjoyed Girl in Hyacinth Blue and thought this book would be as good.  Big disappointment.<br />I was only able to read the first 50 pages and then I had to give up.  I could not get into the characters or the story- I was especially disappointed with the character of Emily.  I felt Vreeland did a poor job of telling us who she was- other than she likes nature and native cultures.  I found everything about the writing dull and drab- from her descriptions of things to the characters themselves.  I found myself not caring what was happening in the story and there was no help from Vreeland to try and create any interest or excitement for this story.  Also, even though I'm an avid reader, several times I didn't understand what was going on- her transistions from one scene to the next were terrible!!  For instance, in one part we meet a man and it's not until many pages later we learn his name.  This confuses things.  She talks about her sisters, but it's many pages later we learn their names &amp; not too much else about them.  And at 50 pages, I still hadn't figured out where this story was leading- what was its purpose?  What would make this book worth finishing?<br />I'm sorry to say I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.  There have only been a handful of books in my life that I have not finished and this is one of them!  Be warned.	2004-03-03

While I've enjoyed every Lavryle Spencer book that I've read, I did not enjoy Then Came Heaven nearly as much!<br />The book is about Eddie who has lost his wife and is trying to get on with his life and raise his two girls who are 8 & 9 years old.  Eddie is the local Catholic school's janitor and he becomes quick friends with the girls teacher, Sister Jean. While Sister Jean adores Eddies girls, Anne and Lucy, she is not allowed even to touch them to comfort them in their mothers death.  Slowly, we start to see Sister Jean become unhappy with her life as a nun and question her decision to ever become one.<br />While the description for this book had me very excited to read it, it just didn't live up to my expectations or Spencer's other books I've read (such as Seperate Beds, Small Town Girl and Twice Loved). I think it was an interesting premise, but it just fell short.  I had a very hard time liking the characters.  They just didn't seem \\"real\\" to me. And I had an even harder time getting into the relationship between Eddie and Sister Jean.  I just didn't feel the chemistry.  There were even parts in the book I was feeling a bit bored with the story.<br />Overall, this was not Spencer's best book, nor was it worthy for her very last writing effort.  I'd recommend another of her books before this one, That Camden Summer, Seperate Beds, Small Town Girl or Twice Loved- those were all excellent!	2004-03-01

I thought it was going to be about Harley, who was going through hard times trying to raise his other 3 sisters after their mother shot and killed their father.  It was about a lot more than that.<br />This book is kind of a look into the lives of children who have suffered abuses at the hands of their parents- emotional, physical or sexual. This families life was completely screwed up!  I'm quite used to graphic writing, but even I was surprised at some of the violent thoughts in this book. Which is why I have a hard time with everyone calling Harley a hero- I don't see that.<br />It's really a sad story.  You keep wishing for things to get better for this little family, but it just seems to get worse and worse.  I do agree with some of the other readers- this book is a bit flawed.  I just feel like the resolution and ending was not quite worth it.  And the character development wasn't up to par.  I think it could have been improved.  Or maybe it was that I was just looking for a happy ending.  Be warned, this book is often hard to read, it's a sobering subject. But maybe it's a story that needed to be told.	2004-02-28

And knowing this was her first published effort at writing (1985), I did figure it wouldn't be as polished as her later works that are my favorites, such as Home Fires, The Secret Hour and Cloud Nine.<br />Angels All Over Town is about three sisters, Una, Lily and Margot and their relationships with each other and with the men in their lives.  The story was told from Una's point of view, who's the oldest and an actress on a soap opera.  I found the sisters very endearing.  And I loved the interpersonal things going on between them, their discussions, arguments etc.<br />There are some things that I think could have used improvement, such as the book didn't feature their mother much.  We didn't get her point of view at all, or learn why she was the way she was.  Also, I would have liked to see more of a resolution with some of the stories, particularly  with Lily and her husband Henk. The ending would could have been improved as well, I felt like it was a kind of odd place to chose to end the book.<br />Overall there were some flaws, but I still found myself enjoying this book and it's characters.  Like all of her later books, the story of family and of relationships is prominent and it engages the reader. I think if you go in reading this knowing some of these things (especially that this is her first book), you won't be disappointed.  However, I would recommend reading her newer books first (Dream Country, Firefly Beach and Follow the Stars Home) and her older books second- but I do think the older books (Blue Moon, Stone Heart) are worth the reading time.	2004-02-25

Every book I've read of his has been a rollercoaster of emotions & suspense.  I haven't  been disappointed yet!<br />I'll admit it took me a little bit to get used to Terry McCaleb, since I'm a huge fan of the Harry Bosch series, and who can top that?  However, before long I was enjoying Terry almost just as much.<br />Blood Work is full of twists & turns, in search of a killer.  Terry McCaleb, who has just had a heart transplant is supposed to be at home resting, retired from the FBI.  Until the woman who's sister died so he could have his heart, asks Terry for his help in finding her killer.  How can he turn her down?  I don't want to reveal too much, so I'll leave it at that.  If you like crime novels and murder mysteries, I guarentee you'll love this book.  There wasn't a dull moment. And I'd also recommend the Harry Bosch series, including Concrete Blonde, Trunk Music and Angels Flight.	2004-02-22

You can't put this book down!<br />While the whole series up to this point has been excellent, I think this book is going to stand out for me, even after I read the last three, as one of the best (out of 9).  This book just had the right combination of everything- suspense, murder, drama, intrigue, mystery, excitement and twists and turns.<br />In this book Bosch seems to come up against everything possible: fellow officers &amp; law officials, his wife and close friend, a city on the edge of rioting, more than one murder to solve and one of the most powerful families in LA.  Anyone who knows Harry knows he's capable of fighting anything though and winning.  And any fan of Connely's knows his writing is far above the rest.	2004-02-18

Again, a book with a great concept- posing the question- who wants to die?  Would you offer to take the place for your friend?<br />The book held my interest for the most part, however the frequent changes between when Diana was young & when she's a housewife, are often hard to follow.  There's some sequences that don't seem to belong to either- they're like dreams.  And they're never really explained.  This book is like you're in one big dream- with a lot of poetry & prose.<br />To some degree I enjoyed the flowery writing and the strangeness of the dreams.  However, after a while, it got very frustrating and I just wanted to know what was REAL and what was not.  Also- as she's describing the younger years between Diana & Maureen, she never uses names, it's just \\"the girl\\" or \\"the friend\\"-- thank god sometimes she'll say \\"the blonde\\"- then you know it's Diana.  Often I found myself not sure of who was who.  And frankly, being an avid reader- if it confused me, I think it will confuse most people.<br />I guess I'd recommend this book with caution.  Nothing is cut & dry, it's pretty much all up to you to figure out what's going on and what the ending means.  I was really hoping there would be more of an explanation at the end or a study guide, comment from the author, but there wasn't any of that.	2004-02-14

As I was reading this book I kept thinking- it's just about this guy who is super horny!  It's about his escapades bedding women and flirting with them.  However, he's not a stick around type of guy.<br />I did for the most part enjoy this book, however I got the feeling the author is continually trying to recreate the success of the Girl with the Pearl earring and she's struggling to find originality and something worth writing about.  This book was so simple, you can boil it down to a man & his sexual adventures.  There's a little focus on the womens lives and the families he comes in contact with, but nothing that could make it if it was the stand-alone story.  i enjoy when there is more than one strong story in a book...Never the less, it kept me reading, the 250 pages goes by quickly.<br />Also, the cover of the book I read did show some of the tapestry that was being written about, so that was nice.  As for a recommendation- if you enjoy Chevalier's writing, you'll probably enjoy this one, just don't have too high of expectations.	2004-02-12

There were parts of this story that spaned 100 years of a families generations that I enjoyed.  I loved how unique the stories were.  And each person in the family had their own quirks &amp; personalities.  There were surprises along the way &amp; some shocking moments.  Overall, the story &amp; characters were great.<br />The part of the book that dragged it down for me was how the stories were woven together.  I'm not sure if that is a part of this magic realism.  I could accept that magic realism makes things that could never happen, happen.  But it was the flow of the book that I had a hard time with.<br />Some tips: You'll need to pay attention to every word on your page.  If you zone out for one moment, you'll surely miss something.  Make sure you read the book with the family tree in the front- I used it probably just about every chapter.  It's hard when everyone's names are the same or similar.  Also, stick with it.  There are parts that are slow and parts that are very interesting.  In the end, the read was worth it, even though along the way I was a bit frustrated. I wouldn't have given the author a nobel prize, but I agree that it's a memorable book.	2004-02-09

And I mean, immensely.  Her books are some of the most romantic I've ever read.  They take you away into such a fun place, you can't put the book down.<br />This story starts off in 1837.  It's about Laura, Rye &amp; Dan who were childhood friends &amp; grew closer into adulthood.  Laura &amp; Rye had a magical connection, married and soon after he left on a whaling ship to try &amp; earn their fortune.  However, fate stepped in, his ship went down, and as everyone assumed, with him on it.  5 years later, with a son Rye never knew, married to his best friend Dan who saw her through the toughest times in her life, Rye returns and walks into a house that was once his &amp; a woman he thought was still his wife.  Not to mention the son he didn't know existed, but who's now calling another man papa. Rye's returned, but lost everything, including his house &amp; it's belongings as he finds out that legally Laura's married to Dan.  But with a love so very strong, Laura &amp; Rye begin a journey, not knowing where it will leave all 4 of them &amp; no one wanting to hurt the other.<br />I enjoyed this book for so many reasons, interesting &amp; likable characters, memorable love story, great friendships and humor.  It was also interesting to read about what it was like to live in Nantucket in the 1800's with the whaling industry &amp; all of the other sorts of things like horse &amp; carriage rides, making homemade candles &amp; wearing those hideous corsets.<br />If you are looking for a love story, I'll guarentee you this one will not let you down!	2004-02-03

I'm very glad I picked it up and I'd definitely recommend it to other readers.<br />Having heard about it for the last two years, winning the award and being chosen as the Today Show's book club selection, I had looked into it a year or so ago. But at that time, the description on the back just didn't catch my interest, it sounded boring. Then, my book club chose it as this month's selection and I read it. Wow...it was so much better than I'd ever imagined it. The description does not do it justice.<br />There's a lot going on in this book, but I'll try to give you a quick summary- Miles Roby is a man who after high school was on his way to BEING somebody, of moving past his small town and away from his dysfunctional family. He was so close, yet so far away. With about 1 year left to go before graduation and his mother on her death bed, he makes a decision that changes the rest of his life- he quits college and moves back home to take over managing the Empire Grill.  Now, 15 years later, living in a town that was once bustling, but now a poverty stricken area and going through a divorce, Miles family is trying to give him the encouragement it takes to change the tides of his life and make something more of himself. It's not easy when his wifes new husband is constantly hanging out at the Grill, provoking him, his daughter is hanging out with some very questionable kids, his father is a leach, a thief, a drunk and the town loud-mouth and his boss won't give him the help he needs to turn the Grill into something better.  Through a series of events that make him question his life and with family on his back about re-writing the mistakes of his past, Miles weighs his options on what to do with the rest of his life.<br />What I enjoyed most about this book was that it had a bit of everything. It had unrequited love, long hidden family secrets, humor and suspense. It's not just the story of Miles, it's the story of his daughter, his wife, his brother and his town.  I don't think it will disappoint you, the writing is memorable and flawless., his wife, his brother and his town.  I don't think it will disappoint you, the writing is memorable and flawless.	2004-01-25

And I think this is the first time I can honestly say that to me the movie was as good as the book! (shocking, I know)<br />This book is about 4 mothers and 4 daughters and their stories of love and loss. There's such a difference in the stories of the mothers &amp; of their daughters, being that the mothers grew up in China &amp; the daughters in the US. It's about their learning to appreciate and understand each other and their lives. What's nice is that in the beginning of the book there's a list of each character and of their stories. It makes it much easier when you go from story to story to remember who's who.<br />What I liked most about the stories was how these women took all of their circumstances and made the best they could out of their lives. Such an inspiration, when you think about how being born in China in the early 1900's was a very difficult time for women. How being born in a different country could make all the difference.	2004-01-19

This book didn't really do that, it was more about Hollywood, which was cool, it's just that the title didn't fit.<br />I know this is one of her most popular books,if not THE most popular, it wasn't my favorite though. There were so many characters and so much jumping back and forth from one to the other, like every page, it was hard to get into. Finally you do, but then the jumping around still gets on your nerves.<br />Story wise, it was pretty impressive. A few shocks along the way & a great ending. If you like reading about Hollywood royalty & their livestyles, I'd recommend this book. I also really enjoyed Hollywood Kids!	2004-01-16

No particular reason, I guess being born in 1975 I never had an appreciation for him. However, reading this book, really gave me a newfound respect for him. Anyone who can turn nothing into such a powerful empire is something special.<br />I liked the way the book started, I enjoyed getting to know Leroy's family &amp; reading about their struggles, I think it helped set the stage for his stardom in the latter half of the book. However, I'll admit at times the first part dragged. It got very exciting when Leroy started to sing, bought a guitar &amp; started working at being a star. I loved it when he went to the &quot;black store&quot; in town &amp; bought the flashy clothes &amp; wore them to school! When he was first starting out &amp; becoming popular was my favorite part, I have to say that some of the final pages of the book dragged for me too. And I was disappointed that they didn't finish the story, you are kind of left hanging on the last page. This book didn't go into any marriages or love stories or kids. Not even into the fall from fame or much on the drug abuse. That didn't make sense to me.<br />Over all I did enjoy the book &amp; am very glad I read it. I think if you're an Elvis fan or would be interested in reading about what his life was like, I'd recommend this book to you.	2004-01-12

So juicy.<br />Jackie Collins is an expert at writing stories about people in the fast lane, rich beyond belief &amp; people who start from nothing and make themselved into starts. This book is about all of that, with some love &amp; lust thrown in.<br />If you're looking for a good book to pass the time with, one that has an outrageous story, you've found it!	2004-01-06

Now Paris is forced to pick up the pieces of her shattered life and try &amp; make a new life for herself. The first question is: does she want to? The second: how does she do that? Third: Will she ever want to be with another man again, be able to trust him?<br />I put myself in Paris's shoes and it was heart-wrenching, what this woman went through. We've probably all been there (being left), so it's kind of neat to read about someone &amp; how they deal with their struggle.  I enjoyed not only the story, but the characters. Danielle really did a good job with this book, she makes you care about the characters &amp; what will happen to them, as she does with most of her books. The best aspect about this book though were all of the funny dates Paris goes on. It's too funny!<br />If you're looking for something newer of Steel's to read, try this book or Answered Prayers &amp; Safe Harbour- they all are examples that she can still write moving love stories.	2004-01-05

I was not disappointed, it was what I expected. I enjoyed the  the characters; Sloan who is a no-nonsense cop & her slew of friends. I liked the sexual energy that was between her & her cop friend Jess & then also Jess & Sloan's other friend Sara. I also enjoyed the whole plot of her being estranged from her father & sister and now after 20some years getting a call from her father & one from the FBI. I was also anticipating how it would turn out- was her father really a criminal, would her sister & grandmother open up to her? And was the family friend Noah a criminal as well?<br />It wasn't the best book I've read, but I wasn't disappointed either. It's kind of a cross between a romance & mystery book.	2004-01-02

When you're near death &amp; almost die, what does that do to you? Can it change you, change who you are- does it open a door to another world? While the thought of dying is scary enough, imagine if you survived, but you were changed. And not for the better. What would you do?<br />This book is full of suspense, mystery, terror, horror, astonishment &amp; heart-pounding moments! Go get it &amp; read!	2003-12-30

Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan, it's just that about half of her smaller books aren't worth the reading time. This one though I really enjoyed. I think it was just the overall story &amp; the characters. If you're looking for a quick love story I'd recommend The Gift &amp; Five Days in Paris. Those are both great reads as well.	2003-12-30

It has to have another element, and that's what the horses are to this book. It's not just the horse ranch, but the passion the characters have for the horses &amp; their determination to use that passion for good. This is one of Steel's classic books, I recommend it, I think you'll enjoy every mintue as I did!	2003-12-30

Stuck in a car with a young boy traveling across country with a crazed killer following you, closing in...And pull it off Koontz does.<br />I enjoy reading Koontz for several reasons, the least of all being that he scares the pants off of me! While the plots may not be very realistic, they terrify you, fill you with suspense &amp; dread and they probably keep you up and night either reading or afraid of the dark!<br />Shattered isn't his best book, that's why I only gave it 4 stars, however, it is a good book. Most of what Koontz touches seems to turn to gold and this book is no different.	2003-12-30

However, psychics make for great stories &amp; good reading!<br />This book is about a woman who basically spends most of her time helping the police catch criminals using her psychic powers. It's not something she even really enjoys, it keeps her up at night &amp; it's stressful on her marriage- however, she can't stop the visions. Especially the one, the one that seems to be trying to tell her something, the one leading her to evil...to someone she is close to.<br />This book is a quick read, only about 300 pages, which is small for Koontz. It goes by in a flash, it'll keep you guessing until the end. I'll admit- I had two guesses on who I thought the &quot;bad guy&quot; was, one was right, but the ending still surprised me.	2003-12-30

Midnight is one of those!<br />Ala Stephen King, Koontz takes the idea of something other than human things walking this earth &amp; wreaking havoc. What's scary is that these are humans, evolving into something else. The concept &amp; the story did manage to give me the chills. I guess the main thing you need to keep in mind when reading a story like this is that it's not supposed to be realistic!	2003-12-30

It's not just the killing that makes this book so scary, it's that it's about two young boys. I think a demented child is one of the scariest things to imagine.<br />Koontz pulled it off.

It makes you look at people a bit longer. That means it's GOOD.<br />Yes, the plot is a bit unrealistic, but it's a fun read nonetheless. Again- another example about carnivals being a bit unsafe.<br />The reason I gave it 4 stars was that it did leave some unanswered questions.	2003-12-30

Perhaps we'd like a bit more UNpredictability, but most of the time I enjoy the story anyway. Reading a book like this makes you feel so thankful for what you have, that's always a good thing. It also makes you think that if anything bad were to befall you, you could probably survive. This wasn't her best book, but I thought it was decent. If you want to read a really great love story by Steel, check out: The Ring, To Love Again, Summers End, Answered Prayers &amp; Passions Promise.	2003-12-30

What's in her mind? However, Koontz got a little carried away &amp; I don't think he quite pulled off this story.<br />If you're looking for a great story by Koontz I'd recommend: The Bad Place, Key to Midnight, Whispers &amp; Cold Fire.	2003-12-30

While this story has a great premise, I do agree with some of the reviewers in saying that Koontz doesn't completely pull it off.<br />I'd really give this book about 3 1/2 stars if I could. It did keep me on the edge of my seat, wondering how things will turn out, however, some of the topics were just a little too out there for me.<br />Some of my favorite of Koontz's are: Odd Thomas, False Memory, Key to Midnight, House of Thunder &amp; The Bad Place.	2003-12-30

However, I don't think Steel quite pulled off this topic &amp; I think her writing in this novel left something to be desired. If you're looking for an exciting &amp;  suspenseful story by Steel I'd recommend: Secrets, Kaleidoscope, Vanished, Malice, Jewels &amp; Message from Nam.	2003-12-30

What kept me reading with enthusiasm was hating the husband &amp; wanting to see him get what he deserved! I think the story meant well, but it just didn't seem to mesh for me. If you're looking for something good by Steel, I'd recommend Message from Nam, No Greater Love, Safe Harbour or The Long Road Home- They're all about over-coming &amp; surviving.	2003-12-30

It just seemed so predictable &amp; boring. The writing could use some work too, saying the same thing over &amp; over gets frustrating to read- I'd rather have a shorter book! The only thing I did enjoy was the characters- some you love &amp; some you love to hate. But if you're looking for something good by Ms. Steel- I'd recommend The Wedding, Star or Heartbeat instead.	2003-12-30

I've been a fan for many years, this was one of the first books of his I read. It's left an impression.<br />While again, the plot isn't likely, somehow Koontz drags you in &amp; makes you think that it is happening.

And the characters, the ones that aren't on the good side, have left lasting impressions.

Dragon Tears is no exception.<br />While again, the scenario isn't exactly believable, Koontz still pulls it off. And with finess. I think the most valuable part of Koontz's writing is his characters. Without that- the plots, the themes, the evil dwellers, would do nothing for us. But giving us characters to love &amp; care about &amp; even characters that we love to hate- make the reading memorable &amp; enjoyable.	2003-12-30

I've read every book by Danielle Steel &amp; have loved almost all of them. This one is no different. A story about survival, bravery &amp; courage- who can't use a little of that in their lives.

What you'll read in the pages of this book will make you cringe &amp; cry. You'll feel exactly as this young girl does, confused as to why her mother seemingly hates her. However sad this story though, it's truly about survival &amp; making a life for yourself beyond your past abuses. I think this is an excellent story &amp; I'd really recommend reading it!	2003-12-30

I like all of his books, but not all of them leave you on the edge of your seat trying to figure out a secret. The best part- it's about the main character in this book!<br />Can you imagine how scary it would be to question &amp; doubt who you are?

It's his least-favorite of mine.<br />The plot sounds good, exciting, but as I started this book I immediately knew that something was missing. I don't know what it is exactly, but I do know I had a hard time liking the characters &amp; caring about them. I also found the book to be pretty slow-paced. It also got annoying reading from different characters points of view, usually I enjoy that, but this book just didn't pull it off. And the suspense that was supposed to be there- wasn't there, a lot of the time.<br />I am still a big fan of Meltzer, I have been since his first book, so if you're looking at reading something of his, I'd recommend First Counsel or Dead Even. Both are much better than this book. I'm still planning on reading his next book, however, this one has made me a bit weary. I think he just tried a concept &amp; it just didn't flow.	2003-12-29

I didn't think it too over played. I found it very nice actually in that it added to the suspense & the greatness of this book.<br />What I liked most about this book was that I don't think it was too \\"out there\\", like a few of his books have been. It felt totally believable & right. It made it so much easier to read than to be saying, \\"oh that could never happen!\\"<br />Go out & get it, once you pick it up, you won't put it down.

The characters are great- and so loveable! The story is a worthy one about moving past tragedy and finding the courage to live again. A predicable love story for the most part yes, but isn't that what makes her books so good? A moral, a love story and a happy ending- what more can you ask for?	2003-12-22

It's actually amazing to think there could ever be a man out there like this. I couldn't wait for him to get what was coming to him!<br />I know a lot of people might read this story and think the characters are too simple-minded or that the story is predictable. Well, maybe they are; but the story kept me reading and I started to really love certain characters and love to hate others. Every now and then, you just need a good love story, no matter how predicatable or sappy.	2003-12-22

It's in a league with some of her earlier works like Star, Changes and Message from Nam.  I really enjoyed this book, cover to cover!  I'm hoping that she keeps up the great work.	2003-12-08

It's been several years between books and since I've had time to read him, but now that I have, I'm in love again!<br />Dead Even and Tenth Justice were the other books of his I read, and from what I remember, they knocked my socks off.  First Counsel is no exception! Not disappointed at all.<br />As for some of the reviews that thought this book was a bit unrealistic, I don't know...I disagree. Truth is stranger than fiction and we've all seen what our elected officials can do and get away with.<br />If you're looking for a book that will keep you on the edge of your seat and in suspense the entire time, I recommend this book. His writing style is not only exciting, but he's a fun read as well, with little jokes and creative writing along the way. Go read this book!!	2003-12-08

I don't know what has happened to those great long books she used to write, such as Jewels, Thurston House or Daddy...books that carried you through almost the persons whole life and when you put it down, you felt accomplished, like you'd read a complete story. Her newer books aren't that. Moving on...<br />I did enjoy this book a little more than some of her other newer books. It was a very quick read at 180 pages, which might have helped keep my interest. It could have been more like 160 if she had cut out all of the repetition. She kept repeating herself over and over and over...I don't understand why. It wasn't a long book, so it's not like we'd forget. She even had the same conversations with questions and answers repeated two or three times!<br />Looking past that, the story itself was compelling. It was sad, but you wanted to keep reading to see what would happen. The ending was so predictable, I figured it out probably 50 pages in, but still was a good ending. It did bring out some emotion in me and kept my interest, so I would recommend this book, the story is good, just need to look past the writing at times.	2003-12-01

His most recent books just aren't the same as The Bad Place, Coldfire or Key to Midnight. (Read those!!) So, Demon Seed, I thought, having never read the original, was pretty good.<br />As I was reading, I kept thinking of the Kubrick film, 2001 Space Odyssey. The plot and writing was a bit...laughable at times. Over-all though, if you just decide to read it and take it for what it is, it's not bad. The only other complaint I have is, is that we only got to hear in 2 chapters in the beginning from the voice of Susan. Why bother? There needed to be more from her point of view, at least at the end. I kept waiting to see what she was thinking, but it never happened, it was just weird.<br />Overall though, it was a quick fun read. A bit of classic Koontz, I think.	2003-12-01

Now, at 28, I saw this book at the library and thought, what the heck.

He just didn't. However, I still found it a pretty good read, a compelling story. Yes, I was able to guess for the most part what the ending was, but hey, that's fun to do now and again!<br />If you used to read his books, I'd recommend picking it up- it's worth the short time it takes to read this book.	2003-12-01

The plot sounded good enough...and it didn't disappoint.<br />The story was a short &amp; sweet read, which worked. The only thing I would have added was a bit more description and experiences from the Harlem side of life. It would have been funny to have him move there &amp; have to learn the lingo, the way of life. Instead, the person that he chose to live with had a background similar to his. I don't think the character really experienced what he set out to do.<br />It was a good book though. I'd recommend it. Ending was a good as well!	2003-11-24

It seems harder to get into books that have such unreal stories, but if told well enough, it's a great read. This book is an example of that. You can either pull it off or not. This time Koontz did pull it off. The suspense kept me reading all 680 pages. I do agree with one other reviewer though that in I would have liked to see a bit more from Noah's point of view. I loved each character, but he especially intrigued me, however, he wasn't in much of the book.<br />At a time when I was thinking maybe I'd outgrown Koontz, this book renews my faith!	2003-11-19

I'll admit that the more I read of hers, I do wish for a bit more originality, going back to her earlier books, that might not have gotten a lot of acclaim, but they sure gained me as a reader. Maybe it's this way with most writers, after you've read about 10 of their books...I don't know. Either way, this still was a good book with a great plot- the bit of mystery was a little unique for Rice- maybe she's realizing her faithful readers need a bit of variety? Over-all, I recommend this book to faithful fans and those who have yet to try a story by Rice. The books always have a touch of magic.	2003-11-10

I became immediately enthralled in the book and enjoyed it until the very end, wondering who the killer was. I'll admit though, about 3/4ths of the way through I had a guess, and it was correct. That's kind of cool though.<br />Ok, I've read several reviews on this book that I am very disappointed with. I don't know if they are coming from people who have weak stomach's or what, but their comments are a little off base to me. I did not feel that this book was too gory or that it was overboard in the scenes. Sure the descriptions were down the tee, but isn't that what you want when you're reading a book? Do you honestly think that when you pick up a murder mystery book that some blood and gore are out of place? Isn't that what murder is? I just think it's unfair for those comments to deter people from reading this book that I thought was a great read.	2003-11-04

Not to sound cliche, but this IS one of the best books I have read in a long time. Oprah did well with this pick!<br />The story has a bit of everything, first off it has the most memorable and unique characters. You can sit and ponder their lives and things they do for hours, if you had the time. The story itself, what takes place is another amazing feature.

But, oh, was I happily surprised! I was very impressed. I thought it would be dull and drab, but from page 2, it drew me in and I enjoyed reading this book immensely.<br />Before reading this book, I couldn't find anything that really gave a description, so here's my synopsis, in case you were looking for one:<br />This book is about two families living in Africa. One is black and one white. We follow them through their struggles and hardships and watch their lives intertwine in the most magical way. This book is full of thought provoking ideas and the writing is at times poetical.<br />If you'd find a book about Africa, in the 1940's something that would interest you, I'd very much recommend this book. At 270 pages, it's a short, easy, enjoyable read.	2003-10-13

At 650 pages, I need something to convince me it's worth the time and effort...well, I guess this book was worth it. I admit, after of about a week's reading, I put the book down. It was a little dry. There was a lot of writings on what I felt was the authors own personal view of society and life. That's not what I picked up this book for, I picked it up for a STORY. Buried in these pages, sometimes buried deep, there was a story.<br />Towards the middle of the book the pace picks up and the author stops all of his non-sense about his views or mundane details of the characters lives, details I felt, should be within the first 1/4 of the book. I don't want to be on page 200 and still be getting to know these characters, it's bad form to me.<br />Anyway, afterall that, I picked up the book and finished it. Part of the reason for that was that it was this month's selection in my book club, and the other part was that I was very interested to see how it would end! I was pretty pleased with the ending. I did end up liking many of the characters (and beware, there were MANY to choose from)as well. My advice- Pay attention to them all, many serve a purpose later in the story.	2003-09-29

No, I haven't been raped, but just to know that someone who went through such a horrible thing and has come out on top, though struggling still I'm sure, is wonderful! I think it gives us all inspiration to move beyond the things that have held us down or hurt us. This book was a bit more than just Alice's rape- it was about her life, her family, her friends. It didn't overwhelm you with too much dialogue or pure reflection on the rape. This book is really a story. It's simple and pure. A read that I think I'm a bit better for.	2003-09-29

The Boelyn Girl book was one of the best books I've read- ever. I thoroughly enjoyed it. This book on the other hand was very dry. Very dry.<br />I was disappointed when reading this book, at several stages I had to urge myself to &quot;plug along&quot;. It was not for total waste, the book did have some shining points. I guess it lacked most of the suspense and mystery that The Boelyn Girl had. And certainly I agree with the other reviewer that the only character that we really got to know, (her thoughts) was Elizabeth herself. It might have been helpful to get more insight on others.<br />The book was very detailed and I give the author a huge thanks for printing in the back a glossary of &quot;cast members&quot;. It came in handy, especially when one person could be and was called 4 different names, which made it hard to keep things straight.<br />I know this book was fiction, but less fiction than the Boelyn Girl, which could be what made it a little less exciting to read. So, I guess that's a plus and a minus in it's own way. If you are interested in Elizabeth, I would still recommend this book, but also with the warning that it's not fast paced. In it's own right it is worth the time to someone who's hobby is learning about this era.	2003-09-01

I've never read a book that took place during this period in time, so I'm new at this. But I'll tell you it totally surprised me how interesting the author made it. I expected it to be dry- it was so far from it. It's over 600 pages, but I couldn't put it down. I loved everything about it. So if you're new to this genre as well, I would recommend this book to you.<br />To those of you who read this type of a novel everyday, I know you might have a different opinion than me. This book is fiction, with some truth mixed in. Depending on what you think of that- I'd say you'd like this book or maybe not.<br />The reasons I liked this book so much-<br />It was easy to read. No vocabulary problems, no old-English spoken.<br />The characters were unforgettable. There were many, so you have to keep close tabs on who each are, but once they became major players, they really pull you in. Plus, knowing these people did exsist made it all the more fun.<br />The drama, betrayal, love, lust, passion, scandal, courage, strength, and suspense.<br />Go read it!	2003-08-27

I'm told by friends that this is where the series gets very good.<br />This book was the perfect blend of courtroom drama and murder-mystery suspense. That's what made this book so good. When one part of the story was moving a little slower, the other picked up pace. It fit perfectly. Also, the book keeps you guessing until the very end. It's fun to go on that journey with the cops and see where it leads you. Bonus when it's a surprise ending.<br />I think by this book the characters are getting fine tuned, and the author is finding his groove. I'm very excited to start the next book and see what it brings me.	2003-08-27

Well, at least this one and Gone for Good. I think I've found one of my new favorite suspense writers. This guy is great!<br />I loved this book because one- it's fast paced. You're not bored to death at the unimportant details of this guy's life. Two- the characters are likable. I love how at certain parts he's talking to you. Three- you don't have any idea how it will end up. But he feeds you enough along the way, so that you, like the character are figuring somethings out in the process.<br />This book was a fun read, it went by very quickly. If you're looking for a new author to try and you like authors like James Patterson, Michael Connelly or John Grisham, I'd recommend this book.	2003-08-27

Plus, it's huge- over 600 pages. First, I went into this not knowing much about this subject and the people, so if you're in the same boat this review might be helpful to you. <br />I loved it! The writing was so easy to get into and it was very easy to read. I was hooked after about 20 pages. And for me that's saying a lot. I really got into these people's lives and I often had to remind myself that this was not fact, but a lot of fiction. However, I find this story compelling and likely to be very close to the truth. <br />I really don't have a complaint about the book. I enjoyed everything about it. Most of all learning about life in the royal kingdom. As I said, I have never read any books on this subject or studied much about it in school, so I was thoroughly enthralled. If you're looking to try something new or kingdoms of England are a favorite of yours I really recommend this book. Beware that it's not all proven fact, but I think you won't mind once you see how fun reading this book is!	2003-08-17

And his past. <br />It's always fun when you know a character to go back and learn a little more about them and I felt this novel did a pretty good job of that. (I know the next one moves further into that category...) I also loved that it continues on from the book before it and his relationship with Sylvia. It's cool to see things progress, as if you're catching up with a friend.<br />What I enjoyed the most was how Connelly switched things up a little and added the courtroom drama. A bit of the break of the monotomy that can get to be a part of certain police crime books. And it was about a serial killer, which created a lot of suspense. I continue to be having fun while reading the Bosch series from Connelly.	2003-08-17

It was my first book by Gowdy and I don't think I'll be interested in reading more later either.<br />I enjoyed the characters, all except Abel, who was pretty much the center of the book. I enjoyed everyone from Louise's nanny to Abel's mother. I just couldn't feel for Abel, as he wasn't much of a lovable character to me. I couldn't understand what Louise saw in him.<br />I am an avid reader and I think that when I say I didn't understand where a story was going or what was the point- I think it's true for many readers. It started out ok, with some suspense when you hear Abel has just died (don't worry, I didn't give anything away, this was literally within the first 20 pages). You feel sad for Louise and wonder what lead up to this point. I was anxious for this great love story. That's not what this is though.<br />This book is a mess. You go from chapter to chapter not knowing what point in time the next chapter will be in. You go from present day where apparently Louis is in her 20's or 30's to when she's about 10 to when she's 17. In no order. I don't understand what the author was trying to do. I couldn't make heads or tails how she decided to order the book in the way she did. It was often confusing and frustrating. And I read many books that have the similar format of jumping back and forth in time frames, but never have I read a book like this where there seems to be no thought or order put into it. Maybe it's just me?<br />I also didn't care for Abel's &quot;ending&quot;. There wasn't much to explain why he was the way he was. Left me wondering a bit. As the whole book did really.	2003-08-04

Elizabeth Berg first hit my radar screen when her book Open House was selected as an Oprah book club pick. And as many of Oprah's authors have become to me, she's now a favorite of mine.<br />I have read all of Berg's books, save two. Something about her writing draws me in. And it seems that the more writing she does, it gets better and better. While I enjoyed her earlier books such as What We Keep, her later books have only displayed her talent polished.<br />Say When is about Griffin, a man whose wife recently told him she was having an affair and that she wanted a divorce. While he had an idea of what was going on, he seems to have had no idea that their issues ran so deep. He is in a bit of denial. This is a story of a man still in love with his wife, and unsure where to go from here. He won't move out and leave his daughter. He still wants to try and be with his wife. He begins to see the mistakes he made along the way.<br />What I enjoyed most about the book is that I could relate to Griffin. I think even though not everyone has gone through a divorce or seperation- most people have had a loved one cheat on them or gone through a break-up. This book is kind of comfort food for you. Or something where you can look back and say, \\"gosh, I was just like that, how stupid I was! I'm glad I'm better now.\\"<br />What I appreciate about Berg's books is that they are a very easy read and considerably short. Most are about 200-300 pages. But she still manages to cram in the best story possible. Elizabeth Berg has earned herself the role of being one of my most favorite women's authors. If you like women's novels, I am recommending her to you too. This is a great book to start with as well.	2003-07-31

I've only read the first two books in this series, and obviously the author was still finding his way a little as he was writing these first few books...but they were still great. I am very excited about the rest of the series. They seem to just get better, so far anyway. Harry Bosch is a dynamic character. And I enjoy anything with suspense, and a homocide cop's life is certainly on the edge! If you like James Patterson, Michael Connelly is surely great competition!	2003-07-26

I have always been meaning to, but when she brought back her book club, that was it. I know this book has gotten very mixed reviews over the years, as well as the author himself. It seems you either love Steinbeck or hate him. After reading East of Eden, I love him. I am a big fan of the good vs. evil, so this book was right up my alley. I enjoyed pretty much everything about it. I liked the characters, the suspense, the story and the way it was written (so very easy to read- I didn't have to pull out my dictionary once!). Don't get me wrong, it's not impeccable, but it is a great read. To anyone who is thinking about starting to read \\"classics\\"- this might be a great one to start with!	2003-07-26

I was warned that the first books are finding their way a bit, but as they go on, they get better. I was quite impressed with this book and the character of Harry. Enjoyed it.<br />Only thing that hindering me from rating it a 5 was that Harry isn't a character that you immediately like. It takes a while. And the ending was a bit predictable. Either that or I'm a good sleuth.<br />I can't wait to read the following books in the series. I have an inkling they only get better.	2003-06-30

Having read Jewel and being impressed, I looked into Lott's other works. This is the first on my list. I enjoyed the book, even though reading something from 1987 can often be disapppointing. I enjoyed the characters of Rick, his friends and Paige. The only thing I'd change is add a little more rememberences of Rick's and Paige's relationship. I'd like to get to know Paige a little better. I recommend giving this book a shot!	2003-06-22

While the characters are different, the writing is close to the same caliber. Good in Bed was in my opinion better, but this book is still worth reading.

For instance the government at the time or something going on in popular culture.<br />What I enjoyed the most was the stories about the grandma and mother. I felt this was really a good book.

I am on to the next books in the series and I'm really excited, I think McCrumb has great potential as a writer. She creates stories and characters that you just seem to become wrapped up in.

I had a hard time remembering each character and who she &quot;was&quot; and what she was going though. Thus, I didn't become attached to any character. I also didn't like that these girls didn't seem to be that good of friends, they hardly kept in touch!<br />Didn't like the ending. Why are we given an update on several characters that were never mentioned through out the book at all? Could have totally left that out.<br />What I liked:<br />Good plot. And I liked that the characters were all going through different things in their lives.<br />I did feel some suspense for what was going to happen.<br />Overall the book was ok.

Life of Pi is one of those books for me. It was just so different from what I had been reading lately, it was like a breath of fresh air.<br />What I really enjoyed about the book was that I learned a lot about the habits of animals. Did you know that if a hyena becomes hot he will urinate on the ground to create a mud bath & roll around in it to cool off?<br />I also learned a lot about what to do if I was stranded in the middle of the ocean and how to survive. I didn't know that there are contraptions to turn salt water into fresh water. I found out you can kill a sea turtle and drink his blood.<br />I thought the author did a tremendous job of putting you in Pi's shoes and what it would be like to be alone in the middle of the Pacific ocean. How would you feel? His words almost brought me to tears. And the scenes where he had to kill for food, literally made me gag. His injuries due to exposure or lack of food made me cringe.<br />If you liked the movie Cast Away, I'd recommend this book. Or if you like adventure books. Or anything about human nature and survival. As the author boasts, this story will make you believe in God.	2003-03-31

She is a writing genius. This story will carry you along, you won't even know what happened. Good pick ...!<br />...<br />This story is (obviously) about a 3 year old boy who is kidnapped. Mitchard puts you inside the heads of the mother and the older brother, who tell the story and their thoughts.<br />I really lost myself in this book. I kept thinking about what if I was in their place. How would I feel, what would I do. And it's almost scary to watch this family be torn apart. To watch them deal with things. I even found myself judging the mother and how she reacted to this tragedy.<br />And Vincent the brother, he too has a very hard time dealing with his family. Your heart goes out to this little boy. These characters are so real, so flawed. They're human. It's as if you feel you need to turn your head away, that you're a peeping tom. I think that's what pulls you in, it's just so realistic.<br />...	2003-02-27

There was one small section that I couldn't get into (I can't say what, without giving something away), but the rest of the book was good.<br />I gave the book only 3 stars (it was between 3 &amp; 4), just because there were some things that I just didn't get into.

You wouldn't know it by reading &quot;The Street Lawyer&quot;.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book, the sleve didn't give the whole plot away, and I enjoy that. Also, this book had the right length, not too long-winded, not too short. That's something hard to find. This book moved with a pretty fast pace. You'll find yourself wondering where your time went.<br />The characters are very cool. The plot is worked out just right. And there's a good mix of human interest &amp; suspense. Oh- and another bonus, you know how sometimes you're reading and there are so many characters, you forget who is who? Well, this book doesn't have an exorbitant amount, but there were two times where I thought, who is this? (They were minor characters) And, bam, there was an immediate explanation, reminding you of who they were- repeating a scene or mentioning the connection. That was super.<br />I definitely recommend this book for people who like surprises, action and fun.	2003-02-06

The Face of Deception by Iris Johansen is a book that keeps you constantly on the edge of your seat.<br />The book is about a Forensic sculptor whose daughter was kidnapped & murdered. She is trying to get on with her life when a very wealthy man asks for her help in re-constructing a face. But with the money he is offering and his status in society (similar to Bill Gates), there must be a catch...and there is.<br />You'll have to read the book to find out what happens from there. I don't want to spoil anything. But as I mentioned above, it's a really suspenseful book. Time flies as you're reading it. I haven't read Ms. Johansen before, I'm likely to come back to her. I guess there is another stoy featuring this character, Eve Duncan, I'll be sure to check that out.<br />It's not only the suspense that makes this a great book. First, it's a good subject, and written well. Many times writers have a great idea, but doesn't come to fruition. Ms. Johansen does it with finess. Second, the characters are very likable & believable. A definite plus. Lastly, the book is written at a satisfying pace. Not too long, or too short. Perfect. Which is also rare.<br />The Face of Deception actually would make a good movie...	2003-01-24

Ok, so I'm a little behind the times since this book was written in 1998. And yes, it has been on my bookshelf for that long (I joined a book club a few years ago, got tons of books, and I'm still trying to catch up).<br />Anyway, I have only read one other book by Nora Roberts, so I am not what you would call her &quot;average&quot; fan, since I know she is widely popular amoung romance genre readers. I think this makes me a prime candidate to review her books objectively...<br />The Reef is about two families, one comprised of an uncle &amp; his nephew &amp; the other a family with one daughter. They are both what you would call treasure hunters (or something like that, they dive for treasures, shipwrecks under the sea). So, they team up &amp; embark on a mission to find a certain shipwreck with a certain very valuable necklace called Angelique's Curse. Why you might ask- well, because it's worth millions &amp; the main hero in the book has set out to beat an old enemy to it. Of course he &amp; the daughter, Tate, begin a romance. Come on, what did you expect?<br />What ensues is a fairly interesting fiction novel. It' nothing extraordinary. No real big surprises or plot twists.<br />I did have a bit of a problem concentrating on this book. I don't know if I've just been restless, or if it's the book itself. I would often find myself drifting off into my own little world about what I had to do the next day, what's for dinner; while I was reading.<br />I give this book three out of five stars. It was surely lacking something. Maybe creativity. But then again, what do you expect from a book like this?<br />However, I still enjoyed the plot &amp; the characters. I even learned a little about treasure hunters. Neato!	2003-01-24

I found it a very interesting look into Ms. Steel's life, which I didn't know much of, but I have been a huge fan for years. I really appreciate how candid she was. I hope writing the book brought her some satisfaction & maybe a little bit of closure- as it helped her readers understand the disease of manic depression.

The visual of a movie would add to the plot more than the book, since you have to use your imagination more when reading.<br />The book isn't very long- only 265 pages.<br />It's basically a fun, quick read. Something to bring to the beach or read over a weekend.<br />The plot wasn't too light though- there were some serious undertones, especially if you can relate to the wife Sylvie.  Or I suppose even if you can relate to the mistress Marla. Their lives aren't so wonderful. I did like how Ms. Goldsmith made the book &quot;light reading&quot;, but she also included some &quot;heavy&quot; topics. A nice balance.	2003-01-09

This book didn't disappoint.<br />It took a little bit for the story to get going, but not long, and when it did, you were drawn in to the characters lives.

I agree with an earlier reviewer in that there were too many sub-plots & characters.<br />I did end up liking the book, and I was VERY close to putting it down & not finishing it. I am glad I stuck it out.<br />The characters are memorable. Their plights, long & hard.<br />You will cringe with them when things go wrong. It's a story that is so believable it feels real.

It's in present tense? I don't know if I've ever read a book written in present tense...and I read alot! Get past the first 50-100 pages and it picks up, QUICK! Wow, I couldn't put it down. Maybe it's because it made me think of my first love. And what it's like when it feels as if things are unresolved. And hey, everyone likes a story about true love, soul mates...or so it seems.<br />I won't spoil this story. But let's just say, there's much more to this book than meets the eye. I really enjoyed it. There's one paragraph where it talks about how March's love for Hollis has been everywhere around her in the past years, in a tree in her back yard, her bathwater, her tears...(it's much more eloquent, but I can't recall the exact words)...and that a true love never lets you go until he's finished with you. (that was put better too...) WOW. Great stuff. Gave me chills.<br />I don't think this book will disappoint you. It will cause you to think, to hate certain characters, to love others...to get mad, to cry, to laugh-- but that's what a good book does. And this is one.	2002-12-09

This story gave us a wonderful insight to a family of 6 children, one of them born [mentally handicapped], named Brenda Kay.  The nice thing about this story is that it's not just about Brenda Kay; it's about a marriage, it's about all of the children & their triumph's & struggles. It's about what it's like to live in Mississippi in the 40's & 50's. Mr. Lott does fill up the book with a lot of description of the surroundings, or of what Jewel is thinking about, etc. I felt that it wasn't too overwhelming, as some readers mentioned.  I really enjoyed Oprah's selection. I am now curious, never having read Bret Lott before, if his other books are just as good.	2002-12-05

I think it is a hard to give an old story a new &amp; exciting twist, but Dunour did a pretty good job handling that. I'm not sure if the story could have &quot;flown&quot; better though...what he did was combine two stories, one of Adam &amp; Eve &amp; another of Noah &amp; the Ark. And he would go back &amp; forth with each story until the end where they reached their climaxes together. I think I would have enjoyed it better if it would have just been one story after the other, in chronological order, but then again, I see how this concept added to the eventful ending. So, I'm not decided on that yet...The other criticism I have is that the story should have moved a little faster, or included more action (activity). At many points the story dragged, but it picked up towards the middle where both stories started picking up.  However, it seemed to take the author many chapters just for small things to happen.<br />Over all, the book was enjoyable. Definately interesting to see old stories like these re-written. Helps people relate to them a little more I think. I'd recommend reading it &amp; see what you think.	2002-12-02

I felt this was a strong second book for Schwarz. I enjoyed reading this book, but let me say that I do understand where a reader can wonder in the first 100 pages or so where this story is going...I mean, if you read the jacket of the book, you know where it's going, but...it takes a bit to get there. After I got further into the book, I understood the strong back ground was to show the reader what it was like to BE Margaret, a writer-want-to-be (at that point). After that brief intro to her &amp; her friend, the book really picks up, and I begin to groan for Letty &amp; her situation, finally taking note where it is headed. I really enjoyed reading this book, thought the ending was worthy as well, and whether I liked the ending or not makes a big difference to me. The only thing I would change is that on the jacket of the book, to not mention where Margaret gets her story idea from. I think more &amp; more things for movies &amp; books aren't left to the reader or viewer to discover, we're given the whole plot in a preview or review. This jacket doesn't give it all away, however, I think it would have been an excellent surprise in reading, if one didn't know where Margaret's big inspiration was going to come from. Other than that, I'm definitely recommend reading this book. It will give you an appreciation for writers.	2002-12-02

Is it just me, or was the whole plot written on the front flap of the book?  I think this author should have kept some of the details secret, keep the reader in suspense &amp; surprise us as the story unfolds. Like the majority of good books.  How great is it when you are reading along &amp; something amazing &amp; shocking happens that you didn't see coming?  I read about 35 pages of this book &amp; I put it down.  I just couldn't get into it. I found the dialogue very dry. I also felt like it was being written almost in movie format, not first person.  Some of the thoughts were very over-dramatic.  And I really just felt like what was the point in reading this book, when I knew what was going to happen from the flap?

I finally got around to reading the book, and I admit it had a slow start, but when it started to pick up the pace, it really started!!<br />I have to say the movie also did a wonderful job of staying true to the book. This book is written very uniquely, and you feel as if you are on a journey of discovery, as the characters are. It feels like life itself is happening and you are watching, it unfolds true to form. The characters are a bit of a mystery.<br />Ginny is the only one we really get to have a close look at, and the others we get a good idea, but some things are left to our imaginations, but it this case, I think it helps propell the book along, and create excitement &amp; interest.<br />I do recommend this book, but warn to stay on track &amp; not let the first 100 or so pages discourage you.	2002-11-07

She did a great job of describing what happens to someone who is dying of cancer- an honest portrayal.  I also enjoyed Black & Blue.	2002-10-30

And then a family adopting you and...what then?  These four stories show that sometimes finding a family isn't all that it's cracked up to be. Families have issues, problems, arguments, tragedy...<br />I really enjoyed all four of these mini-books in one big collection. I don't think I would have enjoyed them if they were seperated.  The stories kind of built off of each other.  I really enjoyed watching these girls struggle to be themselves &amp; to get through their own seperate tragedies &amp; obstacles.  I couldn't wait for some of the characters who were nasty to get what was coming to them.<br />The characters were developed pretty well &amp; the stories flowed at a perfect pace, not dragged out or made to read too quick.<br />Flowers in the Attic series is still my fav. though!	2002-10-28

Then it gets hard to follow what is going on, he's thinking to himself, he's reminiscing about his family, then he's talking with his friends, he's looking at pics of old girlfriends, some girl decides to stop by, they are analyzing a letter his friend Gerrard wrote....where is he going with all of this?! I felt over-whelmed, did he want to introduce us to the character, his family? His friends?? Then mix past with present?? Then you hear about how Gerrard is a kind of womanizer, but I thought Harry was too? It's unclear what traits they have that seperate them. I guess this book isn't my cup of tea!	2002-10-02

But I think you can see what Koontz was using for the premise of this novel.<br />I think what it needed was a longer conclusion when it came to dealing with the &quot;bad guy&quot;.

Well, I have to agree with the other reviewers in this case...this wasn't my favorite of Ms. Rices works.  It was a little slow starting up &amp; I felt that there should have been some more character development on certain characters.  She brought in this extended family, and then left you wondering what was happening with them, first you see them, now you don't.<br />She did try to catch you up though, you weren't totally in the dark.  I felt that the &quot;main&quot; story, was a great one.  It is very interesting to see how people might handle certain situations thrown at them, like a partially-deaf child.<br />I really enjoyed the last half of the book the most.  I think it was worth the read, but still, not up to her best, try: Follow The Stars Home &amp; Stone Heart.	2002-08-19

It did do some explaining about her family, I'd say it was about the most interesting part of the book.  The rest was just jumbled thoughts.  The story didn't go anywhere.

At first I was wondering if it would be boring, being that it was set in the 1700's, but I was wrong.<br />It didn't take long to get immersed in the story at all.<br />I didn't find Mary Saunders so unforgivable either.  I felt like I could see where she was coming from.  Anyone who has a desire for money & finer things, I think can see her point of view.<br />Not that you'd \\"stoop\\" to doing what she did to get those things, but especially nowadays when it seems so easy to get into something like being a topless dancer, you can see the temptation.  You can also feel for her & imagine the degradation.<br />The only thing I wish was that it didn't say on the inside flap anything about a crime (I won't say what kind), I felt it would have been a great surprise at the end.  Also, there were some characters whom I won't name either, but I would have liked to hear what became of them.<br />Interesting book though.	2002-07-23

This book is one of the hardest I've had to rate, in trying to decide what it deserves, in my opinion.  I think a 3 &amp; a half stars. I say that because for half of the book, the reading was very tedious &amp; boring.  I was not enjoying the book at all, and I had many thoughts of just putting it down &amp; not finishing it.<br />However, it did start to get interesting &amp; things began to turn around towards the last half or even later of the book. I don't want to spoil any story lines, but I'll just say out of the several personalities Pran took on, the later caught my attention  much more.  I started to wonder what was going to happen next. There were other aspects about this book that I had a hard time with too, though.  One being that there was a LOT of description, and little dialogue. Two, I felt I didn't get a very good look into the main character himself.  I didn't finish the book knowing much about his thoughts.  At times I was frustrated when much detail was put into other characters and their back grounds, I felt it unnecessary, especially if there wasn't much time devoted to Pran.  But, you might want to try this book for yourself.  If you can get past the first half, I think you'll enjoy the second.  This isn't for those that tire easily though, and the writing contains a lot of words you might need a dictionary for.	2002-07-08

Ok, I've never read McEwan before...there's a list of his books that I'd like to read, but after reading this one...<br />I don't know, I think I will give him one more chance.<br />This book was awful! It was very boring.<br />First, take the book, some 350 pages & flip through it looking through the words---see many quotes for conversations??<br />That's because there aren't many! That's one problem<br />Second, start reading if you like, then start to notice that the author uses 20 words to describe something where one work would have sufficed.  Then notice that this goes on, on EVERY page!!<br />This book could have been shortened up to probably 150 pages. Easy!<br />I had a very hard time getting through this book.

I think I enjoyed this book so much because the author did an excellent job of placing you in the characters shoes.  Imagine being lost in the Congo, a jungle in Africa.  I also enjoyed the fact that there was more to the story than just that obstacle, but also other things going on in the man's life.  I enjoyed learning about what is going on in Africa.  I could picture being there.  This book is a ride that keeps the pages turning, the only thing I would change is to make the ending a little longer so the reader can &quot;appreciate&quot; the outcome (without giving too much away).  This was a very good first book &amp; a great story about overcoming obstacles.	2002-06-21

At first I was worried that it might be filled with descriptions of the war &amp; fighting.  It was to some extent, but the stories that each of the people told kept it going...they were the best part of the reading.  It tied everything in...mixed with the descriptions of war &amp; the problems this group of people faced from the Japanese brought everything together.  The ending of this book was excellent.  On top of all that, I learned a lot about the Phillippeans &amp; it's history. I was very impressed by this new author &amp; look forward to reading her next works.	2002-06-13

Her books are great to curl up &amp; relax with.  You can loose yourself in them, if you let yourself.  Most of her books are quick reads.  They are about feelings, love, family, tragedy...<br />This book wasn't quite what I was expecting.  Like someone else mentioned, it's not your typical romance story, quite the opposite.  Berg does a great job of putting you into Myra's shoes and making you understand what it would be like to be her.<br />She has a very interesting relationship with Chip &amp; Diann- makes the pages turn quickly.  The best part is the epilogue...made me cry.  Like I said, you won't be disappointed.	2002-06-04

I read Daughter of Fortune and it was much of the same way for me, but it picked up after the first 75 pages.

I find it inspiring to read about people who have such courage &amp; stength.  The book didn't quite measure to my standards though. First, I felt the story could have been better told if it was told as a &quot;story&quot;. It was to some extent, but not quite, because she was narrating and not just leting the story come about. Second, I guess it was just hard to feel a lot of pity for her, after reading about the hollocaust &amp; other cases of more &quot;extreme&quot; punishment. Don't get me wrong, a great injustice was done &amp; it's horrible, because these people are scarred forever. But especially the first few places they were held, wasn't quite like the prison I expected. It was more of a house arrest. Also, it did leave you hanging- why did her father start a coup?? It was an alright read. It was just hard to stay interested at a lot of points. However, I wish Malika &amp; her family all of the justice &amp; happiness they deserve.	2002-05-17

The problem lies in the fact that she is a novel-writer. She writes 500-700 pages to tell her story. Not 200.  This is a outline really of a story.  You have no chance to feel connected to the characters.  It keeps you pretty much interested, but you are left feeling a little bereft, like there was so much more that could have been written about. I enjoyed the gift &amp; special delivery much more.	2002-05-15

This book had very little to do with the disease.  I didn't learn a single thing about the disease from this book, and I don't know much about it to start off with. I felt Franzen used the disease to pump up & sell his book, and then instead dealt with ridiculous issues of this family. And the issues of this family are so OLD & pathetic. I didn't really need to read ANOTHER book about a disfunctional family where one brother can't hold down a job, the mother is ignorant & inept, another sibling is having marital problems & another can't hold onto a relationship!! How over-written about is that??  Where did the Parkinson's come in?<br />Only a tiny portion of the book came from the fathers point of view, and in that, it was dealt with very superficially & I didn't get any idea of what it was like to be him!! That's why I was reading this book....It was very slow, the end did pick up though, (I admit the ending was a bit better than the rest of this large book). I kept reading to see how it would turn out...would Franzen EVER deal with Parkinson's??? Barely.	2002-05-14

Rubio did a wonderful job of placing me in someones shoes that has Tourettes.  I was so pleased when I started reading from page one and I couldn't put it down. It isn't one of those books that is supposed to deal with something, and then you read it and feel cheated (like The Corrections that barely touched the surface of Parkinsons). I felt like I understood Icy's need to tic &amp; jerk. I learned a lot about the disease. I loved the characters &amp; their development, there wasn't anywhere where you were left hanging. The end was kind of out of place though....but if it didn't say this WASN'T a true story, I'd think it was.	2002-05-14

I've never read about homeopathy before, and I found this book very interesting because of that. The way the story unfolds makes it a book that is hard to put down. It was a pretty quick read as well- read it in 2 days. I don't know if I really like the ending or not, but it's not all that bad, just can't decide.  If you haven't read anything by Chris yet, this book is a good one to start with.  Hangman is also very good, but it is quite different from his other works.  But that's what makes him so fun, always different topics, you never know what you'll get. Great book from a great writer	2002-05-09

The author did a good job to get you &quot;hooked&quot; on the characters. You wanted to know where they came from, and he explained that, and where they were going, he did that.

I decided to re-read this book, the very first of hers I'd read, wondering if it is as good as I remember.  Not quite, but it was still pretty good.<br /><br />The book is essentially about 3 sisters who are born to a well-off family, but through unfortunate circumstances are orphaned and grow up seperately.  I won't give anything else away about their lives, but suffice it to say that they all grow up in very different homes to be very different people.  The title is very appropriate, because as it is written in the book that illustrates this so brilliantly, with the slight turn of a kaleidoscope, the scope of our lives can change in an instant.<br /><br />If you are looking for some better \\"classic\\" DS, this is a good place to start!  Still hands down much better than her newer books.	2002-04-25

It didn't deal with Parkinsons the way I thought it should or could though. I don't know too much about it & I though this book would \\"enlighten\\" me, which it did to some extent.

It's interesting how she takes two people and &quot;rewinds&quot; their life, as opposed to the usual moving forward.  I have to admit the last third of the book was a surprise, she did a good job of keeping the reader guessing.	2002-04-23

You can't put her books down.<br />They are all good.  Her stories are real, they are about life, love, death, family...<br />This is one of my favorites of hers.  I think I like her books so much because they flow, are so easy to read.  Kind of \\"light\\" reading.	2002-04-23

I have read all of Anita Shreve's books...and I keep saying they are all on my favorites list.  I can't decide!  They are all so good, you can't put them down.  You stay up at night, you make extra time during the day...This is a story that takes place in the early 1900's, but with her description, you feel you are there, you can understand the time &amp; place.  And even though things that might be a huge scandal then, might not be now...you can still imagine the truth &amp; the scandal way back then.	2002-04-23

If you haven't read her before, this is a good book to try.  I love all of her stories, they are so easy to relate to.  They are also realistic.<br />This book will make you cry, it's a lot like the movie Random Hearts, so if you liked that movie...	2002-04-23

I know most of the reviews here aren't so positive, but I found this book a good read.  It is the first Luanne Rice book I have read, and it won't be the last.  I thought the story was a sad, but realistic one.  It was filled with surprises, twists &amp; turns.<br />I enjoyed the characters, but at times, didn't understand where they were coming from.  However, I believe that in a good read, you get more than the predictable story &amp; characters you can relate to.  There should be characters who you CAN'T relate to.  But at that instance, you learn about people &amp; human nature.<br />And at the end of the story, it should make you stop &amp;  think about a situation or attitude that before you didn't know or consider.  I recommend this book.	2002-04-01

She doesn't write stories like this anymore.  You pretty much hear the life story of the main character and in the end, it feels like  a reward.	2002-03-20

I watched the movie to this book when it aired on TV in 1993.  I really enjoyed it and finally I have gotten around to reading the book.  Usually the book is much better than the movie, but I have to say I was very disappointed with this book.  Sue Miller, from what I have noticed has different styles for some of her books.  I enjoyed For Love & Distinguished Guest.  Family Pictures, just kind of threw me.  Her books are hard to get into when you start reading them.  And as I also noticed in the distinguished guest, when she begins to introduce you to the characters and stories, it seems like she doesn't know which direction she wants to go in.  She will mention characters & then never again (and as in the d. guest, they were close family members!). Then you never know from which chapter to the next whose eyes you are looking through.  There is no pattern.  I'd have enjoyed the book more if there was a sequence.  Also, I do agree with the other person who mentioned that she doesn't get into the characters feelings & thoughts as much as she could.  Don't get me wrong, she does spend time on this, but her efforts fell short for me.  I do enjoy the fact that miller probes into the family life.  Her characters are complex & interesting.  However, the book should have been taken from the movie, they had the right idea there.	2002-03-05
