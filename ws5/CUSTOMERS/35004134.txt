Almost simple - there is no victim, at least not yet. Someone is slowly poisoning Lord Vetinari, the local tyrant. Then, the murder occurs, but the wrong one. Rather, the wrong ones. First priest and a baker (of sorts), then two more. There are clues OK, but all the wrong ones. It's important to keep Vetinari alive. That's not because anyone actually likes the man, but because all the alternatives are worse.<br /><br />Pratchett keeps the story moving, beginning to end, and manages to wrap a number of the familiar police watchmen into the story. There's Angua - when she has her monthlies, she'll bite your head off, vegetarian or not. There's Cheri, introducing the idea of women's lib to people who've barely got the idea of women. There are alots of other disparate sorts, too, under commander Vimes. The city is peopled by trolls, gnomes, dwarves, vampires, and seemingly endless other species, at each others' throats half the time (remember the Vampires?), and it's Vimes' job to maintain peace between them. The only solution he's found so far is to racially integrate at a level that surprises everyone, especially the people involved.<br /><br />Although Pratchett uses lots of characters from earlier Discworld volumes, the new reader should feel right at home. It's a great break from a busy schedule, and a great intro to Discworld. Enjoy!<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-10-11

The storytelling takes many forms, with varied styles of artwork chosen to carry each story in the best way.<br /><br />All those great features of the Sandman series come together in my disappointment in this volume. The artwork is jagged and graphic, the kind that expresses the sound of breaking glass but not much else. The story never really grabbed me, either. The \\"kindly ones\\" themselves refer back to many classic myths, but somehow never settled on one, or developed any of the traditional roles very strongly.<br /><br />I've been reading the collected volumes of Sandman out of order, and this is the only one I had left to read. I'm glad of that. If I had come across this volume first, I might never have pursued the others.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-10-09

It discusses the many kinds of etching, including lift and aquatint processes, up to relief etching. Soft ground gets more attention here than most authors give it, including various aspects of using paper as a tool to transfer or create an image. Chamberlain also covers the techniques where the toolmarks create the image directly: engraving, drypoint, crivee, and collage-like \\"metal graphic.\\" Mezzotint, so unlike the other processes, gets separate discussion of its own. Chamberlain is especially helpful in offering alternatives to the laborious rocker ground, including aquatint and abrasive techniques.<br /><br />Later chapters address the basics of paper, ink, and press. Of course, there's that moment when all the pieces come together and print is pulled. Then, discuss covers some of the techniques and problems of drying the finished print - preserving the embossing that comes from intaglio process, while avoiding the cockling that carelessly dried paper is subject to.<br /><br />This won't stand by itself as a how-to guide for a beginning engraver or etcher. It is helpful, though, in summarizing the many ways to make marks on the plate, including some unusual transfer techniques. This helps the print-lover as well. I find myself intriuged by the marks in an image as much as by the image itself. Knowing the means used to convert the artist's imagination into reality only heightens my enjoyment. No book on intaglio process covers everything, but this book certainly carries its weight in describing both common and unusual techniques. I recommend it highly.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-10-08

Lord Vetinari is not a crude man, and would never offer anythign as crude as \\"the offer you can't refuse.\\" You can always refuse. All you need to do is adjust expectations about your lifespan downwards by a good bit if you do.<br /><br />It was an adjustment that Mr. Moist von Lipwig was unwilling to make, given that his recent execution was very fresh in his mind. What was this fate marginally preferable to another death? Civil service. And that doesn't just mean being polite. Moist became the new Postmaster, reviving the moribund band of letter carriers, and finding some way to enhance his undocumented retirement fund in the process. The extra challenge here was competition from the \\"clacks\\", a sort of mechanical internet (staffed by recognizable networking geeks), that could send a message across thousands of miles in just a few hours.<br /><br />Moist, of course, succeeds, despite the rapacious financial lords of the competition, despite his geologically implacable parole officer, and despite his own chronic failure at anything resembling honesty. Come to think of it, that whole honesty thing seems over-rated by a fair margin, especially when there's a lot more work to do than time in which it can possibly be done.<br /><br />Pratchett succeeds in keeping his Discworld franchise alive and healthy, infusing old characters and story lines with new life. He manages to connect to all the dozens of previous Discworld books and also to connect to the first-time reader. And, after so many books in the series, he keeps the new ideas coming - like the dreaded Woodpecker, the internet virus that would bring the network of gears and pulleys crashing down around their ears. (If you've ever seen data-dependent networking failures, this one will have a gut-sinking reality about it.)<br /><br />If this new document of Discworld events lacks the frenzy of earlier volumes, it lacks nothing in cleverness and good fun.

Temporarily exiled from his native world for scientific discoveries in conflict with the traditional texts, Micromegas wanders the galaxy in search of new knowledge and experience. Of course, he wanders to Earth.<br /><br />Since he's about 24,000 times taller than a human, simply discovering that people exist at all was a major feat of microscopy for him. As one might expect, Micromegas' huge size seems to comment on human insignificance when seen in the cosmic scale.<br /><br />This little booklet (under 40 pages of translation, and less than regular paperback size) is satire of a very warm sort. Voltaire manages to infuse Micromegas and his traveler's tales with a sense of wonder about all the possibilities that an infinite universe might offer. And, although humans are among the smallest in very many ways, Voltaire conveys that without ridicule - small and limited, people are as God made them.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-10-04
19902:US	35004134	R3CT704W59MIMZ	1584884916	51889808	The Ten Most Wanted Solutions in Protein Bioinformatics (Chapman & Hall/CRC Mathematical and Computational Biology)	Books	3	3	3	N	Y	Depends on what you want	This book delivers reasonably well on the promise in its title: it does a good job in stating the most computational interesting problems relating to proteins. It assumes the reader knows a little about biochemistry, biology, and computational techniques, but only a little about each. Given that base, it does a fair job in describing problems related to protein structure, function, analysis, and design. It's not an advanced text, in either its computational or biological sides, but not an elementary introduction, either. Someone a bit above novice level will probably get the most out of it.<br /><br />A few things left me a bit leery about this text, though. Despite its 2005 copyright date, the author (p.53) cites an estimate of human 50,000 genes. I'm not sure where (or when) that number comes from, because most estimates today are closer to 30,000. There was another a minor annoyance in the discussion of convolution as a tool in protein docking. The failure to distinguish convolution from correlation is minor and forgivable. Saying that one \\"convolutes\\" a convolution is like say that one \\"revolutes\\" a revolution. Revolve: revolution, convolve: convolution. Also, the Fourier transform step in correlation, especially when docking a small molecule to a protein, is an optimization rather than a requirement. Transform-based correlation gives better performance for asymptotically large models. In some computing environments, for models of realistic sizes, the simplicity of direct correlation gives a performance advantage - and allows non-linear scoring algorithms that would be impossible with the transform approach.<br /><br />This is a fair introduction to many of the ways people study proteins computationally, and to the kinds of tools required. There is very little computaitonal detail, however. It may help a tool-builder create a conceptual base for studying proteins, but won't help much with the specific calculations.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-10-02

As a result, I'm puzzled about how this author managed to cram so much great informtation into it. It covers the basics of etching, engraving, soft-ground, sugar-lift, aquatint, mezzotint, drypoint, and a few other techniques, along with preparing the intaglio plate, trial proofs of various kinds, and seemingly endless tips for the artist working in a small, self-equipped studio.<br /><br />Banister puts strong emphasis on home-made equipment. The most exotic tool he describes is a glass muller for mixing ink. Even then he notes how to put it together, using the kind of glass blank used for telescope mirrors. The book has a few formulas for etchants and grounds, but fewer than other books - the real strength here is in discussion of tools and technique, down to very practical details. Photos showing tools and techniques are quite helpful, but Banister complements them with written detail of fine points that would be hard to capture photographically.<br /><br />This is a great resource for an admirer of prints (like me), who wants to know more about how prints and the marks in them are made. I imagine that it would be very helpful for beginning printers, too, especially those without access to a big studio or expert guidance.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-10-02

The individual photos are lovely, but the collection as a whole is striking in the variety that it presents. \\"Black\\" coloring covers a wide range of skin tones, represented reasonably well here. The women's faces are simply amazing, however. There is endless variety in their shapes and proportions, far more than in collections of European models. Each woamn's face is unique and appealing, but the range of different faces struck me again and again.<br /><br />The models all appear to be young adults - like so many other collections of figure photos, more mature beauty isn't given its due. Also, the large majority of photos are half- or three-quarter length portraits. The upper body is well represented, but the models' hips and legs are commonly left out. That decision dropped a huge number of opportunities to show the grace and strength of the whole figure, and left me slightly disappointed.<br /><br />But only slightly.

At the time of its translation, there was a 350 year uncertainty in the text's original date possibly as late as 1526 or so - in an case, millenia after Vatsyayana's original manual.<br /><br />This is less a book of erotic practice, and much more about the superstitions and pharmacopeia relating to physical love. The prescriptions cover a remarkably familiar range:<br /><br />- freshening of breath and body scent,<br /><br />- enhancement and delay of ejaculation,<br /><br />- induction, avoidance, and even termination of pregnancy,<br /><br />- growth and coloring of hair,<br /><br />- removal and bleaning of hair,<br /><br />- antiperspirants,<br /><br />and openly magical formulas for ensuring constancy or obedience. Many of the recipes make some pharmacological sense. Datura, belladonna, and mandrake are known in the west, too; the irritation caused by peppers and other noxious plants would surely 'stimulate' tissues as tender as his or her genitals. Much of the formulary is just scary: bold use of mercury in many forms would turn the seducer's bed into a Superfund site, and white lead would certainly have some effect on anyone who ingests it, in the long run. Among the magical formulas, the least stomach-turning ingredients include her menstrual blood and his semen.<br /><br />More than just medicine, this book captures beliefs spanning astrology, palmistry, and a catalog of generalizations that simply baffle a modern reader. Kalayana lists a number of types of women, categorized primarily by configuration of yoni, and goes on at great length about the temperament, appearance, kinds of love-play, and even catalogs of caresses specific to each part of the body, different for each category of woman. The implicit racism is at least unsettling to a modern reader, but was probably quite ordinary to a Victorian Europe where even national boundaries were said to define somatotypes and temperaments.<br /><br />A few chapters toward the end recapitulates the Kama Sutra's couplings and rules for proper partners, in a half-hearted kind of way. Remember that both the original and the Victorian translation were aimed at a male readership. That means that, although the pharmacy and spell-casting were of interest, the most remarkable focus of this book is on deducing dozens of intimate characteristics about a woman without going to the trouble of collecting or checking the data first-hand. Instead, we read page after page of sweeping generalizations. One might hope that we, as a society, had grown past such things, but I'm not so sure that modern locker room lore is all that different.<br /><br />//wiredweirdwere said to define somatotypes and temperaments.  <br /> <br />A few chapters toward the end recapitulates the Kama Sutra's couplings and rules for proper partners, in a half-hearted kind of way.

Waterhouse	Books	4	29	33	N	N	Wonderful book on Waterhouse	but on the pre-Raphaelites as a group, too.<br /><br />Waterhouse's subject are almost always willowy, languid models from mythological themes. He often chooses scenes and poses that emphasize the youthful woman's partial deshabille - others in this school, especially Alma-Tadema, found more ways to lose more of the clothing, though. Waterhouse was active during the late Victorian period up through the early twentieth century, and was one of a large group of painters, including Millais, Rosetti, Burne-Jones, and numerous others. Those artists supplied the seemingly insatiable market of gentlemen buying the trappings of 'culture' and 'success.' Under the name of Art, these Victorian gentleman would surround themselves with the very finest unclad forms - it was a lucrative market, and respected in its time.<br /><br />Whatever one may think of the topics or buyers, there is no disputing Waterhouse's technical mastery. His figures are generally elegant, and elegantly draped (or un-draped). Still, he found reason to render more realistic 'peasant' figures, too. His romantic topics are easy to enjoy, although they do cloy after a while. This is very fine presentation of his art, with an informative biographywoven in.<br /><br />My only criticisms of the book come from its weak focus on Waterhouse's art. Trippi offers many samples from Waterhouse's contemporaries, far more than I think necessary for creating context and contrast. The text, though helpful, often took up space I would rather have seen devoted to larger reproductions. Still, this presentation is a good one, and has a place in any collection western painting.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-09-24

Any description of Christopher's family, as seen through Christopher's own eyes, can only fall short of Haddon's unique text. It is a first-person narration, striking for its clear, simple, and almost inhuman style.<br /><br />Teen years are hard for any family, but harder when there's a chronic  illness to attend. And, although I've never met someone like Christopher, I do know that not all illnesses are created equal. Rather, not all people are created equal in their ability to cope with different illnesses, and failures can be tragic. Christopher's father does a superhuman job, but even that can't guarantee success.<br /><br />Christopher's frankness and naivete, his confusion about simple acts of everyday life and his prodigious skills, the things he sees and the things he misses, they all add up to a baffling but very real young man. Although wholly fictional (as far as I know), it's almost a documentary on his strange way of being as human as anyone.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-09-21

I have an amateur interest in Asian classics, and commentaries like Zhu's form an important part of that canon. Straight-laced Confucian culture respected tradition profoundly, to the point that any new thought would be seen as disrespect, at best. As a result, detailed commentaries on traditional texts emerged as a way of stating new thought, under the guise of 'interpretation.' Gardner calls this an interlinear commentary, where the annotations alternate, passage by passage with the original text. This book had special promise, not just because of the importance of Confucius' Analects, or because of Zhu's commentary, but because it includes Hey Yan's commentary from a millenium earlier, as well. Despite the potential for confusion in reading Confucius' original, the two traditional commentaries, and Gardner's modern notes, clear typographic annotation keeps them distinct (if repetitive).<br /><br />My problem is that Gardner's commentary predominates. I have no qualms about his scholarship or analysis. I was really looking for a clear English translation of the original text, though. What's present reads well, and Gardner's notes add insight. I really wanted more of the classic text, though, and less of the modern. I'm sure Gardner succeeds in his intended goal, but not in mine.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-09-21

His piece retells a traditional English story, already retold by folk-rock Steeleye Span in the 1970s.

Orwell used this as an early effort to combine political awareness with the art of writing. In many ways, and maybe not the ones he wanted, he succeeded.<br /><br />He wrote this in that scary time when WWII had just ended, and WWIII was starting to look likely. He never drew the animal parable in fine detail, but used it as a broad brush to pain what he saw of the Soviet Union arising as a world power. Pigs took control of the Animal Farm, and became more piggish at every step. Sheep emerged as a faceless flock, bleating slogans as if repetition meant more than understanding. Dogs, the farm's only carnivores, stood for the secret police and public goon squads. The strong, stolid horses came away with my sympathy, though. To my mind, the horse Boxer created the defining moment in the ideal's fall. He certainly wasn't the first to suffer a violation of the sixth commandment, \\"No animal shall kill any other animal.\\" Quiet, strong Boxer was the first to 'disappear.' After a lifetime of service, he was quietly retired to the glue factory, and for a fair (if un-named) price. That covert, scheming callousness sank as low as the rulers ever went. Every perversion of trust after that one differed in kind, but not depth.<br /><br />These days, 'Animal Farm' is usually considered high school fare. It's brief, and a bit of a blunt instrument. It's still good as a reminder of its time, when the Red Menace was rising and solidifying its control over that bizarre regime, now long gone. Or so we hope.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-09-21

Don't dismiss this as just another fairy tale retold, like 'Wicked.' For one thing, the 1971 copyright predates more familiar titles in that vein by several decades.<br /><br />For another, it makes literate reference to real people and places, as described the Icelandic sagas. Gardner is well aware of the uneasy times between Viking barbarism and Norse rule of law, just before Christianity invaded the North Sea. They form the backdrop against which Grendel plays out his story.<br /><br />That educated literacy may be the book's biggest weakness, though. The Grendel myth isn't widely read these days, and Gardner's story lacks much for a reader not already familiar with it. The Saga times aren't widely familiar, either.

No text, just a beautiful young woman. Ommer presents a variety of faces and figures, many in settings that just emphasize the young woman's charm. The collection represents much of the variety in East Asian beauty, and gives good representation to the slim, elegant bust so distinctive to this population.<br /><br />As much as I like these photos, I found two things to wish for. First is that Ommer could have represented more of Asia in this collection - India is Asia, and is home to a half-billion samples of feminine beauty, none of which appeared here. Second was the way poses tended towards a sameness. They invariably captured the face, and usually the bust and torso. The whole woman has hips and legs, too, that complete the graceful curve of a female figure. These were under-represented by the 3/4 length portrait format that Ommer favors. And, a minor point, lack of titles and even page numbers makes it hard to discuss specific images.<br /><br />It's a lovely collection, and a complement to other collections that favor European features and figures. It could have been more, though.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-09-18

The story here is good: japonisme moderne (OK, I'm a sucker for it), revenge, and white-hat hacking. The good guys win, the ladies have good roles, and the bad guys get something bad.<br /><br />The art is what drew me in. I'm a nut for fine prints, and most of the style is like etching with heavy plate tone, almost monoprint. Drawing is strong and more expressive than realistic, a stark linear style. Color is daubed on, like an etched plate inked au poupee. Color is restrained too - black linear drawing plus one \\"plate tone\\" in each panel, and maybe a little highlight color. My only disappointments came from breaks in this strong style. Some scenes, esp. pp13-15, tried a soft focus that just broke the mood. Also, the background color, what I've been calling 'plate tone', is different in different panels on a given page rather often. Send this artist back to Ms. Tree! There is strength in restraint, and this work can be stronger than it is.<br /><br />I don't recognize the names of these artists. Perhaps this is their early effort. I certainly hope so, because I want to see this work in mature form. That will certainly be worth waiting for.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-09-17

Lilith finds awakens to find herself in a strange prison - but awakening at all is surprise enough, after a few madmen have scorched the Earth with nuclear war and left it to freeze in the dark of a nuclear winter. The saviors, the benign but alien Oankali, spend centuries rehabilitating the earth and the people they saved - but for a price. The Onakali are driven by species-wide imperatives of their own, and they never asked the people they saved whether they were willing to pay that price.<br /><br />It's a good plot, worked in a beautifully literate way. Still, that's just the point of entry into may other facets of Butler's story-telling. Lilith, the mythical Other Eve, is pressed (or seduced) into duty as mother-leader for the people to be returned to the new Eden that the Oankali are making of Earth, so the myth is retold in more modern terms. And, as you may guess, Cain slays Abel again, before even reaching the garden. Then there's the question of freedom, specifically the freedom to go to hell in one's own way. Is is sane to expect gratitude from anyone denied that freedom? \\"Dawn\\" could also be a parable about biotech: both those who see, even need its potential for transformation, and those with reason to reject it. Both are right in some way, and both must coexist, as in our world, but the dynamics of power between them need to be understood. I do not believe Butler proposes this as the right answer. This can also be read as a black American woman's new telling of a people uprooted and made into something they never dreamed in their darkest nightmares. That just seems too glib, and unfairly slots Butler and her work as 'just another [fill in the blank]'. This unique writing deserves much more than that kind of generic brush-off.<br /><br />This, like Butler's other writing, is gentle (but not to gentle) and thought-provoking. I recommend it highly.<br /><br />//wiredwierd-provoking. I recommend it highly. <br /> <br />//wiredwierd	2005-09-17

The translation is modern and readable, I have no problem with that. The original was centuries behind Sun Tzu's book of the same name, even though Sun Tzu wrote around 500BC, 2000 years before Macchiavelli. Macchiavelli gives a bit of advice about soldierly temperament and training. There's also a brief checklist, just two pages, of strategic advice, near the end of the book. That's all that really has lasting value.<br /><br />The bulk of the text is taken up with the right way to position each kind of soldier and arm, rank and file, in marching order. Basically, these were detailed directions for a military parade, suited to the set-piece wars of the time, as much pageant as combat. He also goes on about the right kinds of pennants, flags, and colors to use, proper military music, how to make camp, and proper pillaging and distribution of booty.<br /><br />Directions on how to make camp are subject to errors, though: a measurement 1360 feet long, minus 100 feet at each end, is said to leave a row 1260 feet long rather than 1160 - perhaps an error introduced by the translator, but I tend to think not. He also takes the \\"reduction\\" and sacking of conquered towns for granted. I think Master Sun was a bit more merciful (or prgamatic), on the grounds that the wealth of newly annexed parts of the kingdom should be preserved, and the citizens kept happy enough for easy rule. With a startling lack of foresight, Macchiavelli dismisses serious use of artillery in pitched battles. Instead, he falls back on strategies of the Greeks and Romans, 1000 to 2000 years old even when he wrote. Sun Tzu's warfare had a much more modern look to it, including hit-and-run tactics that the West barely understood until the American revolution.<br /><br />The quality of the translation worth four or five stars, partly because of helpful notes and diagrams. It's the original work that I found weak.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-09-14

I'm grateful anyway. It's an outstanding collection of Chinese erotic art, from about the end of the 17th century to the late 19th. The works here are all silk paintings, except for a few drawings. They are printed in beautiful color, large enough for easy reading, with expanded details of a few. Bertholet adds plenty of useful commentary (much of which I skipped, I admit). He also adorns most pages with brief extracts from classic Chinese poetry, all on the topic of physical love.<br /><br />Two things stand out in every artwork and in the collection as a whole. First is the gentle, consensual tone. The closest thing to aggression is a jealous wife twisting the ear of a husband caught 'in flagrante,' and that's more humorous than anything. Voyeurism, whether peeking in on a lady's solitary pleasure, secret viewer of a couple's engagement, or the reader's own participation with the artwork, is always un-threatening. Humor is always close to the surface, the natural good humor of happy people.<br /><br />The second thing that strikes a Western eye is the very non-Western conventions these artists followed in rendering men and women. The figures are very similar - women aren't given the guitar figure one might expect, and men have rounded and nearly hairless bodies. Women's breasts get only a little attention, and are covered by a bandeau or bib in many scenes. Genitalia aren't exaggerated, and their realistic scale may jar an eye that expected size and importance to go together.<br /><br />But that's why these works are so enjoyable. They aren't Western, they're a very different look at the thing all people have in common. They're still beautiful, both in the Chinese tradition and in the visual celebration of sex.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-09-10

We can read about information theory in Shannon's own words, fuzzy logic in Zadeh's, relativity in Einstein's, and genetic programming in Holland's. He created evolutionary algorithms, and shares his thoughts in this brief work.<br /><br />1975, when he first published this work, was a long time ago. Since then, computing has advanced, computing demands have advanced, and biology has advanced. Biology, because it functions at all the levels from atoms to worlds, has bottomless potential for insight. Because the atoms, the worlds, and everything between are all unfriendly, biology has many problems to solve. It doesn't matter whether you are an oak tree, a virus, or a whale, the solution (at the species level) is the same: evolve. Holland was the first to harness that incredible problem-solving power to computational use.<br /><br />A huge literature has built up from Holland's founding thoughts. Those thoughts are here, in their original and purest form. It is hardly surprising that Holland anticipated so many elaborations of his work. One, in particular, struck me: the idea of 'hot spots' for genetic crossover. Or rather the opposite: 'cold spots' where crossover is inhibited. As a computer scientist, Holland's first thoughts were written in binary. When you allow points where crossover can not occur, you allow coherent multibit values - maybe even floating point. It's easy to laugh at Holland's initial naivete now, but he was talking about the foundations, not the structure built up from it.<br /><br />If you have ever programmed genetic algorithms, you have been stunned by their effectiveness in creating good solutions. 'Good' doesn't mean precisely optimal, but pretty damm good anyway.<br /><br />If you were a hard core creationist to start with, you still are. But now you know that evolutionary problem solving is powerful, broad, subtle, and effective - so much, that it's hard to believe it could ever have arisen by chance.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-09-09

The question is: If you want to color a map so that countries with shared borders are different colors, how many colors do you need? What's the smallest number? A four year old can understand the question, but it took a fundamental revolution in mathematical proofs to state the answer with certainty: Four colors suffice.<br /><br />This is a very readable history of the problem, from its phrasing in the mid-nineteenth century up to its mind-boggling proof in 1976, and a bit beyond that. It captures brief bits of the lives of the mathematicians who worked on it, as well as the furor over Appel and Haken's computer-based proof. Why was this so revolutionary? Because it was the first proof with steps that could never be checked by a human reader. Some people claimed the proof was incomplete until the programs were proven correct. Others stated that, if it couldn't be proven to a human mind, then nothing was really proven at all. Yet others objected to the proof's lack of mathematical elegance. It wasn't a scalpel that cut neatly to the heart of the problem, but a bulldozer hauled away huge buckets of potential counterexamples. A non-mathematician like me has to wonder: did this pave the way for acceptance of the 15,000-page \\"Classification theorem\\"? Although that theorem might not have been proven with computer assistance, its sheer mass is certainly similar.<br /><br />The book does get a bit mathematical in places. The casual (and maybe not-so-casual) reader will be tempted to skip bits, and won't really lose the narrative thread by doing so. And, since the original proof is nearly 30 years old now, some of the excitement has worn off it. Even so, it's an enjoyable history of a problem that resisted attack for so long, and the remarkable attack that finally felled it.<br /><br />And it leave me wondering: do my younger colleagues live in a world richer because of the radical solution, or poorer for the absence of such a wonderful mystery?<br /><br />//wiredweirdyounger colleagues live in a world richer because of the radical solution, or poorer for the absence of such a wonderful mystery? <br /> <br />//wiredweird	2005-09-09

Henry and Clare were truly made for each other, from the time he was 43 and she was 6, until he was 28 and she was 20.

Back and forth, but always along his own stream for some reason, into and out of the lives of people that matter to him. That includes himself, of course.<br /><br />That's just the vehicle, though, and not what the book is really about. Fatalism and predestination maybe? A love too big to live only within its own time? About the secrets we keep, and how they create create bond, or break them? Or about the special company between outsiders, in places that insiders can never find.<br /><br />Ok, one outlandish premise I can take: his problem is 'genetic,' a word taken to mean 'magic'. Like in the 1950s, if you said something was 'atomic,' you could say any silly thing you wanted. It's annoying, but Niffenegger follows the rules. Once her premise is accepted (or at least tolerated), everything else makes sense.<br /><br />This is actually a much more captivating book than I hoped.

This book started that second dozen.<br />It's about Brutha, a minor novitiate even among novitiates who are all minor. He's doing what he does best, hoeing the beans, when his god arises before him in physical manifestation:<br />A turtle. Slow. Partial to lettuce. Not fond of being turned over or dropped. Not much for conversation when it gets cold out. And, as near as Om can tell, the god of Brutha only. No one else seems to be paying much attention when the god calls down plagues, or at least some really nasty rashes.<br />In Prathcett's hands, this small start yields a very worthy bit of amusement. No, there's really no point to what Pratchett writes (well, that's what he wants you to think). Brutha crosses his world, overturns empires as easily as he overturns weeds in the bean-patch, and dies happy. Everyone dies, and Brutha has seen lots of the other ways - this really is a happy ending.<br />For all of its shallow jests, this book has rewards for the serious reader. Brutha wins in the end by be slow, thick, and mind-bogglingly even-handed. Om finally comes out of his shell and really makes his entry, even among the more exclusive clubs of the gods. Everyone gets what they deserve in the end, no matter what you thought they deserved. By the way: observe Om, the lowly turtle, and the place of the turtle in Discworld cosmology.<br />Pratchett fans: watch Vorbis. Yes, the character dies, but that doesn't mean much in Discworld. He may reincarnate as Vetinari, or maybe as Vetinari's evil identical twin. Death is there, all caps, but really quite a congenial chap - says &quot;Thank you&quot; when you pass him the bottle, sort of thing. The librarian is there, working hard in librarian heroics.

Although they come from the same oral tradition and were captured on paper around the same time (1200s to 1400s), they are rarely related to each other. Each story has its unique character, like page after page of people named in 'How Culwch won Owen'. 'The Dream of Rohanbwy' likewise seems to be a listing of colored arms and costumes so detailed that the writer say, \\"no one ... knows The Dream without a book because of the many colors.\\"<br /><br />Others of these tales are much more interesting for their relatioships to other parts of the mythos of the British isles. 'Peredur son of Evrawg' is variant of the Parsival story, with close parallels in many of its particulars. The Mabingion also retells some of the earliest known tales in the Arthurian canon. 'Gerient and Enid,' for example, is founded in the Arthur mythology. It's founded on the notions of knightly honor and chivalry, but with a primitive and harsh interpretation of the ethos.<br /><br />There are other glimpses of early Celtic times, as well. One that struck me, in two different passages, was a telling of some great feast, where the doors were closed to all comers once the feasting began. All comers, that is, except a \\"king of a lawful dominion or a craftsman who brings his craft.\\" Later in that story (Culwch), the bouncer isn't told to let the kings in, only the craftsmen. This is a vivid display of their high regard for skilled work, something that sounds strange to a modern ear. I think less of the modern ear for thinking so little of such skills.<br /><br />Not all translations of the Mabinogion are created equal. Reading another translation, I foundered on obsolete, Elizabethan language injected to make the stories seem archaic. This one uses contemporary language, as bards in a living oral tradition would have done, to create a smooth and readable collection.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-08-30

They are aquatints by the author, an etchinq process originally meant to imitate watercolor, colored au poupee (on the printing plate). Although Goya used it extensively and successfully, it's not common these days. As an achievement in control of the process, this is a worthwhile display of what can be done with the technique. Some plates, such as 'Haunted,' demonstrate how burnishers can be used, somewhat in the mezzotint manner. I found the drawings plain, not always the best renderings of people. The set of prints, as a whole, is still a delight, though.<br /><br />The book itself is a labor of love - in the best sense, but in others as well. The author started it long before her very successful \\"Time Traveler's Wife,\\" and I suspect that TTW's success had a lot to do with bringing this to life. That success may have given the author enough clout to publish a story that might not have seen the light of day otherwise, one that has meaning for her if not for others. It's like an Edward Gorey book, with one picture per two-page spread, and a sentence or two - or less - on the opposite page. There's little of Gorey's mystery, though, and none of his macabre atmosphere. Much is left implied by the epigrammatic writing, and probably a lot more than I was able to deduce. Parts of it seem to have eluded me.<br /><br />Still, it's interesting enough, the pictures generally work well, and word and image add up to more than just their sum.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-08-30

One family leads the hunt for Shangri La: a corrupt General Zhang, a son burning with missionary zeal for the revolution, and a daughter with quiet doubts about the party. A character from Hilton's original story learns of the threat, and leaves Shangri La to avert the threat. Leaving, of course, is a death sentence unless he returns soon enough, but the hero puts the safety of Shangri La ahead of his own.<br /><br />This post-hoc collaboration never really captured my imagination. The writing is good enough, except for an especially magical resolution to the threat. I don't see it as a sequel, so much as an unrelated story in the same setting. That could have been good, but the characters never enticed me. The plot was very plain, an intellectual dead end: things happen, they're resolved, and that's it. Nothing more to think about.<br /><br />Some people seem to this one - just not me.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-08-30

The essay reads well, and gives a simple, clear statement of what Chandler dislikes about the murder mystery genre. You can read the details for yourself, but I'll give you a clue: read Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple, then one of these stories. The differences fix the problems that Chandler saw in the genre as it existed before him.<br /><br />Although I like the Philip Marlowe novels, these are short stories (far less than novel length), they star different characters (none of whom are Marlowe), and generally seem weaker than Chandler's novels. They keep the same dark, gritty tone, but one or two overdo the 1940s slang to a nearly impenetrable level. They're all worth reading, though, especially \\"I'll Be Waiting.\\"<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-08-30

It's about one man among the faceless mob, whose crime is to discover the word \\"I\\" and to assert his uniqueness. The streetsweeper rediscovers technology from the pre-apocalypse Unmentionable Times, then escapes with a like-minded woman to father a new society of individualists.<br /><br />The book's virtue is its brevity. The overheated tone may have been needed to make the point quickly, but would have worn if the book had gone on for more than its 100 pages or so. That makes it a concentrated form of the ethical and moral foundations that Rand built on in later works, like \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" and \\"The Fountainhead.\\"<br /><br />It's also a bit hard to take seriously at times. Rand creates a 50 year bureaucratic delay in allowing candles to supplant torches, for fear that out-of-work torchmakers would destabilize the society's fundament. She very nearly sinks her point under the weight of her exaggeration. She also creates a language with no first person singular pronoun, even though each individual has a unique name. Lack of \\"I\\" in a world where one person has a name that distinguishes him from all others, and can be used by himself, is a conceptual gap that I never saw crossed in a satisfactory way.<br /><br />The Rand completist will enjoy this volume, including the reproduction of an earlier form of the story with hand-written amendments. It will also interest the reader to learn that Rand (an emigre from Soviet Russia) was told her book was unpublishable because she had no understanding of socialism! It's not her strongest work, though, and suffers from shrillness and hyperbole.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-08-30

It combines his signature combination of incredible characters, groanable puns, wild adventure and maybe, just maybe a little serious reflection. I'm not sure that Pratchett would admit to that last, though.<br />And no, no one is quite what you expected. There's the king, elevated from his former role as jester (or was he?). The queen is shy, uncertain, and naive (or is she?). The witches' contest of power ends when one looks away (or does it?). The elves are wondrous and glamorous - or are they?<br />The serious side flirts with the many-worlds ideas from physics, serious science sure to warm the soul of any comedic writer. It also raises some symbols of a long-gone warrior queen, and leaves with some pointed observations on symbols being what you let them. Mostly, though, it's just more of Pratchett's laugh-out-loud history of a world that's even more ridiculous than our own - or is it?<br />//wiredweird	2005-08-30

The few works that survive are in fragmentary condition, often just a few words from the middle of a line.<br /><br />As short as this book is (65 pages), the translation is only half. End matter starts with a brief, helpful biographical note. The rest is a detailed analysis of poetic form - possibly of interest to the specialist, but a specialist I haven't met.<br /><br />The translation is quite clear about the points at which text is missing, and makes no attempt to interpolate. Instead of whole poems, we see individual lines or fragments that evoke Sappho's tone. Since I knew Sappho only by reputation, I wasn't ready for its romantic appeal, or for its praise of male loves (\\"In my eyes, he matches the gods...\\") as well as female. I should have known better - every classic I've read has been very different than its reputation. I strongly recommend this to any well-rounded reader.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-08-30

It's about a girl, just fifteen as the book opens, who delights in the pleasures of her woman's body. She is determined to find a dramatic, romantic love, the kind that makes \\"her heart melt ... [and her] icy stalactites shatter and plunge into a river of passion and beauty.\\"<br /><br />In other words, she has a teenager's overheated physical drive but no realistic direction. The first can be a wonderful thing, if it has a rewarding outlet, but that would be outlet of a kind she can't imagine or even recognize at first. That leads to a promiscuity without real satisfaction, and a slow spiral away from her original happiness in herself.<br /><br />The ending is happy, though - a relationship that may lack in heat, but is filled with warmth. The low point of the book never gets destructively low, teen angst and bad grades at worst. And for all its physicality, there's nearly no real erotic content. (The title's \\"hundred strokes\\" are quite innocent.) As a novel, it's brief and bland, but parents of teenage girls are likely to find it very uncomfortable.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-08-30

She grew them to huge size, setting them at or above human scale. She drew them in scorching colors, like \\"Poppy\\" or \\"Oriental poppy,\\" or in stark lights and darks (\\"Jimson weed\\" and \\"Black hollyhock\\"). She displayed them with human passion, possibly drawing parallels between a plant's organs of regeneration and a human's (\\"Red canna\\" and \\"Yellow sweet peas\\"). Whatever you see in these - and different people will see differently - they are monumental presentations of something we think of as small and delicate. By itself, that's a message: the big and the small are equals in the world, when considered at their proper scale.<br /><br />Maybe it's not fair to O'Keefe's ouvre to isolate one part of it like this - she preferred to show her work with a better balance of subjects and styles. These wonderful paintings deserve attention of their own, though. Some of the paintings are up to six feet tall and seven wide - even at 12\\"x10\\", book can't capture the full drama of the work.

Everyone except maybe Marlowe.<br /><br />This isn't one of Chandler's better-known stories; as far as I know, it was never made into a movie. Maybe it's just a little too complex for a movie. It starts in the usual way. A young woman, beautiful (if she lets herself be) and in trouble, asks private detective Marlowe for help. She needs to find her brother, a small-town boy who's lost his way in the big bad city.<br /><br />She's not quite what she claims to be, though, and the brother isn't what he should have been. As the story progresses, Hollywood and all the people in it lose their shine, and get darker and dirtier. And the bodies start to pile up ---<br /><br />Maybe Chandler didn't invent American noir of the post-WWII era, but he certainly made it his own.

If you're not already familiar with Boris' work - well, you probably are whether you know it or not. He has done years work of book covers for Edgar Rice Burroughs, as well as reams of posters. The one constant through all his work is passion for the human form and human power, both male and female.<br /><br />These paintings range from the lush and sensual to humorous or macabre. A hookah come to life has a demonic presence, but a bar of soap come to life (and licking the bather) is more charming and a little silly. Even the simplest pictures have overtones - that bather is truly a beautiful woman, leaving me just a little envious of such close contact. Maybe not envious either, but off in thoughts of my own. And the preface is right, 'erotic' is much too simple a word for all the different feelings and combinations of feelings that come from having or holding a strong, healthy body.<br /><br />My only complaint is a sameness in the female figures presented. The faces are beautiful, long and elegant, but mostly the same. The figures - the one figure, really is beautiful, but I value the uniqueness of a figure and the differences between figures. Cloning can serve a narrative purpose, certainly, but sameness wears. Even the loveliness of Danielle Anjou, acknowledged as a principal model and collaborator, wears.<br /><br />Boris is the master of the figure in fantasy art, and has been for many years. This is a great sample from an earlier time in his career. It's almost impossible not to like.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-08-18

The Sandman series stands above most other comics, and this collection stands above most other Sandman work.<br /><br />Referring to an earlier story, the Sandman realizes that he has made a mistake, and caused immense pain to someone who never deserved it. He sets out to correct his error, not that anything will take back the pain already inflicted. That's when all hell breaks loose.<br /><br />I mean literally. Not with Bam! Pow! fight scenes, but with delicate and varied art, with invocations of many mythologies, and with Gaiman's ability to put another twist into any plot. The final surprise, this time, is at least one more miscarriage of justice, maybe several, but perhaps in the name of a higher justice. Resolution is as ironic as it is inevitable, and not quite satisfactory in any way. Well, solutions to complex problems never are.<br /><br />This volume collect several of the original comics, each drawn by different art teams. That's especially effective in this collection, and adds to the dreamlike shifting quality of the story. P. Craig Russell's art in one episode is especially enjoyable. McKean's cover art and other odd bits contribute their own elusiveness to the total.<br /><br />The series of Sandman collections read well in order, and almost as well out of order. If you're new to the Sandman, this might be a great place to start. It stands well by itself, and shows just how good this series can be.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-08-17

I can not recommend this book.<br /><br />I wanted to like it. I write, a lot, about technical topics, and am convinced that proper training improve my writing. A few pages in, I found so many errors, both minor and major, that I lost the hope this book would help.<br /><br />Minor things included the author's micro-management of whether dates in business letters should be punctuated. (Yes or no, can you guess what he requires? Does it matter?) Another minor point was insistence that a certain line in a business memo be underlined. Underlining was never a great way to emphasize text, and has gotten worse since the 1970s writing of the first edition. Underlining has come to mean \\"link\\" in the Web era, and it's safe to assume that most memoranda will be viewed electronically. Underlined but unclickable text causes confusion, and causes more confusion if a paper document is ever fed to an OCR scanner. Text recognition is dicey at best, and adding junk to the letterforms can never help.<br /><br />The major problems include notebooks, resumes, and basic English usage. Scientific and engineering notebooks can sometimes approach the status of legal documents. Proper notes can establish primacy of discovery, and can affect the validity of valuable patents. The best notebooks are permanently bound with printed page numbers, giving some assurance that pages weren't added or removed at some later date. Many engineers also favor grid-ruled pages, for aligning text, as 'training wheels' for uncertain sketching skills, and as aids in tables and graphs. Barrass recommends a combination of lined and unlined pages, interleaved from different sources. I'm glad he discusses professional note-taking at all, but I'm disappointed by the discussion.<br /><br />Ditto examples. It's great that he presented real text from real publications for critique, and that he stresses the importance of critique. He is simply wrong, however, in asserting (p.36) that \\"[change] unequalled in magnitude MEANS unequalled.\\" Changes may differ in magnitude, in speed, in visibility, and in as many more dimensions as a creative reader can imagine. I agree that the phrase may be ungainly, and may not be appropriate to the rest of the cited text. Still, it is worthwhile for the writer to point out which aspect of change is under discussion, an idea that Barrass denies.<br /><br />His suggested resume (p.28) addresses only the needs of a high-schooler (is this the scientist who must write?), and addresses those badly. It really is as grim as you may imagine. The suggested cover letter (p.27) would be pathetic even for a high-schooler. It never even mentions the job's content, let alone the reason that the applicant feels qualified to apply for the job.<br /><br />I admit, I made it only 36 pages into the 190+ of this book. In those first four chapters, however, I found so much bad advice that I simply could not believe the rest of the book would repay the time spent in reading it.

If you can't present your ideas well, they won't be taken seriously, and this book offers lots of advice on presenting well.<br /><br />The book covers all the basics of organization, preparation, delivery, and even disaster control - like when the airline sends you and your slides to different conferences. Although the details are useful, the whole book is really makes just one point: that a postive, sure attitude is the one absolute requirement for success. Focusing your message, creating the right presentation for the audience, good visual aids, and good personal appearance are all important, and covered at a reasonable level of detail. All of the preparation, however, supports the one goal of creating a bond of communication between you and your audience. The authors also talk about other aspects of verbal communication, including chairing other speakers, handling questions (including aggressive ones), and interviews.<br /><br />You'll need other references for the details of good visual aids or other supporting materials. This is also a bit thin on the specifics of content organization and discussion of quantitative data. Still, this offers plenty of good suggestions on pulling it all together and getting across to your listeners.<br /><br />If you're not a scientist, the first paragraph of the book may take you by surprise. It's full of words like \\"enthusiasm,\\" \\"excitement,\\" and \\"passion.\\" No one who works in science should be surpised, though. This book is really about sharing your passion.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-08-13

The first 30 chapters each present one typeface ('font' for computer folk). A typeface's chapter analyzes the structural features of the sorts ('glyphs'), noting how the typeface fits into the usual bins labelled 'black letter', or 'modern', etc. That discussion tends to be spotty, though, and the successful reader already knows a few different ways for serifs to differ from each other, for line weight to vary, and lots more.<br /><br />What this book does well is present specimens of different typefaces within each family, showing how the letterforms drifted through time, or how they evolved to meet specific demands of paper, ink, and press. The typefaces are arranged in a chronological order, of sorts, but one type face's era may overlap another a large margin. Within each chapter, Lawson explores the development of that typeface, from the calligraphy and earlier letterforms that preceded it up through its contemporary appearance and use. The many examples also show the relationships between members of the same evolutionary tree. A few times, though, the samples could have been bigger, e.g. for pointing out differences in bracketing of the serifs.<br /><br />This is very much a history of the type designers, printers, and other people in the history of type. It also gives some history of printing and typefounding technology. That motivates discussions of typefaces that were created to solve specific problems of paper, ink, and press, as well as esthetics. Historical information about punchcutting technology and modern type creation tools also explains the changing business relationships between font designers, distributors, and users.<br /><br />Knowledge of history may help the reader in speccing type appropriate to some printing task, but there's very little here that would help in setting up a page of text. It's a book for another purpose, though. It's about the typefaces that are (or should be, or should not be) important to today's typographers, and why.<br /><br />//wiredweird, or should not be) important to today's typographers, and why. <br /> <br />//wiredweird	2005-08-12

It's a reminder, if one is needed, that engineering is human, humane work, and profoundly fulfilling in itself.<br /><br />Florman gets off to a slow start, though. The first third of the book is apologetic, acknowledging the many social and environmental ills in which engineers have taken part. \\"Forgive us,\\" he seems to say, \\"for not being better than the masters who command our work and the clients who demand it.\\" The next third of the book takes on a shrill tone, an answer to the neo-Luddites of the 1960s and 1970s. Florman spends time answering their anti-technological absurdities and self-important elitism. Only in the last third of the book does Florman make the central point of this book.<br /><br />Engineers, as a stereotype, seem boring, but perhaps that's becuase we lack so many of the stereotypical failings of other professions - avarice, personal arrogance, or violence. Engineering is no less creative than any of the \\"creative\\" arts, and is a profound expression of all that sets us apart from animals. It's part of the tradition of Homer and the Old Testament, where the ability to create was god-given, and the tradition of Chartres, where engineering skill was an offering to God. Florman notes that putting one's skills to the service of human needs is a living expression of the communal sense. I felt that myself when I acquired a breast cancer microarray dataset in the course of my work. It was the realization that those blank case numbers were real women, some now dead, and that I had a duty towards them (or their memories), their futures, and the futures of others. But most of all, Florman reminds us that engineering is fun. It answers personal, social, and even spiritual needs in ways that outsiders may never understand. I assure you, the greatest awareness of the world and its glories comes from direct involvement with it, and an engineer's life is about involvement with the physical world.<br /><br />Issues have changed since Florman wrote this in 1976; it sometimes answers questions that aren't commonly asked any more. Still, it's the finest statement I know of what there is about engineering that makes a practitioner proud, even happy, to be a part of it.<br /><br />//wiredweirdife is about involvement with the physical world. <br /> <br />Issues have changed since Florman wrote this in 1976; it sometimes answers questions that aren't commonly asked any more.

It was concise, cryptic, known to few, and bizarrely powerful. For example, it took only a few lines to write a symbolic differentiation program, plus one line per transcendental function. Of course, it involved a kind of \\"computed goto\\" that works only in interpreted languages. Oh, and it was somewhat column oriented, helpful whe you're using punch cards.<br /><br />Remember how C++, the definitive OO language, used to be a preprocessor for non-OO K&R C? SNOBOL is even worse - it was the ultimate string language for many years, written as an intepreter in the ultimate non-string language, FORTRAN IV. SNOBOL had recursion, garbage collection, typed data (with untyped variables), and lots more to delight the hacker's soul. FORTRAN didn't. A later version came out, called SPITBOL. It was a compiler, so lacked some of the interpreter's wilder features. It was still wicked awesome anyway. (Then there was ICEBOL, a program to compact SNOBOL programs. Really.)<br /><br />But when I became a man, I put away the things of a child. It's just a hacker's language, not suited to the professional world. Much that was good in it lives on in Perl and Javascript, when loosely understood. The language itself is just a happy childhood memory. I just had a few moments putting the shine back on those memories - aah.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-08-05

His disciple, Arrian, collected his wisdom, and distilled it down into this booklet of aphorisms.<br /><br />The essence is simple: \\"No man is free who is not master of himself.\\" In part, that is because the self is all anyone can truly own. Everything else is under the control of others, of the state, or finally of the gods. Happiness based on what can be taken away is a flimsy sort of thing, and fighting the will of the gods is futile.<br /><br />Still, this isn't about ascetic self-denial. There are pleasures to be had in the world. If there is wine, enjoy it, remembering that excess is hardly enjoyable. Enjoy the loves in your life, without becoming slave to them.

Although it never became popular in itself, it had remarkable influence on the next generation of languages.<br /><br />It's an object based language, but not object oriented as we'd recognize the term today. It had classes (called 'clusters'), but lacked inheritance. It had generics (templates) in terms of data values or types, and ways to constrain the interfaces exported by the type parameters. C++, but especially Java derived their signalling mechanisms from CLU, down to Java's 'throws' declarations on methods. It also featured iterators as language primitives, something Java didn't catch up with until the version 1.5. CLU also anticipated 'const' declarations as flexible as those in C++. CLU's \\"immutable\\" constructs were even more flexible than the cint and cfloat types in the Cg shader language, and like Cg it relied on a special set of keywords rather than declaration modifiers. The automatically-generated accessor methods in C# also had their ancestors in this language. And, like modern languages, CLU use automatic garbage collection instead of manual resource management - and in doing so, defined whole worlds of programming errors out of existence.<br /><br />The language itself is an historical oddity, these days. You might be hard pressed to find a compiler for it. The language design is a fascinating snapshot in time however, an intermediate point in the evolution of modern OO languages. This is a necessary reference for anyone serious about the fundamentals of OO language development.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-08-04

I didn't find much of use here, but there were a few good points here (very few). Let me start with those.<br /><br />The \\"Execute Around Method\\" pattern is good idea, applicable far beyond this Smalltalk context. The Beta language has \\"inner\\" inheritance, which makes the idea easy, but most other languages lack a good mechanism for undefined logic between matched operation pairs (open/close, setup/cleanup, etc.) \\"Enumeration\\" is another good one, enshrined as \\"Visitor\\" in the Gang of Four book.<br /><br />Most of what's left is either trivial or Smalltalk-specific and face it, Smalltalk is mostly a cult language with nearly no commercial significance. The Smalltalk pretty-printing and variable-naming rules, fatuous at best, are just not applicable to most langages. Some of Beck's \\"practices\\" are language features (like 'super'). Other \\"practices\\", like the long chapter on Collections, seem to describe standard library classes and messages. Yet others (e.g. Type Suggesting Parameter Name) correct language defects - Smalltalk chose to give up the error detection capability offered by variable typing. Beck tries to sneak it back in with variable naming conventions sort of like Microsoft's old Hungarian naming. Some of his suggestions are just dangerous, like that one that says a constructor should \\"half-way construct an object in one place, then pass it off to another to finish construction. (p.23)\\" This distributes an object's setup responsibility across its client classes, leaves unusable and incomplete objects floating around, and causes subtle exposures in multithreaded systems - I'd rip out any code I saw built this way.<br /><br />The good news is that no new trees died to make my copy of this book - I got it used, and it's returning to the used market. At least my conscience is clean on that account, no matter what I'm doing to the poor guy who buys this book next.<br /><br />//wiredweirdwho buys this book next.    //wiredweird	2005-07-31

Chances are that Petronius got by ingratiating himself with the rich and famous, perhaps by amusing them with his stories. It's also fair to guess that he joined some of their debuaches - perhaps some of this is drawn from experience - and that the tales grew in the telling.<br /><br />The story starts with the narrator Encolpius, with his friend Asclytus, and with the toyboy they share, Giton. What follows is a wandering series of encounters. They split and reunite a number of times, usually around some improbable scheme. Later on, the aging poet Eumolpus takes Asclytus' place in the story, in Giton's intimacy, and in the petty schemes with Encolpius.<br /><br />At one point, Encolpius is found spying on the ecstasies offered up to one of the gods. The punishment for that lewd interlude is in kind, to have ecstasy thrust upon (and into) him beyond bearing. That's an early passage, and sets the tone for all the other adventures and escapes in this book.<br /><br />Towards the end, his dissolute ways make him the Cialis poster boy. He seeks an aged witch for aphrodisiac treatment, and she gives it to him all different ways. To his dismay, many ways involve her own aged body in the treatment. A reader with a vivid imagination will see lots more humor than this 1965 translation would have dared put on paper.<br /><br />But I wonder, is this really the best translation? Yes, it has some integrity - Sullivan has been careful to note breaks in the manuscript. He even adds a chapter of \\"fragments,\\" too broken and disjoint to guess at. The reader doesn't get a false sense of continuity caused by the translator's patches. On the other hand, the reader doesn't get a full sense of continuity, either. On the scale from academic rendering to storytelling, I wish this were a bit more in the storytelling direction. No matter, it's a great story anyway.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-07-29

This was not the book, but perhaps it never meant to be.<br /><br />It meant to be used by someone sitting down at a keyboard with a Smalltalk compiler in hand (i.e., not me). The book starts gently, with a few simple expressions to type at the interpreter's command line. Before it even gives the syntax for a Smalltalk function, though, it gives a comparison if the different syntaxes used for inheritance in seven languages, four obscure or obsolete (p.23). The next sections explain simple language elements, unfortunately in terms of GUI-based tools that the reader may not have at hand.<br /><br />The next few sections wander back and forth between language features, OO design topics, a deeper look under the compiler covers than any beginner really needs, and a shallower look at the libraries than anyone could get by on. This last is especially frustrating in a \\"small\\" language, where so much of the capability is built up in the libraries. Instead, we just see a keyword here and there, with no attempt to bind them into a coherent whole. This organization could possibly have made sense if the book were a text for a semester course. If so, it's true to its breed: I generally find them to be poor self-study guides, especially for experienced programmers.<br /><br />Perhaps this book is good for some purposes, just not for mine.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-07-29
144457:US	35004134	R1XGNDOXJ0CMVT	0892815256	412078363	The Complete Kama Sutra: The First Unabridged Modern Translation of the Classic Indian Text	Books	5	67	67	N	Y	Culture, history, and practice	This is an outstanding new translation of the Indian classic, dating from the fourth century BC. It is widely misunderstood in the west, largely by people who never read it, but also by people who only read Burton's unfortunate Victorian translation. Well over 500 pages, this may seem intimidating - I promise you, it's worth your effort.<br /><br />This includes Vatsyayana's complete text, not just the extracts that Burton chose. Danielou interleaves it with not one, but two different commentaries, one traditional and one modern. These add insight, not just to the Vatsyayana text itself, but also to how later ages of India view this classic.<br /><br />The Kama Sutra describes the culture in which it arose. At least for the upper classes, it's a remarkable image. Although male-dominated, women had surprising autonomy. Many services - jewelers, perfumers, and the like - create the objects and gifts of a rich society. Even prostitutes have a more or less respectable place in that world - more like geishas, entertainers with wide repertoires, not just vessels for sexual release.<br /><br />This book is surprisingly clinical in its outlook. Vatsyayana describes a range of sexual practices. Some, he notes, are not widely considered proper - but all things have their time and place, if that's what the practitioners want. Describing a practice does not imply approval of it; in that vein, he mentions seductions and even capture of a woman by force. Prostitutes, too, have a code of behavior. Although they may develop feelings for a customer, their work is their business and their livelihood. This justifies, even demands behavior that would not be proper for a partner of another kind.<br /><br />The largest part of the book is more mundane. It sets out a plan for being a happy, healthy member of society: the skills needed, grooming, social behaviors, and lots more. Despite repressive eras that followed (down to our own), the appeal of this document persists. Today's readers, nearly 2500 years later, can still learn from it, about that ancient time but also about our own.<br /><br />//wiredweirdnearly 2500 years later, can still learn from it, about that ancient time but also about our own.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-07-28

This edition covers the Java language up to 1.5, so it gives a full description of generics and type parameters, boxing and unboxing, enums, annotation, and all the latest. If you develop Java language tools - debuggers, compilers, etc. - you simply must have this book. If you care about Java details that much, you must have the newest edition.<br /><br />The typical programmer, someone who uses Java for application development, probably won't find much of interest in this book. This isn't a programmer's how-to manual. Nearly nothing describes how to use the language features. The code samples just illustrate language syntax and subtleties. There's nearly no discussion of the Java APIs, not even the java.lang.* packages or language-dependent reflection features. These are not flaws in this reference manual - this simply isn't a book meant to serve those needs.<br /><br />Despite its 650+ pages, this really is a concise, precise definition of the Java 1.5 programming language.

The story drags early on, but it builds up a clear notion of the Newts as a legitimate citizens of Nation Earth. Capek spends some time recapitulating the slaughter, love, and other complexities that bring the Newts from jungle obscurity to world prominence - reminiscent of Ebola and AIDS emerging from other jungles not so long after.<br /><br />He the brings the Newts up into his 20th century. The satirist's mind became satyric at the point, eager to prick the fulsome expanse of German nationalism or to penetrate the legs crossed over America's internal outsiders, Black Americans. Capek allows apologists of many different nationalisms in many ways, but they all show up wanting.<br /><br />Simple, hard-working, and certain, the Newts prevail. The author struggles, in a self-conscious final chapter, over a happy ending. He finally fails, and we are left to wonder about Newtworld.<br /><br />It's satire and commentary, but also science-oriented SF. Suppose these beings became available? What then? Capek's answers are very true, but very ugly.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-07-26

This adults only, black and white comic shows his style at its fullest, about as good as it gets.<br /><br />It has all the things that make Chaykin's work stand out. His figures are all strong, the men muscled and the women curved. Every character is unique, not the the same faces and figures repeated. Chaykin's figures are all posed, but without turning stiff and without the exaggerations of the superhero genre. Somehow, he arrages each figure and draws each panel as if it's the most important one in the book. Despite his modern setting, Chaykin favors a 1940s look, with seamed stockings, spike heels, and fashions that make the most of a figure, male or female.<br /><br />This also has the story line and characters that make Chaykin's work stand out. It's a world where everyone is corrupt, one way or another, or maybe more than one. The story starts with blackmail and murder, then sinks successively farther into depravity - the grinning kind, that wears a nice suit and a good manicure. And somehow, through it all, everyone seems to have just one more dirty secret.<br /><br />It's not easy to like any of the characters, but I don't think you're meant to. It's easy to like Chaykin's art, and this is prime material.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-07-23

A bold statement for her to make, even when limited to the photographic nude. Earlier photos of people without clothes generally served scientific purposes (like Muybridge's), or salacious ones. The artistic, even abstract photographic nude may in fact be Cunningham's invention.<br /><br />This samples Cunningham's career, from 1906 to 1976, from age 23 to the year of her death. That artistic longevity, if nothing else, is worthy of note. But the real strngth of the collection is in the photos themselves.<br /><br />The abstract photos, like 'Helen' (plate 42) and 'Roi' (plate 34) are utterly literal and utterly baffling. Each is a simple picture, but shows just how complex the interaction of human figure and viewpoint can be. Many, like plates 44 and 51, are simple celebrations of form. One thing struck me, again and again. Modern photographers often present a figure that's made up and airbrushed to polyethylene perfection - something strangely inhuman. Cunningham captures the human animal more precisely, in the delicate down of feminine skin (plate 43), the scars that record events in a person's life (plates 49 and maybe 72), goosebumps (plate 27), even stretch marks on a woman richly pregnant (plate 98). These details add depth to Cunningham's work, offering something new at every level of detail in her pictures.<br /><br />I highly recommend this collection, especially as it documents one of the visions that founded modern photographic style.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-07-23

We all get along just fine as long as the women have things their way, and the men have things their way too - the women's way, that is.<br />No one has the bad taste to comment on this arrangement until Eskarina is born, and a wizard makes a silly mistake. Could happen to anyone really - his dying moments unwittingly infuse the baby girl with wizardly, male magic.<br />In time, this brings the wrath Mistress Esmeralda Weatherwax down on the fortress of male magic, which is invaded and defeated never even knowing it was engaged. Saves a lot of work and running aroung that way, y'know. But Esme's real problem is that little girl, and her real problem is a little boy, and his real problem is -- unreal.<br />Neither the womanly witches nor the male mages are quite ready for this little girl with tomboy magic. Nor is she quite ready for herself.<br />As in Pratchett's other tales, the fun is in the telling. This battle of the sexes, like so many others, is fought to a draw - there will be cultural exchanges, visiting rights and such, and jittery kind of peace. All end up happy enough, but it's still one world with two peoples in it, male and female.<br />Except maybe for that girl and that boy.

Taoist alchemy differs dramatically from its Western counterpart, in goals but especially in means. Not a search for gold, it is seeks only enlightenment and immortality.<br /><br />These texts are cryptic for a variety of reasons. One is that the alchemical tradition draws on many other fields of esoterica including chemistry, geomancy and numerology. It also draws on astrology in use of dates tied to the lunar calendar and tangential reference to retrograde motion of celestial bodies (p.126). Above all, it draws on the ideas of vital force that appear in Chinese traditional medicine, and meditative and yogic practices. These last may be individual exercises for control of the body, or the \\"paired way\\" that harvests generative force from sex between the mystic and a consort.<br /><br />Part of the difficulty in reading this text is the ambiguity between analogies and literal fact. The adepts discuss lead and mercury, and implicitly the amalgam of the two metals, but also use that as an analogy for combining the forces of the two partners. The texts also use fertilization and the fetus in an allegorical sense, but echo the metaphysical meaning in physical coition.<br /><br />Part of the difficulty is intentional. \\"The names dragon, tiger, lead, and mercury were used by the immortals and sages to hide the true meanings from unethical practitioners,\\" (p.63) and possibly to shield novices from the risks of advanced practices. Although the last author asserts that the Tao is inherently beyond abuse, the tradition works hard to withold its knowledge from outsiders.<br /><br />There is only a little commentary on the texts, but some of that leaves me wondering whether modern revisionism crept into the translation. Wong asserts that an adept's consort may be of opposite or same sex, an idea attractive to today's readers. I have no doubt that homosexual experiences offer the full intensity of heterosexual practice, and that yin and yang refer to forces beyond mere biology. The texts use procreation as a central analogy, however, and offer no clear distinction between metaphor and action. Whatever its potency, same-sex sex is not procreative. Would the old masters have seen a piece missing from their formulas? I wonder.<br /><br />Reading this book is a mysterious experience. It describes mysteries in an allusive, elusive way. More importantly, the whole world view behind it, the many traditions that feed into it are foreign to a Western reader. I found myself reading it with a sense that I saw only the exterior of something, when it's the interior that matters.

It's thinking that creates new solutions, and defective thinking that prevents people from seeing the possibilities.<br /><br />The book is organized around a four-phase approach: detecting points of view that no longer match reality, creating and evaluating new interpretations of the world, putting new world-views in place in oneself and in others, then creating a culture of adaptation and action. Each section comes with detailed discussion and a set of thought questions, to help the reader try out the concepts presented.<br /><br />The authors write for a busy reader, one who wants fast understanding and application of the concepts presented. Supporting that, the style is readable and non-academic. The central material dominates - there's even an audio CD with the book (I didn't listen to it), a quick summary and commentary for people who need to multitask.<br /><br />The book's minor weakness is that the exercises are under-emphasized, and lack depth. True learning requires application of knowledge, and textbook exercises are applications without consequences. If this book were a course text, I'm sure the facilitator could make up for this minor flaw. As it stands, the book's strong points are weakened by lack of hands-on reinforcement.<br /><br />The serious omission here is discussion of change gone wrong, recognition of the mistakes people make that can turn their efforts in ridiculous failures. The biggest one, and the one that happens to almost everyone learning almost everything is \\"over-control.\\" Think of a teenage driver: stomping the gas, then stomping the brake, back and forth, with nothing between the extremes. That's over-control. I've seen it in skiing and other sports, software engineering, and in application of management policies. Art students are encouraged to explore it, to learn about the steps in between. The exaggeration can be comical.

He had enormous influence on twentieth centry type founding, and an encyclopedic knowledge of the history of type. It's a fascinating subject, partly because type design, more than just about any other art, is vividly aware of its own past, and is inextricably bound up with commerce.<br /><br />Up to about p.38, this book keeps the promise of its title, the search for a \\"scientific\\" classification system (a teeth-gritting misuse of the word). It discusses the history of letter forms as they appeared in cast type. The second essay also discusses one strand in the tapestry of calligraphy's history.<br /><br />After that point, however, Morison seems to switch gears. Gradually at first, he mentions earlier commentators on typography. By the end of the first essay, the topic is wholly the history of such commentaries, making this a history of typographic histories. It's a great starting point for someone about to embark on an academic study, but of limited use to the practicing typographer.<br /><br />It's brief, though, and still interesting to any reader wanting to know more about the typography's history. It just doesn't say a lot about the letter forms themselves.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-07-14

Not all women's lives create it, it may be prettiness rather than beauty, and it lasts for only a short part of a life. Still, it's there, and Hegre has captured 100 different kinds of it.    Marketa, the cover model, sets the pattern: they're all young, slender, and very lovely. A few, like Tatiane and Lucy, don't match the European mold - very few, and I would have liked more of the variety they represent. Some, like Luba are very 'posed.' Others, like Olga and Lena or Sveta and Inga, show models in close groups, hinting at physcial affection between them. Natural looks predominate but some - like Lza - offer surprises. The majority, typified by Olga, Andrea, and Dina, convey the fun the woman seems to have in simply being herself.     This book is almost too much, though. The models are sweet, but I wouldn't want to eat only desserts all the time either. There are lots of other ways for a woman to look good - but Hegre has ignored them in favor of just this very conventional one. Well, it's an easy one to enjoy.    This is a lovely collection of very pretty young women. It's not overtly erotic, except maybe once or twice. Instead, it simply celebrates the charm and elegance that's native to these lovely models.    //wiredweird	2005-07-14

Pogo and friends ran for at least thirty years, from the WWII era into the seventies. This book captures a few slices of that wonderful comic's history. It reprints a number of the daily strips from the early `50s, demonstrating Kelly's expressive artwork, soft spirit, and sharp tongue.<br /><br />There's a lot more here, though. Jeff McNally (creator of `Shoe', `Pluggers', and more) opens with a brief, heartfelt introduction. Kelly's widow has added biographical notes about Walt and the Pogo phenomenon. This book also features collections of one-panel promotional pieces featuring the Okeefenokee crowd: X days `til Christmas, weather report summaries, etc. You're sure to appreciate a few samples of Kelly's famous (infamous?) poetry - Carroll-like nonsense with a rolling tone and logical illogic all its own. Best, you'll find parts of the Christmas carols, including \\"Deck the halls with Boston Charlie.\\"<br /><br />A few sequences of the daily strips bring back the politics of Pogo's time. Like some of today's comics, this one was sometimes transplanted from the funny pages to the editorials. Mostly, though, it's a gentle but clear-eyed look at the human condition, as true now as it was then.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-07-14

Sin City is a crime drama, but without the cops. It takes place in an urban world that has no sun or mercy, gritty people in a gritty place. It has heroes of sorts, but you probably don't want to look too closely at the guy you're cheering for. Most of all, it has Miller's stark artwork. Black and white, with no tones in between, every line is as sharp as a knife edge. The images are built from extremes, as are the characters, as are the stories.<br /><br />The stories vary. The first centers on a homicidal strongman, chasing his prey into a gangland dead end, with emphasis on dead - and he's the good guy. The next comic book in this set of reprints is an enigmatic story with only one spoken sentence, near the end. Within that framework, it uses claustrophobic view angles to suggest multiple betrayals and larger events. It also makes clear that some people are innocent, some times.<br /><br />Later stories use single spots of color to create characters and to focus attention, a strong visual and narrative tool. The stories are still dark and violent, based on people at their worst. Only that last story changes in tone, a bride who panics on the eve of her wedding and runs. The problem is that she runs into some bad people. She is, however, returned in time to make her vows.<br /><br />This is what I like about the last decade in comics - innovative artwork and stories that hang together. Others are good, but Miller's Sin City is among the best.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-07-14

Some reflect on historical events, others on proper behavior, yet others on Zen and bushido. The range of topics appeals to me, making it easy to open the book at random and read until something touches on my current thoughts.<br /><br />One recurring theme is acceptance of human failure, with examples on pp 28, 42, and 113. By analogy, a wooden beam may be a little out of true or hold little knots and weeps, but still be strong and sound - perfect boards are rare, and very rarely needed. He also acknowledges (p.52) that \\"great genius matures late,\\" that one can not reach the highest achievements without twenty or thirty years of development. This has meaning for me personally, and I hope for the best.<br /><br />I have a few reservations about this translation, no matter how much I like it. It abridges the original 1300-plus passages down to 300, and abandoned the traditional organization of passages. I appreciate the brevity, but I wonder how much this non-native translator may have sacrificed in the abbreviation.<br /><br />This is an important look into the samurai's heart and mind - I do not see that becoming a monk ended his life as a samurai.

It's a small book, with just two of his early cartons per page, but they're good ones. All of them show Larson's inverted sense of reality. One shows a housewife on the phone, surrounded by fishbowls: \\"Well that's how it happened Sylvia ... I kissed this frog, he turns into a prince, we get married, and wham! ...  I'm stuck at home with a bunch of pollywogs.\\" Several others show an upset Santa Claus, his famous reindeer, and a mention of venison. Many show his fascination with improbable doings of wildlife. That earned him a place in the hearts of biologists everywhere, so much that a newly-discovered species was named in his honor.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-07-14

In fact, it goes back to a classic of western literatures, the Niebelungenlied - you know, Wotan, Valkyeries, the whole bunch that Wagner had people singing about. Those are the main themes. After that, the rest is Holt's comic improvisation on those riffs.<br /><br />Basically, Malcolm Fisher, nebbish extraordinaire, has been granted ultimate power of life and death over all of Earth. His first use of this majestic for is to make funny faces in the mirror: his own, but other people's too. As it turns out, he's pretty good about that ultimate power thing, mostly because he doesn't really want it. After many dealings with gods, goddesses, Norns, Rhinemaidens, and other annoyances, it turns out that he's quite good with that ultimate power for lots of reasons --<br /><br />-- which you'll have to read for yourself. This is Holt at his finest, a fitting peer to Pratchett. In another of his books he complains about reviewers (like me) who keep saying \\"his old stuff was better.\\" Well, this is his old stuff, and I really do like it better.

Kelly presents a nice mix of material here. Sections of comics, mostly reprints from the original daily comics, are separated by selections of baffling poetry - rolling and joyful (as near as I can tell), but delightfully impenetrable. The usual characters appear in many roles: King Owl, Churchy on his way to Mars, and Miz Beaver doing her neverending wash. A few guests appear briefly, as well: a cow looking for a job as royal dog, a lumpish dragon, and some leprechaun-like dream creatures. As always, the description can't equal Kelley's expressive line art and sideways storytelling.<br /><br />If this is your first Pogo, then good for you! If it's not your first, then welcome back, and even better for you! The stories are amusing on their own, but also evoke a gentler and less angst-ridden time. They're nostalgic and silly, but always gentle - like few, if any, today.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-07-14

The first is a wizard's experiment gone wrong at the Unseen University. A chain reaction in their squash court (sound familiar?) has released an unprecedented amount of thaumic energy. Before it could be channeled safely, it materializes a world, in fact a whole star system. But this world isn't a disc, it's round --<br /><br />The second book is a witty, well informed scientific commentary on many things, but especially on the history of life on earth. (I only noticed one mis-step in the real science, a statement about the stability of a an oxygen isotope. They probably slid that error in to make nitpickers like me feel smug.)<br /><br />The problem is, this is just one book, not two. Chapters alternate in odd-even pairs, Discworld fantasy and Ourworld fact. I probably should have read the book twice, all the odd chapters then all the even ones. As it was, I found my attention whipsawed between the two. The total was distractingly less than the sum of the parts.<br /><br />It's clever, amusing and informative.

The columns have been grouped into a few post-facto categories, decided long after the essays were first written. As may be expected, some of the individual columns do more for me than others. The section on his glorious rise and glorious falls into the `others' category, but I didn't read this to improve my understanding of Gabriel himself.<br /><br />The better parts of this book reflect on software reuse, conceptual compression, subclassing, and abstraction. Nearly ten years old at this writing, the book reflects wisdom sorely won during the era of extravagant subclassing, before a better balance with aggregation was achieved. He also describes, at length, the evils of bad abstractions - the kinds that don't include all they should, and do include much of what they shouldn't. Unfortunately, his sourness on subclassing and abstraction prevents him from detailing their proper uses. \\"Abstraction is about ignorance,\\" he quotes, but doesn't distinguish helpful from un-helpful forms of knowledge and un-knowledge, at least not in ways I can use.<br /><br />The most useful of these essays emphasizes the value of writing - I mean prose, intended for human consumption. Perhaps Gabriel is a bit strident in stating the importance of person to person expression, but perhaps neglect of the topic warrants an exaggerated response.<br /><br />This book includes a special treat, a six-page foreword by Christopher Alexander - the architect who introduced the concept of a Design Pattern. If you don't already know, he's a real building-type architect, not just a lead engineer of some kind. It's amusing, but I think rewarding, that he seems to feel better understood by builders in the thought-stuff of programs than by many in the physical world of concrete, steel, and glass. I enjoyed that section even more after reading a few of Gabriel's notes on Alexander's successes and surprising failures.<br /><br />This is a philosophical book, intended for experienced software developers - nearly all of whom have been language designers, at least in small, at one time or another.

I was surprised to find that he was a writer of other works as well. The Icosameron, a story told over twenty days, is a remarkable example. It's a fictional account of a brother and sister's eighty-year stay in a strange civilization on the inner surface of a hollow Earth.<br /><br />Much has been said about Casanova's seventeenth century foretelling of self-powered cars, poison gas, and other modern creations. There is also much to say about how his notorious promiscuity shapes this fiction. Brother/sister coupling is taken for granted, for one thing. For another, the natives lactate but nursing is a daily and necessary exchange between adults. I can only imagine how the author wished daily intimacy of similar kind for himself.<br /><br />I was more interested in other points, however. One was the clockwork regularity of the world. For the human visitors and their descendants, that included annual child birth, accurate down to the day, to the one day shared by mothers and childbearing daughters of whatever generation. I suppose you could call it their combined Labor Day and Mother's Day. Though otherwise inattentive to the women, Casanova noted that the men made competent midwives - partly because of the women's Edenic ease of birth, and partly because all the women were otherwise occupied. The narrator's own wife repeated this annual feat forty times, bearing healthy twins each time. It was a staggering feat of fecundity, and one repeated in the early generations of their descendants.<br /><br />Casanova also seemed to take it as natural that humankind would colonize and dominate this world, despite its incumbent population. The women's rapid-fire fertility was almost a divine intervention to ensure rapid replacement of the natives. Along those lines, the narrator also introduced gunpowder and guns to this Eden. Nominally, they were used only to drive the snakes out of the fruit trees and gardens (!). The author took a miserly glee in the sheer mass of his arsenal, however, despite lack of other targets. It is dismally easy to foresee the human invaders turning those guns against their native hosts, in the imperialistic tradition of the time.<br /><br />This book earns Casanova's inner world a place beside Erewhon, Utopia, and the many lands that Gulliver traveled. It combines satire with wishful thinking to capture the spirit and thinking, not just of the author, but of his whole time.<br /><br />//wiredweirde author took a miserly glee in the sheer mass of his arsenal, however, despite lack of other targets.

He first starts by debunking their ideas of perspective. It's a brief task because, as he demonstrates clearly, they had nothing we could identify by that name. Instead of arranging figures according to the logic of sight, Ivins argues that Greek art arranged figures according to a `tactile' perspective, as if they were placed for easy reach rather than easy visual interpretation. He also dismisses the classical Greek sense of composition, on the ground that there was none. Figures were simply placed, without regard for their relationship to a time sequence, to a landscape, or to each other. He uses, as example, the battle friezes of Bassae, which were dismantled without noting their relationships to each other. At least six guesses at their arrangement, based on content, were in turn declared to be `definitive.' The question of their proper order was only resolved when mounting marks on the backs were matched to the holes in the walls from which they had been detached - with no regard to the pictures themselves.<br /><br />The rest of the book argues likewise against the importance of classical Greek science, philosophy, and even Aristotelian logic (or illogic). Along the way, Ivins throws a number of barbs at the so-called scholars of ancient Greek culture, including those who argue the relative merits of different works that no longer existed even at the time of the earliest known commentary on them.<br /><br />This brief book (or sustained essay) is a wonderful contrarian work by a man of inarguable qualification. He was director of prints for many years, in the Metropolitan Museum in New York, well trained in art but independent of traditional scholarship. It's great by itself, or as a foil to your favorite snob of the classics - enjoy!<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-07-14

They're brief, enigmatic, and very Japanese, an echo of the author's own brief and enigmatic life. The book opens with `In a Grove' a murder mystery with too many confessions - including one by the victim. It continues with the title story `Rashomon', less a story than a snapshot of moral choice. `The Martyr' creates an odd mix of Japanese tradition with Christianity, a story of honor ruined and restored, but with a deeper secret that makes restoration much more than it seemed. There are other stories as well, including `Kesa and Mirito,' about infidelity and vengeance (or something like it). If you need proof that these vignettes come from a non-Western world, this story gives all you need and more.<br /><br />Akutagawa, writing in Japan at the dawn of the twentieth century, evokes a time and place that seem much farther. I recommend this highly, for the sense it gives of how similar other times and people may be to us now, and also how very different.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-07-14

It covers everything from mixing gesso accoording to traditional recipes, to framing and care of the finished work. For me, though, that's the least of it.<br /><br />First, it's an incredible reference on the tools and techniques of water gilding. It limits itself to gilding as it works with tempera painting and frames, but is exhaustive within that scope. It discusses everything from the laying the bole ground to burnishing, then tinting the finish. Although this emphasizes traditional tools and materials, the author isn't afraid to use modern aids, like rubber cement masks. By the way, anyone who wants to use scrapers to smooth the gesso ground, as this author suggests, should consult a woodworker's guide for directions on sharpening the scraper. A little extra effort up front makes a world of difference in the scraper's performance.<br /><br />Second, it's a fascinating historical document. Although the book was written in the early 20th century, most of its recipes go back to medieval times, maybe earlier. Therein lies a potential problem, though. Back then people were a bit less careful about pigments like lead white and mercury-based vermilion. Since egg tempera doesn't keep well in wet form, the artist must use many pigments in their hazardous dry form. The practitioner should review the safety of pigments and techniques very carefully before trying the directions in this book.<br /><br />Still, it's interesting to read about the daily practice of art, including the artist's relationship to a pigment supplier, from a time so different from our own. The recipes, too, have an antiquated sound. I'm not sure I've ever seen sandarac, for example, let alone the range of colors all identified as \\"vermilion.\\"<br /><br />This isn't just history, though. It needs some adjustment for modern safety and materials, but it's a very practical guide to everything there is to know about the many techniques in tempera painting.<br /><br />//wiredweirdut it's a very practical guide to everything there is to know about the many techniques in tempera painting.    //wiredweird	2005-07-14

It's been translated into English, with a few notes added by the modern author (Forrer). The text has many accompanying illustrations. Those include sketches and remarkable paintings on silk or paper. Quite a few will be unfamiliar to most viewers - they include unique objects (like the drawings) and many rare prints. In fact, some of the prints were only discovered recently, or so people thought until they were seen mentioned in de Goncourt's text.<br /><br />What I hoped for: A collection of Hokusai's art that really shows the art. This is basically a history or biography. Only a handful of the reproductions are in color, but printed well in those few cases. The overwhelming majority of illustrations are black-and-white, often too small to see any detail. Many large ones have such uncertain focus that detail gets lost, too. The real purpose of the pictures, though was to support the text. The illustrations do that adequately, like visual signposts along the path of Hokusai's career.<br /><br />If you're looking for a coffee-table set of Hokusai reproductions, give this one or two stars.

It describes the major structural families of Roman letter forms, based on stroke weights and emphasis, style of serifs (if any), and historical origin. There are plenty of visual examples for most of the text, critical for training the eye. This brief book is certainly a good start.<br /><br />It's just a start, though. Lawson chose a brief format for this book. That avoided tedium, but necessarily omitted examples and discussions that could heve deepened the presentation. The section on display fonts is the briefest, probably because the range of display fonts is widest and hardest to divide into tidy compartments. Instead, Lawson relegates all special cases to the \\"hell box,\\" the bin where damaged type was dumped on its way to being melted down. This, I think, is a symptom of the book's weakness: the tendency to force type faces into his Procrustean categories, and gloss over whatever didn't fit.<br /><br />He acknowledges that \\"Exact classification of the many types which can conceivably be listed as decorative is not easy.\\" I would argue that rigid classification is not always desirable and is often impossible. Lawson mentions Knuth's MetaFont program in passing, and that tool (or another like it) inflicts mortal wounds on any body of categories. Whatever the diagnostic point that separates one class from another, in serifs and bracketing, emphasis, decoration, etc., the clever artist can defeat it. It would be a freshman computing exercise to morph two (or more!) fonts into each other, straddling the line of distinction with one foot firmly on each side of the divide.<br /><br />If not taken to dogmatic extremes, type taxonomy can be helpful in a variety of ways. It establishes a common language, allowing terse exchange of complex ideas. When classification fails, as it surely will at some point, the typographer needs a descriptive vocabulary that calls out a font's unique structure in equally concise words. Lawson seems to have become so dedicated to classification that he under-represents the rich descriptive vocabulary needed for the second half of the job.<br /><br />This is a good introduction, and may work well if type is a tool rather than a passion for you. This book will probably disappoint the specialist or advanced student, however. Other books give more detailed description and in more specific terms.<br /><br />//wiredweirdvide.

She was child, woman, and elder. She was part of life, and of the underworld. Enki, her father and the god of wisdom, bestowed on her every holy gift he had, including his wisdom.<br /><br />That brings up a second point. These are very down-to-earth gods. Beer - brewed grain - was an important part of their diet, if only because the alcohol granted some level of disinfection. Enki lavished his riches (and beer) on his beloved guest. The more beer he lavished on her and on himself, the more gifts he granted. Next morning, he woke up and asked his aides \\"What happened? - I did WHAT?\\" By then, Inanna was away with the goods.<br /><br />As a fertility goddess, Inanna had no equal. The stories go on at length describing the holy rites of fertility. She joyously embraces her own fertilization, or at least a good hearty attempt at it. What more could one ask of a goddess?<br /><br />The myths are truly wonderful stories, from the oldest written language in the West. The book is a collaboration of translator and mythologist, and seems stronger for both of their efforts. Each adds a useful commentary to the text, as does the artist who chose the authentic Sumerian artwork that decorates the text. Still, it seems clear that much has been lost to history, or has not yet been recovered form the fragmentary texts. As good as these stories and hymns may be, they'll just get better as more tablets are translated and more pieces puzzled together. It's a dicey process, though. As much as I enjoyed these stories, I wondered whether the pieces had been puzzled together correctly, or even belonged together. Awaiting further discoveries, no one can know.<br /><br />Inanna was a contemporary of Gilgamesh, who appears briefly. She is a natural complement to his story, and gives a wider view of that very early point in Western history.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-06-26

This is a non-nonsense, practical guide to writing with numbers - something that lots of people do without even realizing it, and often do badly.<br /><br />This book is aimed at a variety of different audiences. It will help anyone writing at the level of a newspaper story. Miller suggests a variety of ways to avoid basic blunders and gaffes. Avoiding errors isn't enough, though, so Miller suggests a variety of ways to bring the meaning and importance of the values to life for a reader - and that's what the exercise was really about. One of her strongest techniques is \\"GEE\\", for Generalizations, Examples, and Exceptions. She presents a number of cases that show the general rule expressed by the numbers, specific and representative cases, then the \\"truth in advertising,\\" the gotchas and caveats that refine any broad-brush generality. Come to think of it, that's not a bad technique for other kinds of descriptive writing, either.<br /><br />Miller extends GEE and her other suggestions to the most rigorous kinds of scientific writing, as well. If anything, bad writing about numbers may be even easier when numbers are so much more critical and have such subtle relationships. It's a bit annoying that Miller refers repeatedly to her other, as yet unwritten book for more advanced statistical topics; I keep getting the feeling that I'm reading only half of something.<br /><br />That leads me to a few other weaknesses I found in this book. The sections on charts, tables, and presentations are competent enough, but could have been a lot stronger. The charting section is especially weak, and should be supplemented by another text about charting specifically. If this is meant as a reference, to be grabbed when a writer hits a snag, it could have been organized a bit more tightly, in more of handbook style. Still there are a few good tables describing common kinds of numbers (fractions, percentages, ratios, absolute differences, etc) and how to handle them, good for a writer's quick fix.<br /><br />The one real weakness comes from one of the book's strengths. Miller really does address number users of many levels of sophistication. She does realize that some people need to make sense of milage comparisons and slanted percentages in the news and in ads, but others deal in z-scores, p-values, and wilder exotica. The problem is that the numerical novice and sophisticate are usually addressed in the same sentence, or at least paragraph. This may be a turn-off for people struggling with the basics, i.e. the people most in need of advice.<br /><br />This is a valued addition to the reference shelf of anyone who presents quantitive information. That's just about every writer, sooner or later. It may help technical illustrators, too, because image and word serve many of the same purposes in presenting information. This should not be your only guide to presenting numbers, but it should be among your tools.<br /><br />//wiredweirdal weakness comes from one of the book's strengths.

It is interesting for two reasons. First, that it focuses exclusively on tools for logical reasoning, and not on numerical tools like a slide rule or abacus. Second, it was written at the dawn of the electronic computing era, before even one-at-a-time transistors were used, and long before the earliest integrated circuit.<br /><br />It briefly describes Lull's rotating disks, a little like the child's toy that can put a lion's head on a turtle's body. Lull used dozens of variants (up to 14 disks, in one case) to explore combinations of theological and moral ideas, but not for reaching conclusions from basic premises. Gardner goes on to describe set-inclusion diagrams pioneered by Euler and popularized by Venn, Pierce's arcane \\"existential diagrams\\", and a few other pencil and paper notations. He describes a few clever tools based on different cards with windows cut into them, so that the alignment of windows in overlapping cards represents joining of logical statements. He also mentions mechanical, electrical, and relay-based gadgets, as well as one based on rotating, counter-rotating, and jammed gears.<br /><br />For some reason, he chose not to mention a once-popular tool based on stacks of cards, with holes punched or notches cut in the edges. Stack the cards, slide a pin through the aligned holes representing (for example) male subjects, and shake loose all the cards with notches that don't snag the pin. Repeat the process on the male or female stack of cards, using other holes representing different traits, and the desired subset of subjects (if any) remain. Although used for filing, this tool could easily have handled dozens of logical variables, not just the four or five seen in other mechanisms.<br /><br />The second facet of this book gives it a quaint feeling. Gardner ends the book with a set of predictions about the future of logic machines. He dismisses programmable computers as unwieldy and inefficient. Still, he hopes for inference engines to be sped up electronically, perhaps using analog computation. Other predictions sound equally odd - some because they did not come to pass, others (like H. G.

194452:US	35004134	R10E0F3V9XP475	354058577X	845730486	Digital Circuit Design for Computer Science Students: An Introductory Textbook	Books	5	8	8	N	Y	Best book of its kind	This is an unusual little book that addresses a specific need: the first introduction to hardware how and why for someone who's already a competent programmer. That audience has very different needs than those of electrical engineering students learning logic design, but I know of no other book intended for that audience.<br /><br />The pace is brisk. It starts at the level of bipolar transistors, and shows the differences between a CMOS and TTL totem pole. Before page 100, the student has seen combinational logic, registers, RAM and ROM, and the Lola hardware design language, and is designing a CPU. By the time the book ends, the student has seen bit-slice controllers, microprocessors and IO systems, and the inner workings of a UART.<br /><br />This is not idle play. 99% of all processors these days do not run Windows or Unix. Instead, they're inside of sewing machines, fuel injectors, implanted defibrillators, and anti-lock brakes. Schools do little, if anything at all, to prepare students for working in an environment where software and hardware are interchangeable. In those worlds, a programmer is often called upon to specify and debug hardware, at least as one member of a mixed development team. They may even need to understand how to create logic circuits that perform computing tasks. Silicon Graphics and Cray have both released main-stream processors that have programmable logic strapped onto their CPUs, and someone has to make that logic work.<br /><br />Because of its unique direction, this book skips nearly all of what a \\"logic design\\" book would address. There is no Karnaugh mapping, state minimization, or mention of logic hazards (though the student does get a look at some kinds of transient glitches). There is bare mention of asynchronous design, a bugbear of logic design students and now relegated to narrow niches. There are, however, schematics and part lists for a CPU built from MSI logc, for a microprocessor-based computer, and for the gate-array logic design of a small CPU.<br /><br />An EE might poo-poo this book as \\"logic lite,\\" because it doesn't teach all that manly circuit stuff. Well, it wasn't meant to. The student who studies this book carefully, however, will be ready to deal with ground bounce, spec sheets, and a wide range of problems from the analog level on up.<br /><br />Wirth's dense but readable book is my choice for a programmer's first look inside the hardware. I just wish there were an edition newer than the 1995 printing.<br /><br />//wiredweirdray logic design of a small CPU.  <br /> <br />An EE might poo-poo this book as \\"logic lite,\\" because it doesn't teach all that manly circuit stuff.

In fact, he sometimes claimed it as his own. A grand claim, perhaps, but this extract from his ouvre puts some weight behind it.<br /><br />It includes some of his jewelry, bronzes, and stage design, but those are minor parts of this collection. His well-know graphic works dominate by far - product wrappers, post cards, and theatrical posters. It says a fair bit for his popularity that, shortly after his posters were put up to announce some new production, they were torn down again by collectors.<br /><br />A whole chapter describes his work work Sarah Bernhardt, with whom he seemed to have a happy professional symbiosis. Sarah had the \\"problem\\" of a slender figure in an age when roundness defined a woman's beauty. Mucha's style was about long, flowing curves of drapery, vegetation, and figure - a natural match to Sarah. His publicity posters certainly advanced her career, but it seems that her inspiration advanced his, too.<br /><br />The text is informative, but tends towards a kind of history that I find dry. The pictorial presentation is effective, though. It includes many of his graphic works, and often the sketches that led up to them. The pictures also show his tendency to repeat an image with little or no variation - a plagiarism of self that must have been handy for meeting tight commercial deadlines. It gives an interesting insight into Mucha's work habits and how he would develop an image.<br /><br />There may be better books on Mucha out there, but this one is certainly worth having.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-06-22

He is half deaf and more than half blind with age. Even so, he can see that the diminutive people here are gentle, serious, and not yet Christian. He performs a mass baptism, not realizing that he has created Christian penguins.<br /><br />So begins France's straight-faced satire of the church, the state, and anything else he can think of. First, the innocents must clothe their nakedness. This creates modesty for them, but also creates immodesty, lust-inducing arts of skirt and bodice, and avarice for finer clothes and baubles. Next, they develop property law, proven by disputes over farmland. They create a noble class, when one demonstrates his nobility by killing another penguin and taking his land. They create a royalty, by means of fraud and extortion. They even create their first saint, the miraculous virgin Ste. Orberosia. She seemed best known for her miraculous virginity, which she proclaimed until her dying day (and we don't argue with saints). In fact, she was able to proclaim her virginity even after dozens or hundreds of encounters that would have destroyed it in less holy a woman - miraculous indeed. Perhaps the penguins weren't born subject to Original Sin, but they're mighty quick with the imitation.<br /><br />The History of Penguinia moves forward, through ages of avarice, adultery, elaboarate scams, false accusations, and all the usual goings-on of the political world. The events are painfully funny, right down to the cynical, cyclical view of modern times, locked into an historical rhythm. The views are painful only because they're so very true.<br /><br />I imagine they would have been even more true for me if I knew more about the political current events of France and Europe circa 1900, when this book was being written. I also suspect some wordplay in characters' names that would have been amusing if I knew French. It is a measure of Anatole France's genuius that now, nearly a hundred years later, it's still true enough for a modern reader, and one unfamiliar with the book's original milieu. I imagine this book will reward the prepared reader even more richly.<br /><br />This is satire at its finest - funny, but with an edge, and funny because it's so very true.<br /><br />//wiredweirdnough for a modern reader, and one unfamiliar with the book's original milieu.

Color reproductions are good, but lots of the paintings are shown in B&W, which I consider a loss. The text is workmanlike, but I have to admit I skipped most of it.<br /><br />The problem is, I just don't much care for Hockney's work, and this book didn't change that part of my taste. Parts were interesting, like the relationships between his Polaroid collages and the paintings with rubbery perspective. Only just interesting, though.<br /><br />I gave this four stars because it does seem to be a competent presentation of it's kind, but I've seen more impressive books dedicated to other artists.

But this is Druillet, so we let some things slide.<br /><br />Sloane died, and has ben entombed for ten years in a golden sarcophagus. You've already guessed that little stuff like that won't slow him down. His casket is transported, for reasons obscure, and a magical woman appears within his sealed transport. She revives him with a kiss (hint: this isn't a kids' story). He wreaks the usual havoc, and sails off into one setting sun or another.<br /><br />But you weren't reading this for the plot. Druillet's stories are just vehicles for Druillet's are, which is truly fantastic. It lacks some of the frenzied detail of his 70s/80s work, but is incredible nonetheless. His sense of majesty, mysticism, and evil is overwhelming, and pervades every panel. The \\"Dark Demon\\" is the simplest of the drawings here, technically, but the most evocative.<br /><br />Druillet's work isn't for kids or for tender sensibilities. It is, however, some of the best sequential artwork ever drawn.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-06-20

Still, the artist has an intense experience of his model, and Helga was his model for 15 years.<br /><br />This is an outstanding book in lots of ways. The subject matter is beyond belief, and the reproductions are good. The visual content is organized well: major pieces are chronological, and sketches and studies are gouped with the pieces they support. I find it very helpful to see the sketches, and see all the variations that Wyeth tried before committing to a more dmanding piece. Those groups of drawings are drawing lessons themselves, in how to explore a visual idea. The text is a bit thin, and says nearly nothing about Helga herself - not a flaw in the book, so much as a step short of what it could have been.<br /><br />Most of all, the pictures are simply lovely. Helga was a very handsome woman, in her 50s in the lastest of these pictures. Not 'pretty' maybe, but very beautiful - at least, she is presented as very beautiful, and very real. Some of the nudes studies show her arms crossed, oddly compressing her natural curves. That just makes the pictures more genuine for me, showing her as she is, not made up to some anatomical ideal.<br /><br />Explanatory text could have been more explanatory, but that's OK. The large majority of the book is just the pictures themselves, and I don't mind being alone with them.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-06-19

When you start doing arithmetic, though, things get weird. Measuring longitude in degrees, 179+2=-179. In degrees latitude, 89+2=89, but the longitude changes! And, when you try to figure longitude precisely at the north pole, you run into a singularity. Believe me, you don't want to be in a plane when its navigation programs run into singularities.<br /><br />Those bits of strangeness all vanish when quaternions represent angles. Quaternions are a bit like complex numbers, but with three different complex parts instead of one. They have very nice mathematical properties, even better than rotation matrices, and a compact form.<br /><br />Kuipers gives a clear, thorough introduction to quaternions and their uses in geometric computations. Everything is explained one step at a time, giving the reader plenty of chance to back off and try again when the discussion gets thick. The buildup is very methodical, just about every derivation is carried out in steps that are easy to follow, using legible, standard notation. Kuipers uses side bars to remind the reader about the basics under more complex discussions, keeping an awareness of where a beginner might go off the rails. Since this discusses geometric computations, illustrations are profuse.<br /><br />The book is not for the reader in a hurry. There are lots of gems here, but you really do have to dig through a lot to find them. The illustrations contain all needed information, but it may take some effort to pick them apart. And, like any technical book, this assumes a reader with a certain background. In this case, intuition about 3D objects, trig, and linear algebra are compulsory, but I guess a sufficiently dedicated reader could substitute blind obedience to formulas for linear algebra. Ch.11-13 assumes calculus through partial differentials and ODEs, but many readers can skip these chapters without loss.<br /><br />This is all the how and why of quaterion representations of 3D rotations. It's gently paced, and makes only moderate assumptions about the reader's background. I've never seen this material presently so clearly, from so many angles, anywhere else. Highly recommended.<br /><br />//wiredweirdt loss.    This is all the how and why of quaterion representations of 3D rotations.

Once a week, he would target racism (both the people for and against), religion (ditto), bohemian artistry (ditto), or the tribulations of modern life. Or, as shown here, presidents and politics.<br /><br />This is a collection of his cartoons, spanning nearly 30 years. It's organized chronologically by president, an organization that itself carries information. From the complacency of the 50s, when \\"leisure\\" was a problem, through Viet Nam and most of the Cold War, up to Reagan's Movie America, this is almost a chronicle of American neuroses.<br /><br />His cartoons of kids may be the most pointed. In some (p.187, for example), Feiffer digs at parental callousness and irresponsibility. In others, the unfortunate little ones are shown contorting themselves into blatantly ridiculous patterns of adult reasoning. In others (e.g. both on p.63) the child seems to be the one sane point in a world where sanity is not an asset.<br /><br />These cartoons express ideas that are probably important to you.

The text starts with an historical primer on the Chandellas who created the temple complex. It ends with a few pages discussing the cultural and historical context in whicht the temples were built. The middle section of the book, by far the largest part, gives detailed descriptions of each different temple at the Khajuraho site. Although the text is thorough, pictorial plans of the site and of each temple would have helped in visualizing the details.<br /><br />It was a fair trade-off, though. Fewer architectural details made room for more photos, all in color. The gallery starts with exterior shots of the temples, then works its way into details of some of the famous niche carvings. These are beautiful stone renderings of everything joyous in life. The authors give a progression of pictures, gradually easing the Western mind into a non-Western idea of what deserves holy depiction. Early on, we see a standing couple (p.42), richly arrayed, graceful and handsome, and obviously happy to be together. Other friezes show communal celebrations, like parade of musicians (p.72). Toward the end of the book, the sculptural scenes become more passionate. Some show single figures in ecstatic dance (p.142). Others show couples (or triples, or more) in ecstatic erotism. These works cover the range of sexual contact, imcluding hands (p.181, 191), mouths (p.186), and even animal (p.185). Coital works span the familiar (p.171), unusual (p.177), athletic (p.180, 189), and frankly improbable (p.178). All are sculpted with sensitivity, sometimes with arresting beauty (p.175).<br /><br />This book is the best introduction I know to the famous temple art at Khajuraho. These temples are world treasures. They venerate the creative force in the universe. They celebrate the ongoing flow of creation that sustains the human world, and they celebrate the urge to create the appears in all of us.

I need it now, in a form that I can put to use without too many side trips<br /><br />This book is almost what I was looking for. It builds up a semantic logic based on lambda calculus, then creates typed versions. Pierce really does work very methodically up through the levels, ending at about the place where C++ templates and recursive type definitions start. Along the way, he's careful to match the typing axioms to semantics, covering unusual topics like exceptions and type inference while he's at it.<br /><br />Almost what I was looking for, but not quite. As I said, I have immediate needs, and I'm not into theory for its own sweet sake. That means I had little appreciation for all the chapters that created arithmetic all over again, starting from Peano axioms (or something like), via the lambda calculus. I know that low-level axiomatizations and lambda calculus are much beloved of the theoreticians, but I encounter them only rarely, and when I was trying to get something else done, like now. For me, they created a diversion blocked by an impediment. Also, however convenient it may be for theory, functional programming is mostly a journal-page peculiarity in industrial practice. I admit, analysis of functional programs pushed me into insight I might have missed, but I would probably have been quite happy dealing with assignment formalisms instead.<br /><br />I almost gave this three stars, because its unnecessary notational baggage and off-main-stream topics weren't doing my job. Bruce's book (ISBN 026202523X) was a much more profitable use of my time. Still, Pierce's goals weren't mine, and the mansion of type analysis has many rooms. Not all of those rooms are furnished to my taste, and don't need to be. I rounded up to four stars for what it meant to do.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-06-12

Good thing it's not a very big infinity, and it turns out to be full of people like Seaton and Crane (Anglo faces, pretty much, and they keep their women-folk invisibly tucked away somewhere), in desperate battle against the lesser races of the universe.<br /><br />It's big, it's bold, and it's a 1930s view of women, race, and unbridled technological optimism.

It looks as if Elam has adapted the notes from her own teaching into textbook form, with very successful result.<br /><br />As the title suggests, the book discusses only layout grids as a tool for organizing information and visual effect. One thing may surprise the reader, and that is Elam's repeated use of an exercise that looks so simple as to be trivial: a 3x3 grid, evenly spaced, and a fixed palette of five or ten specified visual elements. Your initial impression might be \\"Nice, but what comes after the first ten minutes?\\" The answer is the same thing, again and again. This works incredibly well. The severe constraints don't crush creativity. They guide it along a specific axis of design space, and force detailed analysis of that one axis. There are other kinds of exercises and analyses, too, but the recurring use of that closely constrained task is a very useful teaching tool.<br /><br />Another things that works well is the transparent films bound into the book. Each one overlays a layout demonstration, and reconstructs the gridlines that shaped the demo. I was happily surprised at how well the book's binding maintained registration between the printing on the different pages, with just one exception.<br /><br />The only reason to criticise this book would be for lack of things it never meant to deliver. Elam always speaks in her own voice, but talks to the design teacher as often as to the design student - well, teachers need to learn, too, and I think it's good for students to get some idea of what teaching is about. This book also has a low ceiling. It's meant for a first-term course in its topic, and some readers may be disappointed by lack of more advanced content. The problem is in that reader's expectations; the book meets its own goal quite nicely.<br /><br />This is a very good reference for beginning graphic designers, for beginning teachers of graphic design, and for self-teacher trying to learn visual organization.

It says much about the few generations of ancestors the led up to Maxfield himself, and offer a vast wealth of minutiae about Parrish's life. Did you know that one of his neighbors was a best-selling author during early decades of the 1900s? Wow. Lots of the text isn't nearly that thrilling.<br /><br />The pictures, though, are beautiful. They make the most of Parrish's brilliant sense of light, landscape, and romantic vision. There are works here that haven't often been shown before, especially from his later landscape ouvre.

It's probably what gave me my taste for comics and illustrated fiction of all kinds, for which I am deeply grateful.<br /><br />If you don't already know, Pogo is a `possum, living in a hollow tree in the Okeefenokee swamp. He's friends with Albert the cigar-chomping alligator, self-important Howland Owl, the ever-inept Churchy la Femme (turtle by trade), pup dog, and a bunch of others. There's a lot of running around, slapstick humor, and personality stereotyping, all in a deep-south-rural vein. Saying that says almost nothing, though.<br /><br />Pogo is always a comment on Walt Kelly's times, and the time was the early years of the Cold War. Atom bombs were on everyone's mind, as was the Soviet threat. More mundane insanity entered the swamp, too, in the form of kangaroo courts (no real kangaroos, though), overly-upright political figures and cultural standards, and lots more. Later Pogo became more pointed, but there's plenty of point here, too. It's an artifact of a different time, though - half a hundred years ago, now, and the problems always resolved happily, in a generally gentle spirit. It makes me nostalgic for times I never actually experienced.<br /><br />Words fail me. Walt Kelly created a wonderful family of characters, right down to the tadpole apprenticed to daddy frog's cake-stirring business. There's nothing like it being written any more, and our time is poorer for it. Pogo was topical, to a point, but is still sweet and enjoyable, and it leaves me wondering just where and when we lost the basic civility Kelly drew in these comics. Pogo and the rest are all worth knowing, even today.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-06-11

It covers all the basics: boolean logic, gate implementations, and the elements of binary arithmetic. It talks about minimization techniques, logic delays, and some of the classic logic implementation technologies (PLAs, decoders, muxes). It gives the basics of common notation, including timing diagrams, gate-level schematics, and so on. The last few chapters discuss synchronous (clocked) design and design of state machines, including standard reduction techniques. All the basics of modern design are there. A good student will start to see the number of different ways any problem can be solved, and start to recongize that no one perspective will solve all problems, at least not well.<br /><br />Asynchronous logic, based on stable states of combinational circuits with feedback, is one of the topics skipped. That's still important in the interior of flip-flops and in niche application areas, but asynchronous design certainly not in the main stream any more. Likewise, the authors skip over transistor-level design (mostly), the oddities of J-K flops, and most discussion of discrete or MSI logic. Well, that makes sense. Most logic these days is implemented in PALs (which are covered) or larger-scale devices. 7400-level devices have pretty much gone the way of relays and tubes - of historical interest, mostly. Remember that this is \\"Contemporary\\" logic, and those aren't big concerns in the daily work of most contemporary logic designers.<br /><br />There are other omissions that make sense for a first-term course. Hardware description languages (e.g. Verilog or VHDL) are barely mentioned; they're critical in daily practice, but may not be useful until students have mastered this book's level. Micro-sequencers might also be a bit advanced for this presentation, despite their usefulness and their conceptual importance in later courses. More complex design examples would have helped, but would probably have started making bad assumptions about tools available to the student. Sticking to simple problems, however, may not prepare the student for systems of realistic complexity. Some of the omissions really don't do the student any favors. When logic design is so separate from other kinds of circuit design, students come away with a critical lack of understanding of how logic fits into a whole system. There's just no mention of signal integrity, drive strength, power consumption, jitter and skew, interfacing, or all the points where logic hits the rest of the world. Nothing in this book prepares a student for reading a standard spec sheet, let alone reading between its lines. I can only hope that instructors using this book make up for some of those deficiencies in supplementary material or in the lab.<br /><br />The authors have chosen a range of topics to cover, and have covered it with workman-like competence. It's good as far as it goes. My only problem is that it doesn't go into the second semester, into the underlying technology (or not much), or very far into the real world.<br /><br />//wiredweirdt would probably have started making bad assumptions about tools available to the student.

It is a very successful grafting of Gaiman's modern creation onto traditional Japanese storytelling. Personalities of the fox, the Bhuddist monk, and all the others work well together. The three Fates (or maybe Norns?) appear, too, in a distinctively eastern form. In among them all, the Dream King aka Sandman works in his quiet ways.<br /><br />This has a somewhat different narrative format than the other Sandman books. It relies more on text to carry the tale, and less on the images. Most two-page spreads consist of text on the left and a whole-page painting on the right, though two-page paintings and even a four-page spread appear. They're all wordless single images, though, not the multiple panels of typical comics. Rather than being the story, the images set the mood of the written tale.<br /><br />The pictures are beautiful, though. The story holds together well, and shows how versatile a modern myth can be in adapting itself to older traditions. This leaves me wanting see more of Amano's artwork, and maybe more different ways for the Sandman to be interpreted.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-06-05

Most of the pictures focus on coupling of one man and one woman, but men together, women singly or together, multiples of each, and even mythical beasts appear in various samples. At least a few pictures show use of toys, genital kisses and caresses, and even cleanup tissues - a little touch that lends familiarity to this unfamiliar culture. Another point appealed to me as well, that all or nearly all scenes show happy, consenting partners.<br /><br />The historical notes are what such notes should be. They explain the unfamiliar or point out details, without belaboring the obvious. Descriptions of the prints themselves could have been a bit better, especially regarding foxing, fading, and other signs of age. I was glad to see the damaged images, though. It gives viewers a more realistic idea of what to expect when the see prints in galleries or stores, and I'd rather see the image damaged that never see it at all.<br /><br />In terms of printing and image-making techniques, this book spans a very wide range. The collection is dominated by 17-19th century woodcuts, in the familiar colored style or simple linear images. The authors have also included some of the cartoons that would have been used to guide the artisan cutting the blocks, as well as pencil drawings made for their own sake. There are a few clever fold-outs, including one where, upon lifting the tablecloth on the print, we see lovers playing footsie under the table. Another series (cat. 87) shows a lovely set of prints in a style new to me, one that imitates traditional ink drawings. Others (cat. 84) use \\"blind impressions\\" to emboss patterns into the print. Careful photography shows how the indentations enhance the patterns of the fabric, or (in a second print) describe the modeling of the figures and their musculature. In a few cases, the authors show multiple impressions of a given image, to show how instances of the \\"same\\" image may differ.<br /><br />If you have just one book of Edo-era erotica, make it this one. It's beautiful, broad, and informative in many ways. Best of all, it gives a very happy impression of the players and their play.<br /><br />//wiredweirdgraphy shows how the indentations enhance the patterns of the fabric, or (in a second print) describe the modeling of the figures and their musculature.

Mohr has captured about twenty models in the later months of their pregnancies. It's a beautiful, joyous collection - these women all want to be photographed, want to be seen at their fullest. They want to be celebrated in that part of their life that is uniquely womanly. Most of them talk about how their curves are loved within their families, and are generous enough to let the viewer love them too, just a little.<br /><br />These are very strong people, as Martina and especially Katrin show. They have friends or lovers, as Andrea shows. Their figures are elegant, as Andrea, Anke, Cara, and Sarah show. They are more than just bellies, as Kolja shows, they people first with other lives. But they are women, too, sometimes more womanly because of their grand figures and because of all the other changes in their bodies.<br /><br />There are many collections dedicated to women's beauty. Very few of them describe the whole woman, in all the ways that she can be. The may skip early life, or later life, or giving life. Pregnancy may be the most important time of life, because every living person, even you, came from a pregnancy.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-06-04

This time, it's a compilation of extracts from the Huainan Tzu (or Huainanzi). Unlike other books, this has multiple authors, guest philosophers in the court of a king of the small Huainan nation. If there's any choppiness in this list of brief lessons, it's probably due to the book's mixed origin rather than Cleary's editing.<br /><br />He chose to arrange the aphoristic anecdotes into four chapters, on State, Warfare, Peace, and Wisdom. These readings are much less direct than other authors on statecraft - Han Fei Tzu or Sun Tzu are clearer to a modern reader, and more immediately applicable. Like other Taoist authors, these convey the sense that proper following of The Way is the only goal. Within The Way all other things, including peace, prosperity, and victory, ensue with the inevitability of water flowing down hill.<br /><br />Some of these teachings are clear enough, though, and applicable immediately in today's world. \\"In early spring, ... pregnant animals are not to be killed and birds' eggs are not to be taken.\\" Natural and agricultural resources need to be managed properly in order to stay productive for the long term. It's a lesson that is too rarely remembered in modern policy-making, when resources must be stretched to feed so many more people. Elsewhere, the Huainan masters direct their invasion forces not to destroy resources or plunder the populace, in order to keep the majority's good will after a change of regime. They knew this over two thousand years ago, but we're still applying the lesson only poorly today.<br /><br />This isn't in the first rank of Taoist writings, but it's a readable and worthwhile addition for anyone who wants to dig a bit deeper. It complements Sun Tzu and Mo Tzu as much as it does Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu. It gives a little extra perspective on today's world, too.<br /><br />//wiredweird<br /><br />PS: This book's content also appears as one section of a larger collection, Cleary's \\"The Taoist Classics, Volume I.\\"Taoist Classics, Volume I.\\"	2005-06-04

It's a vampire story, it's birth and death, it's aliens and Hades, and deformity and beauty.<br /><br />Mostly, it's an incredible effort in visual narration, with the narration priovided by DeMatteis and the visuals by Kent Williams. Watercolors carry most of the story, and carry it in warm, sympathetic renderings of figure. GIven the nature of mixed media, it's never easy to distinguish between painting and drawings in pen, brush, or dry media, but the distinctions don't matter and often combine. Williams' artwork conveys every feeling needed, from love (or something like it), to despair, the blankness of clinical depression, to death and to emotions with no easy names.<br /><br />The visual story is never better than the story itself, though, or not much better. I found the plot a bit weak - jumpy, ill-connected, and lacking in causal relations. It had moments, though, like vampiric nursing, that grab the reader. I enjoy graphic narration for the combination of graphics and narration. This time, it's the graphics that do the job.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-06-04

These are very new classics - that's not an oxymoron, they were discovered by archaeologists only in the early 1970s. That's why I find it slightly maddening that Cleary gives so little information about the authors, origins, and approximate dates of the material. Fortunately, the translations stand well on their own, despite lack of historical context.<br /><br />The first three of these varied works discuss sex as a tool for ehancing health and ensuring long life. They state the theory, based in traditional Chinese medicine and ideas of \\"chi,\\" then go on to list specific yoga-like exercises. These are aimed wholly at male readers, discussing how to absorb the yin principle from its source in the female partner. No similar directions appear instructing women in how to bolster their energies. Perhaps as the source of power, it wasn't needed; perhaps women's well-being was not a topic of interest.<br /><br />Still, the male reader is instructed in how to excite and recognize each phase of the woman's pleasure, and is instructed to use these sexual exercises only with consenting and aroused partners. The woman's pleasure is of interest mostly as a required part of the formula for the man's benefit, but is addressed nonetheless.<br /><br />The last two pieces in this collection address effectiveness and guidance in the world. The word \\"guidance\\" seems to be used in a specific and non-obvious sense, as some complying with The Way - I'm left to wonder how another translator will render the term. Outside of that, these pieces are brief and enjoyable writings in familiar Taoist format: oblique and mystical, but generally joyous in the unity and strength of The Way. They suggest rather than tell, and invite the mind to wander away from the text insearch of personal meaning.<br /><br />Any reader interested in Taoism should take a look at these. Readers interested in alchemy should also pay attention, seeing how Chinese thought differed from Western ideas.<br /><br />//wiredweird<br /><br />PS: This book's content also appears as one section of a larger collection, Cleary's \\"The Taoist Classics, Volume I.\\"e thought differed from Western ideas.    //wiredweird    PS: This book's content also appears as one section of a larger collection, Cleary's \\"The Taoist Classics, Volume I.\\"	2005-06-04

All of commerce, all of industry, and a fair bit of the government have been taken over by one megacorp, but the placid little town of Brentford putters along the way is has for the last few hundred years. And a good thing, too. For one thing, there's that new band with the feel-good music, the kind that really leaves you feeling good. There's Jim Pooley whose name goes down in history as the biggest cockup ever, and getting killed early on doesn't seem to get in his way. There's a stove-top genetic experiment in horse breeding, with success of peculiar sorts. There's the fortune teller who doesn't read your palm but your - well, women don't seem to have very much ahead of them. And there's the end of the world, not that anyone seems to care very much. It all comes together in a readable, entertaining story that all ends just about where it began, only not quite.<br /><br />This seems to be one interlude midway through a series of books centered on Brentford, but a newcomer will pick up the who's who and what's what (even the when's when) quickly enough. It lacks Terry Pratchett's level of fantasy and huge personalities, and lacks Tom Holt's sense of frenzy. Still it's a good read, and I'll be back to Brentford again.<br /><br />Rankin is just starting to catch on in the US, but deserves a lot more attention. He puts together an amusing story. If nothing else, it should hold you until Pratchett or Holt come out with their next.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-06-01

It's what he does for a living, maybe even a compulsion. Over the next few weeks, more pieces appeared in the puzzle, then disappeared. The next to appear was his on-and-off wife, but then she was taken out of the scene, brutally murdered. Then the first piece, Terry disappeared into Mexico, then into a police report labeled \\"suicide.\\" Police appeared and disappeared, the wife's wealthy father appeared and disappeared for a moment then vanished again, a writer and his wife - well, lots more, too.<br /><br />And somehow, a stench hangs over everything. Not just the usual smog, or the misma of cigarettes and alcohol, but everyone he meets. Dirty cops, doctors handing out Demerol and downers, drunks, and all the rest. Marlowe is no angel, but it doesn't take much to outclass even the \\"classiest\\" of Hollywood's stars.<br /><br />This is noir at its best. It's dirty, it's violent, and its morality has a very strange look to it. It also opens a window into the post-WWII era, when all the old rules were being broken, and the new ones weren't too certain.

It has a sassy attitude, the cartoony style, and a page layout more like a pinball machine than a textbook. \\"It could be worse,\\" I told myself, \\"it could have been in color.\\"<br /><br />OK, I'm wrong a lot. This actually does have technical content in it. Good technical content, better than lots of other books. For example, they not only deal with Singleton and thread saftey, they talk about Java 1.5 and synchronization. They even got the volatile declaration right! No, they don't explain it except to say that you need it, but at least it's there. The description of statically initialized singletons doesn't describe the circumstances where it may fail (in multiple classes with mutually dependent static initializers), but they mention static init. The machine control code used as an example couldn't restart after a power failure, but the pattern is handled well. And, on the whole, they handle other patterns with equal, pragmatic care.<br /><br />There's a lot of blank space on most pages, so the 600-some read like less - a lot less. Cartoons, cartoony photos, and gratuitous thought balloons occupy most of most pages. It's consistent, though, and encodes information fairly clearly. I don't know their right names, but some characters recur throughout the book. There's the \\"Yeah, But\\" lady, who points out problems and inconsistencies. There's The Guru with her mystical pronunciamenti and her conversations with \\"Grasshopper.\\" (Do these readers actually remember the Kung Fu TV series?) There's the \\"What If\\" lady and the Geek Guy. Another book might have sidebars of different sorts, but these characters each narrate one kind of point worth extra mention.<br /><br />Example code is generally good. One problem with sample code is that students often get wrapped up in the synthetic problem being solved, and forget that the code is meant to illustrate some other point. These samples serve the structural purposes well enough, but will never be mistaken for serious applications.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the fluffy format leaves about half of the GoF patterns to one- or two-page descriptions in an appendix. This includes some of my workhorses, like \\"Prototype\\" and \\"Chain of Responsibility\\", and an inadequate version of \\"Interpreter.\\" Like so many other authors, they get caught up in the text-processing problems tangential to the pattern and ignore its real meaning: composition of complex actions from simpler ones.<br /><br />I might actually recommend this for an undergrad course, at least as one among several texts.

It's coffee-table sized, allowing reproductions large enough to show their many details. Every image is beautifully printed, with lush, strong color. The examples cover a variety of styles. Most of them are paintings on paper or silk, though a few ceramics and other works appear. Notes are sketchy, but most of the images seem to date from the 17th or 18th century forward.<br /><br />Across the whole period covered, a few things stand out. First is the whole tone of the works: they all depict affection between the players. Some of the pictures show an illicit love, or a senior wife unhappy at attention given to a concubine. None of scenes depict coercion or aggression, however. They are all about people happy together, or who were happy until found out. The second is the wide ranges of practices. Most scenes depict coition, in numerous, often improbable poses. There are also repeated themes of caresses, genital kissing, toys, multiple players or helpers, and same-sex couples. Although the male usually held the dominant position, nearly every practice was practiced for him and her both, by him and her both.<br /><br />The paintings usually display intricate detail in the surroundings, to invoke rich furnishings, fine clothes (often discarded), or outdoor scenes. Most of the reproductions here are large enough for even fine detail to be visible. In fact, the relatively few small pictures became frustrating, since it was harder to read the finer marks in the pictures.<br /><br />Text is very helpful. It often explains fine points that I might not have understood otherwise. It also contains extracts from stories and poems about physical love, and the first section skims nearly two thousand years of Chinese history. I found that helpful for placing the pictures and passages shown in a larger historical context. Given its generally useful content, I found it nearly maddening that so few of the comments told when, where, or by what artist any picture was created. Just a few sentences more per page would have made a huge difference.<br /><br />There's a lot to say about the images, the culture behind them, and the historical shifts in surroundings, practices, and visual style. I'll let you see that for yourself, though. This book really isn't about the text, it's about the pictures.<br /><br />//wiredweirdfew sentences more per page would have made a huge difference.

These aren't high tales of courtly romance, but more realistic tellings of more realistic stories, generally with a bawdy side.<br /><br />The first group of stories has been published elsewhere as \\"Five Women Who Loved Love,\\" not the title used here. Using one story for each, it describes five women overcome by their passion, then overtaken by their fates. These have a moralizing tone - except for the one woman who converted a lover of men, they all end badly.<br /><br />The next clutch of stories trace the life of the title's \\"Amorous Woman.\\" The setting is a monastic hovel, where the now-old woman lives in retreat. Some young men bring her gifts, and ask for adivce in the ways of the world. She replies, starting with her own earliest stirrings for men at an improbably young age. The ancdotes wander through marriage, courtly life, prostitution, and work as a seamstress, teacher, and scribe. The general tone is amusing as she enters each new passion or strategem but ambiguous as a whole, tinged but not drenched with regret.<br /><br />Finally, \\"The Eternal Storehouse\\" and \\"Reckonings\\" each present a few short tales. One of those short stories, \\"Daikoku\\" is itself an exchange of stories among travelers, a little like Chaucer. The final segment presents unrelated anecdotes, tied together by the common theme of resolving debts when entering the New Year. These are mostly stories of tricks used to avoid paying, or the trickier business getting payment anyway. Some, Dickens-like, just relate moments of the sadness of poverty.<br /><br />Between the preface and the appendices, explanatory material weighs in around 175 of the 400 pages or so. It would have been a bit easier to chase the 800+ footnotes if they had been presented page by page instead of segregated in the back. Still I prefer the author's decision to let the text appear uninterrupted, except for a few enjoyable block prints of line drawings. The notes are not just filler, by the way. They really do help to fill in the cultural background that makes the stories make sense.<br /><br />This is a very readable, very enjoyable set.

Two of the thinkers, Sun Tzu and especially Macchiavelli are well known in west. The other two, Baltasar Graci&aacute;n and Han Fei Tzu, deserve to be better known. Rodney Ohebsion's book shows why.<br /><br />Extracts from all four writers discuss trust, leadership, success, and the factors that lead up to it. Despite separations up to two thousand years, and the wider separations of Eastern and Western culture, there are some stiking similiarities in their thinking. All of them stress flexibility and adaptation to circumstance, for example in Sun Tzu's \\"Modifying Tactics\\", Macchiavelli's \\"Suit Action to Fit the Times,\\" Graci&aacute;n's \\"Variate\\", and Han Fei's \\"Adapt.\\" Other recurring themes include  the value of information (pp. 71, 89, 127), or the preferred kinds of forces for binding the led to the leader (pp. 41, 67, 135). The book is intentionally brief or it could have drawn more parallels as well, for example Macchiavelli's \\"Lion and Fox\\" to Graci&aacute;n's 'serpent and dove.'  Unfortunately, the reader must refer to Graci&aacute;n's own book to see that passage. Only 13 of the 300 aphoristic \\"oracles\\" are reproduced here, and the other authors are similarly abridged.<br /><br />That brings up an important point about this book. It is brief by intent, so it necessarily loses much of each writer's context and general sense. Graci&aacute;n was a Jesuit priest, familiar with warfare but largely concerned with social the good and bad of interactions. Sun Tzu's goals were different, but relatively direct: his work discusses military strategy only, and applicability in other spheres is just a happy side effect. Macchiavelli, of course, dealt with adversarial affairs of state in many ways, often referring to adversaries within the state or even within the court. Han Fei, however, is the most chilling of the lot. His original, Legalist text is practically a cookbook for totalitarianism. He turns even one's own family into potential enemies. He uses even the happiness of people as a tool for reducing their threat. The full brutality of hard-core Legalist thinking, as it deals with one's own people, is not at all apparent in Ohebsion's extracts.<br /><br />Still, there is a lot to like in this book. Ohebsion's target audience seems to be busy people who want only the good parts, and Ohebsion addresses that demand. He supplies nearly no commentary, not even the implicit comment there would have been in grouping similar chapters by each author together. There's a lot of white space in the book too, so its nominal 150 pages read like a lot less.<br /><br />Perhaps best of all, Ohebsion introduces a busy modern reader to classic thinkers worth further attention.

The mathematical content is rich, although proofs are generally in references rather than in the text itself. The real value is in its many and detailed algorithm examples, and in the way it builds up to them.<br /><br />Before it even gets into the text, Hankerson et al have created a model of clarity. In addition to the usual, front matter includes a list of abbreviations. If you've ever choked on the alphabet soup in other books, you'll appreciate how this makes the discussion much easier to absorb. There's also a list of the algorithms presented - what the practitioner wanted in the first place.<br /><br />After an introductory chapter, the authors present finite field arithmetic in a thorough but readable way. First they present prime fields over the integers, then optimal extension fields and (most importantly) binary fields. There's nothing here for the cut&paste programmer, but dozens of algorithms help the thoughtful developer work through material that is immensely complicated in other presentations. Other goodies, like Karatsuba-Ofman fast multiplication appear here as well.<br /><br />The third chapter is the book's real payload: EC techniques. I've been looking for years for a book that was so explicit in the how-to, without watering down the technical content. This is practical stuff - not just the theory of EC operations, but the techniques that make EC calculations practical for high-speed implementations.<br /><br />The rest of the book - about half - discusses what to do with EC codes. That includes protocols for choosing parameters, public-key and signature algorithms, and standard kinds of attacks. It also includes hardware-level description of possible implementations, down to specific instruction sets and cache structures and different kinds of chip implementations. That leads to another set of discussions on attacks, the kind that go in through the power supply or RF emissions. Appendices provide or point to pragmatic details such as parameters to use or software support available.<br /><br />The only thing that could be improved in this book is the index - it's just too brief, and lacks the thoroughness the rest of the book led me to expect. I hope you realize just how small a complaint that is. In all other ways, this book meets the highest expectations.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone who needs to understand exactly how EC cryptography works, right down to the bit level.<br /><br />//wiredweirdssions.

We have some sense of the sacred, and are well (maybe too well) aware of our sexuality. We just don't put the two together. When we look up into a niche in a church's wall, we expect to see statues, but not of couples embracing.<br /><br />India, around the thirteenth century, saw the duality of man and woman as a holy thing. As an agricultural people, they knew first-hand how the continuing force of fertility sustained them. They also knew the intense human power of intercourse, and saw the sacred in it. That ongoing act of creation sustained their living world, and the gods had seen fit to make man and woman a vital part of it. Of course it was proper to acknowledge that directly. This book captures many beautiful fragments of that acknowledgement.<br /><br />Elisofon's photos show the general plan of the temple at Konarak, and many of the wonderfully carved details that cover every remaining wall. Some are parables and symbols of a more recognizably religious sort, and some honor other gifts of life, such as music. Many, however portray men and women - sometimes several of each - coupling in every way available to the fertile imaginations of the stonecarvers. There is endless variety in the display, much of which has eroded with time. Still, some of the carvings (p.107 for example) are achingly beautiful.<br /><br />Alan Watts wrote the explanatory text around the pictures, showing how the sacred notion of sexuality spring naturally from many facts of Hindu life. One facet had to do with praise of the living world, certainly. The physical practices also draw on the same tradition as yoga, using the body in disciplined ways to explore the holy. Yet another interpretation comes from the knowledge that a person's life includes a life among other people. Proper social intercourse is part of a proper life, including the proper behavior of men and women together.<br /><br />This book calls out to be read and reread, partly for the inherent beauty of the temple carvings. It also reminds my Western sensibility that there are other, possible better ways of combining the human and holy worlds.<br /><br />//wiredweirdto be read and reread, partly for the inherent beauty of the temple carvings.

Shunga appeared prominently in the works of Hokusai, Utamaro, and many other revered woodcut artists. This lovely book summarizes that honored tradition.<br /><br />It starts with the early shunga of Settei (1710-1780) and Jihei (active 1680), and works up to the dawn of the 20th century (1899). The presentation, sequenced by time, creates an order that the originators could never have seen. The less important order has to do with drawing and coloring.<br /><br />Colors, since the 1700s could well have faded. Even the best-preserved prints may have retreated into shades of orange and black, if those were the stablest dyes. Some, like p.29, simply omit color altogether, with no loss. Later prints, from the 1820s and on, show rich blues and greens. Some historians attribute these colors, at least some times, to imports of synthetic dyes. Other prints from the era use mica for a glistening effect, or use \\"blind\\" impressions of un-inked blocks to create depth. A print fan may only regret the loss of information regarding technical issues of image creation.<br /><br />The rest of us, however, take the greatest pleasure in the egagement of the sexes, epitomized in a sumo fight of man vs. woman (p.57). Most of the prints show basic couplings of man and woman, complicated only by their improbable angles and their exaggerated organs. Others show man and woman at play with each other's genitals (p. 135, 156), or sometimes a woman at play by herself (p.112, 127, 139, 164, etc). At least one (p.56)  displays man engaged with man, showing very different social gender even for the same physical sex. Some pictures demand three- or more-way couplings (p.31, 46-7), others suggest that tied partners sometimes enhanced an ecounter (p.76-7, 137). Still others, like Hokusai's octopus (p.115), invoke a uniquely Japanese mythology, leaving an image that a Western eye can only see in very strange ways. Others (p.118) express a humor that works wherever men and women exist together.<br /><br />As the years advanced, I found the images sucessively more enticing because of the increasing nvolvement of the female characters. Early on, up to the mid-1700s, the woman was entirely passive, a receptacle (however grand) for the male advance (however grand). Koryusai and Shigemasa display women with needs and interests of their own. Toyokuni and Hokusai promote women to center stage, with fondlings, genital kisses, and other activities that focus wholly on the ladies' fulfillment, sometimes at their own hands (p.112, 127, 168).<br /><br />This is a lovely book. I admit, I have given short shrift to its text, even though I found it interesting and informative in those few places I stopped to read. This book is about its pictures, carefully organized and captioned, and in historical order.<br /><br />It is beautiful. I truly hope that you can see it for the cultural sample that it is, and also for the expression of physical happiness that it is.<br /><br />//wiredweirdnese mythology, leaving an image that a Western eye can only see in very strange ways.

There is also the lesbian couple, unexpectedly in the family way, but even they are just people of this world.

They describe honor, skill, honesty, and trust. They describe the times when each must be pressed, and when each must be left behind. Graci&aacute;n states again and again how each moment nurtures some effort or other, and how each kind of effort must await its moment. He also prescribes a peaceful mind, most times. That means letting go of matters that do not matter, for your own sake, for mercy towards those around you who may suffer brief lapses, and for your reputation as a person of judegement.<br /><br />I fault Graci&aacute;n for exactly one lack: continuous and clear-eyed self criticism. The essence of all art and all science, in terms of daily practice, is the ability to look at one's own work, and to see clearly what parts succeed and what parts fail. Somehow, Graci&aacute;n missed the bravery required to tear down your own work when it needs to be torn down, in order to build up something more worthy in its place. I also question Graci&aacute;n's central emphasis on luck, on the benificent forces of the stars. I have seen luck, good and bad, and have always seen that it is a thing a person creates for him/herself. In my own life, I acknowledge random effects for good or bad, but I see little or no \\"luck.\\"<br /><br />Graci&aacute;n's essential message describes a person of honor, determination, insight, and adaptability. This person, in the end, can only succeed. This is a book to read, to re-read, and to re-read again. Mark it up, add your thoughts - it can only become more true.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-05-14

The title story, \\"News from Nowhere\\", is a Socialist Utopia like Bellamy's \\"Looking Backward.\\" In fact, Morris wrote an intro to Bellamy's brief book, and criticized it (gently) for not going far enough.<br /><br />Morris' view of that happy future occupies about half of this thick compilation. It is an incredible Eden, where hale, hearty, and lovely people swing into everything with the greatest gusto. Morris' character, the Guest, arrives just when everyone is falling over themselves to row upstream for the privelege of baling hay. Through some Socialist magic, everyone has become beautiful, intelligent, and youthful. In fact Ellen, who takes a shine to the Guest, has such \\"beauty and cleverness and brightness\\" (her own words, p.223) that she lives out of town to avoid causing a ruckus among the young bucks there.<br /><br />Outside of everyone's passion for good, hard labor (with the fear of some future shortage of sweaty work to go around), 'Nowhere' is most notable for the changes it has wrought on the English countryside. Since government no longer serves a Socialist need, the old trappings of power have been torn down. The one exception is the old Parliament building, which now serves as the transfer station between the producers of manure and its consumers - with a clear implication that little has changed.<br /><br />Exchange of manure is about the most sophisticated social interaction, since Morris declares that \\"this is not an age of inventions. The last epoch did all that for us,\\" (p.192) and they let more of the old knowledge slip away every year. Instead, his healthy and pastoral people work for love of work, and infuse some vague sense of art into whatever it was they were going on about. Issues of medical care are waved away under their general shiny health, despite the fact that pastoral, non-technological people filled their graveyards with women dying in childbirth.<br /><br />The other half of this book is divided between a number of essays and lectures, most of which extol the Socialist ethos. About 120 pages of \\"Lectures\\" discuss design, and some few - with gritted teeth - acknowledge that science may deserve to exist. Yes, he tolerates those people in whom the desire to know burns most brightly. Mostly, however, \\"science\\" is something good for cleaning flue gas so the rural colors may shine more brightly.<br /><br />Morris was a visionary. He was also a brilliant and driven man, a skilled artisan, and eloquent writer. Unfortunately, he was born into a good-sized estate, so never had to pay all that much attention to the fussy bits of how people put the bread on their tables. The disconnect between his plenty and the majority's need is painfully apparent, but not to himself.<br /><br />The best-reasoned essay of the lot was the last, on the founding philosophy of his Kelmscott Press. He explained, in concrete terms, how he decided on the principles of artisanship of printing, and goes into some detail about how well-made text should appear. Much of what he said made sense, and much of the rest could be confirmed or denied by printing up a few pages and seeing what worked - the essence of his reviled \\"science.\\"<br /><br />Morris had a fine and wide-ranging mind.

The story starts in a world as real as yours or mine, then moves to a faerie land inhabited by Oberon, Tatiana, Mab, and a Green Man (but maybe not The Green Man). The art carries the story, and it builds up towards its own mythos. Somehow, though, it never makes the most of its many materials.<br /><br />The artwork is certainly competent, despite a few jarring notes. Perhaps the willowy, long-legged look was meant to suggest a finer kind of world, but was somewhat irregular and somewhat at odds with the ladies' fulsome upper body. Even the \\"Aria Pin-up\\" shows several different kinds of bust, but shows them all in one figure.<br /><br />The story calls on many pieces of traditional mythology, as does Promethea. It's a great vehicle for creating a kind of continuity, even from the first page of the first chapter. This book, however, just calls down the names of the mythic figures without ever really invoking the whole of the myth. At the same time, it creates some new characters with intense potential - Ember, and the formal name of The Beast (\\"Type IV ...\\"), with some relationship between these riveting figures. The story never pursues these characters to their potential, and, esp. with Ember, never pursues them back to their origins. OK, I grant that The Beast's origin may exceed the yuk threshold of this book, but The Beast has huge, visceral, and untapped power.<br /><br />Although I liked Aria, I came away frustrated. The art is good, but could have been more. The traditional characters could have been more, and the new characters could have been more. There's a lot to like here, but everything could have been more.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-05-10

You won't need the basics of classical physics, including Hamiltonians and a few projections of the Navier-Stokes equations down into tractable form. Non- and in-equilibrium dynamics, smooth and discrete representations, plus their mixed forms - you're prepared to build up from these elements.<br /><br />You, the ideal reader, are not much of a programmer, though. The book built very much around extensive C sample code. I use the term \\"C\\" in some strict syntactic sense, though. The general style reminds me of FORTRAN, but the global data declarations are in the style of pre-1980 BASIC. This book is aimed at the odd mix of capable numerical analyst (which I'm not) and chemist (which I'm not), but naive software developer (which I'm not).<br /><br />The strength of this book is in its code samples. The author explictly invites modification and extension. The only sane way to modify this code is to understand it thoroughly, and to understand the underlying chemistry, physics, and numerical models.<br /><br />Maybe this book works well for some people, people that I admire immensely. I just wish it worked better for me.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-05-10

They both know that, if added together, they might total a whole personality (but not a very interesting one). They are both surprised to meet each other again on starting day at the new job. They are surprised again at the mind-numbing boredom of the apparently senseless tasks they are given, but even more suprised at the weirdness that starts to emerge as they sort and file. Was that really a love letter from Sophie to Paul in the archives - dated 100 years ago?<br /><br />That's where the story really starts, and Holt steers it along an amusing route in his trademark form: the hero never quite knowing what's going on, in and out the mysterious doorways, and increasing strangeness right to the end. This time Holt adds a comical attempt at romance between two people who seem to like the idea, but don't quite know how to go about it. (That anarcho-socialist ceramics performance artist doesn't help anything.)<br /><br />This is a good one, but I think Holt put a lot more book around the story than it really needed. Yes, we see from the start that Paul and Sophie are both the Novacaine of social sensation. Yes, we are tantalized by the gathering clues that all is not what it seemed. I think all that could have been established in a bit les than 175 pages, though, and the next 200+ pages were only a bit more tightly-packed.<br /><br />If you're the kind who gets testy when Pratchett's next book is later than you want, Holt might help you get by. He has a lot of the same slanted view of the world, and a lot of the same funny/fantasy story line. Holt has written some very good stories, and this is a good one. I have to admit, though, that readers new to Holt might get a better first impression by reading another title first.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-05-09

Then, a bit like Gaugin, something happened. Whatever it was, it was wonderful.<br /><br />Much of this book is written in a mystical style, in words about something that can only be known through direct experience. Originally, a Russian wrote it in German, and it was translated into English. Again and again, I felt that something must have been lost, most likely in the transition from the inside of Kandinsky's mind to its outside.<br /><br />I am left with more questions than answers. At points, Kandinsky rails against material vs. pure form - he's speaking of vision, but I am a person of my hands. Pure form would be free of the unique character of metal, stone, or wood, physical character that I connect with very deeply. I am left wondering whether some other sense of the word \\"material\\" would have been more informative. He writes at length about the characters of many colors, and develops a color wheel with some significant differences from the one I know. I am sure there is insight there, but it has not opened itself to me. I am curious, however, about some assertions (p.43) about red against blue - I'm sure that parts of his discussion could have been enriched by noting the colors' different indices of refraction at each step in the human eye.<br /><br />He writes about personality, style, and artistry - I just have to listen, I can not claim to have risen to the level he describes. I am especially interested at his predictions about how future man will see and create things, somewhat the way Mondrian made similar predictions. I'm interested because now, most of a century later, I really can't see how people have evolved in the required directions.<br /><br />I respect this writer, and respectfully withold agreement on many matters. That's fine by me. I came to listen, and this speaks in a very clear voice.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-05-03

It's literate, accurate, wide-ranging, focussed, funny, personal, and very informative.

(In this case, Ms. Redback is probably just not in the mood, maybe still full from her last tryst. Cheer up - if you try again later, she might be amorous enough to bite your head off.)<br /><br />This is a great book. It's frank, but very readable and surprisingly funny.

I gues that's part of what earns her a whole branch of her own in Santa's \\"naughty or nice\\" division - the branch that keeps putting in for overtime and hazard pay.<br /><br />This collection brings over a hundred pages of dailies and Sunday color funnies. I could wish that the Sunday strips were a bit bigger - some are small enough to interfere with easy reading. And, as with every other Wiley collection I've seen, the back cover comes way too soon.<br /><br />Still, this one is worthwhile for every comics fan and essential for Wiley fans. In fact, it might even turn youinto a Wiley fan - but then you'll have the book already and be way ahead of the game. Go ahead, enjoy Danae in all her dark-clad glory.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-04-29

The losers in that fight don't count, but the winners get to vote.<br /><br />That is the basis of ant colony optimization. There are many parts to the idea, all of them very simple. First, there are many routes to the goal (food, if you're an ant) - some are better, some worse, you don't know which are which in advance, and the answer may change over time. Second, it's a random search. If you find any answer at all, no matter how convoluted, you get to vote on your route. Third, there are many other ants, all voting. Any leg of a trip that is heavily followed must be part of a good route, and gets many votes. There are details, but that's about it.<br /><br />Chapters 1-3 are the most readable, and convey the basic spirit of the family of algorithms. Ch. 4-6 will drag a bit, for the general reader, but go into significant detail about the ant algorithm and specific applications.<br /><br />Ch. 7 ends the book with a warm, informal discussion of the algorithm's history and some delightful variations. Dorigo, the principal author and founder of the ant school, uses this chapter to express his pure joy at having found such a wonderful thing, and at the similar approaches that others have also found.<br /><br />The approach has some real limits. For example, it can solve only problems that look like finding the shortest route. The good news is that a wide range of unlikely problems can all be cast in these terms. The better news is that, given the many variations available, some form of the 'stigmergic' approach will probably solve any problem in that range. Best of all, though, is the sheer cleverness and the sincere appreciation expressed by the authors.<br /><br />Nature is economical, but a brilliant problem solver. This is written by someone who as able to listen in on one of the lessons.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-04-28

It takes hundreds to capture even part of it - maybe as many as six billion.<br /><br />This is a sample of our faces. There are no words in this book, just a face on the right-hand page and a place and year on the left. There doesn't seem to be any special order by place, time, or theme. Any order present is probably in the reader's mind only - not a bad thing, I think.<br /><br />Young, old, man, woman, and some I'm just not sure about. The most varied in dress and adornment may be the many photos from India. The most varied in the people themselves may be Mali. As a group, the most beautiful may be the faces of Niger. The most startling, by far, are the Afghanis - so familiar in their features, but so very far from from my own world. If you don't like my answers, ask again. I'll probably have a different impression each time I look through this wondeful book.<br /><br />And of course, there is \\"Pakistan 1985,\\" the cover model. That may be the most famous, certainly the most arresting portrait of the modern era. The face is warm and somber, but the eyes look back out of the page, and into the viewer. I wonder whether they see more than my eyes can.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-04-26

Readers unsure of their calculus or Newtonian physics may struggle. The brief first chapter addresses the basics: what are the questions, which ones can computation address, and with what result. Chapters two to five develop successively more refined models up through Lennard-Jones soft-sphere models. That puts the reader about half-way through the book, to the point where it becomes less about physics and more about real chemistry. The next two chapters deal with the basics of thermodynamics and a bit on evaluating stability of the computed results.<br /><br />The last third of the book is mostly appendices. The first three are decidedly of interest to the chemistry beginner, but the next dozen or so could have been dropped with no harm to the book's main content. \\"A Random-Number Generator\\" and \\"Conventions for Naming Variables in Fortran\\" are redundant and irrelevant (respectively) in most contemporary computing environments. If someone needs computing advice at that level, they're probably not ready for the load this book presents.<br /><br />What's good is very good, though. The introduction material is sensible and adequately rigorous, with many and varied references at the end of each chapter. My interest in computational chemistry is mostly in the computation, not in the chemistry. Given that computational chemistry is a huge field, Haile has done a good job of keeping a sharp focus on one range of techniques and on a specific level of reader.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-04-26

I mean, like a glacier moves forward. Not the fastest one around, I won't even warn you to get out of his way. Glacier-like, it wouldn't matter. Go ahead, get in his way - he might even notice. Probably not.<br /><br />This time, in his ducal capacity, he has been appointed to an ambassadorship by Lord Vetinari. Vetinari is not a bad man (by local standards, at least) and doesn't do bad things (again, by local standards). Pray that you're nowhere near when he attempts something good. It might be like lighting a candle in the darkness, with you as the match.<br /><br />Or it might be like lighting the fuze on the powder-keg. Vimes isn't much the candle type. Around him are many people. There's his finishing-school wife who can finish off dwarves and lots of others, six against one, in unarmed debate. There's Officer Angua of the city watch. A very capable woman but watch out for her \\"monthlies\\". You know, new moon, howling over the heath, and and all that were-sort-of-thing. Then ... well, Angua is the predictable one. There are lots of others who aren't.<br /><br />This is a long-running series with lots of character development in previous volumes. Pratchett is uncommonly well tuned to the newcomer, though. Even if the writer knows the two-dozen stories before this one (and a dozen-squared he never wrote), this story still stands well on its own. The newcomer may as well start here as anywhere. The tone is a bit more serious and less haha than most of the Discworld series, but it fits well.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-04-22

It's a place built on peace: happy, pastoral, multiracial, communal, and sexually liberated. The people are so viscerally in tune with their environment that they very nearly hibernate through the cold season and usually bear their young in the spring. The whole populace is dedicated to their dreams, to sharing their dreams, and to living more deeply in their dreams.<br /><br />A man from our outer world appears in that place, not the kind you'd want as your representative. He can not see into their depths, and violates one of the women who tends him. These peaceful people still accept him, though, and envelop him in their way. After many years, he finds his place among them. He also finds the true meaning of this Eden, a power and an ongoing place in the world that he never imagined.<br /><br />I'm still not quite sure what to make of this book. It comes from the hippy/commune era around 1970, and carries the indelible mark of its time. It's a bit simplistic at times, and only the first-person character is developed in any depth. This is a bit more than the common Utopia story, a bit more optimistic and a bit more magical.<br /><br />The very worst you can say about this is that it's light and readable, even enjoyable if you let yourself enjoy it. The story of personal transformation has been told before and is told well here. I guess real point is that this little land of loving dreamers is itself a dream worth having.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-04-22

First, though, the 'what' is well worth the attention.<br /><br />The setting is some time after a long and destructive war, within the enclave of the victors, or so they style themselves. They have created a technological heaven on earth, tamed the wind and waves to human use, and very nearly tamed the human animal. Nearly, but not quite. D-503 (the protagonist) is a driven man. First, he is driven to the most demanding feats of engineering achievement. Later, he is driven to the wildness of his passion by I-330, a woman who has manipulated the movers of that world to the edge of revolution. Other characters offer contrast; O-90, for example, is the archetypal woman: petite, soft, emotional, with an uncontrollable urge towards the crime of unauthorized motherhood.<br /><br />There are many ways in which this parallels Orwell's later 1984, down to the forced conversion of the protagonist at the end. This book predates Orwell's by over 20 years, however. It also predates Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\" with which it shares much, including technologically enforced, ineffectual happiness and the idea that everyone belongs to everyone else. Although Zamyatin's characters tend towards the one-sided, the book's situation is a good deal more complex than either Orwell's or Huxley's. What, for example, is that Green Wall? And what, beyond one glimpse, would we find behind it? This also raises the idea of the \\"Stockholm Syndrome\\" when an entire society is held captive. D seems to have an overwhelming sense of duty towards the state and its Benefactor, even when confession would mean his own destruction.<br /><br />Though generally good, I have reservations about aspects of the translation. Zamyatin seems to have had fair grasp of math and science, and used the square root of negative one as a metaphor. In this translation, that strange number is termed \\"irrational.\\" Modern English usage would call it \\"imaginary\\" instead, and irrationality would name a different property of numbers. That peculiarity makes no narrative difference, however, and the translation holds together well in other respects.<br /><br />Most interesting is that Zamyatin wrote this around 1920, after several run-ins with the early Communist government. He wrote with prescient authority about what he saw happening in his world, and this book was suppressed for many years. Although weaker in some ways than later, similar books, it carries first-hand passion as well as seniority in its genre. Anyone who reads 1984 should read this also, for the striking similarities as much as for the differences. Or just read \\"We\\" - it's worth it by itself.<br /><br />//wiredweirdh usage would call it \\"imaginary\\" instead, and irrationality would name a different property of numbers.

Maybe this is a collection of newspaper comics, but these stories look like they were written for this book. The vignettes meander, like a river through Pogo's beloved swamp. The first reminds us of the Cold War and the race for space. Walt Kelly was as solid a cold warrior as any, and launches salvos of humor at the first Soviets on the moon. (Did you know it's made of strawberry ice cream?)<br /><br />In the loosely coupled stories that follow, Owl somehow eats the laundry that Miz Beaver's takes in, Ol' Bear seeeks vengeance for the loss of his underwear, Albert gets stuck in a cook-pot, and the Russians steal Georgia - see, it says so right there on that map. As always with Pogo, there's a happy ending. Two Santas fight over the privelege of delivering belated gifts.

Now, no one is left to hold back the --<br /><br />-- lights, camera, and action! Pratchett's premise is that nameless evil is the driving force behind the many people joined in creating motion pictures. OK, it sounds improbable (or does it?). Pratchett makes it all make sense somehow, in a steady stream of bad puns, unlikely characters, and loving references to every kind of movie from Gone with the Wind to King Kong.<br /><br />A few of the usual characters are there, Death (as always), wizards somehow escaped from the Unseen University, Vetinari (briefly) and the rest. A few new ones show up as well, including Laddie, friend to all except maybe Gaspode.<br /><br />It's light, literate, and laughable, just what you'd expect from Pratchett.

There are lots of times and places where you just need to make a good picture - or good enough - really fast. What you need is to create a visual idea and to convey it, right now, to those people who literally won't get it until you draw a picture for them.<br /><br />Marker rendering is the established way to do it. Saying that you use \\"markers\\" is just too weak, though. This is about doing whatever works, to make a picture that lasts just long enough. There are the masks or friskets, highlights in gouache or white grease pencil, cutouts, layers of paper, and all the other media that go into a \\"marker\\" rendering. Even when you use the markers by themselves, there are endless variations of line, weight, guides (surely you've customized your triangles to lift the edge away from wet marks), color, and gray. Heck, you might have more than 20 markers even if you have only grays, warm and cool, in a dozen values, and new/juicy vs. old/dry.<br /><br />This can work well as a text, with a series of graded exercises. It just can't stand by itself, though, it really needs a good teacher to go with it. You'll need someone with a trained eye for the gazillion things that go wrong, and with a back pocket full of ways to make them go right.<br /><br />As far as it goes, this book is really good. If your pictures are there to convey an idea and not just to be pictures, this book is one of the student's best friends.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-04-11

I should have. I managed to hang on to within 25 pages of the end. That was where Mr. West presents the reader with the formula X=4q+(p*r), and solemnly announces (I'm not making this up) \\"4 represents a constant value,\\" with the word 'constant' set in italics to emphasize its gravity. By the standards set elsewhere in this book, that qualifies as a technically profound statement.<br /><br />At least it's not just plain wrong, as were statements elsewhere in the book. For example, p.270 asserts that \\"Ensuring that it's possible for two objects to exchange messages is a matter of visibility: the objects have to be able to see each other.\\" Well, no. Systems like Linda allow objects to leave messages for each other at anonymous drops. Component systems like the Bean Box count on some third party able to see both, a 'Mediator' in the Gang of Four terms that West generally disparages. Heck, anyone who's ever seen a Unix command pipeline would know how silly that claim is. He also asserts (p.253) that over-riding a superclass method causes \\"cognitive dissonance.\\" For those not familiar with psycho-babble, that means it confuses him.<br /><br />Those are probably low points, since the rest of the book is so vague and philosophical that it neither informs nor misinforms. Mr. West goes on at length on the hermeneutics of objects and their postmodernist interpetations (p.59). He goes on about how Alexander's design patterns have been misunderstood by mere application, how their real purpose is personal transformation within the user. Mostly, he just goes on.<br /><br />By now, I guess my lack of fawning shows that I haven't been born again into the mysteries of \\"Object Thinking,\\" whatever that is. True believers initiated into the mystery will probably say that I'm not competent to comment on the wonderfulness of The Way of West. Well, maybe that's a good thing.<br /><br />I wish Mr. West all success in his navel-gazing.

It's not a diary, nothing so organized, and he claims repeatedly that \\"This is not a book.\\" Instead, it's a sequence of slightly connected thoughts, anecdotes, and aphorisms. Give the book time, though, it develops into something much more revealing in its second half.<br /><br />Gauguin is known for his abrupt departure from respected commercial and family life into the most primitive world available to him. His son prefaces this book by explaining that the parting of ways was necessary and mutual. This book itself presents a few hints at what drove him out of polite and wealthy society - a distaste for the venal gendarmerie, a contempt for the church, and more.<br /><br />What I found more interesting, though, was his recollections of rooming with Van Gogh and his first-person narrative of the Impressionist revolution in France. He sweetens any bitterness by describing the Tahitian people, as a society, as a system of mores, and as healthy and beautiful human animals.<br /><br />There's a slight self-conciousness here. Gauguin seemed to be writing for some imagined reader, and in fact sent these journals to be published. I feel that not nearly enough is said; what's written here does little to describe the personal angel or demon that drove him to the farthest point on the planet. Still, I value the master's words.<br /><br />I admit that I'm not fond of his art.

I mean things with internal dividers, things the hold together by themselves, decorative, utilitarian, and the entire range.<br /><br />This book has an industrial orientation, as if you're planning a die-cut paper product. It also assumes that you're a fairly skilled designer. Although the patterns are given in full detail, you'll have to make lots of adjustments. That includes sizes, cardboard thicknesses, customization, and proportions. That last can be tricky, because so many of the measurements interlock with with each other, and Roth hasn't given any indication of what the dependencies are. Some of the more complex pieces also appear to assmble in non-obvious ways, which you'll have to work out for yourself.<br /><br />Still, many of these patterns are well within the reach of a home crafter, and offer some exciting possibilities for gift boxes and other kinds of containers or stands. The patterns aren't the kind you can cut out directly from the book, but can be scanned and scaled, or just act as a conceptual inspiration.<br /><br />Whether you're a commercial designer or a paper-crafting hobbyist, this is a unique and incredibly rich resource.

That was before the rise of national-scale communism, and long before its fall in Europe. Somehow, when it finally came, it wasn't as shiny as stories like this made out.<br /><br />It's easy to criticise in retrospect. Perhaps the central fallacy is that human nature will change so that \\"The coarser motives [of dread of want and desire for luxury] ... have been replaced by higher motives unknown to the mere wage-earners of your age.\\" It's not going to happen, and it didn't happen when the experiment was tried.<br /><br />The fact is that communism really does work in specialized environments like some monasteries. It is easy to see the higher motives and dedication, as well as the communal living at work there. That make it tempting to create a causal relationship between personal dedication and communalist practices.<br /><br />The fallacy, of course, is that the higher motives of a monastery have just about nothing to do with the monks' housekeeping arrangments. The household economy serves the devotion, it neither drives it nor is driven by it. Also, a monastery is a relatively simple environment, with a small and homogeneous population, without child rearing or family complexities, and usually with access to the economy and services of the greater world. However successful such an enclave might be, scaling it to a full and heterogeneous society is difficult at best.<br /><br />Still, Bellamy's book preserves a snapshot of his age's thinking. Almost 120 years later, it helps us understand the ideals behind the social experiments that have since been relegated to the \\"dustbin of history\\".<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-03-31

Each piece gives a brief description of one thinker's ideal world, a Utopia of a sort. This book is strengthened by presenting two such different views, casting them into sharp contrast.<br /><br />The first, by Bacon, makes much of pomp, ceremony, and fine accoutrements. He starts by describing the wonderful pageant put out for any man whose living descendants exceed thirty in number. He is paraded among and served by his issue, and granted gifts by the benevolent ruler. At this point - only at this point - is a woman of the realm mentioned. His wife, should she have survived such a feat of childbearing, is to be presented as well, in a carriage, tightly enclosed. A featureless box, the best to which a woman might aspire. (Bacon goes out of his way to disparage More's Utopia, in an amusing aside.)<br /><br />The remainder of the story details the alchemical feats and workshops of the land. They interested Bacon much the way a candy store might interest a child, with no thought as to how they might be provisioned or staffed. Although the many labs are of interest to today's technologist, the country's means of feeding itself and its voracious researchers remains unsaid.<br /><br />Campanella's \\"City of the Sun\\" is a Utopia of very different character. Above all, it focusses its energies on war more than any other city since Sparta. He demands training in arms for men and women both from the earliest age on, though women would enter combat only in final resort. Even the infirm are put to service however they may serve: the lame can watch and guard, the blind can work in some crafts, and so on. Women are expected to participate in industry, too, except in the woodworkers' and armorers' trades. This city is surprisingly free in religion - Jews are tolerated, if not too jewish, as well as Brahmins and others who acknowledge a soul. Hey, in those days, it was radical.<br /><br />Both authors express ideas that repulse a modern mind. Even Campanella's enlightened treatment of women and religious minorities sounds brutal, until considered in the context of his time. Bacon's blinkered self-involvement would barely be worth a chuckle, until one considers his influence on history.<br /><br />It's not formal, but it's a way to view history: what is it that each age most wanted itself to be? What views existed, and what views have survived? And how did the writers of each age differ from the man in the street, or more likely the man behind the plow?<br /><br />//wiredwierdess ideas that repulse a modern mind.

Through some miracle, one woman becomes parthenogenetically pregnant - without normal fertilization - and civilization is rebuilt.<br /><br />But without men.<br /><br />The story opens 2000 years later, after the culture has flourished and stabilized, when three men of very different temperaments arrive. This brief story sketches the Edenic society. The women have their entire country under the most intense cultivation, and it is lush and productive. The women have a stable population, and a rich culture built around progress, peace, and single-minded devotion to the creation and care of the next generation. That is the cental axis of Gilman's world. Religion and everything else revolve around that.<br /><br />The women themselves, through Lamarckian and social evolution, have become strong, wise, happy, and oddly sexless. They seem not to have discovered the happiness of physical affection, especially when separated from procreation. I find it odd that there is not even a hint of that physical intimacy in this otherwise attractive world, even though the women could easily share it between themselves.<br /><br />Of course, one of the men commits an outrage, and they are banished back to the evil outer world - Eve casting Adam out of the garden, this time. Nearly nothing is said about the economy of this world, and just a little about their system of justice. As utopias go, it's a bit one-sided and bland, with one chilling exception. In the very last sentences of the book, there is a hint that their justice can include capital punishment. It would be carried out by overdose of anesthesia, a 1915 prediction of today's \\"lethal injection.\\"<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-03-28

They also mention other numbering systems, including the Roman numerals, Greek, Egyptian, and cuneiform Babylonian - numbers that persist in our 60-based measures of minutes and seconds, in both time and angle.<br /><br />Next, they move into squares, triangular numbers, and many others with rich geometric meanings. Chapters 1 and 2, especially, create vivid images that bring many of their concepts to life. I had a bit of trouble finding ch.3's focus. It touches briefly combinatorics, a world in itself, and difference techniques. I found \\"Jackson's Fan\\" fascinating, but too terse for easy application to real problems. After this, the going gets a lot tougher, fast.<br /><br />By ch 4, \\"Famous Families,\\" the illustration is no longer as vivid as before. Ch. 6, on fractions and decimal expansions also held some interest - it touches on complexity in the decimal forms of fractions, and the numeric roots from which it springs. The section on continued fractions is only just enough to titillate without really enlightening. Discussion of imaginary numbers is OK, and offers some enjoyable insights. The section on quaternions, though, does a lot less to invite personal involvement and stir the imagination. Later sections of the book present readable surveys of their topics, but require a lot more form the reader in the way of determination and mathematical background.<br /><br />If the whole book sustained the initial energy, it would have been an instant classic. The later parts of the book were clear, readable, and even enjoyable, but didn't match the breadth or vividness of the first half. I enjoyed this, but I may not come back to it.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-03-28

We're surrounded by bullshirt, up to our ears in it every day: the self-aggrandizing attempts to do on an amateur basis what a spin-doctor does for a living. Frankfurt does an adequate job with the etymology of bullshirt, where the word was first recorded, contrasting it to misdirections of other kinds, and even starting to give examples of everyday bullshirt --<br /><br />-- and then stops short. That leaves us with a dry, academic, and unmemorable treatise on bullshirt. With no loss of academic rigor, this could have been so much more. Think of the self-aggrandizing written records of Benvenuto Cellini and Salvador Dali. There's plenty of propagandizing bullshirt to work with, including the overblown body counts from the Vietnam war and twisted truths used in in pushing any agenda. There's large and lively field of bullshirt to be explored in the perpetual motion and \\"Einstein was wrong\\" pseudoscience communities, and faux-spiritual New-Aginess. How about the trash-talk of athletes, psyching themselves up before a game or a fight?<br /><br />If ever a Nobel prize were given for bullshirt, the first should go to Alan D. Sokal, for his classic \\"Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity.\\" That wonderful piece of writing was intended as social commentary for some readers, satire for others, and of course bullshirt aimed at the magazine that published it. There is ironically little irony in how its greatness overshadowed the truckloads of whining bullshirt responses that it engendered.<br /><br />But Frankfurt gave us none of that. Instead we see why so many people consider philosophical analysis to be dusty, irrelevent word games, just another steaming heap that that has no purpose in the real world. This really could have been more.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-03-23

This is a technical question, only, it adds or detracts nothing in Vermeer's ouvre and career either way. It's and interesting question though, and even an important one. What choices did Vermeer make in achieving greatness?<br /><br />Steadman convincingly argues that Vermeer very likely used a camera obscura, in one form or another, in creating many of his paintings. This work starts with a thorough discussion of the inconclusive written records. Vermeer was certainly contemporary to people like van Leeuwenhoek, who pioneered microscopy, even lived in the same city at the same time. He had long exposure to trades where lenses were used regularly, and lived in a time when lenses were available commercially. All that is circumstantial and, unlike other authors, Steadman declines to read more into available facts than they said in the first place.<br /><br />His real contribution is in his detailed analyses of Vermeer's paintings and their geometries, and in actual reconstructions of the rooms Vermeer portrayed and tools he might have used. This is the scientific method at work: present a falsifiable hypothesis, and create an experiment that confirms or denies it. \\"Is shadow in 'The Music Lesson' a credible, literal rendering of an actual scene?\\" His experiments from the late 80s, rebuilding rooms that match Vermeer's says \\"Yes.\\" This is a delightful contrast to armchair guesswork by others, such as Wheelock, who never really checked but thought the shadows looked false.<br /><br />This is a worthwhile historical and technical achievement, partially funded by the BBC for a TV special in 1989. It also stands in clear contrast to Hockney's later work on much the same question, \\"Secret Knowledge.\\" Hockney asked, as an artist, do these tools give me the experience captured in the old masters' art? His answer, achieved by personal immersion, was also \\"Yes.\\" I respect Steadman's rigor as a historian and experimentalist, but this work comes off a bit dry compared to Hockney's first-person report.<br /><br />It's an interesting book on an artist about whom maddeningly little is known. It's thorough, and gives future art historians a very high bar to clear. If not for the hands-on liveliness of Hockney's book, I might have ranked this one even higher.<br /><br />//wiredweird.\\" I respect Steadman's rigor as a historian and experimentalist, but this work comes off a bit dry compared to Hockney's first-person report.

It is the very best in its field. Just start there.<br /><br />Grunwald and Shepard have put together the definitive book on ways to tile the two dimensional plane. \\"Tiling\\" means covering the 2D universe with interlocking figures, so that no gap remains. Bathroom tiles do that, and patterns of brick on walls, and all of those wonderful geometries that the Muslim artists raised to their god in place of graven images.<br /><br />That can not be enough for the very strongest of creative minds. The authors show the \\"Penrose tiles\\", that cover the world without ever repeating. Penrose used a five-way plan, which barely meets the needs of the world's symmetries. Amman used a four-way plan, like floor tiles, but created tiles that forever create new patterns. The pattern fills the world, but never repeats (except in detail). And then, there are the spiral tiles - perfectly regular, and different at every scale.<br /><br />The artist will savor the richness of the plane. A mathematician will sink deeply into the many symmetries that turn THIS point into all points, or no other, or some, or all of the above. The student will struggle through the problems at the end of each chapter. Thoughtful readers will simply find themselves wandering away from every page, where some seed of thought blossoms in your mind.<br /><br />I can not imagine how this could have gone out of print.

What's interesting is the amount of territory that Odell covers in this book. These aren't beginners' issues, lots of them go straight to the heart of OO design. What does aggregation really mean, for example? How can companies ensure high-quality, maintainable software products in the presence of ever-changing and often inexperienced developers? What is the proper way to express the changes in an object's meaning over time? And finally, what is the methodology to end all methodologies?<br /><br />Unfortunately, I found the writing opaque at times, and many of the proposals at odds with the lessons of my experience. In the opacity department, I would have liked a bit more description of just why a 'lattice' constraint describes a DAG. I could have done without understanding that state machines are useful \\"When user experts find that [state machines] are the best way to describe their system,\\" with a similar tautology describing when they're not useful.<br /><br />I was simply baffled by his support for objects with types that can change at run time. There is elegant theory behind the idea, but it's mostly a lab curiousity and for good reason. You could start with the difficulties in assigning an object reference to a variable, then changing the object type so it no longer matches the variable type. I'm quite happy with compile-time type checking, though. It means that whole realms of run-time bugs can't pass compilation checks, and saves endless annoyance. Anyone who remembers the BLISS language that implemented Vax/VMS probably still has nightmares about weak typing.<br /><br />Although interesting to a point, the discussion of aggregation went beyond practicality. It was well into the realm of philosophical hair-splitting, but without the formal rigor that could have justified the fussiness. I guess that's what really bothered me all through - high-sounding discussion, without the serious backing needed for the points to make sense. Even his grand idea for a meta-methodology floated away into meta-meta-ness, without giving any clear idea about how all those round pegs and square holes could be resolved with each other.<br /><br />Most of all, the ink on the book's page is frozen in time, and times move on. Many ideas that may have seemed novel or profound in 1992 have been overtaken by events. Although a few points remain interesting, today's readers have better ways to spend their time and money.<br /><br />//wiredweirdy into meta-meta-ness, without giving any clear idea about how all those round pegs and square holes could be resolved with each other.

Rossum's Universal Robots were the first robots to be called by that name, though.

Shelley's story is about intellectual hubris, but Capek's is a bit closer to home. It's about financial hubris, about the dividend above all else, and about what a life is worth - $150, including clothing, plus shipping.<br /><br />R. U. R. is in the form of a play, which always slows my reading. It's very short, though, and perhaps a bit over-wrought. I guess that packing so much emotional response into such a short script tends to leave that feeling, though. It's also interesting to note that the one visible woman was the downfall of this technological Eden, even if the somehat interchangeable men had been nurturing the apple tree before she got there.<br /><br />This is a brief story, very readable, and very much to the point for anyone who works with technology.

It's practical, earthy, and wide-ranging. It covers everything a man might need to know, from positions for love-making, to the various names for his and her genitals, to potions for enabling, blocking, or ending pregnancy. Mixed in, there are a few amusing stories and a section on dream interpretation, possibly to break up a discussion on sexuality that might otherwise have been too dense and intimidating.<br /><br />What's missing from this book is at least as telling as what's present. The author stays close to the basics, and omits things like oral sex, other kinds of play than penetration, toys, and eroticism between men. One of the stories mentions eroticism between women, but only as an inferior kind of pratice. In fact, most of the book's references to women emphasize that belief of their inferiority, and the book is clearly not intended for an audience that includes women. The female partner's pleasure is always part of the discussion, but there are relatively few specifics on the many ways of bringing it about.<br /><br />This is a welcome update to Sir Richard Burton's Victorian work. His version was several steps removed from original sources, and heavily adapted to his Victorian audience (also men).

This, however, is the book that gives us the word 'Utopia.' The book is brief, barely over 100 pages, and only 60-some describe the place itself. That is enough, and makes me nostalgic for the habit of writing briefly and to the point.<br /><br />It's easy to sum up More's heaven-on-earth in a few words. It portrays a communal, democratic society. It is paradoxically unregulated and tightly regulated - overwhelmingly, More's citizens just want to do what is best for their society, and that covers a remarkably narrow range of possibilities. There are, of course, some who break the laws of the land, and More deals with them harshly. \\"Harsh\\" is a relative term, though, and his punishments were hardly harsh in a day when it was a hanging offense to steal a loaf of bread for your starving family. (That's actually the introductory topic, the one that leads up to the description of Utopia.)<br /><br />It's also a strongly religious society. Religious tolerance is a matter of law, a novelty by the standards of More's day and the standard of his own behavior. 'Tolerance', however, meant tolerance of any monotheism that wasn't too animistic, and certainly didn't tolerate the unreligious.<br /><br />This translation from More's original Latin is modern and smoothly readable. Even so, I wonder how another translator would have handled some of More's neologistic names, like the unpleasant 'Venalians' who are the Utopians' neighbors. No answer is right, but other renderings may convey more and grate less. Those are quibbles, though. It's a good book as well as being a Great Book, and casts an interesting shadow into modern communism, theocracy, and ideas of the good life. I recommend it highly.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-03-11

The author took the unusual step of reproducing each specimen at 100% of its original size, even it it meant cutting one of the original pages short. Scaled images of characters never tell the visual truth about the letterforms, so this is the only meaningful way to experience typesetting in these specimens.<br /><br />Dowding organized the book's chapters into a taxonomy of type styles, giving a brief summary of the origin, historical development, and available fonts in that style, as of the orginal printing date. Most, though not all chapters give a brief checklist of that style's distinguishing features. This could have been expanded, I think, handled more uniformly from chapter to chapter, and could have included the distinguishing items that differentiate one family from another. For all its lacks, this is a good description of the various styles a typographic student will encounter.<br /><br />What makes this book stand out is over 45 pages of commentary in the back of the book, describing the distinguishing features of each specimen. There's a bit of historical information in many of the commentaries, bordering on gossip at times. The real value, however, is in the discussion of each typeface as a unique composition, and sometimes in contrast to others. It's not explicit but there is a unique lesson here, a sustained discussion in how to look at letterforms. I fault it only for weakness in addressing sanserif fonts, which deserve a lot more than the two perfunctory pages shown here. Perhaps when this was written, the sans fonts hadn't gained enough popularity to warrant discussion. Perhaps, however, Dowding's biases and historical sources shied from such \\"grotesque\\" shapes.<br /><br />This is an exceptional reference for any student wanting to start on serious discussions of letterforms. The only real problem with this book is that it's not very deep or systematic in teaching the history its title seemed to promise. Take it for what it is, however, and I think it's quite good.<br /><br />//wiredweirdhis book is that it's not very deep or systematic in teaching the history its title seemed to promise.

Fizzickle Pogo	Books	5	2	2	N	N	A long-time favorite	Pogo pretty much guarantees an amusing and gentle story, full of groanable puns and enjoyable comedy. This book keeps that promise.<br /><br />It's about 200 pages with not much blank space. I wish more of today's comic reprints had that kind of density. It starts with the International Geophysical Year, a 18-month period that startos off causing confusion for Howland Owl and Churchy - does that mean ten-and-a-half day weeks? Well, they're easily confused. The story meanders across the swamp and past all of the usual characters, Miz Beaver, Mlle Hepzibah, Sarcophagous McAbre, and (my favorite) Grundoon. There's a trip to the moon, planned if not a achieved. The insects decide how they'll divvy up the world once people A-bomb themselves off it.

This book started that second dozen.<br /><br />It's about Brutha, a minor novitiate even among novitiates who are all minor. He's doing what he does best, hoeing the beans, when his god arises before him in physical manifestation:<br /><br />A turtle. Slow. Partial to lettuce. Not fond of being turned over or dropped. Not much for conversation when it gets cold out. And, as near as Om can tell, the god of Brutha only. No one else seems to be paying much attention when the god calls down plagues, or at least some really nasty rashes.<br /><br />In Prathcett's hands, this small start yields a very worthy bit of amusement. No, there's really no point to what Pratchett writes (well, that's what he wants you to think). Brutha crosses his world, overturns empires as easily as he overturns weeds in the bean-patch, and dies happy. Everyone dies, and Brutha has seen lots of the other ways - this really is a happy ending.<br /><br />For all of its shallow jests, this book has rewards for the serious reader. Brutha wins in the end by be slow, thick, and mind-bogglingly even-handed. Om finally comes out of his shell and really makes his entry, even among the more exclusive clubs of the gods. Everyone gets what they deserve in the end, no matter what you thought they deserved. By the way: observe Om, the lowly turtle, and the place of the turtle in Discworld cosmology.<br /><br />Pratchett fans: watch Vorbis. Yes, the character dies, but that doesn't mean much in Discworld. He may reincarnate as Vetinari, or maybe as Vetinari's evil identical twin. Death is there, all caps, but really quite a congenial chap - says \\"Thank you\\" when you pass him the bottle, sort of thing. The librarian is there, working hard in librarian heroics. Lu Tze is there, makin sure that history turns out the way it's supposed to, not that he has a lot to work with.<br /><br />Every series has its ups and downs. This is a serious up for Discworld.

They're in use everywhere today, from the nearest cell phone or DVD to the most distant interplanetary probe. But the book barely mentions his mathematical achievements and certainly doesn't describe them, so let's move along.<br /><br />Galois himself has all the makings of a great romantic figure. It's a matter of historical fact that was mathematical prodigy, with important work published during his short life. It's also true that he died in a duel at age 21, after spending his final night organizing his mathematical notes for posterity. That, plus simply living through a time of intense political upheaval, let alone being involved in it, makes him a character quite able to capture the imagination. Petsinis' imagination has been quite completely captivated.<br /><br />If anything, there may be a bit too much imagination in this rendering of Galois' life. It's told in the first person, from Galois' own point of view, for which historical justification is thin at best. With so little fact at hand, Petsinis has created a wildly emotional character. In this presentation, Galois seemed quite incapable of moderation in any feeling, driven continually between white-hot intensity and blackest depression. Every page seemed to sizzle with overheated passion for math, for his politics, for his family, or for what he had for breakfast - I was tempted to set an ice pack on the book more than once.<br /><br />Given all that was obviously fabricated in the cause of a good story, I'm not sure how much to trust any of the other facts that might have historical reality. How much was his mathematical career actually affected by perceptions of his politics? The paranoid view here suggests that the mathematical establishment conspired to create a wall of silence around the firebrand's work during his lifetime. On the whole, inertia and absent-mindedness look like equally good explanations.<br /><br />I find this a fair (if wildly expressive) novel, a questionable biography, and a disappointing tribute to the mathematician and his mathematical achievements. It is very tempting to romanticize Galois the man, and Petsinis has fallen completely for that temptation.<br /><br />//wiredweirdlly good explanations.

As part of the Sandman world, she was a much more complex and active figure. I guess the other stories set my hopes unrealistically high. That's not surprising, since Gaiman set the bar so high that not even he can match his own standard all the time.<br /><br />Taken by itself, this is a pleasant but undistinguished comic.

It covers every aspect of the programming world, from praise of hardware, through product management and economics, back to testing and coding style, and on and on. There are a few real gems among these 45 essays (plus intro and appendix), untrammeled by the need for consistency. He's certainly unabashed about bucking current fashions, including all the silliness seen under the revival tent of the eXtremists.<br /><br />At several points, Joel rails against the false economies of making code smaller and sniggers at the people to whom it matters so much, then (ch 39) he rails against the size of a Microsoft runtime support package. He also points out that antialiased fonts, other than things like headlines, are a bad idea. That was already common knowledge around DEC by about 1980, since the visibly blurred margins of characters led to eyestrain as the focussing muscles fruitlessly tried to find the edge. Modern display technology with far smaller pixel sizes seems to have reversed that decision, however, except possibly at the smallest character sizes - a blow-up of a screen capture will often show antialiasing on body text that looks quite good. If he came on a bit less strong to start with, these annoyances would be a lot less annying.<br /><br />Joel's incredibly high opinion of Joel wore on me after a while. Despite all the good in this book, I had to drag myself through the last half of his pontifications, repetition, and tendency towards the absolute. If you're already a fan of his other writing, that might not bother you. For me, Joel, in his role as high priest in the cult of Joel, became tiresome. I'm sure he's a skilled developer and savvy business man, but I really don't think I'd enjoy meeting him.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-02-27

The first few pages of introduction set the mood. Each two-page spread presents two of the images shown later in the book. They're split down the middle, placed opposite each other along the crease between pages, and formed into a startling new whole. The mismatched parts make it very clear that there is no one \\"female figure\\", that it's a range filled with wonderful variety.<br /><br />Some of these images, like Aida's, remind me that there are views I am very glad not to share. Others, like Parrish and Edmeir, can be read as simple celebrations of the literal form, though Edmeir complicates his statuary by choice of model. Patricia Cronin, among others, brings female sexuality to the front. Still others, including Mueck and Mann, examine biological facts of the female sex that have nothing to do with eroticism. Many artists, including Cindy Sherman, read the figure as a politicized battlefield. It's not necessary to share or even like every view shown here, but I find it very useful to see how many kinds of view there are.<br /><br />Don't expect a standardized view of a standardized figure in this book. Do expect variety, complexity, and presentations where simple beauty is only a means to an end or is missing completely. This is not for everyone, but the receptive mind will be well rewarded.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-02-27

The premise is simple: Hockney believes that the Old Masters of European art used tools and techniques of which little record remains. This book presents his justification for that belief.<br /><br />The first half of this book is visual. It shows the original paintings and drawings that led Hockney to this idea. Once it's pointed out, many signs are unmistakable: odd proportions in otherwise masterful works, inconsistent perspective drawn by people who really knew perspective, and a few other better-known oddities. Although I'm not a fan of Hockney's own work, I respect the training and sensitivity that picked out these features.<br /><br />Hockney goes on to show how these artifacts could have come from use of a family of optical tools, including camera lucida and several variants on the camera obscura. This is where he brings the most to this book, in trying the tools himself, as an artist, and seeing what unique features each tool imposes on the resulting artworks. This is what has so many critics upset - the idea that the Old Masters might have used every tool possible to complete their commissions faster, and to give their patrons the most pleasing result for the ducat. Those critics know about the assembly-line work in some of the Old Masters' studios and who know about the other mechanical aids that are well documented, but squawk at the idea of adding another tool to their toolboxes. Huh?<br /><br />Hockney's evidence is often circumstantial, since painting was (and often is) a secretive and competitive business. Still, he offers a good story, and the second half of the book adds a strong foundation of written records to the structure. This is the book's weakness, though. Hockney is an artist, not a historian or optical technologist. He chose a story-telling format for presenting his findings, the letters he exchanged with scholars and specialists in other fields. It has a friendly look, but lacks in density and in organization of the historical records.<br /><br />Despite its many flaws, I find it a fascinating study. Hockney really brings history to life, with his own hands, dispelling the idea that historical study is a dry, dusty practice. His documentation lacks in formal rigor, and he addresses the Great Masters about whom people have strong sentiment. Some people see that as iconoclasm for its own sake - guys, get over it.<br />-- Address his facts with facts. Name-calling says more about you than him.<br />-- Picking one nit (and there are lots) doesn't pick apart the whole presentation.<br />-- Don't assume that Hockney's own art (of which I'm not a fan) decides the merit of his historical analysis.<br />-- Accept the idea that his eye may be better than the words he can put to his vision.<br /><br />It's an honest and vivid account, with a good base in reason and fact. It deserves respect on that account, and works hard to earn the reader's enjoyment. I recommend this to anyone interest in the history and practice of visual art.<br /><br />//wiredweirdI find it a fascinating study.

It's written in a very readable style by one of the guys who lived through a lot of it. He's not afraid to name names, and not (much) ashamed to admit that he was in the thick of some bad ones.<br /><br />Long before the dot-bomb collapse around 2000, companies in the PC world had been shooting themselves in the foot, making (and repeating) insanely bad decisions, and doing everything they could to drive themselves into the ground. Many succeeded in killing themselves off, others (like IBM and Apple) did not. The recurring themes sound simply ridiculous, unless you live in this high-tech world. They they sound ridiculously familiar. They include:<br /><br />* Expensive acquisitions of companies with nothing to offer,<br /><br />* Demolition (\\"rewriting\\") of bread-and-butter products,<br /><br />* Selling two, three, or more products that all do the same thing,<br /><br />* Annoying and ignoring the customers until they all wander away, and<br /><br />* Whatever it was, doing it again and again.<br /><br />This mostly has an anecdotal, non-academic style, so it's an easy and enjoyable read. The dark side of that force is that Chapman isn't always strong on constructive suggestions or on the details of the analysis. Sometimes, though, it would have been psychoanalysis - personalities brash and aggressive when there wasn't that much to be brash about.<br /><br />Chapman covers only the PC side of the world, so he missed some good ones. There was Apollo Computer, for example, and their steadfast determination to avoid advertising their strengths. Still, he gives plenty of cases, and gives good documentary support from the newsrags of the times.<br /><br />I could have asked for a few more pointers on ways out of the stupidity trap.

That's way too many for any one voice ot dominate, but certainly covers a wide range of views and practices. There are a few minor gems here, including discussions of the unique needs of Hebrew and Arabic, and about the 'voice' of a printed text. There's no organized bibliography here, but the careful reader will be rewarded with a good long list of titles, some of which are sure to be unfamiliar.<br /><br />Though by no means unanimous, there was wide agreement that hand-work exercises, using physical media, are helpful or necessary for understanding what computerized systems are doing. I have to agree. If nothing else, computer users have a tendency to treat the quirks and oddities of their chosen software as laws of nature. This inflexibility stands in sharp contrast to most students' use of ink, paper, and all the rest, where their goal is to push the medium to its limit or beyond. Because they have no way to adapt the software tools to their concepts, they constrain their concepts to the tools, sometimes unknowingly. Users of physical media may at least have the vision to see beyond those limits.<br /><br />The practicing typographer won't find much to relate to here, except a formal statement of what was probably done to her in the classroom. This book is about training educators, not about training the practitioners themselves, so there is very little discussion of the concrete design issues.<br /><br />This book has a rather narrow intended audience: type educators. Others (like me) can still read it, and still get some measure of insight into typography and typographers.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-02-21

It succeeds as a sustained exercise in illogic. I am sure that only a mathematical logician like Dodgson could possibly have pulled it off - only someone with such deep understanding of reason could master unreason so completely.<br /><br />Second, Martin Gardner's commentary adds depth and background to the reading. Gardner explains terms that are now obsolete, but also adds his own analysis and a rich history of the Snark phenomenon. It should be no surprise that Gardner is still best known as the long-time editor of Scientific American's column on Mathematical Games, a mathematician himself.<br /><br />I can't add much to the scholarship or praise that already surrounds this incredible poem.

He (among others) pushed the revolution in computing out of the slipstick era. He, at the height of the Cold War, wrote for audiences in both the USSR and the USA. Small wonder that he took on religion. I mean that he took it on as a duty and companion, not as an opponent, though many might have seen opposition.<br /><br />Much of this book lacks direction. He skims issues that are still contentious, including the right to die. His arguments about self-reproducing machines tend twaords the vague, although he admits that he avoided tedious precision. Many of his points are clear and sharp, however. Drawing on the genie in the bottle, the Sorcerer's Apprentice, and other popular literature, he argues that the capabilities of technology steadily run ahead of our ability to predict and mitigate its consequences. He also notes, during first light of the transistor age, that \\"Living matter has a fine structure ... [approached by] machines which operate according to the principles of solid-state physics.\\" As usual, technological optimism carried him well beyond justifiable extrapolation. Also as usual, he had a fair inkling of how today's 0.1 micron transistors might compare to 1.0 micron brain cells.<br /><br />His sharpest commentary starts in the faith that scientists and engineers are moral people, and work in the belief of the human good that comes from their life's work. (Please, don't descend to the belief that we think we are evil people reveling in evil outcomes.) Weiner notes that the deepest hell in Dante's Inferno is reserved for the sin of simony - directing the Church's good power to personal gain, using the force of money. He draws a direct analogy to the sin of corrupting vast technological power towards personal gain, also using money as controlling force. If you're already queasy about the amorality of the MBA's \\"bottom line\\" ethos, this may give you some very bad dreams.<br /><br />It's an important book. It's flawed, but has the honesty to ask hard questions.

Given Anita's habit of watching TV unclad, the results are about the same in every case, a close encounter of the physical kind. The second story, 'Input Anita', features the same attractive woman in a dream scene, again populated by men and women, singly and in groups, intent on making every use of Anita's person.<br /><br />I admit that I haven't seen part 1. Maybe that gives some explanations that would have helped. I tend to doubt it, though. These appear to be Crepax's own stories, and those generally seem a good bit weaker than his adaptations, more scattered and with less visible story line. No one reads Crepax for the stories, though. As always, his female figures are sleek and attractive, and his male figures aren't. Crepax's pen drawings are always well executed, but he added color washes to specific features of some panels this time. It's fairly effective in 'Anita Live,' where Anita is drawn in outline but the fantasy characters are colored.<br /><br />Crepax has done a good job illustrating other erotic stories. His illustration is just as good here, but the stories didn't live up to their potential.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-02-13

In brief: Lucius is magically turned into a donkey, but keeps his human intelligence. His first donkey use of that intelligence is to realize that he'll be safer playing it dumb. He goes through many changes of owner, but all owners ahve one thing in common. They don't care what a donkey sees or hears. This puts Lucius privy to all manner of stories, which are recounted here. There is a bit of tame bawdiness, but other stories describe a wide variety of exploits, intrigues, romances, and adventures. Lucius, the donkey, is involved in several close calls. In the end, he is restored to his human form.<br /><br />There's no plot here, in any modern sense of the notion. Instead, this is a series of vignettes tied together by the donkey's bridle. That makes this book easy to pick up and put down.<br /><br />This might be a good way to introduce teen readers to the classics. The topics (all but one, at least) are safe enough, with enough villainy to make the stories interesting, but with the good guys winning out in the end. Through it all, there is Lucius' plight, always bordering on but missing catastrophe. This isn't the most memorable story from the Roman era, but it's an easy one to enjoy, in comfortably modern language.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-02-13

'Global Frequency' is a shadowy, wordwide group of trouble-shooters. When some problem comes up too fast, in too sensitive a way, or in some manner that the normal forces can't handle, GF activates one or more of its 1001 agents. No superheroes in tights here, but good action based on unusual premises and people.<br /><br />This book collects the first few issues of the comic. Each of the original comics seemed to be a self-contained story with separate characters and situations. Although the writing is consistent, the artists also changed book by book. The artwork is always good, but won't have collectors stampedin any time soon.<br /><br />This is the start of a readable, interesting action comic series. It's off to a very good start. I'll read more in the future, but this hasn't turned me into an instant fan. There are lots of other good ones to read, too.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-02-13

At least on the surface, the writing bears out that statement. Every chapter starts with the phrase \\"Lao Tzu said\\", possibly in answer to a question posed by Wen, as if Wen were writing down the master's teachings directly.<br /><br />Points of style also seem more like Lao Tzu than like later authors. In fact, the Wen Tzu fits nicely into a continuum. Lao was the earliest, also the most poetic, abstract, obscure. Chuang Tzu was probably later, and had a more prosaic, anecdotal, and understandable style. Lieh Tzu was the latest, and even more pedestrian and pragmatic than Chuang. Wen fits neatly between Lao and Chuang. His writing is less figurative and poetic than Lao's, but still more ethereal than Chuang's. Like Lao, Wen addresses the Tao directly, rather than through the kinds of stories that Chuang uses with such good effect.<br /><br />Wen Tzu has a strong message all his own, however. He conveys a strong sense of changing needs of each different moment, and of the proper relationships between things. He notes that a bow is needed for hunting, but is put away when the game is caught. He also points out that the wheel functions only when all the spokes are properly fitted, and that the harp plays only when all of its strings are present and properly tuned. One spoke can't carry a cart and one string can't play a melody. Both messages have strong social meanings: the Way gives a person diffferent duties at different times, and that organization of many people into a society may also be proper, if done in accordance with the Way. This is why Wen's \\"quotes\\" of Lao are sometimes suspect. It was the tradition, back then, for a newer writer to ascribe his words to an older authority. This practice made sure the writer was not seen to contradict established wisdom, and hoped to gain respect by association.<br /><br />Cleary's translations are always very readable, and this is no exception. The text tends towards the repetitive, verging on monotony at times. Still, it makes a useful addition to any collection of Taoist classics and is easy to enjoy for its own wisdom and voice.<br /><br />//wiredweirdt tends towards the repetitive, verging on monotony at times.

It is best known as the vehicle for Meyer's \\"design by contract\\" methodology, a relaxed version of formal, mathematical proofs of program correctness.<br /><br />This book sets out to be two things: a user guide and also a specification of the Eiffel language, as it was defined at version 3. It's not quite rigorous enough to be a full spec, but adequate as a user guide. This is not a tutorial for beginning programmers, a very different kind of book, but it says at the outset that it was never meant for beginners. That's fair, since beginners and experienced programmers need quite different kinds of material for learning a language. The organization isn't all I could have asked for, but I could use it for wrting Eiffel programs if I had to.<br /><br />The one thing that stands out in this book is its lengthy discussion of the typing system. That is well justified. Eiffel has the most complex type system I've seen, including parametric types (like C++ templates), multiple and repeated inheritance, and more than one scheme for creating aliases. Its repeated inheritance mechanism allows class B to claim class A as a superclass twice - like \\"diamond\\" inheritance in C++, but without the intermediate steps. That's where renaming comes in, creating ways to refer to the two different A superclasses unambiguously. Also, Eiffel allows a subclass to over-ride a function's return type - just to add flavor to the mix and complexity to the class-type rules. Once you combine parametric types, aliasing, and all the rest, type compatibility becomes a real hairball and is the subject of lengthy discussion. Despite its length, that discussion lacks clarity and examples, so I would expect a lot of ugly surprises if I tried doing serious work in this language.<br /><br />The one serious omission here is lack of description of LACE - sort of a linker language for Eiffel, with a renaming facility of its own. Java and C# programmers won't even know what a linker is. Good. Since Eiffel requires LACE for just about any nontrivial application, however, something a bit more readable than appendix D would have been helpful. Another important idea is also weak or absent in this discussion: how name spaces are organized for projects so big that duplicate class names become likely. That may be a lack in Eiffel itself, though.<br /><br />There's a lot to say about Eiffel, good, bad, and just puzzled. I'm not commenting on the language itself, here, except to say that I'm glad more recent languages are simpler, or at least put their complexity elsewhere.<br /><br />I can't give this a ranking among other Eiffel books, because there are so very few others. It appears adequate as a reference for advanced programmers, but suffers from an inverted organization and thin discussion of some important topics.<br /><br />//wiredweirdrogrammers won't even know what a linker is.

She wants the voices of the masters, not lists of dates and places. She has written her book accordingly. These are readable, non-academic stories of Taoist sages and masters. Dozens of different masters are presented, each in a short and readable anecdote. At the end of the story about some master, a few lines state the era and area in which [s]he lived, if known.<br /><br />This book's goal is its weakness, however. It present each famous name in isolation, with no organization by place, time, or school of thought. It's almost impossible to get any sense of continuity, or sense of which sages lived at the same time. Some are simply identified as having lived in some dynasty - a span of a thousand years. It would have been nice if the information were just a little more specific.<br /><br />Also, the relationships between different immortals and different Taoist traditions are rarely spelled out. Chuang Tzu, a major author, gets the same three or four pages as any other. The more practical sages are lumped in with the ones who founded the alchemical tradition, blurring distinctions that I find worthwhile.<br /><br />It's an interesting and lively set of stories, but unsastisfying for any reader who wants more historical information.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-02-08

The sketches are good, but the paintings are everything I hope for in Hildebrandt's work. They capture draftmanship, color, expression, and light in a wonderul balance.<br /><br />The story goes back to 1900 or so (the only clue is that the author died in 1920, about age 60). A small boy follows a magical being through worlds of fantasy and fairy tale, learns to believe in the unbelievable, and wakes to find that it was all a dream. It's been done before, it will be done again, and it can be good, but this just didn't engage me. The changes were so frequent and abrupt that it was easy to skip a cog. If you read this to a small child, though, the brief vignettes may suit the brief attention span.<br /><br />Four stars - all for the illustration. It would have been 5 if there were more samples of Hildebrandt's art, or maybe if a kid had been there to advise me on the proper reading of this story.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-02-08

A few of these photos are striking figure studies, making the most of the model's youth (p.33), mystery (p.41), or simple elegance (p.64,80,164).<br /><br />Murrian's vision of starting womanhood just isn't mine, though. The soft focus wore on me after a while - there was scarcely a crisp, clean line anywhere in the collection. Romantic vision has a place, but the strength and agility of the figures was never allowed to come through. The orange cast, possibly suggesting firelit warmth, was decidedly overused. Also, I found his fascination with lingerie just odd, out of place on these models. Were the girls playing with prettiness the way a child plays with a toy, or trying on adulthood to see if it fit, or was Murrian pushing a look onto them that they really didn't need?<br /><br />The models all have an inherent loveliness that comes through in every picture. The collection of photos, taken as a whole, seems to say a lot more about Murrain than it does about them, though.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-02-08

It allocates a paragraph per school to housing, non-scholastic activities, handicapped access, scholastics, application procedures, and a few other basics.<br /><br />That's it. Academic programs are addressed in a single paragraph, and not always the longest one. There are stats on degrees awarded in the 2002-3 year, but nothing before or after that. Graduate study is shrugged off in one line that states how many graduate students there are - if non-zero, there must be at least one grad program. Community colleges aren't listed at all. That's a small enough loss, since they generally address a different clientele than this book is meant for.<br /><br />What's painful is indexing - there is none, to speak of, just an alphabetical list. It's perfectly reasonable to ask questions like:<br /><br />-- Which schools have law programs?<br /><br />-- Which ones issue MFA degrees?<br /><br />-- Which have ABET certification?<br /><br />-- Which have a Catholic or other religious orientation?<br /><br />-- Which have under 500 students? Over 10,000?<br /><br />These questions can only be answered by a cover-to-cover search.<br /><br />Also, information about the computing facilities has questionable freshness, and lacks in important details. Yes, a certain school may have (or had a while back) some super-computer, but that doesn't mean all students have easy access to it.<br /><br />This book keeps the promise of its title. It doesn't go an inch past that goal, though, and misses important facts. One in particular, is glaringly absent: universities generally consist of several colleges. Each college generally has its own requirements and application procedures. Describing each college might have been a bit much, but it would have been helpful to note that the colleges differ and to be more explicit in saying where to find information about each.<br /><br />//wiredweirdon about each. <br /> <br />//wiredweird	2005-02-08

Craig Russell is one of the most literate comic artists now active. He is best known for his opera adaptations, but he goes after a different kind of story here.<br /><br />These start as fairy tales in the classic mold, with giants, ice fairies, enchantments, and royalty lost and found. Even though Wilde wrote them, they're tame enough for kids and carry moral lessons I wouldn't mind a kid seeing. Wilde made sure there's plenty for the adults to hold onto, including a surprisingly religious turn in \\"The Selfish Giant.\\" To tell the truth, I haven't read Wilde's original stories. This book is good encouragement to do so.<br /><br />Russell's gentle artwork brings these stories to life. He has a unique way with fantasy elements, vividly seen in the Giant's perpetual winter. He also has a fine sense of how much cartooniness to allow - just enough for the story, but not enough to Disneyfy Wilde's text.<br /><br />I consider these kid-safe, but \\"Star child\\" has a few harsh turns that may not suit the delicate - read the story first, yourself, then decide whether it suits your family.

The depictions exaggerate some characters, but just enough to support Wilde's stories.<br /><br />There's something in this book for many different readers: good visual storytelling, fairy tales for people who thought they were too old, and some of Wilde's lesser-known works.

His story was told for a thousand years, in many parts of the mid-East. This book renders into English one of the latest versions of that story, from about 2000BC.<br /><br />The book's layout follows the format of the clay tablets on which it was inscribed, twelve tablets each divided into six columns of text. After roughly 4000 years, much of the original text has been damaged or lost, and that is part of the excitement of reading this book. The translator shows just which parts were illegible, giving a sometimes broken form of the story. It really gives me, a modern reader, a sense of time's ravages and a better appreciation for the parts that remain.<br /><br />According to notes in this book, other translators have often tried to patch a whole story together from different texts of the Gilgamesh epic. Since the story changed so many times over its active life, that practice is suspect - almost like filling in a Brothers Grimm fairy tale with scraps of a Disney version. The editor does sometimes show alternative versions, especially where this text was most damaged. That is very different. It preserves the integrity of the current translation, but still gives some idea of what might have been lost.<br /><br />In other ways, though, I generally found the footnotes to be pedantic. They helped in a few places, in understanding the role of the temple courtesans in that society and religion. Most often, however, debates about the meanings of specific words and the ancient poetic forms added very little to my reading. I skipped most of that esoterica, of interest primarily to other translators.<br /><br />What I did get was a deeper appreciation of the canon of Western literature. This story includes an early story much like Noah and the ark. This version is so similar to the biblical one that the differences are more striking. That pre-Noah saved \\"the seed of all living creatures\\", an evocative phrase in this era of DNA banking. He also saved \\"the children of all the craftsmen\\", preserving not just life but knowledge. A later part of the epic foreshadows Charon the ferryman, crossing the river Lethe to the Greek world of the dead. There is also the snake that deprived mankind of eternal life, with echoes of a Prometheus story and the Edenic snake.<br /><br />Despite the academic commentary, the translation is modern and comfortable - even crude, when there was crudity in the original text. Parts of the story are missing, as they are in the historical record, but what's left is enjoyable and enlightening.<br /><br />//wiredweirde also saved \\"the children of all the craftsmen\\", preserving not just life but knowledge.

The table of contents follows a classic plan: restriction maps, assembly and sequencing, 2- and N- way string comparisons, and analysis of rearrangements. There's a good but brief section on mass spec  analysis - unfortunately, that chapter is called \\"Proteomics\\" even though the term covers a lot more than MS. Other sections skim the surface of hidden Markov models and Gibbs sampling for finding patterns (\\"motifs\\") in DNA.<br /><br />A few chapters have unusual strengths. The \\"Conway Equation\\" gives more insight in analysis of motif significance than other introductory books do. The section in sequence comparison pays a lot more attention to BLAST-like algorithms than other books do, also - modern material you'd normally see only in the journals. Also, the section on rearrangements gives some ideas about using rearrangement data for phylogenetic analysis. That really gives the material meaning. Rearrangements aren't just string operations, they're features of evolution, and they can be compared to each other. No matter what the discussion, Pevzner keeps maintains a readable and enjoyably informal tone.<br /><br />The book does have some weaknesses, though. It's a bit advanced for an undergrad intro, but bottoms out before the Baum-Welch algorithm, for example. Discussion of microarrays for sequencing seems dated. Pevnzer describes their use in sequencing, a rarity now, but skips their use in functional gneomics, where they are used most often. Illustration style is erratic and many diagrams are oddly stretched (3.5, 5.7, 8.3, and others, some much worse). Formal analysis of the algorithms is weak, but Pevzner somewhat makes up for that with better statistical analysis than many authors give. Also, even though the book was reprinted in 2001, it still estimates 100K genes in the human genome.<br /><br />This is a good second book, maybe the one to read after Pevzner's newer \\"Introduction\\". It covers most of the basics and gives fairly usable pseudocode. Most of all, it always keeps the biology in mind.

That term may not have been in wide use back in `97, leading to the title that suggests a lot more focus on the molecules than is in fact present.<br /><br />The book starts with two brief chapters on biology and mathematical basics - graph theory and algorithm analysis. I'm sorry to say that these really are too brief. A reader who comes in with little knowledge of either topic will probably leave with about the same level of knowledge.<br /><br />After that, the authors give coverage of the basics, as `97 writers saw them: approximate string matching, fragment assembly, mapping, trees, and a discussion of the reversals that occur in DNA over evolutionary time. Each topic is presented carefully, in a number of variations, and with formal analysis of the algorithmic complexity. That last won't do much for the biologists in the crowd, but gives programmers a good idea of how each technique will behave as the problems grow larger (and they always do). The presentation generally stick with the most popular algorithms, emphasizing detailed presentation over breadth of coverage. Multiple alignment, in particular, could have used a lot more pages. Also, topics like assembly and restriction digests aren't at the forefront of analysis any more. They're important, but good algorithms exist in widely available tools, and more advanced analyses tend to attract more attention these days. The section on genome rearrangements is quite good, but seems to stand alone - it could have been one input into tree building, but the authors don't draw any clear relationships between the reorderings and any other problems.<br /><br />The section on structure prediction is definitely showing its age. RNA structure prediction has come a long way since this was written, and protein structure prediction has come even farther. Discussions of the basic ideas are good, but a more recent reader will want a lot more development. The final section, on using DNA as a material for performing computations, is interesting but hardly mainstream. The authors use one or two problems as case studies, but don't present the kinds of tools that can be applied to lots of different problems, just a few point solutions.<br /><br />This book's value, today, lies mostly in the clarity of its complexity analysis and in the pseudocode that gives a programmer a step in the right direction. It has a few unusual items, like a highly generalized gap model for approximate string matching. On the whole, though, more recent books present most of the same material at least as well, and cover more up-to-date topics.<br /><br />When it was new, I might have given this book a five star rating. Times have changed, though, and I have to rate this book among the others on the shelves now.<br /><br />//wiredweirdopment.

On the whole, though, more recent books present most of the same material at least as well, and cover more up-to-date topics. <br /> <br />When it was new, I might have given this book a five star rating. Times have changed, though, and I have to rate this book among the others on the shelves now. <br /> <br />//wiredweird	2005-02-02

Lieh Tzu followed Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu as the third major Toaist writer, at least as Western readers understand.<br /><br />This can't be read wholly at face value, as Graham explains. Lieh often co-opted Confucius as a spokesman for Lieh's teachings, a standard technique when reference to the old sages was required. Graham gives plenty of notes showing where that happened, and how. Lieh also took over some of Chuang's teachings, but in Lieh's own way. That was a time when many competing schools fought against each other, but none could fight against the ancient sages or the dominant Confucians - it wasn't subterfuge, but accomodation of Lieh's views to his reading audience.<br /><br />This is a readable, but often contradictory text. Graham starts each chapter with a bit of explanation. I do wish that he had more clearly set his commentary off from Lieh's text, though. Graham makes up for that lack of clarity by showing which parts of the text were most likely later accretions. For many reasons, these old Chinese texts are often the writing of many hands, not all of whom agreed with each other, and Graham helps us unwind which writing is which.<br /><br />Through it all, Lieh's voice dominates. He is serene and practical. He often spins tales of immortals flying through clouds and living on dew, but more often describes ferrymen or shepherds. He preaches submission to The Way, but the book also describes a hedonsitic fatalsim - if destiny has already declared my future, then why should I not drink and be merry? This is where Graham's notes are most helpful, in sorting out which is the original text from and which parts were added by unknown authors.<br /><br />If you have already read the Chuang Tzu, I strongly recommend Lieh. Lao Tzu was a poet, Chuang Tzu was a story-teller, but Lieh Tzu was very earth-bound and practical Graham has done a good job of making the work accessible, while giving the scholar room to study Lieh more deeply.<br /><br />-- wiredweirdle, while giving the scholar room to study Lieh more deeply.<br /><br />-- wiredweird	2005-02-01

All the basics seem to be here, in the form of examples. An experienced programmer can skip over the bumpy parts and fill in the blanks.<br /><br />And there are lots of blanks. Boolean operators are introduced on page 60, including both bitwise and short-circuit OR operators. It gives an example of short-circuit behavior, but never really explains what that means. (If you never heard the term, \\"a OR b\\" in the short-circuit sense means \\"if a is true the expression as a whole is already true, so don't even evaluate expression b\\", and don't create all the output and side effects that b would have created.) Likewise, p.216 shows a use of include() that doesn't mean what you probably want, but fails to explain why incorrect usage is incorrect. Escape tag configuration is set on p.20, but there never is a clear description of how escape tags interact with the code. The section on Javascript gives examples of files with that and PHP together, but never really spells out the source-level interactions between them.<br /><br />Also, there is only a little mention of some of the peculiar capabilities of an interpreted language, like being able to use character strings as variable names. This borders on (and sometimes blurs the line with) self-modifying code. There's a lot of potential power there, but you're on your own if you try to tame it.<br /><br />On the whole, the book gave a uniform impression. It sounds like a pretty good explanation of material that the author just barely understands. There's plenty of code-by-example material here, so I can probably get everything done that I need to. Someone who really needed to understand the language in finest detail would not get what they want, however.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-01-27

Its friendly tone stresses the basics, like decent grammar, clear labeling, and thoughtful use of color. It also emphasizes the kinds of charts commonly created by PC desktop tools.<br /><br />Lots of things get in the book's way, though. It dates from 1995, so lots of its advice about computer specifics (especially color) is dated. Although (fig. 10.4) he suggests underlining as a way to emphasize text, it was never a very good idea and has been given new meaning by conventions for hypertext links. Also, this edition is a black and white reprint of a book that seems originally to have been printed in color. That doesn't have to be a problem, but many of the original colors were replaced by annoying stipples or uneven screens, and one photo (11.2) makes no sense at all in black and white.<br /><br />The worst problem is that the book often fails to follow its own good advice. Fig 3.14 uses cute 3D-ish cylinders as the bars in a bar chart, leaving the reader wondering just which part of the rounded end was meant to be the bar's end. Fig 7.8 is a supposedly good example tainted by the perspective distortion that Jones notes elsewhere. The \\"linked bar\\" of Fig. 7.10 is deceptive in that the bars themselves appear to cover some span of time, when they really represent instantaneous values.<br /><br />Good advice, and there is a fair bit, often doesn't go far enough. P.105, for example, mentions log and log-log axes. Admittedly, the basic math is beyond this book's level (as shown by the blooper on p.140). Still, it wouldn't have been so hard to suggest using log scales for compound-interest or common growth curves, or to give a few examples where log-log scales would turn curves into straight lines with more meaning. Fig 7.17 shows two-sided bars (not usually recommended), without noting that they may be useful when the sum of the two sides has meaning. He discourages the use of \\"bubble\\" charts (p.128), even though that notation is common for chemists' phase diagrams or for placing different products along price and performance axes. He doesn't even mention the main value of \\"stacked\\" bars (fig 7.13), in showing the total of the stacked amounts. His \\"donut\\" chart (fig 2.10) is all but illegible, even though the same notation can be very useful for annotating one loop in many different ways.<br /><br />Well, you get the idea. There is some good here, but lots that's not so good, including (p.200) reading your slides to your audience! I really can't recommend this one.<br /><br />//wiredweirdsides has meaning.

I like \\"Tyger,\\" \\"Garden of Love,\\" and a few others, but I can't add to the scholarship on his verse.<br /><br />I am, however, fascinated by his use of relief etching in creating these pages. It's a rare process even now, and was revealed to Blake in a vision (plus a lot of painstaking experimentation). It's the process by which he shaped each letter, reversed, in the printing plate, plus much of the 'illumination' on each page.<br /><br />The preface is vague and the reproduced images are hard to read, but Blake printed the lettering and line work on each page, then hand-decorated with watercolors. The preface says that Blake went on to create color printing processes, but what they were or whether they're used here is not explicit. I tend to think not, unless a few pages were printed with one or two more plates to emphasize the dark areas. If these illustrations really are true size, then inking on the plate would have been tedious, imprecise, and would not have given the results seen here.<br /><br />There's much to say about his illustration. That includes an odd conflict, between figures fully drawn even under clothing and the androgyny or sexlessness of so many, an ambiguity that appears in the poems as well. I'll leave that commentary to others, though. The thing that impresses me about these editions is their artistic intensity. Each individual copy of the book was printed and decorated on demand, for a specific buyer. Blake had full control of every part of the creation, the words, images, and reproduction.<br /><br />It is a rare mind that can master visual and verbal arts, both, then the craft of creating the book that carries them. Perhaps I miss parts of the presentation, but I very much admire the parts that I understand. Four stars because better reproduction would have served his visual art and craft much better.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-01-26

This goes way beyond the basics. For example, it doesn't address BLAST internals or usage, but does describe how it can be used as one step in more complex computations.<br /><br />The good parts are quite good. The first chapter's biology review is quick but generally adequate, except for a few over-simplifications like \\"the disease genes for ... breast cancer ... have been identified.\\" They have? ALL of them, or just a few of the more important ones? The \\"Strategy and Planning\\" chapter is very weak, perhaps because it addresses such a huge and varied range of topics. Chapters on neural nets, motif finding, homology search (post-BLAST), probe design, and RNA structure are good, and have enough detail for a programmer to get started on. The data mining section has some good material, but doesn't really cover the full breadth of data mining (a book-length topic in itself). Other chapters, esp. phylogeny and database issues, don't rise to the same level.<br /><br />The problems: Well, no index for one. There's a huge aggregate list of references (I would have preferred chapter by chapter), and even pictures of all the authors in the back, but no index. The table of contents is quite detailed, but hardly a replacement. Also, despite editorial policies meant to ensure uniformity between chapters, some inexplicable differences showed up. Sometimes it's a \\"translation start site (TSS)\\", other times a \\"translation initiation site (TIS).\\" The editing could have been a little tighter too. Criterion should be the singular of criteria, strata should be the plural of stratum, a few other annoyances should have been addressed as well. Editing should cover the illustrations, too. The diagram on p.411 has \\"mosquitoes\\" from poor compression, and the line drawings of ch.11 don't always connect connected lines. And of course this shows the usual problem of such books - it's an idiosyncratic selection of topics, giving erratic coverage to the field. If it hits your area of interest, great, but it may miss.<br /><br />What's good here is quite good. It covers topics well into the post-genome age, using genome data rather than just trying to discover it. Still, the book as a whole is spotty - considering the price, I hoped for better. Also, readers expecting \\"Practical\\" to mean \\"Basic\\" are in for an unhappy surprise.

The book centers on the punch, that unique object that is eventually copied into the matrices, movable type, and printed results that are more familiar. Smeijers started by studying the literature, printing tools, and printed artifacts that are still available. That wasn't enough - he taught himself the craft of making (or \\"cutting\\") the punches, learning a lot from the tool and die machinists who preserve much of the skill that Smeijers needed. After his eye became trained to the marks of tool on steel, he realized that a whole craft existed and had nearly vanished without a trace. That was the skill of making the tools to make the tool, creation and use of the counter-punch.<br /><br />Along the way, he fell in love with the metal that he shaped into punches. He became quite lyrical about it: \\"... you feel nothing but delight in this substance, with such a strong and fine substance, which we call steel.\\" He even became jealous of the old-timers, who remember alloys of the past that yielded even more gracefully to the punchcutter's caress. I have to admit, I've worked metal (though not steel), and I know just how that passion developed.<br /><br />There's more about the history of letterforms and the punchcutters that brought them to life, and about the pleasures there are in being an amateur historian. There's more, too, about current and future practice in type design. This brings us to the one point where I disagree with Smeijers, a statement that I just can't believe he made. He mentions letters on screens, objects that he lumps together as \\"anything that can carry information and which is able to refresh itself.\\" Earlier, he gave lengthy descriptions of the difference between letterpress and laser printer results, in sharpness of edge and many other dimensions. All those same differences, and more, distinguish CRTs from plasma panels or LCDs, and all the different LCDs from wall displays to cell phones. Perhaps he has since learned to look at modern displays the same way he looks at the older media, or maybe another writer will need to make the distinctions.<br /><br />The only real reason to criticize this book would come from incorrect expectations. It's not directly about how a modern typographer can use modern tools to get the daily jobs done. It's about the practices of times past - they do bear on today's work, but only in subtle and indirect ways.<br /><br />Highly recommended for the serious typographer or historian of western technology.<br /><br />//wiredweirde has since learned to look at modern displays the same way he looks at the older media, or maybe another writer will need to make the distinctions.

He painted traditional rural landscapes, and seaside scenes along the New Englad coast, too. What he captured best, though, was urban life in the 1940s.<br /><br />He seems to have caught it all, the bridges, trains, opera, and tenements, at every hour of day and night. And very often he captured someone, often a woman, in a moment of solitude. These scenes border on voyeurism, the unguarded moments when his subjects might be dressed, or partly, or not - with no one to dress for, it hardly matters. There is nothing erotic in these nudes and semi-nudes. In fact, I quite like the unposed, unpoised relaxation of the moment. Hopper is quite capable of showing a female figure as strong and desirable, as in \\"Office at Night\\" or \\"Summer Evening\\" I sympathize more with the figures who have no one to pose for; they seem more honest somehow.<br /><br />People say that many of his paintings are about loneliness, and that may be true. I think more of them are about solitude, or separation, or the invisible walls that people erect to keep themselves sane in the urban crush. In \\"Two on the Aisle,\\" as in so many paintings of two or more people, the two parties seem barely aware of each other. Even within the couple, they scarcely look at each other, as if long familiarity means there's nothing new to see.<br /><br />Of 246 paintings reproduced here, only 88 are in color. They are well printed, and capture Hopper's generally subdued palette. They are just enough to make me greedy, though, and to wish I could see more in the colors that Hopper gave them. There's a lot of work here, including a number of etchings, from Hopper's earlier ouvre as well. I don't mean to neglect those works, but his 40s and 50s pieces have an incredible power over me.<br /><br />The commentary occupies about half the book, and gives real insight into Hopper's life. I have to admit, I skimmed the words, only dipping into them occasionally. That just gives me more reason (as if I needed reason) to come back again. And again and again.<br /><br />This book really is beautiful. If more of it were in color, it would have the highest praise I know how to give.<br /><br />//wiredweird..

Let's start with what works.<br /><br />Bilal's drawing style emphasizes pen work, with a wash of color almost as an afterthought. The pen sets the tone of each person drawn, whether craggy Joseph, the babushka'ed housewives, weatherworn fishermen, or gangster-like developers. Color completes the personalities of the red-nosed gendarmes or bilious bourgeoisie.<br /><br />The story is filled with good parts, and carries its sense of mystery well. Just a little too well, I think. OK, the mysterious old man raises his arcane army, tears the village down a stick at a time, and spirits the population away overnight. The villagers seem to take it all in stride, the reasons are never quite clear, and the choice of new home seems arbitrary. There seems to be about 80% of a story here, but I'm not quite sure which 20% went astray.<br /><br />It's interesting drawing, and Bilal is well known as a comic artist.

They cover every embrace, every kiss, and every acrobatic exotica in the Kama Sutra catalog. The pictures go beyond the actual text, in illustrations of groups and in groups of illustrations.<br /><br />Some depictions are stone carvings from the temples at Konarak, other are more recent carvings in wood or ivory. Drawings and paintings seem to cover every historical style the sub-continent has seen since the 18th century, from stylized cartoons to realism. Color, where appropriate is vivid and well-printed. The illustrations capture many times, people, fashions, practices, and styles of dress. Where necessary, foldouts show larger views so you can appreciate the original's detail. With just a bit more organization and care with the attributions, the illustrations alone could form a serious historical document.<br /><br />The only drawback to this beautiful book is the Kama Sutra - it's just not there, at least not in complete and coherent form. There are extracts, in Sanskrit, a Romanized form of the Sanskrit phonetics, in a modern translation, and in Burton's Victorian rendering.

What can I say - I should have read it myself long since. This play seems to offer everything. It goes beyond just bawdy, but never turns salacious. It's got silly wordplay, but real social commentary. The battle of the sexes is about real battle this time, and Aristophanes fires a few well-aimed shots at both the men and the women. It's a classic of the Western canon, but amusing and readable. Also, for those who dread literature that's \\"good for them,\\" it's short. The script comes in under 100 pages, and they're not dense pages.<br /><br />As I said, this is a modern rendering full of wordplay and chants for the traditional Greek chorus. I'm afraid that the easy, humorous style puts me on edge, though. If a play starts in classical Greek, then ends up in modern English with proper rhyme, scansion, and dialect(!), I know the translator has taken some serious liberties with the libretto. Still I'm torn. Which is more important, academic integrity in creating a version for English readers, or being true to the popular, funny, bawdy tone that Aristophanes intended? I really can't answer that question.<br /><br />It's a great play in a readable translation. There's a good bit of explanatory material, but not the kind that interferes with the flow of the play. I recommend this Lysistrata if you want the fun in the play, but I have reservations about the rigor of the translation.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-01-15

I respect the man's opinions completely, and look to him for the best advice on connecting information to the human mind.<br /><br />That's why this booklet (28pp, covers included) disappoints me - he just doesn't live up to his own standard. As he did with the Challenger space shuttle's disaster years ago, he uses this book to analyze the presentations that contributed to the loss of the Columbia shuttle and crew. In the Challenger case, he showed some of the mis- and dis-informative displays, and how they could have been converted to tools for making decisions. In the Columbia case, he only went half-way: what was wrong, not how to make it right.<br /><br />The rest of the booklet follows the same pattern: what's wrong, with very few positive, definite suggestions for mitigating or circumventing the problems. His conclusion is that PowerPoint is hopelesly flawed, and I have to agree. That's just not enough, though. Given its dire failings, and given that its use is pervasive and sometimes compulsory, what specific steps can we as viewers and presenters take in order to transfer information anyway?<br /><br />This is a great half of a book: the problem statement. His bad examples are wonderfully bad. Unfortunately, the missing second half is replaced by little more than one sentence on the inside back cover: \\"Well, I can recommend 3 books on how to present visual evidence!\\"<br /><br />Please, Mr. Tufte.

In fact, if you're a no-equations reader, this book will be especially helpful.<br /><br />It shows all the little tricks that advertisers and propagandists, government agencies included, throw at you every day. One, p.85, is an impressive sounding news article about teachers' pay. At first, it looks as if a generous government outlay had doubled or tripled teachers' salaries. Looking closer, however, one sees an odd cluster of unrelated numbers flying in close formation. None of the numbers quoted has any bearing on any other, at least none that the article's reader can discover.<br /><br />Duff also points out the fallacy of correlation. Oh, it's a useful enough measure, if (!) a number of mathematical requirements are met. It is not causation, however. For example, there is a strong correlation between a school child's height and the child's score on a given spelling test - taller kids do better. The fact is a lot less surprising when you see that first graders tend to be smaller than sixth graders, and tend to know fewer words. Maybe the example sounds silly, but no sillier than lots of the numbers in the news every day.<br /><br />This is a quick and approachable read, and true even if the examples are now dated. Despite its name, this book really is aimed at honest people, readers who want real understanding of the data thrown at them, and presenters who want their numbers to be understood properly. And best, you don't have to be a mathematician to see what's going on.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-01-12

They occur in many forms, in many contexts, and commonly carry more data per square inch than just about any other kind of diagram. Also, a map carries some sense of authority and may even inspire a kind of loyalty - surely you know at least one map fanatic? That carrying capacity and authority can be used badly as easily as used well: incompetently, to make some point at the expense of others, or intentionally to misdirect.<br /><br />The book's first section reminds us that every map contains mis- or missing information - if only because the world is round and the map is flat. Later, Mommonier gives examples of incompetence showing how information, especially in color, can be illegible.<br /><br />He also shows how maps can affect political decisions as close as your own back yard, the maps used to make land planning and zoning decisions. He works up from town hall politics to the international scale, including some remarkable Cold War artifacts. He mentions esthetics only briefly, mostly to point out how the decision to make a map look nice can corrupt its data content. This is a loss since esthetics don't inherently conflict with the message, but good illustrators already know how to create visual appeal and bad ones should not be encouraged.<br /><br />This is a useful addition for anyone who creates or uses information in picture form. It's not as broad as other books, but adds depth to discussions about one particular kind of information graphic. The wide ranging and well categorized bibliography is just an extra.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-01-11

One good thing is breadth. It starts with the printmaking studio, with the tools, lighting, furniture, and floor plan useful for making the drawings and pulling the prints. It describes the inks and their formulations for specific processes. It describes even some of the papers for printmaking, how they're made, and the sizing and other treatments that affect the structure of the paper.<br /><br />Also on the good side, this shows the tools and techniques of wood engraving, down to the way your hand should hold a burin. It covers lithography, and pays special attention to screen printing (serigraphy). Every section is richly illustrated to show the tools, materials, and masterworks of each printmaking process.<br /><br />For all that, the selection and coverage of topics are oddly spotty. The section on intaglio printing shows specifically how to hold the handle on the machine for laying an aquatint ground, but omits whole centuries of engraving techique. It mentions sugar-lift technique briefly, without describing or showing the esthetic reason for the process. It goes into detail about the carpentry for the corners of the frames used to hold seripgraphic screens, but devotes only a page or two to the process by which an artist creates an etched plate. It also treats us to such insights as (p.80) \\"Metal polish is used for polishing.\\"<br /><br />What's good is the breadth, from inception of an image to the hardware use to hang the framed print on the wall. This may help the practioner in some technical points, and there's a good chance that at least one detail will appeal to any beginning printmaker. What lacks, however, is uniformity in treatment. What it does, this book does well. Sad to day, there is much that it omits.<br /><br />If the authors' idiosyncratic choices of topic match your needs, you'll love it. Print afficianodos may learn a bit more about their favorite processes, and maybe even about favored artists. The coverage is erratic, though, and may skip over your needs as an artist or art lover.<br /><br />-- wiredweirdyour needs as an artist or art lover.    -- wiredweird	2005-01-09

Judy Garland, in 'The Wizard of Oz', lands on one Wicked Witch, destroys another, ends the rule of The Wizard, and returns home by magical means.<br /><br />This is the back-story, all the way back to the Wicked Witch's birth and a few hours before. I'm willing to be corrected, but I've never seen a male author write down that last day of pregnancy, so sensitively, from the mother's point of view.<br /><br />What follows is a strained childhood. Our very different little girl makes her way through a theocratic home-schooling. She watches a expansionist Wizard's rule destroy the one minority population after another in a militaristic expansion. Did you know that the US Interstates started as a Cold War artifact for materiel transport? or the Appian Way for the Roman expansion? Think of the Yellow Brick Road in the same terms, a route for military support of puppet rulers, or a feeder for military collapse of undecided regimes.<br /><br />There is much too much detail to tell here, but I hope you get Maguire's general premise. The Wicked Witch was once a little girl, almost like all the others. She was hardened by hard times, made some unlikely alliances, and was defeated in embarassment and pain. History is always written by the victor, and her history (until now) was written by an especially vicious victor.<br /><br />In retrospect, it's quite remarkable how much Maguire has made from very few facts. He maintained fair consistency with L. Frank Baum's original, though, and pulled me so deeply into his intrigues that I never noticed the inconsistencies, or had a good way to explain them away.<br /><br />This is a complex and imaginative re-reading of a story I thought I knew. Now, I want to see what Maguire has done with my other childhood favorties.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-01-08

In fact, you silently snicker at most people who say they \\"really know Java,\\" because they don't - not like you do.<br /><br />Why: Java 1.5 is really different. Not just enums and boxing/unboxing, it has type-safe varargs (who'd've thunk it!), last-chance handlers for threads, the most comprehensive generic mechanism I'm seen, and more. You need to know what's new, and how to use it, and fast.<br /><br />What: This book. It won't help the Java newbie. It's just the new features, spelled out in detail. Better yet, they're spelled out in code samples. This doesn't so much tell you what's new, it shows you.<br /><br />Where: Here. Until the next generation of Java books hits the shelves, your alternatives are this and the language spec. Believe me, you don't want the language spec.<br /><br />When: Now. This book will probably look old fast, once the more polished, friendly, and tutorial texts come out. It's a great quick-start on the new technology, though, and (see \\"who\\" above) you can't wait.<br /><br />I hope O'Reilly keeps coming out with new titles in this series. I give it five stars now, but probably two a year from now. As I said, though, this book is for !right!now! and does a great job of what it does.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-01-06

The result is generally satisfying. It's a well-styled piece of adult story telling, but never quite finds whatever it is that makes a visual story truly memorable.<br /><br />For one thing, Crepax's comic rendering suffers all the weaknesses of the original story, including a washed-out central character and some passages where French philosophy is injected like literary Novacaine. Then, the story displays Crepax's own manner (or flaws) as an illustrator. His signature style emphasizes line at the expense of volume and mass. His characters sometimes suffer oddly asymmetric features, a distortion with no apparent narrative purpose. Still, he renders figures with real passion, even the unusual figures such as Bea, and especially those figures in the throes of passion.<br /><br />Crepax's Emmanuelle is far better drawn, in both pictures and words, than most 'adult' comics. It's truer to the book than Sylvie Kristal's movie. It's enjoyable in many ways, but I can give it only a lukewarm recommendation. Lots of erotica out there is at least as satisfying - maybe this will work for you, but maybe not.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-01-03

That is a real shame, and I am very glad to have made or remade its acquaintance.<br /><br />This book calls out to be read to a small child. On the surface, the premise is just silly. A gentle dragon introduces himself to The Boy, the only name for our young central character, saying \\"Now don't you hit me!\\" The dragon is, in his own words, \\"a confoundedly lazy beggar.\\" The Boy becomes the dragon's friend and critic of the dragon's poetry.<br /><br />That means there's a real problem to solve when a dragon-slaying Saint George pulls into town. Everyone, the Boy included, wants to see a little excitement between the dragon and St. George. The saint is a reasonable man, however, and sees the merit in putting on a good show without really harming the friendly (if lazy) dragon. I'll let you enjoy the happy details for yourself, and I don't think I spoil the ending by saying that everyone ends up happy and well-fed.<br /><br />This is a brief, enjoyable story with a Winnie the Pooh pace and drawing-room manner. It's sweet, gentle, and delicately illustrated. I hope that a new generation of readers and readers-to-be discovers this one, and gets the same pleasure from it that I have.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-01-03

They remain friends as they grow up, and as she becomes the most beautiful of young women. They betroth themselves to each other with small gifts, and --<br /><br />And that's about the last point that makes any sense in a book for children. She is bought for marriage by a rich, gouty, and syphilitic guilder. Her one-time orphanage becomes a brothel under her harsh command. Her one-time beau becomes a hermit, living and dying in mortification of the flesh. On his final day a flea escapes the cloak she had given him. It starts the Black Death on its march across Europe, eventually collecting her in its grim parade. The end.<br /><br />Except for a few flowery turns of phrase, only Froud's illustration makes this book at all worthwhile. The story is too bleak for kids, but not subtle enough for adults. Four stars for Froud's illustration (good, but he's done lots that was better) and zero for the story. Two stars over-all, no matter how much I like Froud's drawings and apt references to Heironymus Bosch.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-01-03

Heany, a Nobel award winner, has brought this text his full skill as a translator, as a Celt, and as a poet above all. It flows, the meter is strong and expressive, and many readers can all approach it on their own levels. It's a story of heroism tried, tried again, and tried to the end of human endurance - but a few other stories show up in the interludes. There are jealousies and political intrigues, as well as personal bonds and honor. And, in a happy surprise, the Celtic tradition of metalworking is never far from the surface. However great the feat of arms, the arms themselves and the anonymous smiths always get their footnote.<br /><br />One fascinating feature of this book is that the original text, a modern typesetting of the old English, stands side by side with the modern text. This is a remarkable bit of honesty and academic rigor, almost as if a chef invited every diner to examine the kitchen in white-glove detail. I can't read the original, but I don't have to in order to get some of its value. I can pick out a word here and there - \\"gold\\" from \\"golde\\", or \\"mother\\" from \\"modor\\" - but even I can see more. I can just look the unknown words and see how the original alliterated and how the modern English does not. I don't value the modern rendering less for the loss, but I value the original more.<br /><br />A stereotype is due for update. \\"Beowulf\\" was once a trial by ordeal for English majors. That is no longer true. Heany makes it a vivid contemporary experience without losing sight of the people and times that brought it to life. Ever better, Tolkien fans will see where he drew so much of his inspiration, especially in naming his people. This story is not just good in itself, it's good in the ways that it underlies so many English stories that followed it.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-12-29

Maybe the book could be used as a coffee table by itself. Don't do it, though. You'll miss all the wonderful fun inside.<br /><br />The New Yorker cartoons have always been known for their urbane wit. Don't expect snooty subtlety in evey panel, though. James Thurber and Chas Addams appeared early on, and George Booth and Gahan Wilson appeared later, not to mention lots of others in the prat-fall and way-weird categories. Of course, Roz Chast's \\"90s neurotic\\", Edward Koren's fuzzy people, and Sidney Harris' in-jokes are all there, among the many other drawing styles you'll recognize.<br /><br />The book is organized by decade, from the 1920s to the early 2000s. I am fascinated by the changes of visual style, from 20s flappers to the people you see (and want to laugh at) every day. The topics drift, by decades, from the roaring 20s, through The Depression and WWII, past the Eisenhower doldrums, over the hippy 60s, into Reagonomics and out again, and up our current day. I don't know that anyone has ever based a history of America on its comics. If they ever did, however, they should start here.<br /><br />I admit, I haven't read all of the 68,000 or so comics on the DVD inserts. I'll allow myself years for that. Even the 650 pages of paper comics are daunting. Don't let that stop you. This is a rich experience, and one that will probably touch you at amny points, again and again. Let it.<br /><br />Visual literacy is part of literacy, and these cartoons are very literate.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-12-29

Jules Feiffer is best known for his long-running cartoons in The Village Voice. Once a week, he would target racism (both the people for and against), religion (ditto), bohemian artistry (ditto), or the tribulations of modern life. Or, as shown here, presidents and politics.<br /><br />This is a collection of his cartoons, spanning nearly 30 years. It's organized chronologically by president, an organization that itself carries information. From the complacency of the 50s, when \\"leisure\\" was a problem, through Viet Nam and most of the Cold War, up to Reagan's Movie America, this is almost a chronicle of American neuroses.<br /><br />His cartoons of kids may be the most pointed. In some (p.187, for example), Feiffer digs at parental callousness and irresponsibility. In others, the unfortunate little ones are shown contorting themselves into blatantly ridiculous patterns of adult reasoning. In others (e.g. both on p.63) the child seems to be the one sane point in a world where sanity is not an asset.<br /><br />These cartoons express ideas that are probably important to you. Maybe they echo your own beliefs, maybe they present the opposition - either way, they're important.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-12-22

Yes, he invented the geodesic dome and laid out the principles for some kinds of tensile structures. He was also a tireless inventor. He did not necessarily create something fundamentally new each time, but always sought out more value for the dollar and pound of resources, and always measured that value in quality of human life. Except for the dome, his developments are often paraded and quixotic oddities, stripped of Fuller's real intent. This brief book lays out his philosophy for human welfare in terms of national and trans-national economics.<br /><br />His thinking is clear and gentle - human happiness always comes first. It comes across in a whirwind of ideas, racing across the page faster than words can keep up. It's not rare to see a sentence start with economics and finish with stellar thermodynamics. You'll also sentences wildly stretched to hold just one of his ideas in complete form. Two consecutive sentences stretch from page 8 to 12! Even English words are too small to hold the atoms his ideas, so he creates the most startling hypenated word-collages. For example, in discussing how tools grew out of and extend the body, he writes:<br /><br />  \\"Nests and eggs are indeed tools, as is the womb -<br /><br />  an only-once-in-a-while, carried-within-mammalian,<br /><br />  new-life-production tool.\\"<br /><br />Social criticism, economics based in the physical world, tempered technological optimism, and a wonderful heart - they're all here, wrapped in a unique package of words. Whether or not you agree with his \\"economics of wealth\\", as opposed to \\"economics of scarcity,\\" it's a remarkable view of human society.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-12-21

The advice is clear and detailed: turning healthy pleasures into vices, prohibiting clear and rational thought, encouraging divisiveness over any issue or none at all, and lots more. It's a proven plan which, unfortunately, sometimes fails. Despite every distraction, excess, and false trail, some people still reach a higher plane.<br /><br />This wonderful book is written from a strongly Christian point of view. No, Lewis does not propose any literal reality for these allegorical demons, but he clearly points out the human weaknesses that so often expand and crowd out the valid and valuable parts of life. In fact, this book need not be taken from a Christian standpoint at all. Whatever morality and ideals you hold to, they are under the same kind of attack as Lewis' Christian virtues.<br /><br />This book is quite enjoyable in itself. It's even better as an introduction to Lewis' other work, especially his space trilogy (Perelandra, Out of the Silent Planet, That Hideous Strength). Those books play out the human strengths and weaknesses that Lewis isolates here.<br /><br />This really will help thinking readers take stock of themselves. I know it points out my room for improvement. I recommend this very highly.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-12-19

The Icelandic sagas are a unique historical resource, a written capture of European oral history, back when the stories were still fresh. As part of the oral tradition, they had to be memorable, but also to focus on the men and women important to the clan where the stories were told.<br /><br />This is really the story of Gudrun, a remarkable woman who successively married (and lost) four of the most influential men in the Lax river area. Iceland, around 1000 AD, was a male-dominated society, but with strong property rights and legal status for women. Many rose to positions of high influence and respect. This is hardly surprising, since they kept the household and lands working while men were out viking, or after the were killed in frequent vendettas. In fact the first few chapters talk about Unn and her supporters.<br /><br />The narrative is a bit choppy, and lacks in character development. In that, it's not much different from other sagas I've read, and better than some. The translators have done a good job of rendering the story into modern English. They also add explanatory text that I find quite helpful. Footnotes are informative but unobtrusive, and often cross-reference the story at hand to other sagas. End matter draws the family trees, very important for understanding where loyalties lie, and indexs the dramatis personae. That's especially helpful, for example, in sorting out which of five different Thorsteins is under discussion.<br /><br />The sagas are a wonderful complement to standard history. They describe history as seen by the people who made it. They put personal faces, meanings, and depth on dry facts, like \\"1000 AD: Iceland converts to Christianity.\\" And, as always, they show the personal intrigues, vengeances, and triumphs of the individuals.<br /><br />This saga, in particular, presents the complex, bloody, and dramatic events around a very powerful woman of the time.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-12-18

Somehow, every prospect in front of him is just another source of boredom. Then, a mysterious package arrives, a build-it-yourself tollbooth. The directions say, \\"... if not perfectly satisfied, your wasted time will be refunded.\\" Since driving his battery-powered car through the toolbooth doesn't seem much worse than anything else he can think of, he does --<br /><br />-- And ends up in a strange and wonderful land. His quest is to restore the princess sisters, Rhyme and Reason, to their countries. Getting there is the challenge. He is accompanied by a Watchdog, one who ticks and is guaranteed to be set to the right time. He meets outlandish characters of all sorts. That includes the ministers of Dictionopolis, the Mathemagician, demons, hoarders of sound, and lots of others. He is, of course successful in the end.<br /><br />His real success, after all these incredible adventures, is a regained interest in the world around him - a remarkable place, for anyone with the eyes to see. The moral of the story seems to be \\"Boredom is self-inflicted. Feel free to stop any time.\\"<br /><br />If you have an allergy to bad puns, you're likely to break out in hives within the first few pages. The book is sparsely illustrated, but in a style I like. Jules Feiffer's loose pen-drawings are as much a part of this book as Tenniel's engravings are part of \\"Alice in Wonderland.\\" Again, this may not suit all tastes, but should be fine for any kid old enough to read the book on their own.<br /><br />For some, this is a children's classic of the first order. I came to it later in life, so it lacks that sentimental specialness for me. Still, I like it for itself, and I hope that the gameboy generation likes it as much as my generation did.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-12-18

Lots of well-known type designers have done revivals of traditional fonts. Good designers spend immense amounts of time studying the originals before rendering them anew. The beginning designer hears all that but never quite hears: just what is it they study?<br /><br />This is a detailed examination of the printed texts of Aldus Manutius, one of the Renaissance founders of typography. Burnhill has gone back to the original sources, all there in black and white, to understand the thinking, the art, and the technology of those early printers. I was surprised that Burnhill pays a lot more attention to the white than the black - his main interest is in the spacing rather than the letterforms themselves.<br /><br />For me, the real surprise was in the technology. Eli Whitney is often credited with the development of standardized parts in a weapons contract around 1800. That completely ignores what was already common practice by European print shops 300 years earlier. Although shops differed, each one was built around an elaborately standardized set of movable type sorts, casting molds, matrices, punches, and frames for holding type to be printed. Measurements had to be precise, repeatable, and common across huge investments in tools and equipment. They also had to meet the esthetic requirements of the typographers and wealthy book-buyers, while making the most of expensive hand-made paper.<br /><br />This book will fascinate serious students of type or of western technology. One could ask for better printing - although nicely laid out, photographic reproductions are crude and barely adequate for illustrating they points they need to make. They are adequate, though, and keep the costs down in producing this low-volume academic treatise.<br /><br />The right reader will find this book immediately useful and endlessly fascinating. Others, I'm afraid, will treat it as an inexplicable curiousity. I hope you like it the way I do.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-12-18

As the editor points out in the intro, \\"nude\\" usually means \\"nude European female 20-ish, and probably thin.\\"<br /><br />This book does a lot better. Yes, the subjects are mostly or all nude, and yes they're all women. No, they are not all Anglo, as Phan, Sullivan, and Torcello show. No, they are not all young adults, as Murphy and Kander show. No, they are not all thin, as Glover, Casanave, and Perotte show.<br /><br />Yes, they are fully functioning women, as O'Sullivan and Fink show, with surprising tributes to physical motherhood. And yes, the female shape is a wonderful thing, simply as a shape, as Carnegie, Lategan, and others show - whatever it is they show.<br /><br />These pictures give much to think about. Saudek's \\"Ballerine\\" proves that age strikes different parts of a woman differently. Look at this portrait again, but not the face, to see what I mean - youth lasts a lot longer than you might think. Go back to Braham's Flower and allow yourself a giggle before you even see where the humor lies. Go all the way forward to Zeschin's contribution, and see why 'bigger is better' just isn't true. Not false, surely, but not true.<br /><br />The book is organized alphabetically by the working name (not necessarily the born name) of the photographer. In other words, it is utterly random with respect to dates, style, subject, technique, or any other aspect of the images themselves. This emphasizes the photos, the individual women, and the spectrum of womanhood. Still, it leaves me hanging in some intellectual sense - is there some underlying order that I've missed, or is it my job to impose my own order?<br /><br />I am passionate about women's beauty, as is the editor. Whatever you may have thought, this is a clearly non-erotic view of womanhood, in most cases. Being bare, even being fully sexually functional, are different from being erotic.<br /><br />-- wiredweird	2004-12-17

It's spread so far (into XSL, Xlink, XPointer and more), it has so many companion technologies (FO, CSS, X/HTML, SAX, DOM, etc), and the standards change so fast that it's hopeless to look for The One book.<br /><br />That said, this book is an effective guide and introduction for experienced programmers - beginners may find it a bit much, and may not like the lack of cut&paste code. This gives the clearest coverage I know of DTDs. It also covers XLinks, XPointers, XInclude, and the basics of schemas well enough to put those tools to use. You can try, at least: some of the standards (like XPointers) are so new and unstable that very few browsers support them.<br /><br />The discussion of CSS is a good start, but will work best in conjuction with a book solely about CSS. Most CSS books, however, talk only about HTML, so this helps bridge the gap to CSS/XML. There's a short section on XSL, probably too short for any real application writers - Kay's XSLT book will help a lot. There's also a short, informative section on XSL/FO. Harold may intend this more as a look into the future (FO isn't in browsers yet) and as a comparison to CSS than as a real programmer's guide. He finishes with a brief description of XHTML and SVG.<br /><br />Although the core of XML syntax has been stable for some years now, the larger sense of XML is a fast-changing and fast-growing family of interlocked standards. It's way too soon for the last word on the topic, and experts haven't settled on usage conventions. Some of us can't wait, though. We need XML help now, and this book does a good job delivering that help.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-12-13
425960:US	35004134	R1OWC2DOHSH90M	0684839814	758000303	The Illustrated Koka Shastra: Medieval Indian Writings on Love Based on the Kama Sutra	Books	4	10	10	N	Y	The Kama Sutra for a later generation	There are two parts to this book, very nearly independent of each other even when they share a page: the illustration, and the text of the Koka Shastra.<br /><br />Kokokka's medieval text is heavily based on the older Kama Sutra, but differs from it in important ways. The biggest is that it very nearly isolates the act of physical love from every other part of life, where the Kama Sutra treats it as one of the many ways for people to enjoy each other's company. Another is that this later text seems much more concerned with social proprieties and taboos than the Kama Sutra. Although both books seemed aimed at a male readership in male-dominated societies, both do pay attention to a woman's wants and physical satisfaction. The Koka Shastra, however, puts the woman in a more subservient role, \\"wholly subject to her husband and honor[ing] him with word, heart, and body, as a god.\\"<br /><br />The illustrations are very informative, but rarely have much to do with the text around them. They show a wide variety of couplings and love-play, in a wide variety of artistic styles. I was continually disappointed, however, by a near-total lack of information about them. When were they created? By whom and for what audience? What sources provided them? None of these questions are answered, and that detracts seriously from the book's value.<br /><br />Still, there's a lot to like in this book. The physical practices are interesting, whether or not each one is something that the reader might want to share in. The book's real value, however, comes from in its looks into the bedrooms and the thoughts of that distant time in India.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-12-12

Despite its amusing, basic style, there's a lot of good information here. It describes recessive genes, not just with Mendel's pea plants but with a bible story as well. It summarizes the history of reproduction, and of what people have known of reproduction.<br /><br />It goes on to modern molecular biology, DNA and the people who discovered it, and the mechanisms of DNA replication and protein synthesis. Gonick isn't afraid of complex ideas like introns - well-known now, but shockers when they were first discovered. The last sections cover gene regulation - why the cell does what, when - and recombination.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this book dates all the way back to 1991. That's the medieval era in the biotech world, and a lot has changed. For example, we now know that the human genome holds about 30,000 genes, not the 200,000 estimated when this book was written. It's a real shame that Gonick hasn't written a newer edition to clean up those few dated facts and to include more of what's been discovered since. The errors are generally minor, though, and don't detract seriously from this unique presentation.<br /><br />It's still the best light introduction around, humorous and serious at the same time. It's real science, so some of the terms might be a bit much for very young readers. Still, I recommend this to any interested adult and to any kid willing take it seriously and willing to listen when corrections have to be made.<br /><br />-- wiredweird	2004-12-11

It's cute, it's clever, it's thought provoking, and it gives decorative results. It just doesn't have the depth or breadth of Munari's \\"Tree,\\" for example.<br /><br />There are lots of good pieces here, some simple and some very subtle. The simple ideas are even simpler than a \\"potato print.\\" To make a potato print:cut the spud half, incise the exposed flat surface, press the flat side into ink, then press the inked shape onto paper. Here, you just cut the end off the veggie, ink, and stamp. The veg defines its own shape, unique per individual cabbage or radicchio, but similar within a species.<br /><br />What's cute is the simple stamping technique for creating many families of flower prints. What provokes thought is how the development of the species or individual creates such distinctive marks, and marks distinctive at such different levels. There is subtle biology at work here, made visible in the inked impression.<br /><br />What lacks, however, is the direction in which a child artist may grow. Munari's \\"Trees\\", for example, starts even more simply, but gives even more directions to explore. \\"Trees\\" leaves open doors for the visual artist, fractal mathematician, or intelligent child. Munari just didn't rise to his own standard in this book.<br /><br />This book is good, but Munari has done better. An art instructor may want this book, but amateurs like me can learn more elsewhere.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-12-11

These aren't the deepest thoughts on the business, craft, and engineering of software, but they cover a lot of important ground. Best, these aphorisms come from hard-won experience in many areas. I don't disagree with any of them, but I have to qualify my agreement in a few places.<br /><br />For example, #32: \\"It is nearly impossible to test software at the level of 100% of its logic paths.\\" I'd go farther and say it's usually dangerous even to try. If some pointy-haired manager decides that more coverage is better, programmers will dutifully optimize that metric. Error recovery is hard to test, so they'll edit out the error recovery. Integrity checks may be hard to trigger, so the integrity checks have to go. Trust me, this is not an improvement.<br /><br />Or #51: \\"Residual errors will always persist.\\" No argument there. \\"The goal should be to minimize or eliminate severe errors.\\" That's one good goal, but there are lots of systems where the goal should be to continue service in the presence of errors, via error recovery, some fail-soft state, or other means. Even perfect software may violate its contract in the presence of hardware errors: given a one-in-a-billion error rate and 3GHz clock, errors happen three times per second. Even at one-per-trllion, they happen every five minutes or so.<br /><br />Also, #46, a prioritized list of \\"-ilities\\" that define quality. Of course I disagree with his or any order. Heck, in one system I worked on, four different subsystems had four different lists. Reliability was paramount in one area - software failure would have to be repaired by unsoldering and replacing a chip. Other subsystems variously emphasized speed, compiled code size, and user-friendliness. In the bulk of the system, maintainability was at the top of the list (a fifth different priority list).<br /><br />Although I generally like the content and style, a few things might have strengthened the book. Glass' favorite author, based on citation counts, is Glass. He's good, but so are other authors. This book isn't really self-contained. Lots of discussions are cursory (and he sometimes points that out), requiring a lot more elaboration of his part or a lot of reference-chasing time on the reader's part, assuming the reader can find the references at all.<br /><br />Still, this is a welcome comment on the current state of affairs in software development. His one point - if there is only one - is that it's the same state we were in back in the 70s. Only the buzzwords have really changed. That point I agree with.<br /><br />//wiredweirdmight have strengthened the book. Glass' favorite author, based on citation counts, is Glass. He's good, but so are other authors.

It has elements of fantasy, history, and science fiction woven together. It's an eco-catastrophic world with clean, livable enclaves for the few. It has demons, heroes, and some who tried and failed. A lesser writer would have made those parts sound like a formula: \\"Attach Hero (a) to Villain (b), then connect the Mysterious Source of Vast Power (c).\\"<br /><br />The artwork is strong, but mostly not the kind I'll remember in a week. Well, there is that four-page foldout spread at the end. The rest is expressive, varied, and communicative, but greatness requires more.<br /><br />Other comics have a more thoughtful pace, but this at-a-run style works too. It switches often between scenes, times, and levels of awareness. This still leaves time for multiple reversals in the marriage of security chief to science chief, but the human relationships aren't very subtle or central to the story.<br /><br />Frank Miller is brilliant, and this proves it again. The style is very different from the choppy chiaroscuro of \\"Sin City\\", but works for this piece. I'll keep buying Miller's work.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-12-08

Chuang Tzu uses prosaic descriptions, but still described philosophical ideal rather than gritty facts. Lieh Tzu came later. He used prosaic words to describe prosaic, everyday scenes, and to find enlightenment in them.<br /><br />Many ring true for me. The \\"yellow mare\\" reminded me of a technician who was finely attuned to the circuits we used. He was always wrong in his diagnosis onf the problems he showed me. That never mattered. He was always right in pointing out that there was a problem, often based on small clues that I might have missed.<br /><br />Lieh discusses honesty and friendship, poverty and happiness, great riches and death. Still, the language is always modern and clear, and a good supplement to Chuang and Lao.<br /><br />My problem, though, is that this isn't a translation. It's Wong's interpretation. She says, early on, \\"Instead of a straight translation of the sematics of the text, I have decided to present the 'voice' of Lieh Tzu.\\" As much as I like Wong's text, it troubles me. Translation is never exact, but there are degrees of inexactness. I am concerned about how much Lieh's text has suffered.<br /><br />This is good anyway, and I'll probably come back to it eve if I find a more scholarly Lieh Tzu. This is readable and thought-provoking, no matter what it's authenticity.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-12-08

The first story, Shells, is a post-apocalypse. People defend themselves in full body armor at all times, even in making love. \\"Crevice\\" gives an odd echo to The Matrix, where an all-sustaining computer must itself be sustained by human company, but with a happy ending. \\"Olive\\" is another story, in a very different visual style, about a world governed by strange forces. After those disconnected short stories in the beginning, the Schuitens give us a longer tale. Men and women live in segregated societies, then rediscover each other. The result is ... well, you'll just have to read it.<br /><br />The artwork is skilled and subdued. Figures are carefully drawn. The stories move well, from one turn to the next, without big fights and other cliched tricks. There's occasional nudity - this is not a comic book for little kids. It's thoughtful and lyrical. It's also a DC venture. For years, DC was the stodgy comic house, sticking to their superheroes in capes. DC still sells Superman and that crowd, but also sells the Vertigo line and books like these. I'm glad to see that DC's range of offerings has matured to match their readership.<br /><br />\\"Hollow Grounds\\" doesn't blaze new trails in visual storytelling, but it's well drawn and well told.

Munari's tree is a simple thing: the letter Y, drawn again and again. Within that framework, though, there is endless variation. Munari encourages both personal creativity and a systematic exploration of the visual possibilities.<br /><br />This is a friendly approach to building basic drawing skills. Its second message is just as important, though: the image can be analyzed as well as enjoyed, and visual analysis gives choices. I really wish my early teachers had used more of Munari's wisdom in their teaching.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-12-05

When I come back to it, it's like learning XML all over again. That's why I like Megginson's book. It's clear, detailed and gives all the basics needed for competent, flexible data design.<br /><br />I said \\"data design,\\" not \\"document design\\" as some might have expected. Although XML grew out of SGML, a document markup system, it's used for lots more than just text formatting. That's why Megginson focusess so heavily on the DTD, the \\"data type definition\\" for any XML application. Any one document uses XML commands to organize a specific set of data, and the DTD specifies a well-formed organization. It's the grammar of the document, like a database's schema. It's what defines the principles used to organize the data. Best of all, Megginson describes DTDs in terms of five well-known and freely available DTDs.<br /><br />This book is old by internet standards, however. DTDs are being supplanted by XML schemas, which are not mentioned. Conversions between formats are now managed by XSLT most often, not \\"architectural forms.\\" The DocBook standard has moved to the Oasis consortium (oasis-open.org). The XML standards family has grown, but this book is locked to the time in which it was written.<br /><br />Even then, I had one real complaint about this book. Megginson took great care to distinguish XML from its SGML parent, giving detailed descriptions of SGML features not present in XML. It was sometimes confusing to read around the discussions of features that aren't there. If necessary at all, the information would have been better placed in footnotes, appendices, or some text typographically set off from the main discussion.<br /><br />I'll have to replace this book sooner or later, but I haven't found anything that discusses newer XML usages and still meets this standard of clarity. In the mean time, I can keep puttering along with this book - it's old, but hardly obsolete.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-12-04

If you need this book, you already know it. You barely remember what the Fourier transform does, let alone how it works, and you need to implement it from scratch. This book is for you.<br /><br />Most programmers never need to use Fourier transforms. Most of the ones who do will get by quite nicely on black boxes from Mathematica, Matlab, or Numerical Recipes. Data goes in, answers come out, and \\"a miracle occurs\\" somewhere in between. There are those times, however, when you can't use the canned routines. You just have to write your own.<br /><br />This book isn't for the faint-hearted, but really does give everything a non-specialist needs for creating a competent implementation. There's no cut&paste code here, but this is for people with unique needs. It presents a number of basic variations, with clear illustrations and pseudocode. It even discusses 2D transforms, but most of that discussion centers on how to transpose the 2D matrix between 1D transforms.<br /><br />The discussion of parallel implementation was the only section I found weak. It's aimed at standard sorts of multiprocessors, with specific kinds of connection networks between processors. First, those networks are rare in commercial multiprocessors or are so deeply embedded that the topology is not accessible to the application writer. Second, those networks and architectures miss a lot of important computing environments completely - including the ones important to me.<br /><br />I don't wish it on anyone, but it might happen - you might have to implement a FFT for yourself. If it does happen, this book may be your most effective tool. It will probably take the non-specialist (like me) time to get past some of the notation, but the answers here are worth the effort.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-12-04

Bland history makes great men look great. Bad history makes great men look bad. This makes a great man look great being a 'bad boy' - a tasty bit of irony and accuracy.<br /><br />Franklin was one of the first printers in the US - he was a material supporter of freedom of the press, and a severe critic of irresponsible press. He was a statesman and clown, when clowning made his point the best way. He was a politician, scientist, and bawd - how else to take in so much of the human condition?<br /><br />This collection captures some of the contradictions that comprised Benjamin Frnaklin. Maybe it takes some of the sheen off the gold star that history dumped on him, but it adds toughness and flexibility to the steel that he showed as diplomat. Satire is a voice, and this short book shows a few octaves of his.<br /><br />I have to admit that poor teachers put me quite off American history. Books like this get me reading history again. It shows Franklin the patriot and firebrand defending the mothers without husbands and deflating the learned academies of Europe. This is short but sweet, and even his choices of words show me a lot about how modern English is used.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-12-03

The sequence section covers all the basics: dynamic programming for string matching, scoring matrices, trees and classification, and profiles of various sorts. The sequence discussion is a bit shorter, but goes over substructures, similarity searching and scoring, and kinds of structures and domains. The third section is even shorter and unites the two areas: predicting structure from sequence, with a good introduction to threading.<br /><br />The book's strength is its breadth. It sacrifices depth to get that breadth, though. A few analytic techniques are sketched in the text or presented in psuedocode. Most often, however, a programmer will have a hard time gleaning enough detail from this to implement any of the algorithms described.<br /><br />The authors aim at readers who already understand the significance of protein structure and who are comfortable with ideas like hydrogen bonding. Lots of programmers will have a hard time understanding why problems are important or what the driving phenomena are. Biologists won't be put off by an excessively mathematical treatment, but won't get a detailed understanding of the algorithms or mathematical foundations either. This book comes close to under-serving both kinds of reader.<br /><br />This book is good for conceptual understanding of the algorithms, where implementable details don't matter, and gives good coverage to protein-specific issues. It's decidedly for someone who wants more than just the how-to of running BLAST or strucuture analysis tools. I think this book will help most if you want more understanding of what goes on inside the tools, or if you want an easy start to a deep and complex topic.

Harvey Kurtzman's geometric, brash figures walk through a noir murder mystery, narrated by the deceased. Richard Corben's piece opens the book, showing not a hero or has-been but a never-was, who screws up 65 million times over. P.

Maybe it's an interesting contrast to other modern translations, like Watson's, but that's not why this book stands out.<br /><br />The commentary by Kuo Hsiang (spelled Guo Xiang elsewhere) is what makes this book stand out. This is the only source I know that presents Kuo's commentary, or even part of it, directly in the Chaung Tzu text on which it comments. Those two things together give this book its real value: Kuo's own text, and its original context.<br /><br />Kuo Hsiang was a later Taoist author. Like any other commentator, he presented at least as many new ideas as discussions of old ones. He stressed an ever-changing holism, in which each part is necessary and gives rise to all other parts. Each part fills the role required of it, engenders whatever must come next, and passes away in its time.<br /><br />Kuo was also an educated man in a Confucian society, and seemingly tried to resolve relaxed, egalitarian Taoism with rigid, hierarchical Confucian thought. He calls on The Way to explain the priveleges proper to a prince and the subservience proper to lower people - if either stepped out of their assigned roles, it would threaten the functioning of the whole world. Fung goes even farther in his commentary on Kuo. Fung likens the natural forces of change to Marxist historical necessity, and cites passages justifying the state's existence as an accord with nature.<br /><br />This is the best presentation I know of the Kuso Hsiang commentary.

Some have a macabre side, but that is always used to make a point. Others seem to radiate quiet desperation. Still others comment on the compromises people make. Some do all of the above, and more.<br /><br />There's no text in these drawings, or almost none. The style is spare, even more than in \\"Where the Sidewalk Ends.\\" My only complaint, and this is a very quiet one, is that that most pages hold only one drawing, and that one is small. I'm used to a lot more density, but the open, airy pages do a good job of framing Silverstein's characters, or of echoing their isolation.<br /><br />One more thing - unlike the better-known Silverstein books, this one is decidedly not for the kids.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-11-27

In languages like Java or C++, subclass methods can over-ride superclass methods, and optionally dispatch to the superclass. In BETA, the \\"inner\\" form of dispatch means that the superclass always controls the caller's interface, and optionally dispatches to the subclass. That's very attractive when the superclass doesn't necessarily trust subclass over-rides to maintain important invariants. BETA also goes a big step beyond the getX/setX methods that commonly export attributes. In BETA, the same syntax is used for assignment to variables as for methods calls. You can't tell the difference, by looking at the caller, whether you're looking at a reference to an attribute or to an accessor method. Although odd in other respects, that's one case where the assignment/call unification can solve some problems. Constructs for parallel programming a strength, but exception handling is a weakness and the &lt;&lt;SLOT>> interface definitions go beyond just weak. Scoping for programming in the large is mostly in the writers' imaginations.<br /><br />The language uses peculiar syntax. The least of the problems is that the \\"left hand side\\" of an assignment is on the right, and that many syntactic markers rival C trigraphs for ugliness. The Danish authors generally use very good English, but often choose inexplicable terms (like \\"pattern\\") for familiar notions (like C++ \\"class\\"). As noted elsewhere, this is the only BETA book around, so there's really nothing to compare it to.<br /><br />I'm not aware of any current use of BETA, so this book is of historical interest only. It's instructive as a bad example in choosing syntax for a programming language, but also as a good example for some of its creative semantics. I look forward to seeing some of those good ideas enter the main stream.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-11-26

If you think illustration is a lesser thing than art, and commission a lesser thing than inspiration, you can just toddle along.<br /><br />Harrison presents a lot of variety. I don't get the sense that I see the same personal symbols reworked again and again; he really does seen to respond to the material at hand. Still, a few things recur in his images. One is a sense of landscapes and skyscapes that he openly attributes to Parrish, and does well. Another, that follows, is brilliant color: bright, but never too bright. A third thing, after a mixed relationship with figure, is a sense of scale. Maybe half of the images include some significant person, but shown only a half-inch tall on a picture printed at ten-inch height or more - a huge scene, a small person, but the person is the focus.<br /><br />A little more technical information would have been appreciated. What was the original height of the painting? What media? A little less of the commentary would probably have worked just as well, too. Harrison expresses himself very capably with his brush, but less so in words. A better book would have used more of his strength and less of his weakness.<br /><br />This is a welcome addition to any fantasy art collection. The colors are more vivid, and the broad landscapes less claustrophobic than other artists'. Mostly, though, it's jsut fun to see worlds that never were, rendered with such skill.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-11-24

First, it is Beardsley's earliest commission, illustrations for Malory's classic. For that reason alone, it will interest fans of Beardsley's drawings.<br /><br />Second, and what really fascinates me, is that Beardsley developed his drawing style visibly over the course of the 580+ works in this project. When I look at the drawings for the first few chapters, they seem harsh and angular (p.22 for example). In other samples (e.g. p.18-19), Beardsley uses textures to generate tonal effects. By the end of the book, his drawings are much closer to his more familiar style. The lines are more graceful, and there is less use of the middle tones - broad solid blacks and whites dominate.<br /><br />This is certainly a book for the Beardsley fan. It is also a distinctive example for anyone unsure of what \\"an artist's development\\" refers to.<br /><br />Just a small warning, though - this contains only fragments of the Malory text, and many of the drawings do not appear with the printing that defined their original context. This is about Beardsley's drawings, not about the book in which they appeared.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-11-24

This book is divided into a few sections describing the man and his work. The first is a longish essay on type, computers, education, and whatever else came to mind. It ends with \\"A code of conduct,\\" guidelines for ethical practice, mostly applicable to anyone in any creative pursuit. There's a brief glossary, possibly too brief to answer more than cursory questions.<br /><br />I very much like the next section. It's more or less of a Smeijers specimen book and portfolio. Each font is demonstrated in a full piece of readable text, not just quick brown foxes. That really gives me the feel of the font, as I would experience it in normal reading - something I wish I could see more often. Best, the text chosen is a brief essay written by Christopher Plantin in the 17th century, material of interest in itself. Next, there's an annotated gallery a few pages long, academic and commerical work, and the book ends with a brief time-line of Smeijers' career.<br /><br />Still, I was looking for something that would teach me more about type, letters, typography, or other aspects of design. Instead, the book teaches me about Smeijers. Thus, my disappointment in the book and a rating lower than another reader might give.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-11-21

It all comes together on this book.<br /><br />Bell's art is about hot animal power, embodied in a human frame. Most of the subjects in this book are women, often Bell's sisters. She draws them with real love for a woman's figure, and with gut-deep understanding of how the female version of the human machine works. A few of the male figures are patterned after he husband, Boris Vallejo, and his schwartzeneggerian build. The only figures that don't project raw power are modeled after her sons - somewhere around ten in these pictures, and much too young for the rippling sinews.<br /><br />If you like fantasy art, you are sure to like Bell's work. There are some science fiction and comic-book themes here, but I think the best work is in the sword and sorcery genre.<br /><br />One final note: the female figures she draws are all young, beautiful, and powerful, like Bell herself. That is not the only way for a person to look good, though. Older figures have their own attractions, and Bell will have an older figure soon enough. I hope her artwork branches out when that happens  - the possibilities are very exciting.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-11-21

As a commercial artist, however, he had to fulfill a lot of commissions that couldn't afford color printing.<br /><br />This book collects his work in black and white. Many of the pieces show the peaceful scenes familiar from his color work. Others, like his book illustrations for Kenneth Grahame, show whimsical, cartoony exaggerations. He seems to have taken special delight in gentle lampoons of people who took themselves just a bit too seriously. We also see foreshadowings of his later color landscapes in some drawings for \\"The Great Southwest.\\"<br /><br />There's a kind of sameness about many of the drawings. Part of that is the famous Parrish style. Part, however, comes from limits of the lithographic process used in creating images for reproduction. The litho stone constrains the kinds of marks possible. That sameness never becomes monotony, though.<br /><br />This is a lovely book, and an effective complement to other books showing his color work. It starts with a brief commentary. After that, there is nothing but the pictures themselves. I like that - I like the feeling of being alone with the artist, or at least with the art.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-11-21

Despite its subtitle, it's not a history in the sense that modern reader might expect. Instead, it's more a series of vignettes or anecdotes, strung together in more-or-less chronological order.<br /><br />Like other sagas, this was put in current form and written down by an Icelander. Until then, the stories had been part of the oral tradition. Small surprise, then, that events of minor interest were dropped and other events dressed up after the fact - despite the book's historical value, it can't always be taken at face value.<br /><br />This is quite unlike Icelandic sagas in many ways. First, is that Norse paganism was largely supplanted by Christianity. Bishops appeared in positions of power, and pilgrimages to Rome were part of the tale. St. Magnus gets more attention than just about any of the other Earls, even the later ones whose stories had less time to fade.<br /><br />The difference that struck me most was that, compared to the Icelanders, this was a very violent crowd. They lacked the realtive peace of Icelanders' democratic rule of law and system of courts. Instead, more depended on the authority of kings or of the best-armed thug in the region, not always a clear distinction. Many of the characters, Svein Asleifarson in particular, seemed to rely on twice-annual plundering as their major source of income. Those trips get generally minor attention, as if the vikings were shearing sheep or harvesting grain, instead of reaping plundered loot and human life. I know that peaceful times don't make history, so the stories that are kept always present a skewed view. Still, this sounds like a very different culture.<br /><br />There's no real plot or character development, and names come and go at a dizzying rate. The translator has provided a glossary of personal names at the end, and that helps keep track of all the players. Still, it's a somewhat dry book by the usual standards of recreational readers.<br /><br />Anyone interested in medieval Europe, Scotland or Norse culture in particular, will find a lot to like here. It's not the most exciting of the sagas, but gives a remarkable look at a powerful influence on English history.<br /><br />//wiredweirdsual standards of recreational readers.

This book gave me the introduction I wanted.<br /><br />It starts with a brief discussion the basics: illumination, scanning, and rejecting out-of-plane light. The next chapter describes a bit more about the pieces that go into the instrument and a little about the optical theory. That chapter is nowhere near what an instrument designer would need to know. It does, however, give a user enough information to use the tool effectively. The next sections discuss fluorescence, including the problems that arise when handling long and short wavelengths at through the same optics, and a little about specimen prepration using nanoparticles. The final sections briefly discuss applications and possibilities for the future of confocal microscopy.<br /><br />The authors do not have much to say about specific protocols for specific applications - the level is more general and centered more on the microscope itself.

All those different people - fishermen, sailors, weavers, surgeons, and shipping clerks - all of them had their own needs and only strings to meet those needs with. They did their jobs, and did them well, using the techniques remembered in this book. What's more, mathematicians use this book as a fundamental reference. Just about any twist in space was named here, so Ashley has become the catalog.

His drypoint prints look like they were made by a man enraged, or more likely Spanish. These are some of his linocuts, obviously made by the same hand.<br /><br />First, please, don't dismiss block prints as kids' stuff. It's wonderful that the medium presents such a low technical barrier that it's accessible to many makers. That doesn't matter. A great artist can make better art with a charred stick than you or I can with a full studio. And he did.<br /><br />Some are white-line prints (\\"Painter and his Model\\"), some are black-line (page 133), and some (\\"Dancers and a Musician\\") are both. Many use multiple blocks (\\"Small Bacchanalia\\"), others (\\"Bulls in Vallauris\\") are single blocks or (\\"Family Scene\\") reduction prints a.k.a 'suicide' prints. Some are delicate (\\"Head of a Boy\\"), but most are bold.<br /><br />This is an amazing collection, with ten unique pages at the end. Clay impressions were taken from some of those blocks. They captured the individual tools marks in the original linocut, and showed just how his hand pulled each line from the lino surface. If you've ever made a block print, you will feel in your hand how Picasso created the image - an experience beyond words.<br /><br />I'm not the one to fault the master, but I have to ask: what was his artistic reason for not sharpening his tools? Again and again (images #110, 118, 82, and others), the linocuts show a jagged line where his gouge tore the surface. I know that linoleum blocks are fragile and break with use (#82 again), but the ragged edge was not necessary. Or was it?<br /><br />Anyway, it's a wonderful book. The color is good, the prints are incredible, technical information is adequate, and the commentary sinks out of sight. This book mostly just leaves you by yourself, with the beautiful prints.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-11-18

This book is about processing large volumes of data in ways that let simple descriptions emerge.<br /><br />This is an introductory level book, aimed at someone with reasonably good programming skills. A little facility with statistics might help, but certainly isn't necessary. The book starts gently, with some very basic questions: what is data mining exactly, when there seem to be so many definitions for the term? What is a data warehouse, and how does it differ from a database? Next, the authors address the data itself in terms of quality, usability, and organization for efficient access. The central chapters, 4 thhrough 8, address various kinds of query specification, kinds of relationships to extract, correlations, clustering, and classification. None of the discussions is especially deep. All, however, are presented in pseudocode or simple math that can easily be translated into working code. The careful reader learns a few basic principles that work well in many contexts: entropy maximization, Bayesian analysis, and simple stats. It may be surprising to see how little of normal statistical analysis is used. I suspect the authors assume that stats-savvy readers will already know how to apply significance testing, and that stats-naive readers don't need the distraction. The last chapters discuss complex data, where the best structure for the data and the questions to be asked of it are not at all obvious, and tools and applications used in data mining.<br /><br />The book is nicely laid out as a textbook, with an orderly summary, problem set, and bibliography at the end of each chapter. The bibliography is more than just a list of names and authors - it actually helps the reader decide which references will give the best description of each of the chapter's topics.<br /><br />This is a clear, usable introduction to data mining: the data it uses, the questions it answers, and the techniques for connecting them.

A theocratic totalitarian regime takes over the US in a fast, well-planned strike. Overnight, women lose the right to own property. They become property, their worth measured by their reproductive ability. If they fail as baby-making slaves to the inner circle of male domination, they become forced-labor slaves in the worst of environments. The regime reverts to public executions as entertainment, and to a corrupt core inside its iron fist.<br /><br />What's truly chilling is how close the details are to contemprary American politics. The regime bans birth control (except for \\"entertainment\\" slaves) and requires every pregnancy to come to term. No matter how severe the accident of nature, the baby must be born, post-natal infanticide being the replacement for abortion. Believers in any faith but the state faith are first banned, then hunted down. Much too much of this sounds like the ideal world for America's Christian fundamentalists - one faith, one morality, rights for only the few they select, all enforced at gunpoint. It's just too close to be funny.<br /><br />The book's postscript shows optimism. In it, some far-future conference on sociology analyzes the book and its era as ancient history, long after the regime's collapse. The narrator escaped and lived long enough to create the book's content, and the regime collapsed of its own internal distrust.<br /><br />This is a worthwhile, thought-provoking piece of fiction.  Let's just hope that it really is fiction, not prophecy.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-11-12

Those references may show which HTML elements allow STYLE values, but not what values have meaning for that element. They may show what JavaScript methods and properties exist, but not which HTML elements support which ones, and so on. Details like which particular properties apply to which particular elements in which versions of Internet Explorer are critical to complex web sites, but generally hard to find - unless you look here.<br /><br />This book is the missing link. The subtitle really says it best: \\"A complete cross-reference to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\\" This supplements the references you already have, it doesn't supplant them. You'll still need other books for the how and why of each topic, and beginners may not even understand the problem that's being solved here.<br /><br />I have very few complaints about the content. One is that it's not very explicit about versions of the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript standards that define each feature. Another is that it discusses Internet Explorer and Netscape, but disregards other browsers. And, as expected in a new title of this size, there are a few formatting glitches and typos. None of those problems interfere much with the book's value. A web reference to its many brief examples would have been helpful, too, but seems to be missing.<br /><br />This isn't a tutorial. There are no \\"coolness\\" tips or slick demos. This is for people with plenty of coolness of their own, but lots of hard problems to solve in bringing it to life. Perhaps you've already got a stack of web development manuals, but an ongoing \\"The answer is in there SOMEWHERE\\" frustration.

He followed a common usage in rigidly decorous Confucian society. Phrasing anything as a new idea would have been an unforgivable snub to the classic masters, but commentaries on the classics honored them properly. This book is phrased as a commentary on the Zhuangzi (Chuang Tzu), but the commentary really says more about Guo's thinking than about Zhuangzi's.<br /><br />Unlike earlier Taoist authors, Guo was firmly a part of a strict, hierarchical, Confucian society. That gives much of his writing an odd cast. Earlier Taoists seemed quite egalitarian, rating the high or low according to their wisdom in The Way. Guo, among other things, reinforces the status quo by saying it is The Way for some to have much and others to have little - it would be improper to take from the former or to give to the latter. Social rank seems like a force of nature, on a par with gravity.<br /><br />Guo said lots more, too, but I found it hard to get Guo's words from this book. This is overwhelmingly a philosophical commentary on the text of Guo, not a presentation of that text. As a result, Guo's own words are taken selectively, with little concern for their original order or context. That selectivity supported the modern commmentator's theses well. It will disappoint readers who, like me, mostly want a translation of the original text.

This book collects seven of the Icelandic classics into about a hundred pages, plus some historical commentary by the translator.<br /><br />Iceland around 1000 AD was a remarkable place. It was a rough, Norse culture, but had an effective democracy and system of courts. Many sagas, including most of these, are dramatic stories of pride and revenge. That still leaves room for courtroom manueverings (as in the Ale-Hood story), for protection by powerful lords (as in Hreidar the Fool), and for several kinds of uneasy peace (as in Halldor Snorrason).<br /><br />Hrafnkel's Saga is by far the longest in the collection, and the widest ranging. Fortunes are made, upset, and reversed again. Revenge is hot and bitter. It's almost a soap opera, with tales of adventure mixed in. That's probably why these stories have lasted through all those centuries when story-telling was the form for recalling history and for passing the long Nordic winters.<br /><br />The translations are smooth and readable, and the stories are exciting. This is a brief, enjoyable, and thought-provoking read. It's also an enjoyable introduction to this wonderful tradition of stories.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-11-06

About half of the illustrations fall into the pinup category or a bit beyond, where the leather and chains live. About half depict exchanges of physical affection between women, often with a vampire theme mixed in. Nice stuff, certainly not for the kiddies, but never crude enough to be called hard-core.<br /><br />Renderings vary in style, something I like. There are quite a few drawings in pencil, finished to varying degrees. There are some distinctive pen and ink drawings, sharp contrasts with several steps of gray in between. Most illustrations are labelled as oil paintings, with an airbrushed look I don't often see in oils. The skin surfaces all seem to glow rather than catch light from any specific angle, a feature that doesn't always work for me. A short section a the back shows his working technique, including the photos and models he works from.<br /><br />It's an interesting and competent collection, but I just didn't develop a strong reponse to it. The vampire, goth, and pinup themes aren't in the center of my tastes. The scenes of women coupling are generally quite enjoyable, but wouldn't be the star of any collection.<br /><br />There's no 3.5 star rating - a cut above the ordinary - so I rounded up to four stars.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-11-06

In Confucian China, this was a radical and subversive notion. It undermined the traditional notions of filial piety, even social hierarchy, since it eliminated the special status of one's own parents in the web of personal relationships.<br /><br />He compounded the breach of filial piety by insisting on small, inexpensive funerals and brief mourning periods, also in the name of universal love. Mo Tzu believed completely in the spirits of the dead and in honoring them properly. He believed even more strongly in supporting \\"the people,\\" usually meaning the farming classes. Confucian funeral garb, coffins, and rituals inflicted staggering costs, and harsh mourning practices literally endangered the mourner's health. Mo's utilitarian philosophy required that wealth be used to meet the needs of the living, since the dead could not use it. Utilitarianism also argued that mourners should return to normal, productive life as soon as possible, without risking the strength needed for their livelihood.<br /><br />Most surprisingly, Mo Tzu's universal love justified the militia composed of his followers. Mo Tzu held that the small and weak were of equal standing with the large and strong, and that bullying (or invading) of the weak was unjust. He backed his notion of justice with arms, coming to the defense to small states when unjustly attacked by the larger.<br /><br />Historically, Mo taught after Confucius (who is treated to special excoration in Mo's text) but before Mencius (who in turn attacks Mo). Mo appears to have been well known down to the current time, even if his actual influence on Chinese history was minor. I wonder, though - his drab utilitarian outlook may eventually have been informed Maoist policy.<br /><br />This is a brief and enjoyable addition to any set of Eastern classics. It's divergence from the main stream of Chinese philospohical history makes it especially interesting, since it provides contrast to the better-known thinkers.<br /><br />Perhaps Mo Tzu isn't for every reader, but the serious student is sure to enjoy it.<br /><br />//wiredweird<br /><br />PS: This appears to be the same material as Watson's \\"Mozi\\" (ISBN 0231130015).

It's written in a much less poetic style, but I find Chuang Tzu more readable for that reason. The style is more conversational, and well rendered into contemporary English by Burton Watson.<br /><br />These inner chapters contain only the core of a much longer work. Over the 2200 years since its writing, many accretions had crept into the work, including commentaries and addenda by other authors. Watson strips those away and leaves only the central and most vivid writings. Some of those may already be familiar to today's reader. For example, this book originates the man dreaming to be a butterfly dreaming to be a man. Chuang Tzu offers many more of these anecdotes, too long to be analogies but too short for fables. He also calls on the history and mythology of his time - not always distinct from each other - and creates mythology of his own, whether he meant to or not.<br /><br />That mythology lived on in Chinese alchemy, when Chuang Tzu's magical sages were taken as literal beings. Chuang Tzu lived on, too, in Taoism's eventual alignment with Buddhism. His cryptic, non sequitur style of answer seems to foreshadow the koans of the distinctly Chinese and Japanese schools of Buddhism.<br /><br />This is a wonderful complement to the Lao Tzu. If that book is the art of enlightenment, then this is more like the practical craft. I recommend it highly to any student of eastern classics.<br /><br />I must add that Chuang Tzu is an older romanization of \\"Zhuangzi\\" - different renderings of one name. It is easy to become confused and think that the two were different writers. It is especially confusing since Watson published this same material many years later under the \\"Zhuangzi\\" spelling (ISBN 0231129599). While I have the highest respect Burton's scholarship, I think that this difference-without-a-difference should be made more explicit.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-11-04
467436:US	35004134	R2KQGKGIDGNDM7	0231086091	484182279	Han Fei Tzu: Basic Writings	Books	5	14	14	N	N	A chilling classic	Han Fei's \\"Legalist\\" writings on government may be the most brutal and amoral in China's long written history. I can't even call it vicious - his grasping, avaricious view of human nature displays the same bizarre innocence as a snake crushing a rat.<br /><br />The Legalist school built itself around laws or duties that defined every part of life. Enforcement was rigid, both in punishment and in reward. This, oddly, was where the Legalists diverged from the duty-bound Confucians. Han Fei stopped short of openly criticizing Confucius, but would have reversed every Confucian decision based on compassion or familial bonds. (Han Fei's \\"everyone vs. the world\\" view accepted even wives, parents, and children as potential enemies.)<br /><br />Although Legalist punishments were permanent and severe - mutilation or death - rewards were intentionally small. No farmer should ever have a reward that let him stop farming, no under-lord should ever have wealth that could support his own power base. A happy populace was important to Han Fei's government, but only because a satisfied peasantry was harder to stir to revolt. Han Fei also argued against a large educated class. That argument helped me understand (but not justify) purges in more recent history.<br /><br />There is a lot more to say about this book, but I have to rein myself in. However repulsive I find Han Fei's philosophy, though, this book has given me plenty to think about. It's a slim book, Burton Watson's extracts from Han Fei's ouvre, but well chosen. Also, it is another sample of Watson's outstanding translations. I've read a number of Watson's works, and I find his translations uniformly well written. His scholarship appears impeccable, and he has done the English language a wonderful service by making these classics available.<br /><br />I have to recommend this book to anyone who's read Macchiavelli. I don't expect any sane person with a trace of compassion to follow this way. I do hope that readers will let Han Fei teach them the signs of tyrrany. I take this book as a warning light that has shined for over 2000 years, and still illuminates current dangers.<br /><br />//wiredweird<br /><br />PS: This material appears to be repeated in Watson's \\"Han Feizi\\" (ISBN 0231129696).

It's aimed at tween-age readers or maybe a bit younger, so almost all of the major characters are themselves young. It offers adventure, a quest along an interesting trail in search of the star of Silverlance. There is variety in the story; this story is complete by itself but leaves room to be extended in future volumes. And, perhaps best of all, it addresses a younger reader with respect - the vocabulary and grammar haven't been dumbed-down for the post-literate world.<br /><br />A few things could have made this a stronger story, though. Yes, there's often a tension between what a youth wants to do and what the parents allow. That was about the only force driving the plot in the first two-thirds of the book, though. New characters seemed to arrive at a every chapter. That doesn't have to be a problem, but I had trouble distinguishing their personalities, and more could have been made of the uniqueness of each kind of people. The quest for the star and for the Silverlance created the nominal plot, but very little reason was given for why it might lead some people and not others. Just a few too many facts and people seemed to pop up out of nowhere, for little visible reason.<br /><br />I also gave this book three stars. It earned some for being so much better than my unfortunate experience of Lemony Snicket, and earned more for my hope that Crowell's writing and characters will just get stronger with practice. Four stars over all.<br /><br />//wiredweird, reviewing a complimentary copy<br /><br />Addendum: I shared my copy with a reader more directly in the target audience, aged nine but he reads \\"older\\".

This book is almost a catalog of every printmaking process around. It covers all the basics: intaglio, relief, screen prints, litho, and monoprint. It covers related technique, including embossed \\"dimensional\\" prints (aka \\"blind\\" prints), molded paper, and more. It devotes special attention to collographs, prints from textured or collage surface, and much too much more to describe.<br /><br />Best, the tools, materials, and how-to of every process are described in a fair bit of detail. Because so many processes are listed, each one gets just a short section, nowhere near what a printmaker would need in practice. Still, the descriptions serve at least two purposes. First, they may entice an artist into learning more about a process.<br /><br />Second, and more importantly for me, is that you don't have to be a printmaker to read this book and benefit from it. I'm a fan of fine prints, even though I don't make prints myself. I like to know what I'm looking at. I like to see a mark in a print and understand where it came from, how the artist's hand created it. By explaining each process, this book helps me understand the result of the process, and understand its effect on the finished product. Not everyone sees art that way, but it makes me feel somehow closer to the creator.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone who loves fine prints. Perhaps it's helpful to the printmaker looking for new techniques to try. It is certainly useful for the viewer, in understanding how the artist makes a vision come alive on paper.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-10-31

Rembrandt didn't invent etching, but he very nearly reinvented it. He did more with mixed processes, especially drypoint and etching, than anyone before him. He was also among the first to use etching as a drawing medium, giving it a freedom it had never had before.<br /><br />One distinctive feature of this book is that each print is reproduced full size. That gives the viewer unique insight into each work - was it small enough to fit the hand, or so big it had to be worked on a bench or table? Just how fine was that texture of lines? Even the biggest prints are presented full size, in a set of oversized sheets that come with the book.<br /><br />Probably hundreds of authors have written about Rembrandt's art, especially his drawing and etchings. I don't have much to add except what I personally have learned from his work. As well as light and dark, Rembrandt modulates a picture in levels of detail. Look at B76, for example, \\"Christ presented to the people.\\" The central figures have expression and nuance. Outliers, like those towards lower left are barely sketched in. It's a fascinating way for the artist to guide the viewer's attention.<br /><br />One author (I forget who) was asked to name the finest printmaker of all time. He started by eliminating Rembrandt, on the grounds that this master went so far past any mortal skill that he was outside of merely human history. This book shows just where that claim came from.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-10-31

Every page has at least one full-color reproduction of, well, reproduction or something related. The colors and printing are good. The author has also presented some notes of cultural explanation, and a few bawdy stories. The pictures don't seem to be hand-picked for their aptness to the story they embellish, but keep up the enjoyable mood of the book.<br /><br />For all that, I found parts of this book disappointing. None of the pictures is labelled with artist or even era. I can't hunt down more of the work that I liked, or see if stylistic similarities point to some artist or time. Also, some of the pictures are quite small, as if the shunga itself was of secondary interest to the text. The stories, too, are cut loose from attribution - the author could have made them up for all I know. That's not a possibility I take seriously, but it was disappointing to lose all trace of historical context for the stories, too. For some odd reason, the last section of the book is quite unrelated to shunga. It's nice material, from lady Murasaki's diary, and nicely illustrated. It's just not shunga, though - remember what this book was called?<br /><br />The pictures are enjoyable, and show some variety in practices and poses. I was hoping for more, though, more information about the images and their creators, and more about the history shown. As much as I like the pictures, I'm still looking for real information about these lovely prints, the people who made them, and the times in which they arose.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-10-31

Bitesnich uses that material in improbable sculptural ways - Ingrid (the cover model), Zuzana, and Bernhard make me stop for just a moment, wondering what I'm looking at. Kika makes me stop, too.<br /><br />This is an enjoyable, thought-provoking collection of figures. They're all young, strong adults, at the height of their handsomeness. They are beautiful people, but skip over the possibilities of older forms. Perhaps the next collection will show more of the different ages of man, but this is a good set anyway.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-10-31

There's a lot of good material here, and in very usable form. In fact, that's the whole focus of the book: practical, efficient implementations.<br /><br />The main topics, chapter by chapter, are simple matching of one desired word to a string, matching of multiple words, two levels of complexity in wildcards and regular expressions, and approximate matching. A number of important and historical algorithms are discussed in each chapter, in great detail. There's pseudo-code for the most important algorithms. Quite a few also have examples worked in detail. The mechanics are tedious and somewhat bulky, but anyone actually trying to implement these techniques will appreciate the examples.<br /><br />What's really interesting is what's not in this book. You won't find a lot of theory, and you won't find some of the most famous algorithms in string matching. The authors make it clear that this is about practical algorithms with efficient implementations. Lots of the algorithms beloved by theoreticians are impractically complex or just plain slow. Those may be mentioned in passing or as the base for more practical algorithms, but are not welcome on these pages.<br /><br />It's not an easy read, but it's not a book for people with easy problems. It discusses tradeoffs, like when one technique works well for short strings but another works better on long strings. It addresses the different needs of English-language processing and bioinformatics - just the different numbers of letters in each alphabet make a difference, in some cases.<br /><br />This is a good one for anyone who takes string processing seriously. There's no cut&paste code here, but plenty for a knowledgable programmer to use. Even better, it offers references to the literature and to working code, and pointers to some books on related topics. I expect to get a lot of use out of this one.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-10-30

All of them have the same format: full-height, standing figure on a shadowless, blank background. Diffuse lighting and tricks with exposure settings hide the modeling of each woman's figure, leaving almost an impression of a line drawing. Even the most solid of the bodies shown seem ghostly, as if the woman could vanish at any moment.<br /><br />There are one-trick photo collections out there, the kind where every print is solarized or where every model is body-painted. This book is like that - the difference is that I enjoy this trick. The models are generally quite similar, women with light skin tones and slender figures. It would have enriched the collection to see a wider variety of light and dark in the subjects and matching backgrounds, and a wider variety of figures. Still, the models selected really are quite lovely.<br /><br />The book itself is a distinctive artifact. The pages (at least in the edition I have) are fan-folded into the binding, and a place-marking ribbon is attached. The usual front matter actually appears in the back, so the reader starts almost immediately with the photos. I like the unusual binding, but it is a bit much. Something less ostentatious would have worked as well, and made the book more affordable.<br /><br />I find this collection very appealing - as soon as I saw it, I was hooked. It won't match every taste, however. There are lots of other ways to see figure than this one. It worked for me, though.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-10-30

Reading it is a little like sitting down with an oldfashioned master craftsman. I mean the kind who shows you, step by step, how he plies his trade, and offers a cantankerous side-commentary of opinion on just about everything while he does it. The commentary on p.283, for example, describes a very questionable programming trick that he pulled, and why, and why this one violation of normal practice is acceptable in this one case. In other words, it's real - a little gritty, not like didactically pure textbook examples. It's what real programmers really do.<br /><br />The book is basically a commentary on the Gang of Four. It's certainly not the first, but it has a unique format. He demonstrates all 23 of the GoF patterns by applying them to two modest-sized Java applications. This is great for people who need concrete code to see what the pattern really means. It's even better because it shows multiple patterns overlapping, where one application class has different duties in the different classes. A large part of the book's bulk is code listings for the applications - some classes exceed 1000 lines of source code. I normally consider that to be a waste of paper. This time, however, the code is complex enough that it really does need to be presented right next to the commentary. (The code is also available electronically at holub.com .)<br /><br />Towards the end of the book, he says \\"So, that's all of the Gang of Four  design patterns, all tangled together in the two programs ... the way the patterns appear in the real world ...\\" That tang of realism is what gives this book such an unfamiliar format, and gives such contrast to the standard, one-at-a-time reductionist descriptions of each pattern in isolation. I'm not saying this holist approach is better; a beginner will just get lost in the whirl. Holub's holism isn't worse, either, it's a complement to the microscopic, academic presentations seen elsewhere. This book plus the analytic pattern catalogs form a sum much more valuable than the parts.<br /><br />I recommend this very highly. The successful reader already is already quite familiar with Java and with design patterns. That reader is ready to take the next step, from the theory of patterns into their practical application. Seasoned pros may not get much form this book.

Solutions to small problems rarely scale well - the big solution often has to be different in kind from the small one. This book is about solutions to big problems, the kind that may involve hundreds of servers and thousands of clients, or more.<br /><br />This gives a clear, thorough description of about 15 design patterns that work well large, performance-sensitive applications. Some (like \\"Scoped Locking\\") depend on the specific semantics of C++, but may work in Java or C# if used carefully. Others are highly specialized implementations of more general patterns. The \\"Leader/Followers\\" pattern, for example, is a one implementation of the \\"Object Pool\\" pattern (see Grand, 'Patterns in Java', 1998) used for a particular purpose. On the whole, the authors did a fair job of relating these patterns to others in the literature. I was only occasionally frustrated that I did not have that literature at hand when reading this.<br /><br />The authors go into extreme detail in describing implementations based on each pattern, something sure to help some readers. There is often a C++ implementation as well, at least in skeletal form. The descriptions go on at great length, averaging almost thirty pages of discussion for each pattern. More isn't necessarily better, though, and some descriptions would have benefitted from a slimming program. I would also have been grateful for more differential discussion - comparing patterns, in terms of the specific decision critieria that argue for one pattern vs. another.<br /><br />The back matter in this book takes about 100 pages - glossary, bibliography, and indices by pattern, topic, and author names. Very helpful stuff. If it's going to be that long, however, a sentence or two about the more important references would have added little bulk but lots of value to the bibliography.<br /><br />The book is a good one, giving lots of practical information about the patterns it discusses. It's aimed at an experiecned reader, someone already conversant with OO programming, patterns, and at least a taste of problems bigger than classroom exercises or solo projects. A bit less mass chosen a bit more carefully would have improved this book, but it's still a worthwhile addition to my technical library.<br /><br />//wiredweirdiscusses.

Bioinformatics is maturing, and this book is that welcome.<br /><br />It's written as a textbook for a Bioinformatics 101 course, the kind that has both computing and biology students in it. Historically, the two have lived in uneasy truce. The biologists thought that a 'database' was an enzyme that acted on 'datab'. The programmers would, in the authors' words, \\"spontaneously abort\\" at the chemistry and informality of biology. Maybe that's less true now, but the authors offer just enough computing basics for the biologists and just enough biology for the computer crowd to be able to discuss the same thing.<br /><br />After that intro, the authors cover many of the classic problems in bioinformatics, including assembly, motif-finding, clustering, HMMs, dynamic programming, and even mass spec analysis. The style is very readable, and discusses both the biology and the computation of every topic presented. Many algorithms are built up in steps, showing how successive insights from both computation and biology can make existing techniques work better. Along the way, they offer biographical notes about the founders and luminaries of modern biological computation.<br /><br />This is a great first book for anyone wanting to enter the field, from either a biology or a computer science background. Advanced students will bottom out quickly, and may lose patience with the informal and gently-paced discussion. Sorry, this book was never meant for them.

His question is, why is this so jarring? Why is it that people are literate and numerate, but so seldom both at once?<br /><br />This book addresses that question. In part, he says that literature deals with many aspects of a few individuals, but statisticians generally study a very few aspects of very many individuals. He also notes that literature tends to treat each individual as a unique product of a unique time and place. In contrast, math and physics typically deal with cases where the specific individual is irrelevant. Any experiment on an electron gets the same result no matter which electron you use, or where, or when.<br /><br />The dichotomy may not, in fact, exist. One could refer to the recent statistical studies of DNA data that have that literary much-about-few character and that often seek out the uniqueness of the study's subject. Part of Paulos's main point, however, is that reasoning in \\"human\\" prose is often just mathematical reasoning in street clothes. Other times, when day to day logic seems irrational to a simplistic \\"scientific\\" analysis, it turns out that there is a deeper kind of reasoning at work, and one that can be cast in formal terms.<br /><br />Paulos delivers more than his nominal argument, though. His presentation is filled with little asides and self-referential humor. He is a logician after all, and, like the logician Lewis Carroll, uses his logic to create delightful unreason. Taken as a whole, it's a brief, enjoyable, and instructive look a the formal side of casual reasoning, and at the human side of mathematical logic.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-10-24

More than that, though, he gives background material and discussion that work in OS and application environments, too.<br /><br />Chapters 4 to 9 lays out a number of patterns that work well in embedded environments. Patterns for any one aspect of the system (memory, safety/reliability, etc.) are grouped into chapters, allowing easy understanding of the relationships between patterns that differ only subtly. Ch.7, especially, covers a number of related patterns that address to dealock avoidance - good stuff, but a bit more comparison between patterns and discussion of how to select between them would have helped. The discussion on deadlock in general is good too, but a standard OS textbook might cover aspects of deadlock in more detail.<br /><br />Ch.6, on memory, will be a revelation to people who just use malloc() and free() without thinking. There are lots more ways of handling memory. His discussions of different patterns are good but there's always more to say. Memory pools, for example, may have many different meanings: different memory regions (cache vs. main memory) may have different performance features, or (as in DOS or Windows before about Win95) implications for the instruction sets required for memory access. Harvard and multi-bus architectures may use memory pools to reflect different memory accessibility rules. The \\"fixed-size buffer\\" pattern is another great one. I've seen it implemented in hardware, for on-chip buffers in network controllers, and in operating systems where objects of a specific data type are reused frequently. (This can overlap with the pool pattern, when there are different pools for buffers of different fixed sizes.)<br /><br />Ch.3 talks about patterns in general, and the discussion ranges widely. It includes a fairly good discussion of using multiple patterns in one application, but stops short of the tricky cases where one object participates in two different patterns.<br /><br />On the whole, this is a very useful book. It does presuppose some background in system (as opposed to software) design. That means it's not for the raw beginner, but it doesn't pretend to be. Some of the discussions of low-level system design suffer from shallowness, and some embedded topics are simply never discussed. Memory structures for block-erasable FLASH, for example, may resemble those used in writable CD-ROMs. Every book has bounds, though, and Douglass has done a good job within the bounds he chose.<br /><br />//wiredweirdparticipates in two different patterns.

Yes, both.	This modest title delivers far more than it promises.<br /><br />It promises that the most profound, enduring artifacts of English language scholarship will be traced to the schock of war and to a man that it shattered. It promises that a small-town teacher would be elevated to the highest levels cultural authority. It promises dark secrets of broken minds and dusty secrets of doddering universities.<br /><br />It delivers. Better yet, it delivers more.<br /><br />The style is readable and compelling. I really wanted to turn each page. The narrative skips around, from the time of Shakespeare, to the founding of today's US, to the horrors of the US civil war. WWI notwithstanding, the US Civil War may represent the worst balance of weapons' destructive power vs. medicine's ability to make a broken soldier whole. Perhaps two among every three casualties on both sides succumbed to medieval medical care. Even within that, the most terrible slaughter in one battle of that most terrible war came from fire: the whole battlefield and the whole forest above it became an inferno. Men already dying from wounds tried desperately to avoid that worse death, and failed.<br /><br />It just gets more grim after that, in ways that may well have shattered Dr. Minor's frail mind. Others suffered later, shot down in the street or orphaned. Somehow, all of that fell onto a man and fell into a time that could work towards a book. Not just any book, but The book of The English Language. However much we might value the OED today, we can never recreate the Victorian meaning of English as a tool of The Empire and of The Church - specifically, not the Roman church.<br /><br />I've said too much.

I imagine some doctoral advisor with five great manuscripts and six students. This translation seems to have come from the sixth student.<br /><br />The translator's own notes show indifference to the text: \\"characterization on the whole [is] somewhat superficial. We look in vain for the ... heroic struggle [of] Njal's saga, ... the dialogue lacks the bite of quick retort; the humor is crude ...\\" Given that introduction by the text's own English author, it's hard to be stirred by this rendering.<br /><br />There is so much that can be exciting here. Iceland, around 1000 AD, had a strong democracy and rule of law. In that rough time, man-slaying was not necessarily a crime - not for good and stated reason. If wrong was done, it was made right in local court (the \\"Thing\\") or in the nation's high court (\\"Althing\\"). Lawsuit was a serious matter, and the preferred way of resolving conflict. Women had property rights in divorce, granted by law and enforced by neighbors who wanted peace no matter who had to die for it. Read Njal's saga - even jury selection had a gut-gripping intensity, when everyone in the room was armed for battle.<br /><br />Perhaps this translator had only a lesser work to render into English. Half of the sagas were below the median; great products can't come from inferior materials. Still, I'm sure this translator could have worked harder. A tension with the Norwegians could have been called out. English, even British suffixes replaced the originals and lost their savor, for example where \\"Nollarsstead\\" renders \\"Nollar's home\\". Some sentences simply defy sense, as in \\"... I've been living in great discomfort and now I want to marry.\\" Huh? 'Discomfort' is horniness? Or lack of house manager? No matter what the words, a translator should present the sense of a passage.<br /><br />I value the literature of early Europe, and I am sure that Iceland's early democracy will interest modern Libertarians (or Heinlein fans, or Ayn Rand fans). I am very sorry that this is not the book that shows that value or stirs that interest.<br /><br />//wiredweirdows that value or stirs that interest.    //wiredweird	2004-10-17

Many are dark and sorrowful. Even so, many have an indestructible kernel of hope in them kept alive through sheer personal will.<br /><br />Now that I've read these extracts from her diaries and correspondence, I can understand better the woman who made that art. Above all, she was a woman founded on her emotions. I don't means twittering sentimentality. I mean the kind of love that kept her one marriage strong for 49 years, until she was widowed. I mean the kind of devotion that kept her at work for fifteen years on the memorial to her son, fallen in the first World War. I mean the kind of dedication that led her to teach master classes, even though she grew up when women were almost forbidden to attend advanced schooling.<br /><br />Despite her losses in the two World Wars, her life had much in it to bolster her strength. Her family supported her childhood interest in art, and her father was willing to get her what training he could. She married young, and somewhat against her parents' wishes. Her husband, however, supported her art, and she remained close to her parents. She fully accepted motherhood; her sons and later her grandchildren were bulwarks of her adult life. She engendered lifelong affection in her friends and her family. Her surviving son compiled this tribute to her life, and her grand-daughter added a few pages about Kaethe's last days.<br /><br />There are a few dozen samples of her drawings, sculpture, lithos and woodcut at the end of this book. (Given her tendency towards transfer lithos, the distinction between litho and drawing isn't always clear.) The reproductions aren't great,  just enough to indicate the structure and feeling of each piece. The set is nicely bracketed, however, by an early self-portait and her last one. The face is the same handsome woman in both, but the later Kaethe is wizened and wisened by her years.<br /><br />This is a wonderful book. I am truly glad to know more about this woman.

Listing the content would take pages, and much of it is chemical or physical arcana - if you need the data, you already know what to look for. At a more accessible level, it lists the frequencies of notes in several musical scales, information about common wire sizes, astronomical information, the chemical makeup of the human body, and ways to create carefully controlled humidity. That last one can be helpful to woodworkers; this book really does have something for almost everyone.<br /><br />Although it comes out every few years, most people won't need to update very often.

They create religious schisms, and are even said to start wars. The marks around the words shape the meanings of those words. When they are habitually mis-used or un-used, the language loses those meanings. Truss demonstrates that clearly using scores of specimens, some collected in the wild, some hand-raised for her demonstrative purposes.<br /><br />As she so eloquently notes, even experts disagree on correct usages. She also notes that experts differ in the particular abuses that offend them most, and I respectfully differ with her on one point. As bad as apostate apostrophes may be, abuses of the dot-dot-dot ellipsis grate most harshly on my nerves. It's not the occasional ineptitude that bothers me, it's the chronic disease of epellipsis that drives me towards violence. Seeing them attacking a page in swarms, like machine-gun marks on a war-zone wall, is more than a thinking person can bear. If you don't believe me, expose yourself (cautiously) to a book called \\"As the Future Catches You\\". If those ellipses don't replace excesses of exclamations as the most annoying punctuation in history, you'll at least see support for that belief.<br /><br />Truss presents her case with charm, wit, and elegance. She presents it with clarity and with case studies, but without taking herself too seriously. Treat yourself to this delightful little book, and you may never look at your own writing the same way again.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-10-10

Peirce was a mathematical logician, reasonably well-known around the start of the twentieth century. He is not often remembered now, at least not in my circles. This book does much to explain why.<br /><br />Peirce set about creating a visual notation for formal logic. The basic idea sounds familiar to anyone who's seen Venn diagrams. (They came from Euler, actually, as did incredible numbers of other things. The term 'Venn diagram' follows the informal convention of naming the thing for the first researcher after Euler to work on it.) Peirce went the extra steps, beyond AND and NOT to existential and universal quantification.<br /><br />Although his graphical notations - several of them, and contradictory - are of historical interest, I really see no advantage over standard textual notation. The marks lack clear distinctions of order, in the sense that \\"for all X there exists Y where Z is true\\" differs from \\"there exists Y such that for all X, Z is true.\\" The diagrams uses lines, sometimes sprawling and forking across the page, where a simple variable symbol would have sufficed. In fact, a set of letter variables seem clearer in that each has visually distinct shape, unlike the lines. (Lines of different weight and style were already reserved for other purposes.) Worse, the notations were especially ungainly in the day when they were scribbled by hand into a type-set page. Peirce's latest generation of diagrams included colors, metal tones, and more, for expressing possibilities and features of modal logics - decidedly inconvenient, in an age that lacked markers and convenient color printing. He even used the reverse of the sheet on which the graphs were drawn!<br /><br />Anyone devoted to visual representation of formal concepts should be aware of Peirce's work, if only because bad examples can be so instructive. I have to admit, however, that the peculiar notation of 'existential graphs' has little practical purpose.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-10-10

Don't be fooled: this simple and elegant art deserves the most serious respect.<br /><br />Western marbling uses a thickened medium to support the inks. Suminagashi, instead, relies on the fluidity of water's surface to create its delicate drifting marks. It differs from Western marbling also in that it tends towards a limited palette, often being executed with black ink only. The results, however, go far past the Western style in delicacy and complexity. Suminagashi can fill the paper with marks as vivid and dense as marbled paper's. It can also create airy, open patterns as pale as morning mist, the kind that sit well under calligraphy or drawing.<br /><br />Best of all, suminagashi is simpler in tools, materials, and process than its Western relative. You can try it yourself with only a shallow pan, ink, and a little detergent. Even kids can get good results within their first few tries, and get enough different results to hold their interest.<br /><br />The basic simplicity of the craft takes nothing away from the masterworks of the craft's finest artisans. There is infinite subtlety in the play of ink and surface. The samples shown here are breathtaking. The book's value, though is in letting you create images of your own.<br /><br />Go ahead.

Sawyer, the modern commentator, has made it even more relevant to the contemporary reader.<br /><br />Each chapter has three parts. The first is almost always a brief reference to Sun Tzu, Ssu-ma Fa, or some other classic of strategy and tactics. The second part reaches into China's long written history to find historical examples of each precept.<br /><br />Although phrased as a commentary on older texts, the reader should remember the rigid social structure and respect for ancient wisdom common in the Ming dynasty (when this was written). New ideas were suspect, even irreverent to the extent that they challenged the classics. Instead, new ideas were concealed as commentaries on the established wisdom. One should not dismiss these commentaries as just a rehashing of texts that were a thousand years old even then.<br /><br />The third part of each chapter is Sawyer's modern addition, sometimes longer than both traditional parts together. Sawyer uses these notes to explain historical content and to point out relevance to the modern world. The real value of Sawyer's commentary, however, is its extensive citation of other Chinese military classics. He will often provide the whole passage to which a chapter alludes, as well as related passages from other texts. I found this very helpful, especially when Sawyer quoted classics that are little-known or inaccessible to English speakers.<br /><br />The indices are good, providing reference by topic, by proper names referenced, and by the eight classics references for which commentaty is provided. There was no bibliography, though, a real loss. I would very much like to read the Wu Tzu or other unfamiliar titles named, but I'll have to hunt those down on my own.<br /><br />This shouldn't be your first book on classical Chinese strategy, but it will be a welcome addition to any serious collection.<br /><br />//wiredweirdn. <br /> <br />//wiredweird	2004-10-05

Magritte, straight up - his pictures and almost nothing else.<br /><br />It's an incredibly rich experience, and even better for its strict chronological order. I'm fascinated to see themes appear, endure, fade away, and recur. What are those silvery balls with the black bands? Why tubas? That nearly Impressionist phase in the mid 1940s was a remarkable depature, but one that didn't last.<br /><br />Best of all, the time series lets me see his skills develop. I like his later figures much better than the earlier ones, for one thing. His landscapes and textures gained in subtlety, too. Most of all, he continued to develop his language of image throughout his life - \\"The Blank Signature\\" (Le Blanc-seign) expresses ambiguities that he seemed to have worked decades to achieve.<br /><br />Except for a brief time-line at the end, there is no commentary. I like that, at least I like it better than un-helpful commentary. Hughes consciously leaves me and Magritte alone with each other. That's fine by me - Magritte spoke through his pictures, and I might not have appreciated the interruption.<br /><br />The book is beautifully printed, but somewhat small.

If imitation is the sincerest flattery, that's a pretty high-profile compliment.<br /><br />Despite its title, this is more a study of photography than of the body itself. Ewing reproduces images from the last 150 years, in many technologies, for many purposes. There are medical and microscopic pictures, pictures to titillate, and \\"freak show\\" shots. There are the pseudoscientific Victorian images of habitually nude Africans - often, racially based excuses for some drawing-room smut. There are modern abstractions, utterly literal but somtimes so baffling in composition that I can't figure out what I'm looking at.<br /><br />The images are individually captivating, and even stronger in this well-made collection. About half the bulk of the book is explanatory text, however. I have to admit that I skipped most of that. The few fragments I did read added very little to my understanding or appreciation of the photos, so I let it go by me.<br /><br />This is a beautiful celebration of the human figure. More than that, it's a catalog, by means of example, of the many purposes and styles that figure photography has had during its relatively brief history. \\"The Body\\" will be a real asset to any collection of figure photography.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-10-03

As a writer, however, he is not nearly well known enough. This short book collects some of his early writings from rather obscure journals, and presents a lecture that was never actually given.<br /><br />Escher is well known for his precise renderings, and we are blessed with writing in the same precise style. He wrote out the script for his lecture in full, before it was to be given. That means that, when a medical emergency forced its cancellation, the lecture was preserved in its entirety. Like his geometric woodcuts and his precise lithographs, the calm of the text belies the passion that lay behind it. Escher spent decades in poverty before his well-earned fame, and pursued visions for which he had no good words and certainly no companions. That same drive was what pushed his skill as a woodblock artist down to the limits of his hands and his materials, below the limit of his unaided eye.<br /><br />Although not trained in math or the hard sciences, he puts a human face on subtle mathematical concepts. The infinite and unbounded is a common idea, the finite and bounded is part of everyday life. These aren't his words, but he pursued the finite and unbounded, in tiled patterns on the surface of a sphere. He also sought out the infinite and bounded, and found it in the Cirle Limit pieces and other works.<br /><br />This book is the only inexpensive and easily accesible source of Escher's own thoughts on his work. It's not a catalog of his work - most of the reproductions so small that they only suggest the piece depicted, or remind a viewer already familiar with the work. It's not a biography, although it has a few biographical details. People with the wrong expectations are sure to be disappointed in this.<br /><br />I'm happy with it. It is a very enjoyable look at his cool manner of presentation. Like his Three Worlds litho, it presents a surface of meaning, but shows reflections of distant ideas and hints at his hidden depths.<br /><br />//wiredweirdweird	2004-10-02

Even if you look at nothing else, this is a wonderful, sustained effort in visual story-telling. It tracks Moonshadow, the hero, from before his birth into his old age and death. The style perfectly captures sensuality, fear, and the sense of the bizarre.<br /><br />The second is the story. It's baffling, by design, a product of hippie culture and the whims of whimsical and omnipotent beings. That really captures a lot of a kid's experience - with all-powerful adults acting in incomprehnsible ways. It has more, though: coming of age, destroying any romance there might be around war, and loving (and being loved by) people who aren't very lovable.<br /><br />This book is thin, but includes over 400 pages of generally good color printing. The original 1980s comics are all here. So, unfortunately, is a 1997 accretion. It's a newer addition to the Moonshadow canon, also, illustrated by Muth. This add-on relies more on text than on illustration, and is painted in a rougher and more garish style. After the nuance and control of the original story, it's a let-down.<br /><br />Anyone who like comic art should check into this. Anyone who likes good storytelling, where will is pitted against a universe with a sick sense of humor, should like it too. It's a true classic.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-10-01

There's a good reason for that.<br /><br />It captures all that people love about slapstick, and doesn't worry about toning it down for the kids. The two heros drift from town to town, bordello to bordello, and bar to bar. They're petty grifters, always trying to pull another meager scam, and always getting the worst of it in the end.<br /><br />There's no real plot here, just a sequence of vignettes. They're all like enough in kind to create a rhythm, but different enough to stay entertaining. Lots of the humor is low - potty humor, not restricted just to human waste. As in some britcoms, our heroes suddenly appear in their underwear time and again - or out of it, or next to it, or looking up into a tree at it. The real fun is in their silly pranks and exaggerations, always found out in ways that make them look like total twits.<br /><br />Ikku Jippensha's work is still a good read, even today. Sometimes, though, English doesn't capture the flavor of the original. The translator just shouldn't have bothered with some of the puns, and a few turns of phrase probably sounded better back when this was translated.

The repertoire includes many stories adapted from myth or mythic in themsleves.<br /><br />Opera is also, I'm afraid, an acquired taste, and one that I have not acquired. That's part of the reason I'm so happy to see these adaptations in a form I can appreciate. Another part of the reason is that I just like Russell's art, no matter what story it tells.<br /><br />Opera purists may object, but hey - it gets people like me interested in the stories, and that's a start.

There's not much here for the fetish crowd, and almost every encounter centers on one man and one woman (from her point of view). Maybe that's not enough variety for some readers, but the endless variations work for me.<br /><br />This is enjoyable, intelligent, and sexy, with extra flavor from Zane's brown sugar.

It's about 100 years old now. It was written by a Japanese expatriate, in English, for an English-speaking audience. I mean the term \\"audience\\" in the most audible way, since this text was meant to be read aloud to the highest of the Boston Brahmins. (That attention to sound is probably a big part of why this reads so smoothly.)<br /><br />Kakuzo explains the Japanese tea ceremony to a non-Japanese audience. Oddly, he does not describe the ceremony. Instead, he lays out the history of tea and the history of the Zen esthetic in which cha-do (\\"the way of tea\\") makes sense. He describes the place in which the ceremony is held, and some of the tools used in that ceremony. He does not, however, spell out the mechanics of the service. Perhaps it's just as well. As Kakuzo describes, it is not the tea that matters. It is the effect that the ritual has on the people who perform it.<br /><br />This book is laid out simply and elegantly, as befits its topic. The primary font is a little unusual - a long-waisted serif that connotes the warm feeling of the text itself. Page layouts are airy, and have a distinctive swaying gait from as they step from chapter to chapter. The few photos that illustrate this book are atmospheric, and printed in a subdued color scheme. It doesn't equal the old slip-case edition, but it's still a pleasing and instructive sample of book design.<br /><br />This is a pleasant book, and a short one. The reading is over much too quickly. It is also a delightful contrast to another Japanese author writing for an English audience at very nearly the same time. Nitobe's unfortunate \\"Bushido\\" tries much too hard to explain itself in Western terms. Kakuzo, instead, expresses his home culture in its own terms, the only ones that make sense, and in much more readable language.<br /><br />//wiredweird<br /><br />PS: This edition has a new intro by Liza Dalby, the first and possibly only American woman to complete training as a geisha.	2004-09-27

And the grown-ups won't listen.<br /><br />The style just never engaged me, though. The little asides to explain what words meant - they just looked patronizing. There was lots more, like what's with the eyes? I hoped the author would at least give us a clue, but no. They're weird, they appear around that one individual, then he runs off.<br /><br />Harry Potter set the bar pretty high. I can't expect every writer to reach that level, but I can still be disappointed when they don't. The series has become so popular that there must be something in there that I'm just not getting. After reading this book, though, I'm just not tempted to hunt it down.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-09-27

It must be a favorite of Gaiman's too, for him to come back to it after so many years.<br /><br />It must be a special favorite for Gaiman to have engaged so many top illustrators. Each of the seven pieces is dedicated to one of the siblings in Gaiman's pantheon, and each piece comes form a different illustrator. P. Craig Russell opens with a story about Death (charming girl, really), using two rendering styles to represent two threads of the plot. Next comes Milo Manara, who brings lush figure illustration into a story or mixed emotions and revenge. Sienkiewicz delivers a complex visual realization of complex people in a very subtle undertaking. Only someone of his skill and judgement can throw so much into an illustrated story create a coherent whole.<br /><br />The stories are good (except maybe one - I still can't quite make it out). The art is exceptional. If you like the Sandman, or good comic art of any kind, you're sure to like this extension to the Sandman saga.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-09-27

There's the Mars Needs Women theme, but this time the men are of interest, too. (Right. And just like on Star Trek, the females of this alien species probably look pretty good in a bikini, too.) **SPOILER** After being stood up for a date  by someone who doesn't even know his name, the Invading Overlord threatens destruction of the race unless -- well, once again, the aliens come.

It has inspired many books, spanning several centuries. This book, written around 1905, is distinctive for being addressed to a Western audience.<br /><br />It was written by a Japanese scholar in Europe, educated (possibly over-educated) in Western ways. As a reader of my own era, I would say that bushido can only be understood in the terms that it sets out. The reader must knock down the Western tradition, from medieval mythos forward, and accept wholly Asian premises for the bushido to make sense. This author, instead, tries to describe the bushido in Western terms. The result is paltry and grotesque.<br /><br />Nitobe is a product of the bushido, and I am not. He is also a product of the late 19th century, writing in the first few years of the 20th, and writing with English learned at the end of the Victorian era. He explains the bushido in terms of the Old Testament, Shakespeare, Aristotle, and Cervantes. He speaks eloquently to his audience, men who are rigidly Christian and just plain rigid.<br /><br />I find an unhappy desperation in this book, where the author tries to justify a profoundly Japanese culture in un-Japanese terms. This was the era just after Legge, Hearn, Burton, and FitzGerald. There was an influx of Eastern culture, but it was filtered so that proper English could disuss in their own terms. I am afraid that the filter stopped out all that was truly Japanese.<br /><br />The serious sudent should read this book, but not to understand Japanese culture. Instead, the reader should try to understand the Western culture that this book addresses. Even now, we are afflicted by Victorian translations of Eastern classics. This book, working from East to West instead, shows just how dire that affliction had become.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-09-26

It's interesting that, even in classical Roman times, an analogous kind of writing existed. Leucippe and Clitophon, written in Roman times, was set in the still older Greece.<br /><br />It's an adventure story with all the trimmings - wrecks at sea, love lost and regained a number of times, travels across the known world, mistaken identities, courtroom drama, and lots more. The premise behind all this is Clitophon's passion for the chaste (and chased) Leucippe. The details are too much to tell, but chains of improbable events keep the lovers just moments from consummation until the very end, when all the other loose ends are tied up as well.<br /><br />This could be read as a drama, with waves of emotion cresting and crashing at each gain or loss. It may be easier to read this as comedy, though, especially near the end. There are so many silly subplots and misunderstandings, before all is made right, that it get just a little hard to take seriously.<br /><br />It's also easy to read this as an academic translation. Although the story is pleasant enough, the reading isn't as smooth or idiomatic as I'd hope, and the footnotes add technical detail without insight that supports the story. As translations go, however, some are lots worse.<br /><br />This is a pleasant romp. Despite it's talk of eroticism, the physical passions are mostly hoped or imagined. That leaves an enjoyable, safe story of adventure and romance. It's goofy and overdrawn, but fun.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-09-25

The first book is just in the pictures, reproductions of paintings, photos, and even a few cartoons that celebrate the figure. The pictorial reading is hugely informative by itself. The authors place each picture in the historical or visual context that led up to it - showing related pictures that might have informed the one being discussed, or displaying cartoons that editorialize on the figure in then-contemporary art.<br /><br />One thing that's hard for a modern viewer is to see the pictures through Victorian eyes, with Victorian sensibilities. Nudity often represented innocence, invoking Edenic times before modesty (and immodesty, by implication) arose. This seems true, most often, when depicting youths and children. A modern viewer is free to wonder, though - weren't a few artists, Charles Dodgson included, just a bit shrill in protesting their innocent motives?<br /><br />The second reading of this book is in its explanatory text, an even partner with the imagery itself. This is what a picture book's text should be, but too rarely is. It really does add insight to the images. Sometimes the writing explains mythical references that are now obscure, sometimes it describes the artist and that artist's place in society, sometimes it explains how competing schools of thought created pictures with specific features of style. In every case, though, the reading is worthwhile, if only because it invites the reader to linger just a little longer over each of the pictures shown.<br /><br />The artists represented here all honor classical human beauty in its many forms, male, female, and child. That explains one of two lacks I found in this book. First was the absence of mature figures, especially among the women. It was and often still is implicit that only the young can be beautiful. This error deprives fully adult women of their due, and deprives the viewer of a wider vision of human wonder. Second, this book emphasizes the classical, formal style of painting. I miss the other kinds of images that were also being made at the time, especially the Impressionist. The first lack I attribute to the artists of the time, but the second was introduced by the modern editors. It's a minor point, though, and does not interfere with the enjoyment of what is present.<br /><br />This is a book worth having and keeping, for its inherent beauty, for its intelligent commentary, and for its presentation of painters I might not have known otherwise.<br /><br />//wiredweirdssical, formal style of painting.

Even within etching, there is standard intaglio process, relief etching, intaglio so deep it's amost relief, spit-biting or open-biting - well, a very long list. This gives an exacting look at the marks specific to each process, and gives good diagnostic descriptions. A special strength in this book is the differential diagnoses, the questions to ask that help distinguish two very similar kinds of marks. Every point made in the text is illustrated real samples, and that makes for a heck of a lot of illustrations.<br /><br />I have almost no quibbles with this text. There are just a few minor points that Gascoigne could have brought out more clearly. First is that Japanese woodcuts are under-represented. It's a rich tradition with a number of distinguishing features: gradations of ink hand-placed on a block, occasional use of mica for luster, and occasional use of un-inked \\"blind\\" impressions to impress texture into the paper. Second is a mark that I think is unique to drypoint: the line is often asymmetric, crisp on one side and blurred on the other, capturing the asymmetry of the drypoint burr. The split drypoint line is more famous but, in my experience, less common. I've seen it only in the most aggressively worked drypoints, such as some by Picasso. Third is a feature of some dust-ground aquatints: that the white marks can sometimes form a connected mesh around the black dots, where a spirit ground always has a black ocean dotted with white islands. I know these are minor points, and I hope you see how few there are.<br /><br />I'm a process nut. It's not the only way I enjoy prints, and not the way everyone enjoys them. For me, though, it really adds something to know how the maker's hand created each mark that I see. This isn't strictly a process book, and only accidentally a book of process history. It's a book about how a print looks, and seeing even more in the finest part of its looks. In the end, that's really the best reason to love a print.<br /><br />//wiredweird<br /><br />PS: A little while ago, I was given a very nice color print. It was done in mezzotint style, using burnishers to work from dark to light. Instead of a rocker-made ground, though, it had an aquatint ground. Color came from inking au poupee, dabbed on the plate.

That's by Hokusai. He worked about 200 years ago, but his work is still fresh and vital.<br /><br />\\"Fresh\\" may seem an odd word to use about images made by the hundreds, and \\"vital\\" may seem odd when describing the days, weeks, or months needed to carve a set of wood block. Still, the images are clear, communicative, and decisive, as if one thought were held for the days or weeks of cutting a set of wood printing blocks.<br /><br />That freshness aslo belies the huge labor that went into each print, or set of prints (36 of Fuji, 100 of Edo). Each of them was based on a \\"key\\" block, the one that created the black outlines. Then there were more blocks in each color, usually one for each color, sometimes four or more of them. Then there were the various trial proofs of each block and combination of blocks. Then there was the effort of inking each block and pulling each impression uniquely. The \\"100 views\\" is beatiful, but also a statement of Hokusai's endurance.<br /><br />Hokusai also printed some shunga, \\"pillow books\\" allegedly used to show baffled newlyweds what goes where. Some are charming, some have outlandish exaggerations of both his and her genitals, and some (see the diptych p.157) are just strange - funny, but strange funny.<br /><br />This is a wonderful colletion of Hokusai's color and B&W printing, along with a few brush drawings, and a very informative text.

These aren't creationists, but hard-headed scientists discussing the blind operation of nature. Nothing in nature \\"means\\" anything in the sense that a human word has meaning, nothing has \\"purpose\\" in the sense that some intelligence has assigned a goal to the object. They why do serious people use such anthropomorphic terms?<br /><br />Most of all, why does this language lead to such stunning successes in understanding the mechanisms of life?<br /><br />That is Lewens' goal, to figure out just what the thought processes are behind those words. His search isn't just intellectual word-play, it's a search for the basis of human understanding in biology. As in any experimental science, biological tests are phrased as questions: do real-world facts contradict the statement in question, yes or no? The scientific outcome of the experiment is just a physical phenomenon, but the answer to the question is semantic. That is the point that Lewens addresses: how the meaning of the question maps into physical phenomena, and how results map from phenomena to meaningful answers. The meaning of the question is the most fundamental factor in the scientific process.<br /><br />Lewens does a very good job in this analysis. He avoids the dogmatic absolutism that seems to characterize other philosophers' answers. Biologists, after all, are usually happy to look at any one problem in two or three ways that contradict each other. Lewens seems to place more importance on what the practicing scientists believe than in philosophical theory - a habit that lends relevance to his work, or avoids immediate irrelevance. Despite his generally sound foundation in scientific fact, Lewens still shies from answers in statistical form; future work should address that weakness, but it did not detract from the general thrust of his discussion.<br /><br />Lewens has chosen an important field of study, and has addressed it with respect for the people who work in that field. He succeeds in showing that philosophy can be a constructive force in modern life and thought. I have to admit, however, that many of his distinctions were drawn so finely that the details blur together for me even a little while later. There are times when the words matter, but scientists tend to putter along quite happily without approaching this level of fussiness.

The story of the theorem starts out with all the right pieces for a tale that would really hold the general reader's attention. Fermat - a brilliant but reclusive mathematician - left a tantalizing clue in the margin of a book \\"... a truly remarkable proof which this margin is too small to contain.\\" It was a hint at a map to a wonderful treasure of number theory.<br /><br />More than 300 yeears later, Andrew Weil did in fact excavate that treasure by creating a proof of the theorem. It took him more than seven years of lonely dedication, and built on seemingly every mathematical innovation between Fermat's time and his own. Unfortunately, Aczel got carried away in tracing those innovations. Aczel traced many of those historical strands, from Archimedes and the ancient Phoenecians, through the 18th and 19th centuries, and into the present. I'm afraid he didn't tie those strands together as tightly as I could have hoped. I came away form the book remembering vingettes, but no real historical plot. Maybe the real continuity, through the mathematical developments, would have been to technical to follow.<br /><br />The book is brief enough, however, that it was still easy to read. That famous theorem, so called long before it was proved, has been a part of mathematical culture for centuries. Its conquest really is a good story, but I'm still looking for a good telling of it.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-09-19

The plot has its protagonist setting out to explore regions that have not yet been explored - i.e., explored by Europeans, i.e. explored by anyone who counts. He finds the remarkable country of Erewhon, with its many odd ways.<br /><br />Most of those odd ways exaggerate the social ills that Butler saw in his own society. The Erewhonians are overtly fascinated with physical beauty and health, to the point of treating ugliness or disease as criminal offenses. (Our own fascination with looks differs not in kind but in degree, and maybe not such a large degree.) Theft and embezzlement are treated as minor quirks, more like habits to be broken than real crimes. (Well, our business pages read like a police blotter most days.)<br /><br />Butler skewers the church, by redrawing it as a sort of bank. It's an odd bank, though. Everyone feels they should do business there, but very few do except so they can be seen doing it. It has its own currency, but a currency that can't buy anything and that even its own cashiers treat casually. The Erewhonians all hold it to be the most wonderful of institutions, but hold it in complete disregard in their day to day activities - does this sound at all familiar?<br /><br />He also takes on vegetarians, an anti-machine sentiment that seems to have gone out of fashion, and especially higher education. That last, or UnReason as he calls it, is his primary target of ridicule. I'll let you read the details for yourself, but the points that Butler attacks are still a part of modern academia. In fact, those malfunctions of purpose have spread out of the universities and into our grade schools.<br /><br />Butler's worst exaggerations are saved for the protagonist himself, however. The last chapter has the hero escape from Erewhon. He intends to return with a team of missionaries who will convert that nation of heathens, to the greater glory of god and gold. He is quite specific in the armament that will be used to ease the process. He also details how the Erewhon nation would be turned over to slave-holders for enforced religious instruction (and to turn a quick buck). Butler takes on the very worst of The White Man's Burden, and sinks it under its own miserable weight.<br /><br />This is a brief book, but very worthwhile. It stands well next to Gulliver's Travels as a partner in satire. It also works well against utopias like Shangri-La, by taking the same premises and working them in the opposite way.

The problem is that they aren't hiring, not her sort, at least. You know, the female sort. Religious law would declare her an Abomination for such un-womanly behavior. Polly, however, is not one to let little things like the nation's entire theocracy or or military establishment upset her plans.<br /><br />So she joins. So, among others, do a troll (a minor geological formation on legs), a vampire who's taken the pledge, and an Igor - good person to have at hand, or at any other body part in need. This small, untrained, unarmed, and underfed platoon (the \\"In and Outs\\"), led by a delusional desk-jockey, are out to defeat the massed armies of Discworld.<br /><br />With Pratchett writing, you already know that A) the massed armies aren't ready for the In-and-Outs, and B) the In-and-Outs aren't quite ready for themselves, either. The nation's theocracy and military establishment should get a good grip on something sturdy, too, not that it will do them much good.<br /><br />This book doesn't sustain the frenzied pace of the earliest Discworld books. The series is still going strong, though, even after two dozen or more titles, long after most series start looking tired. It's still worth reading, especially when Polly wonders whether she's wearing the socks or they're wearing her.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-09-14

The first parts of the book present the mathematical tools needed for the discussion. There, they extend formal logic so that it can make statements about classes and subclasses, the kind of statements that must be made in order to determine whether a program, even a whole programming language, make good sense.<br /><br />The authors introduce a notation I haven't seen elsewhere, having to do with the object instance bound to a method instance. This subtlety describes a number of language constructs, including Java's inner classes. They add further notation for describing languages where object structure can be highly dynamic. Although of theoretical interest, the dynamics do not apply directly to commercial OO languages such as Java, C++, or Ada. Dynamics may also complicate reasoning about the type systems. Other type analyses are simplified by acting on the static program representation. Dynamic analysis will have to invoke heavier mechanisms, like the ones used in traditional formal verification of programs.<br /><br />I have to admit that I haven't gone through the book's entire content because that discussion doesn't address my current needs. Right now, I'm working with very static systems; this book creates solutions for problems that I don't have. Still, I've gotten some value out of the basic discussion of covariance and contravariance in subclassing, so the book has helped me somewhat.<br /><br />This book is intended for researchers in computing theory, or possibly for practitioners who develop languages and language tools. It's way beyond the needs of most OO programmers, and is decidedly not for OO beginners. If you need deep, rigorous understanding of OO foundations, beyond what's needed for mainstream languages or applications, then this book may be very helpful.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-09-12
524526:US	35004134	R2XQ0ZLQF6LIPS	1584883278	416046082	Statistical Analysis of Gene Expression Microarray Data	Books	4	9	9	N	Y	Outstanding survey	Microarray studies are becoming the preferred research tools in many areas, including cancer research, development studies, and studies in organisms' responses to their environments. Because of differences between organisms or between experiments, microarray data is always statistical in nature. The problem is that the data aren't well suited to traditional statistics. Instead of studying a few characteristics in large numbers of individuals, microarray studies typically yield thousands of data values for a few dozen samples.<br /><br />That mismatch, between current statistical practice and microarray analysis requirements, seem to be driving many innovations in statistical analysis. This book is a brief survey of four of those areas of analysis: model-based analysis, experimental design, classification, and clustering.<br /><br />The first section, on model-based analysis, is brief. Mostly, it seems to establish the language used in later sections. The next, on experimental design, deals with ways for getting the most information out of the fewest samples. The costs of arrays and processing are dropping, but still high. More analysis on less data makes good economic sense. The DNA samples analyzed also have costs - some can only be prepared in minute amounts, others must be extracted surgically from human patients. Either way, it's important to maximize the knowledge harvested from limited amounts of biologcal material.<br /><br />The next section, on discrimination, is a bit longer. It briefly summarizes a wide variety of techniques for deciding which category best represents any one sample. This section gives a good review of analytic approaches: Fisher classifiers and their descendants, principal components, support vectors, and decision trees. Within trees, the authors note that the number of missing values in typical microarray data may interfere with standard analysis, and that surrogate variables may be needed in many cases. AI and data mining techniques aren't broadly represented, but this chapter is still very informative.<br /><br />The final section, on clustering, was shorter. It was reasonably informative, and I gleaned a few new facts from it. Mostly, though, it seemed to present techniques that are already well known.<br /><br />This book is a survey, so it emphasizes breadth over depth. Many algorithms described only briefly, and some are just mentioned by name. The developer will need to chase references to find an implementable level of detail. Still, the book has value as an index to references and as a comparison of techniques.<br /><br />//wiredweirdues aren't broadly represented, but this chapter is still very informative. <br /> <br />The final section, on clustering, was shorter.

He created that ambiguity of biota and machine. This book, with less concern for censorship, drives those images far beyond what the theaters can accept.<br /><br />I read this book with a choked fascination. Giger uses all of his technical mastery in depicting landscapes of torment, eroticism, deformity, and beauty. This world is peopled by multiple beings, fused by birth, by force, or by carnality. His work reminds me of Druillet, where every scene is packed from edge to edge with bizarre detail. Giger goes beyond Druillet with his realistic style, making his monochrome worlds so much more convincing.<br /><br />Although the Amazon web site lists Timothy Leary as a co-author, he just provides a one-page introduction. It's good, and it's Leary, but Leary fans shouldn't get their hopes up too far.<br /><br />If you like Giger's work, as I do, this is an incredible collection. (If the imagery is too much for you, I understand.)This book also provides autobiographical notes, but I take those about as seriously as I take Salvador Dali's. It's the pictures that matter.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-09-11

The reasons for each commission vary - cards, book covers, promotions, etc.<br /><br />There is a lot to enjoy here. Although Maitz has a certain style, the work and topics vary. There are sword and sorcery images, dragons etc., and some science fiction (The Cyteen covers are especially enjoyable.) All of the work meets high standards of workmanship. In the few cases I've checked, it's very well suited to the subject, too.<br /><br />There are a few oddities, though. His female figures tend towards broad bands of pale eye makeup, a little raccoon-like, perhaps an artifact of the time the paintings were made. Many of the women, and some of the men as well, show a lot of white around the iris in their eyes, like a horse about to bolt. That look serves well in a few places, but becomes distracting.<br /><br />It's a nice collection, and adds balance to a larger collection of fantasy art.

In the most literal sense, one (e.g. Afternoon with the Grimm brothers) might include a cat, antique block planes, what looks like an old tube TV, a workbench-turning-piano, and possibly the monster under the bed. The detail goes on, and many of his paintings present the same collections of oddities, neatly arrayed like words on a page. Others (including Please Don't Slam the Door, Foraging in the Field, and Eruption) suggest an uneasy truce between the things of man and the forces of nature. Yet others (Susan, for example) imply intimacy between people, and with the world.<br /><br />In too many cases, though, I see the catalog of Yerka's personal icons arrayed across the page, and feel as if the picture's meaning is not meant for me. Perhaps his personal language is too personal. For whatever reason, the imagery says very little to me.<br /><br />Harlan Ellison, on the other hand, says far too much. Most of this book alternates pages, Ellison's writing on the left and Yerka's painting on the right, plus commentary by Ellison at the end of the book. Long ago, Ellison's favortie topic became Ellison, and I was no longer able to enjoy his writing. I would have liked the book better with Ellison's part missing.<br /><br />Yerka's work is competent; some people may find it legible. Ellison has a following, and those readers are sure to find something here to like. Unfortunately, I am not in either group.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-09-11

A lot of books out there are aimed at HTML developers, maybe even graphic designers. Many such users have little or no real programming experience, and maybe no real interest. Books for that audience are user-friendly, filled with useful examples, and low on scary-sounding technical terms. In other words, almost useless.<br /><br />Flanagan has good credentials as a technical writer, and as a highly technical writer. He really knows what software engineers look for - trust me, it's not what a graphic designer looks for.<br /><br />This starts with a clear, methodical description of the language. Flanagan goes through all the language basics, pointing out where JavaScript differs form languages like Java, C#, or C++. The differences are numerous. For example, JavaScript has typed data, but not typed variables. It's object oriented, but doesn't have classes. It's an interpreted language, not compiled, and that opens up generative programming possibilities that reflection APIs can't approach.<br /><br />After the language itself, Flanagan presents it in the client-side HTML context, where it appears most often. That's about 20% of the book. It goes over all the common HTML features, and shows how JavaScript can add dynamics or configurability to most HTML features. The last part of this section discusses XML and the DOM model. It does not yet discuss the E4X standard, ECMAScript for XML, the new ECMA-357 standard. As of this writing, the standard has only been out for three months, though. I'm sure Flanagan will catch up to it soon.<br /><br />The book's remaining three sections cover the language's basic APIs, the APIs needed in the client-side HTML context, and the DOM model. The first two are fundamental to any non-trivial use of the language, the last is the programming model that gives access to XML or XHTML in a rational, predictable way.<br /><br />JavaScript has a number of very different user communities, with different needs when it comes to language documentation. This isn't a cut&paster's book, and is nothing at all like a training guide. It's a reference manual. If you're a serious techie, then this is the book for you.<br /><br />//wiredweirdTML in a rational, predictable way. <br /> <br />JavaScript has a number of very different user communities, with different needs when it comes to language documentation.

The work does, however, combine many factors that I find appealing.<br /><br />He may be best known for extravagant use of gold leaf in his paintings. That's been done since the middle ages, to highlight images of exceptional value. Klimt, however, seemed to use it in an ironic way, to fill the least important parts of his paintings. Flat, featureless planes of gold just framed what really mattered, the human figures.<br /><br />Far more often than not, the figures were female - a fascination I can understand. This book shows very few men at all. The one full adult male figure (in \\"Here's a Kiss\\") is blocky and crude. Klimt's women, however, expressed everything there in in the human condition.<br /><br />\\"Sonja Knips\\" is an early painting, and shows how much meaning Klimt could assign to one person. Sonja is a young, willowy woman in the full dress of the time. Her expression, however, is piercing and alert. Her pose is seated, but ready - something in her approaches the tension of a runner at the starting blocks.<br /><br />Other paintings cover the whole range of human reality and myth. \\"Danae\\" depicts that woman's beauty, innocence, and violation, but with drawing-room elegance. \\"Hope\\", more than once, appears in the figure of a woman pregnant and near full term. \\"Woman Friends\\" shows two lovely and delicate figures, but hints at the strength of a physical friendship.<br /><br />This book starts with a brief, informative biography of Klimt, including a three-page time line. The rest of the book reproduces a selection of his paintings. Sometimes, just a detail is shown from a larger work. I know that the whole painting, reproduced on the page, would shrink important features below visibility. Still I think more attention could have been paid to those wholes.<br /><br />It's an enjoyable book, though. It's informative without being dry and scholarly, and it focuses on the paintings themselves. The book is interesting in its own right, and interesting enough to encourage more study of his work.<br /><br />//wiredweirdin its own right, and interesting enough to encourage more study of his work.     //wiredweird	2004-09-09

The JavaScript language is simple enough, but its the definitions of the system objects that create complexity in using it. Goodman spends lots of time going over the particulars, with short readable examples.<br /><br />This is great for the serious HTML writer. I'm imagining a reader who's done a good bit of HTML and may have a little experience with more common kinds of programming. That reader has probably looked into the source code for lots of other people's web pages, and has probably seen JavaScript embedded for various cool functions. Such people will appreciate the thoroughness, detail, examples, and friendly style of the book.<br /><br />That intended reader is not a battle-hardened veteran of software engineering or advanced student of computer science. People with more programming background may be disappointed by the relatively low density of the text, and by its organization. The author has created a successful organization grouping by task, but that is very different from a formal presentation of the language and standard APIs.<br /><br />Decide who you are and what you want. This is a book for a specific purpose and reading population, and seems to serve those very well.

The second presents the new knowledge, but the first step clears out old fallacies to make way for the new facts. To do that, he starts this book by thoroughly confusing the question of what is hand work, and what is done by machine. Once that is shown irrelevant, he starts on the points that truly matter.<br /><br />First, the terms \\"craft\\" and \\"craftsmanship\\" have been co-opted and corrupted by so many authors that, with regret, he abandons them. Instead, he defines new terms. The first opposed pairs are the workmanship of risk and the workmanship of certainty. Certainty is knowledge that a piece of work will surely complete in the way intended, as is typical in mass manufacture. Risk is the chance that any workpiece could be damaged or destroyed at any step in its handling - a chisel could clip, a hammer could damage the surface, a saw cut might be placed wrong. It doesn't matter whether the tool is a simple hammer or a complex milling machine: either a reliable process or a fallible workman defines the result.<br /><br />Pye's second distinction is \\"regulated\\" versus \\"free\\" or \\"rough\\" fabrication. Regulated work meets fine tolerances, has precise geometries and surfaces. Free work allows the workman to vary the workpiece somewhat. Free workmanship allows expressive notes, perhaps tool textures or subtle changes of shape.  Rough workmanship goes farther. A wood fence, for example, may be straight and strong enough, with coarse shapes, knots in the wood, and even some checking.<br /><br />None of that distinguishes good workmanship from bad. Good workmanship carries out the practical and esthetic intent of a design, or improves on them. Bad workmanship detracts from the design's usefulness or beauty. In something like a rural stone wall, excessively regulated work might even be considered bad, if it's the one exact geometry in a generally relaxed environment. A rough-hewn bench may be just as good, in its way, as an inlaid Victorian table.<br /><br />Pye ends this wise book by reviewing what Ruskin and Morris had to say about craft. I won't repeat his arguments, but he points out the reams of nonsense they interleaved between pages of meaningful thought. As with everything he analyzes, he carefully highlights the worthwhile, and elegantly tears up the romantic silliness.<br /><br />Pye is truly dedicated to workmanship and to dedicated workmen (and, implicitly, women). I recommend this book to anyone who creates anything, whether professionally or for the personal reward in the act of making.<br /><br />//wiredweirdPye ends this wise book by reviewing what Ruskin and Morris had to say about craft.

(Walter Neurath Memorial Lectures, No 11)	Books	4	24	24	N	N	The anti-deconstructionist	There's been a period of rabid anti-judgment, of the assertion that any esthetic judgment is just a matter of culturally defined opinion, and that no work of art is inherently \\"better\\" than any other. Fortunately, that thought itself is just an opinion, and one with remarkably little historical justification.<br /><br />Sir Clark uses this booklet to try to define the indefinable something in works called masterpieces. I don't think Clark succeeds completely, but he doe seem to capture parts of it. Technical mastery is a requisite, but certainly not enough. An important subject helps, the kind that compels a human response from the viewer, whether or not the viewer knows the people and events depicted. Masterpieces may use the visual vocabulary of their times, or define a new idiom. Clark used Montegna's Dead Christ to demonstrate the former, and Picasso's Woman with a Guitar for the latter. Clark also seems to say that no one period can define a masterpiece - it must stand the test of centuries, holding its importance while times and fashions change around it. Most of all, a masterpiece is a product of the master, not just of the master's skill but of the personality, empathy, experience, and revelation.<br /><br />Frankly, I find the book too short to address the topic properly. Though interesting, parts of Clark's definition can never be put into practice. The master's subjugation to subject is an inner experience, something that can not be shared or even detected by another person. I can't define a masterpiece either, but I can't accept a definition that relies on the artist's frame of mind.<br /><br />Still, the book is brief, readable, and thought-provoking. It reproduces some of the works described, but only in black and white, printed indifferently. The pictures seem intended only as memory-joggers, to help the viewer recall better renderings seen elsewhere. This is an approachable work by an acknowledged master in his own right, but just left me hoping for more.<br /><br />//wiredweirdg for more. <br /> <br />//wiredweird	2004-09-06

He has started to pull together anti-patterns (a.k.a. \\"bad smells\\"), refactorings, and patterns into one unified study. All three work well individually. Together, they make a powerful combination.<br /><br />This isn't as rigorously analytic as the original Design Patterns book. I fully expect more theory-oriented writers to follow the trail blazed here. Instead, Kerievsky gives worked examples, in great detail. At every point, he starts with a code sample drawn from real life, complex enough to be interesting. Then, step by step, he shows the incremental changes made to transition from it's problematic start to its pattern-based end point. Experienced programmers may find this plodding and repetitive. Beginners, however, often have a hard time planning incremental changes and executing them. The author takes care to keep the code in working order at each increment, showing a clear path through the forest of possibilities. Some readers may even trace the path backwards, giving another look at how each change moves toward the end state. The worked examples are the real strength of this text.<br /><br />This is a book for the software maintainer. In other words, it addresses 90% or 99% of the work that real programmers do. Just about every other software text on the market assumes that the project just started - the disks are empty and the compiler shrink-wrap is on the floor. I admit, that kind of programming  is the most fun. It's just not realistic, though. Most work is rework, the kind demonstrated here.<br /><br />Another great feature of this book is what it lacks: dogmatic harangues about methodology. It even keeps a skeptical attitude towards patterns, since heavyweight design techniques aren't always right for lightweight problems. Kerievsky mentions agile-ism, but doesn't make it a part of the process. He does, however, take the continuous testing idea from the eXtremists and work that into the demonstrations. Bravo! Hardware designers may wonder what the fuss is about, since thorough testing has been part of their culture for years. It's a happy novelty in much of the software world, though, and deserves to become standard practice.<br /><br />My only problem with this book is that there isn't more of it. For example, constructor chaining is a great idea. There are two kind of chain, though. He shows the increasing parameter list, where simpler constructors supply default values for the more ones with more parameters. It's also possible to chain in decreasing order, where each constructor processes one parameter and passes on the simplified list. (What's good for constructors, of course, is also good for other collections of related methods.)<br /><br />The book's ideal reader understands an OO language, uses subclassing regularly, and knows something about design patterns. That reader, with enough patience to follow the examples, will learn a lot. More experienced developers won't need the step by step approach, but may benefit from seeing multiple refactorings working together to solve a complex problem. It has my highest recommendation for any developer who really thinks about design and redesign.<br /><br />//wiredweirdsigners may wonder what the fuss is about, since thorough testing has been part of their culture for years.

Either civil law or heaven's law may execute the sentence. Suicide, wasting away, execution, or monastic poverty, the general result was the same. The moralistic tone may seem natural, given a society with many conservative elements and given that Saikaku did much of his writing after taking holy orders.<br /><br />The tone rings just a little false, though. On the whole, Saikaku's writing sounds sympathetic towards the people involved. He was very well aware that men and women are flawed beings, and had a monk's awareness of how material concerns can control a person. Also, Saikaku's \\"Life of an Amorous Man\\" must be taken as part of the stories' context. In that book, the wastrel hero ends up an old man, happy, and still seeking the next day's material happiness. The women in four of these stories end badly, even though their equally guilty men sometimes do not. It's never said in quite these words, but Saikaku seesm to hold women and men to different standards of behavior.<br /><br />Like some of Saikaku's other writing, these stories have a drifting quality about them. The plots, to my Western eye, wander where they will. I don't read these for their stories, though. I read them for their travelogues and impressions of people and events.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-09-04

And strike it will --<br /><br />This book picks up where the first five left off. Volumes 1-5 collect the short pieces from the comic book originals. This is a new story, and the only XXXenophile book with one story end to end. It is a fantasy quest, in search of a god's missing libido. The questers find it, and it works its god-like power over them, in pairs, threesomes, and moresomes.<br /><br />It pays to have a versatile attitude towards what passes between adults when reading this book. That may not matter too much, though. The cartoony couplings (and triplings, and more)are hard to take seriously, even when the participants are seriously hard. Still, it's not for people with tender sensibilities.<br /><br />The good news is that this is a central chapter of a much longer story, so there are prequels and sequels to anticipate. The sad news is that Foglio has not yet given us the rest of that story. I, for one, can't wait.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-09-03

That explains why its reputation is so completely mistaken.<br /><br />Vatsyayana's reputation for describing couples' gymnastics comes from just a few pages out of 200 or so. The rest of this book is about all the other social aspects of men and women in each others' company. It emphasizes the \\"64 arts\\", a liberal education including literacy and literary games, as well as carpentry, cooking, and other domestic skills. It talks about courtship and courtesanship, monogamy and polygamy, brides and widows, and suasion and seduction. It discusses the dark side of human passion, including capturing the object of one's love by main force. There are even love-charms and potions for ensuring faithfulness.<br /><br />I'm not forgetting the discussion physical affection. Yes, there are the many ways for a man and woman to come together. A few are familiar, others acrobatically improbable. Vatsyayana pays attention to many kinds of caresses as well. Some, including love-bites, seem suited only to the most passionate of lovers seeking the strongest sensations. Such acts may not appeal to some readers, but the author keeps coming back to the precept that what's right is what's right for the people involved and for their time and place.<br /><br />Vatsyayana mentions oral sexuality, by and for men, by and for women. He addresses all combinations, but same-sex couples get very little attention. He discusses, in passing, limited use of toys. He also mentions relations with 'eunuchs', apparently a euphemism for homosexual men. I suspect that this confusing usage was introduced by the Victorian translator, sir Richard Burton. I also suspect that the medicinal recipes have lost something in translation. There may be no English words for some plants, but the latin names probably indicate a lot more certainty about species identification than may be justified.<br /><br />The author has a relatively egalitarian view of women, especially when compared to the Arabic \\"Perfumed Garden\\" written over 1000 years later. Still, it's written my a male author for a mostly-male audience. The modern reader must remember that book comes from about the 4th century AD and was translated during the prudish 19th century. It's an historical document; reading it in a modern framework will only cause confusion and detract from the work.<br /><br />After 1700 years, the Kama Sutra has a lot to say to a modern reader. It reminds us that the best lover is man or woman who has many other skills as well. Parts of the advice are obsolete. Even those parts remind us that relations between men and women are endlessly complex, and that the complexity is part of the joy.<br /><br />//wiredweirdview of women, especially when compared to the Arabic \\"Perfumed Garden\\" written over 1000 years later.

By that reasoning, Foglio depicts it done very well. (If it's not a laughing matter for you, just skip the book and the rest of this review.)<br /><br />Volume 5 continues Foglio's visual exploration of the funny side of sex, collected from comic books printed some years ago. It's a series of short stories, all with fantasy or science fiction themes, allowing a lot of room to explore outrageous ideas. That means, for example, that the reader should have a liberal attitude towards dating outside of one's species.<br /><br />Like the other XXXenophile books, this expresses a generally happy and consensual approach to adult play. The overall goofiness assures that the plots won't be taken too seriously. For example, most people wouldn't think that a dark spirit, sent to enforce an evil curse, would be open to seduction. Well, I guess dark spirits have to have a love life, too.<br /><br />None of the short stories are especially memorable, but that makes them easy to enjoy more than once. That's what makes this a book worth owning, the fact that it can be funny more than once.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-09-03

It's written by a contrary, crotchety old man, full of opinions you won't hear anywhere else, and incredibly well-informed. The author was retired from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where he had been curator of prints.  I listen when he talks on the topic of prints, and I think I hear why he waited until retirement to write this book.<br /><br />It starts with a diatribe against classical Roman culture as derivative from Greek, and against classical Greece as `predatory'. He argues that much of the Western classical period was powered by a steady stream of slave labor. As a result, the captors shunned practical arts as demeaning to free men (slave owners). Printed replication of text was well within their technology and would have suited their needs as a reading intelligentsia. The problem was that the presence of slave labor had weakened the slave-owners so much that they couldn't be bothered to carve a printing block. As a result, they created a weakened intellectual heritage, founded on what sounded good instead of what replicated the features of nature. Ivins ties the history of technological innovation to the history of the printed images that educate the innovators. Pictorial information, he argues, enabled the scientific and engineering efflorescence that started in the Renaissance.<br /><br />Ivins supports that premise with a brilliant tour of the history of pictures on paper. He treats the hand-copied and re-copied manuscripts as the prehistory of true image capture. He traces that history forward through the many technologies of image-making, including woodcut, wood engraving, and intaglio print, on up through photos distributed by machine printing. He offers a number of historical anecdotes, some from traditional sources and some from his personal knowledge of the early 20th century.<br /><br />Along the way, he thoroughly debunks the mystique of printmaking. It has, overwhelmingly, been a practical art. Much too much has been made of the artificially limited edition, of the false mystique around specific processes and practices. Back in the 1950s, when this was written, that may have been an especially important message. It's still true, to some extent, but I think it undercuts the modern printers who choose printmaking because of its unique expressive capabilities.<br /><br />Still, it's a clear, well-directed discussion, and illustrated with a rich assortment of demonstrative prints. This book is a treat for anyone interested in the history of prints and pictorial communication; it's a confection for everyone who likes their sacred cows cooked well done.<br /><br />//wiredweirdh too much has been made of the artificially limited edition, of the false mystique around specific processes and practices.

It does cover the physical act of love in some detail. That includes the many poses that couples might try together. It also covers all the lore about what makes a man or woman desirable, and about resizing one's genitals for better performance (larger for him, smaller for her). There's other medical lore, too, including potions for ending an unwanted pregnancy. The most interesting discussion covered techniques suitable when he, she, or both had physical deformities or paraplegia. I guess that the 16th century Arab world lacked modern medicine, so such irregularities were part of everyday life.<br /><br />This differs from the Indian texts in several important ways. First, this discusses sexuality as an isolated topic. It lacks the Kama Sutra's placement of sex as one among many social graces. Second, it adds a number of brief stories, a la 1001 Nights, to illustrate its teachings, and adds a section on dream interpretation. Third, although the Perfumed Garden attends to women's needs in the bedroom, it displays a generally low regard for women elsewhere.<br /><br />Still, this book tells us a lot about two times and places. The first is the 16th century Arabic world, as set down by Sheikh al-Nafzawi (the author). This gives a look at the medicine, the culture, and the folklore of that time. It also tells us about Sir Richard Burton's England, in the Victorian era. Like so many other British translations of that time, the English rendering carries the indelible stamp of its translator and of its period. The Burton translation is decidedly aging - modern phrasing and scholarship would make this a much more interesting book. Still, any translation is better than none, and the Victorian flavor is part of this book's character.<br /><br />There are lots of reasons for reading this book: for its view of mid-Eastern culture, for its view of sexuality, or just for fun. That last is my reason, and it works.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-08-28

She sat for the innumerable photographs that he used for his paintings, she tended his children, she lived with him for decades in his `studio' (a fair-sized house by any standard). He often painted her with a wedding band on her finger. He just never married her.<br /><br />Another woman, Lydia, was his wife. For many years, she lived in the other house on the property, almost a mansion. This peculiar split life, wife and mistress on the same estate, just a few yards a way from each other, was a permanent feature of the Parrish household.<br /><br />It seems to have started innocently enough, when Lewin was hired as nanny and maid to the Parrish household. Parrish had great financial success during his life, enough to build the two grand houses at `The Oaks.' Over time, Lewin became more involved with his art, posing and making costumes, cooking for him and fending off threats to his privacy. At the same time, Parrish became cordially estranged from his wife. There was a curtain of silence around the arrangements, but that is the story told in this remarkable book.<br /><br />It is clear that Lewin had enormous importance in Parrish's work, far more than hard evidence may ever tell. If you like Parrish's work - and it's easy to like - this brief book will give real insight into the art, the man who made it, and the woman who inspired it. The only disappointment in this book is that it doesn't show more of Parrish's famous illustration.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-08-26

A dissertation is basically a book, of a sort. It's lots more, too - more personal investment, usually, subject to more complex constraints, and carried out in a very unusual social setting. The presence of an advisor and dissertation committee is another unusual feature. Bolker spends a good deal of time on the support to expect from each, and how to address unsupportive situations.<br /><br />She states at the outset that dissertations in math and the sciences are outside her main field of expertise, and it shows. Engineering disciplines have another nuance of difference that she didn't even address, a more ambiguous balance between practice and theory. That's a secondary issue, though. Her advice is generally sound for any topic, and no advice will cover all possibilities.<br /><br />I've read it through, and am in a position to see how well her advice holds.

It starts with the man as a young boy, the kind who would spy on the female servants in their bath. The story winds from one seedy, bawdy vignette to another, until the aged Yonosuke sails into the sunset. The times between cycle from one courtesan to another (or to occasional tries at celibacy), from money to poverty, from honest work to the edge of the law, from one bowl of sake to the next, and always back again. There is very little real plot or dramatic buildup, there is very little moral. In fact, we last see Yonosuke sailing happily off with some friends, in search of whatever pleasures their old bones can still support.<br /><br />Yonosuke is often shown as an unpleasant man. His debts tend to go bad, he is given to cruel pranks, and is hardly a model husband in his few tries at domesticity. He is openly disdainful of many of the women he pursues, even as he expects them to provide his enjoyment. Still, when he has money, he will sometimes buy a courtesan's freedom for her. His family disowns him early on, but this prodigal son is later welcomed back. It is never quite clear what the author wants us to think of Yonosuke, if anything at all.<br /><br />The author, Saikau Ihara, was once a successful merchant himself. The story is said to be a composite of his own experiences and those of his friends, as they spent their way across the red light districts of 17th century Japan. It is curious that Ihara wrote about this perpetual hunt for pleasure after suffering deep personal losses and retreating into monastic life. There is no explanation for this apparent contradiction, it is simply left as a puzzle for the reader.<br /><br />This is a translation to be read for enjoyment, not as an academic rendering. In that, it is largely successful. A few explanatory notes would have been helpful, though. I don't know the units of money, for example, so sometimes could not tell whether larger or smaller sums were being discussed - facts that would have changed the meanings of some scenes. Also, some terms describing the courtesans' ranks were unclear, and a few other terms as well. Even so, and with a few ungainly turns of phrase, the English text reads fairly well.<br /><br />//wiredweirdsums were being discussed - facts that would have changed the meanings of some scenes.

The first is a clear introduction to the basics of the JUnit test framework. The pace is gentle, and the entire discussion is built around sample code - very helpful for the beginner who thinks in concrete terms. Link (the author) omits the JUnit API information that's already available in JUnit's JavaDoc pages. Those are just the basic words available in the framework; Link's goal is to put them together into meaningful test phrases. Throughout this half of the book, the reader is shown a number of common situations with non-obvious solutions. At each step, Link presents a little theory (plus some nice references), a little refactoring to improve the system's testability, and enough sample code to make the solution clear. This isn't a textbook on the theory of testing. Still, by the end of this first section, the reader has been exposed to many ideas: coverage metrics, internet resources, design and implementation for testability, and a lot more.<br /><br />The book is heavily oriented towards Java, partly because of the relative wealth of test tools available and because of Java features and APIs that support automated testing. Having chosen Java, it is natural to ask testing for unique features of the Java environment: GUIs, persistence, EJB, servlets, RMI, and more. Link covers those in the book's second half. Many of these chapters are specific to Java technologies and APIs. Some, like the GUI discussion, have value beyond the Java specifics they discuss. Even if the language and APIs change, many of the techniques will work well in any GUI programming environment. This section ends at a strategic level: introducing testing into existing workflows, handling of legacy systems, and management issues.<br /><br />Link has written a very helpful introduction to testing. It has enough specifics to get a beginner started, or to help an old hand deal with the problems of complex systems. The book's practical orientation skips a lot of the history and theory of testing, including tests that deal with qualitative performance issues rather than basic correctness. Anyone reading this book by itself might not realize just how broad and deep the subject really is. Link does at least mention the major ideas in the field, though, and prepares the reader for more advanced discussions.<br /><br />//wiredweirdh specifics to get a beginner started, or to help an old hand deal with the problems of complex systems.

I enjoyed seeing them, in unexpurgated forms, in the context of the script they were meant to adorn. I think I can see wonderful possibilities in staging that play, where modern sensibilities could show and accept what England of 1892 could not. Even so, I found the script itself somewhat repetitive, with more in it to startle than to explain. Perhaps there's a knack to reading this script that I haven't mastered.<br /><br />The second piece, Beardsley's own \\"Under the Hill,\\" is a mortal's visit to the kingdom of Venus, the goddess of love. Although the story has revolting moments, it's easy to become drugged by the thick perfume of his flowery language. The elegant circumlocutions sometimes narrate, other times only suggest effete debauches. The brief story sustains an oddly split mood, comical for its excesses and affectations, darkly fascinating for its content. Beardsley's life was cut short in his 20s, leaving this story unfinished. I have to wonder whether I would actually have wanted to read its entirety.<br /><br />Neither story will suit polite company, nor was meant to. Both, however, give little insights into artists that are still appreciated today. These particular insights may not be 'fun' or 'likeable', but add real information to any view of Wilde or Beardsley.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-08-19

It starts at a very readable pace. The first section (about 100 pages) covers the basics of OO languages and OO features, and establishes a working vocabulary. For example, it introduces the very distinct notions of subclass and subtype early on. That is important, if only because words like \\"subtype\\" have different meanings when used by different authors. Barbara Liskov, for example, used a semantic definition for \\"subtype\\" in her famous substitutability principle, a definition that can not be checked by automatic tools. Here, the definition talks only about the information you might find in a Java interface or C++ abstract class, and can be checked automatically. This early discussion also defines the problem to be solved: creating programming languages that are richly expressive, that compile to efficient code, and that are rigorously type safe, goals that often conflict. The clear statement of the problem is very informative, by itself, and casual readers might stop at this point.<br /><br />The next brief section defines a mathematical notation, a lambda calculus, for discussing types. In this calculus, a \\"record\\" or \\"struct\\" keyword is an operator that aggregates other types together into a new unit, and C++ templates are functions that generate new types. This calculus feeds into a formal logic that proves statements about types the same way standard arithmetic proves statements about numbers.<br /><br />This isn't nearly as daunting as a normal proof of program correctness, by the way. Behavioral correctness deals with a program's changes of state over time; this treats the program as a static, compile-time entity. Also, for better or worse, it skips the most of the category theory that often accompanies type formalisms.<br /><br />The remaining 200 pages or so constitute the real meat of the discussion. Bruce takes the first section's intuitive ideas about types and languages, phrases them in the second section's formalism, and uses that language to analyze several small, purpose-built OO languages with different type systems. Along the way, Bruce makes a few remarkable claims. One is that, although multiple inheritance can cause pragmatic problems for developers, it's no big deal for the mathematical tools. The real problem is deciding what you mean by multiple inheritance, where C++ and Eiffel provide only two of the possible answers. (Agreed - coming up with something useful to say is often harder than saying it.) Another is that classes really aren't necessary for strong OO typing. Classes are just names for collections of features, and it's the features in the collections that matter. (I see the theory, but I'm not sure that this leads to practical improvements in language design.) Many of these results are quite clear even if you, like me, skip some of the hairier proofs.<br /><br />This is certainly not a book for a beginner to programming or to OO. It's really about the theory of how languages work. It will be of use to developers who create new languages, compilers, or language-smart CASE tools. I doubt that most others will find information relevant to their work. If you really care about the fussy bits of an OO language's type system, though, this book will be very helpful.<br /><br />//wiredweirdt types and languages, phrases them in the second section's formalism, and uses that language to analyze several small, purpose-built OO languages with different type systems.

There are great leaps in time, with no apparent explanation. Things that should have seemed vitally important, like raising three children, are dismissed in a few scattered lines. Sarashina simply walks out on a once-in-a-lifetime imperial ceremony, but returns again and again to the sight of the moonlight.<br /><br />Sarashina, the pseudonym we have for her, lived and wrote in the first half of the 11th century, in Heian Japan. It is a wonderful quirk of history that this era hosted so many educated, literate women, with cloistered lives that allowed time for introspection. The authors of The Gossamer Years and Shonagon's Pillow Book lived during that same era, and even had family connections to Sarashina.<br /><br />She wrote this memoir near the end of her life, and seemed to use it as a package for presenting her life. Like an elegantly wrapped package, this tantalizes us by hiding the real substance inside. We read a little of her role in the imperial court, but never see into the closed society of the women's quarters. We see a courtier's career interrupted by family duties, but quite make out what those duties were. We learn that her husband was influential enough to be named regional governor, but we never see her part in his court or how that related to her imperial service. Instead, we read a few conversations, travelogues, and poems, the kind that hide more than they reveal.<br /><br />As a child, she had a passion for romantic stories. She used those tales to enter worlds of elegant people and beautiful places. It was only in her thirties that she came back to earth, and realized that she had let too much time go by. She did marry, but was widowed early. She did have a comfortable life as lady in waiting, but never found her way into the court's inner circle.

That's really where Ewens and Grant start, with the best high-density review of probability I know.<br /><br />The first two chapters cover probabilities of one and many variables, respectively. This includes several topics that other authors equently skip, including conditional and marginal probabilities, probability- and moment-generating functions, a little about entropy, distributions of sums, and extreme value statistics. All that takes about 100 pages. Two later chapters cover statistical inference (parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, and Bayesian techniques), two more cover stochastic processes including Markov models, a short chapter includes hidden Markov models and their training, and another chapter covers sampling techniques: bootstraps, permutation tests and such.<br /><br />If the book contained only that material, it would still be a valuable review and summary of basic probability. It's way too dense to be a beginner's text. That's OK, those chapters were really intended as a review and as a statement of the terms and notation used in the book's real objectives: models of biological systems.<br /><br />The chapters on biological applications are interspersed with chapters on basics, so that each application is presented as soon as its elements are covered. Those chapters describe statistical properties of a single DNA or protein string, relationships between two strings, BLAST and its scoring models, mutation modeling, and construction of phylogenetic trees. Coverage of each topic is brief but very dense. A surprising amount of information is packed into each brief chapter, and it's surprisingly readable. Still, these are big topics. Ewens and Grant don't and don't try to present any topic to its full depth. Instead, they give enough discussion that a determined reader can learn the basics, and can understand more advanced discussions of specific topics.<br /><br />The book does require a determined reader with some background in probability - this shouldn't be anyone's first book, unless you have a very skilled teacher. The prepared and careful reader will be very well rewarded, however. Despite the book's title about statistics and bioinformatics, this is a reference you may use for probability models in any field. It's certainly one that I keep coming back to.<br /><br />//wiredweirddoes require a determined reader with some background in probability - this shouldn't be anyone's first book, unless you have a very skilled teacher.

In some cases, even slightly different hosts have very different parasites - the connections can be very close. Hosts change, though. They migrate to new ranges and split, through evolution, into new species. The parasites that depend on those hosts must adapt or die.<br /><br />This creates fascinating relationships between the family trees of the host and parasite species. That is the subject of this book: the study of the parasite's phylogeny, in terms of the host's. (The reasoning can be applied to symbionts or to species with other dependency relationships, as well.) The book is a series of mongraphs by different authors, all discussing various aspects of coevolution. The actual times and places of speciation events are lost to history, so much of the discussion centers on ways to create credible phylogentic histories, and to estimate the probability of any guess being accurate.<br /><br />About 2/3 of the book is biologically oriented: case studies of various host/parasite relationships, actually families of hosts and related families of parasites. Some of these are very interesting. One uses presence of a single parasite to argue for a close relationship between two rodent clades. Others describe coevolution at different scales, subject to different forces, or in different biological systems. I have to admit, though, that the biology is tangential to my own interests.<br /><br />The first third of the book is more mathematical, the material that's closer to my own needs. It starts with a basic discussion of the events - branching in the family tree, jumping between branches, and so on. This includes discussion of approaches to take for resolving two trees, scoring mechanisms for evaluating conjectured relationships, and more. It's also a logical next step in bioinformatics. Historically, solved problems turn into steps in larger problems. Once, just getting a sequence was an achievement. Next, the sequence was taken for granted and comparison of two was the achievement. Successively, comparisons became steps in tree-building algorithms, then individual trees became pieces of \\"consensus trees\\", statistically graded estimates of history. This study takes different trees as the inputs, and creates histories of coevolution between them.<br /><br />This would be a good second or third book on coevolution and computational support for the study. Unfortunately, there does not currently seem to be a first book - this just leaps into advanced discussions that assume a large base of knowledge. The references are all to current journal articles, in biology, evolution, and mathematical graph theory. Well, that's a normal part of the progression from a specialist study to a widely-known body of practice. Introductory material may not exist for some years to come.<br /><br />For now, this seems to be the only book around that describes computational analysis of coevolution at all. This is not for the cut-and-paste programmer, but serious software developers will find some good basics and references.<br /><br />//wiredweirdken for granted and comparison of two was the achievement.

It is an ecological failure in some post-apocalyptic, post-technological world. The kingdom wrestles its living from the scorched earth, even as the \\"corrupted\\" forest advances. A young girl must take control, although women have never ruled. There is a force within her --<br /><br />The eco-fable gets a bit thick at times. Also, the narrative seems to jump, as if the writer just stepped past some plot hurdle that the reader must leap. Still, the story flows fairly well. Most transitions make sense, or will make sense in a moment.<br /><br />I value good artwork, and this is good. It's \\"black and white\\", but black is replaced by a warm brown. The paper also has that held-back character: unfussy, and not so bright that the ink color gets lost - a thoughtful compromise. The few color spreads remind me of Moebius, but Miyazaki's artwork is unique.<br /><br />Miyazaki has done some relatively recent movies - notably 'Spirited Away' - that cemented his reputation as visual storyteller. Movies like that, even with computer aid, are expensive, though. Studios want to see a proven performance record before speculating on the next production. Nausicaa, I'm sure, is part of why the studios chose to back his movies, or at least the first.<br /><br />This comic is enjoyable in its own right. It's even more enjoyable when seen as one piece of Miyazaki's ouvre, and one moment in his career as story-teller.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-08-13

Darwin moved the creation of species out of the Biblical garden. James Hutton, though little-known today, had a similar role. He moved the origin of the Earth out of Biblical creation and flooding, into the realm of observable, testable fact.<br /><br />It may not sound like much today, but it was just as shattering a shift in its time. Hutton's theory of geology had the added impact of informing Darwin, and preparing that later scientist for changes in species as gradual and continuous as the changes in the earth under them.<br /><br />Repcheck's biography of Hutton describes the man, his times, and the debates that followed his theory. Repcheck starts with background - some history of the Bible and Christian doctrine, of Scotland in general, and of Edinburgh in particular. Hutton's time must have been an exciting one. It's now called the 'Scottish Enlightenment,' and gave rise to Adam Smith, James Watt, and many other great thinkers. Repcheck then gives a very readable account of Hutton's life and the successors who guarded his intellectual heritage.<br /><br />The book is a clear, readable account of the man that made study of the world into a science instead of a branch of Biblical scholarship. Repcheck never fully engaged my imagination or passion for the character, though. There's background material up to page 100 or beyond, with some speculation on how the young Hutton fit into the Edinburgh that Repcheck so clearly documents. Hard facts about Hutton start to appear about that point. Hutton then dies before page 165 (out of 250 pages or fewer). His ideas live on, but the book says surpringly little about Hutton the man.<br /><br />It's a short, informative history of the origin of modern geology, and a brief picture of the man who brought that origin about. This is not the most vivid character protrayal I've seen, but it adds a welcome chapter to the history of science.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-08-12

A serious scholar would certainly come away with a different impression.<br /><br />The book has a lot to like. It's a Watson translation, and it lives up to his usual high standards of readability. Watson has compressed the book, omitting many sections generally taken to be tedious. He does give profuse notes, however, describing the omissions and enriching understanding of the text.<br /><br />The text itself covers the Spring and Autumn period of Chinese history, about 250 years ending somwehat after Confucius' death. (This is not the Spring and Autumn Annals, though.) The Tso Chuan describes many major figures to which reference is made in later literature. It decribes major wars of the period, court intrigues, prophecies, moral lessons, gallantry, and treachery. All of these come through in anecdotes usually a page or two long.<br /><br />The anecdotal style is the first of my problems with the book. It looks more like a series of isolated snapshots, less like a unified whole. I guess I'm used to modern histories, where commentary and causal connection help the reader see the larger picture. Also, Watson softened the blow, but the Tso Chuan still hits the reader with many alternative names and titles for historical figures. Place names often referred to cities or states long gone, or referred to them in allusive ways. My western ear is poorly tuned to Chinese names to start with, so this just caused confusion. It's embarassingly easy to see why Japanese scholars have a term set aside for readers who intend to go through the whole text, but abandon the effort early on.<br /><br />Many of the stories are amusing, many display the morals or beliefs of the time, and many describe events of great cultural importance. On the whole, though, the general-interest reader will need discipline to work through this book. Its kaleidoscopic shifts of unfamiliar people, place, time, and events can be very hard to follow.<br /><br />//wiredweirdedweird	2004-08-11

It starts with a brief history of writing in general, then of the Roman alphabet now used for most European languages. Along the way, we see a few hints about the history of page layout and other typographic concerns. The book devotes a few pages to the skilled craft of punch-cutting, of carving the steel stamps that represented the master copies from which metal type was replicated.<br /><br />That just sets the stage, though. The next 250 pages or so cover the history of printed text in Europe and the New World. It's an amazing journey, filled with rich characters. Gutenberg was only one of those characters, and his bankruptcy played a surprising role in the spread of printing. Chappell followed through, era by era, until the start of photocomposition, somewhat after WWII. Bringhurst added the section on computer typesetting and all-electronic fonts, bringing the story quite up to date.<br /><br />Bringhurst has done an elegant, seamless job of updating Chappell's original work. This is a posthumous collaboration that actually works, to my happy surprise. The book tells a coherent story in a very readable way, without bogging down in pedantic detail. The history of print can't really be told in just 300 pages, but this is an outstanding summary. It provides the framework and structure for the full story. Interested readers will look elsewhere to furnish the framework with detail, but will keep coming back to give context to those finer points.<br /><br />With Bringhurst as collaborating author, you know that this book has to be a joy to read, both in its prose and in the structure of the physical book itself. I suggest it to anyone interested in typography, printing, or history in general.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-08-09

It is the only process that gives such delicate nuances of light and dark, the \\"mezzo\\" in its name. Even aquatint's tonal qualities are generally crude by comparison.<br /><br />Wax first shows the technique of mezzotint process. It starts with a ground that prints beautiful, silky blacks. Unlike other printmaking techniques, the artist then makes lighter marks on this dark field. This technical information is very helpful when looking at actual mezzotints - it lets you read each mark in the print with better understanding.<br /><br />Wax includes a huge gallery of mezzotint prints, her own and other printmakers'. The reproductions are very good. They show how the process evolved from a technique for reproducing other artwork into an art in itself. Something is always lost in photo reproductions of these prints, but Wax's gallery should be enough to entice you into wanting to see more.<br /><br />This is the only book I know dedicated to this most unusual printmaking technique. I recommend it to any serious maker or afficionado of fine prints.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-08-09

The collection is noteworthy for its breadth, and also for its emphasis on that very recent century.<br /><br />Dore works from the early part of the century - 00s to 20s - up to the latest (80s, when the book appeared). The progression is interesting. It shows broad trends from the turn of the century, through two World Wars, up to the Reagan era. The number of different artists, well-known and not, is the real strength of this book. Ashton quote scores of artists on the topic of their craft.<br /><br />Therein lie many weaknesses. First is the sheer number of artists cited. Given that many artists, not all can be of the first rank, or even people of whom I've heard. Well, I read this to learn, so that's not too bad. Second is the artists omitted, Kandinsky and Dali being obvious by their absence. I'll just hope that Dore meant for those artists' own publications to represent the artists themselves, or for copyright problems to be self-explanaory. Third is the arrangement of quotations: 1900s to 20, 20s to 40s, and 40s onward (to mid-80s). This creates boundaries at arbitrary dates, and positively misrepresents the active eras of many artists. Fourth is the fact of collecting Artists on Art - an open invitation to pretension, which was accepted many times over. Longer writings seem to show more thought and less manifesto. The very form of this book prevents proper representation of the artists' thoughts.<br /><br />On the whole, though, this book succeeds. If nothing else, it provides an index in which the serious student (maybe the not-so-serious, too) can find references for further reading.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-08-06

There are over 250 of them, all unique, all showing the characteristic grain and coloring of the species. The eye-candy is just the icing on a very substantial cake, however.<br /><br /> Suppose you cut down an apple tree and decide to keep the lumber - do you season in the round, or cut it first? How long will it take? As well as the right way to season each wood, this gives its resistance to insect attack and special considerations in machining, nailing, veneering, and gluing. Only so much can be said in one page, but Lincoln covers the basics in a systematic way.<br /><br /> Appendices cross-reference the common and latin names, and list suppliers and organizations that provide information. Those tables are helpful but weak. Suppliers come and go too fast for that list to have lasting value. The \\"table of uses\\" of each species in each application is also helpful but limited. Veneer is not mentioned in that table, even though Lincoln discusses it elsewhere. The indices could also handle conflicting names better. I just gained access to some fresh-cut American linden, and wanted to know how to season it. The word 'linden' has only one index entry, even though the name is applied to several species, and that entry doesn't match the linden I have. I was supposed to look for 'basswood.' Now I know, but lists of synonyms would have helped. More information about each wood would have been useful, too: which woods create dust with breathing hazards? What about the percent change, radially and tangentially, during drying? How does the appearance change when quartersawed?<br /><br /> Still, the book's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. It's just pretty to look at, for one thing, but it has good information as well. I'm happy with it.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-08-04

Nominally, this book presents \\"archetype patterns\\", using UML and an extended case study. The archetype idea, intermediate between a general design pattern and a specific application, is a valuable one. In the case study, it's a set of business meta-objects, operations, and organizing principles. In presenting the archetype abstraction, those objects are spelled out in enough detail to create a useable framework for routine business needs.<br /><br /> The archetype mechanism is also spelled out in great detail, almost wholly within the UML framework. By itself, this won't be enough to convince any UML doubters about UML's flexibility. Taken as one among many UML applications, however, it's very compelling. It's also the first reference I know that gets down to cases in applying MDA - an interesting view. I fault the technique for only two things. First is a slight dependence on a specific CASEproduct, ArcStyler. That reliance never turned all the way into an advertisement, so I'll let it pass. Second is a baffling section on \\"rules.\\" The rules and rule mechanisms make sense, but inexplicably seem to re-create the features of the OCL.<br /><br /> Two extras make this presentation very attractive. First is the mention of \\"literate programming,\\" tying the UML tool suite to user documentation and design documentation. They specifically note XML and DocBook, existing standards, as the vehicle for integrating prose and technical parts of the model. Bravo! Even if their LP tools are weak, use of the idea is a real strength. The second extra is a pervasive awareness of standards. Money is phrased in terms of ISO 4217, nations in terms of ISO 3166, books in terms of ISBNs (ISO 2108), and on and on. Far too few programmers realize how many of their software requirements are already spelled out in external standardslike these, so the consciousness-raising exercise is a good one.<br /><br /> This is an excellent resource, not just for its business objects and not just for its UML case study. The author treat even personal names (table 4.4) with more care than I've seen anywhere else - that care pervades the whole book, and is a lesson in itself.<br /><br />//wiredweirdthor treat even personal names (table 4.4) with more care than I've seen anywhere else - that care pervades the whole book, and is a lesson in itself.    //wiredweird	2004-08-03

A western woodworker might consider \\"joinery\\" to be dovetails, part of finish carpentry or fine woodworking. The joints shown here are far more elaborate, and are applied to construction framing.<br /><br /> The first half of this book describes the joints themselves. These elaborate connections aren't just a woodworker's showmanship, however. One joint may have different features that prevent side-slipping, prevent rotation, carry weight, and admit a key to keep the assembly from backing out. Another joint may connect a vertical, two aligned horizontals, and one or two more horizontals at right angles to the others. With a little practice, you may learn to read the purpose of each feature, and even create new joints for your unique needs.<br /><br /> The second half of this book is about framing, about using those joints for walls, floors, roofs, and second stories. It shows the all-wood joints at work. It also shows the Japanese genius at work, the skill that accepts the best of other worlds and makes it their own. All-wood construction serves only ritual or conservation needs these day. The authors show how traditional joints work with many kinds of metal fasteners. Classic artisanry is not a competitor to modern technique, it's a complement.<br /><br /> One appendix shows that this is not a book of Western carpentry. It summarizes the religious ceremony that blesses the construction project and is \\"intended as a memorial for the numerous plants, various insects, and small creatures that would be destroyed during building on the property.\\" Reading that, I felt a real sense of loss at our developers' relative carelessness.<br /><br /> The book's line drawings are beautifully clear, but require careful reading. Whether or not you ever follow their directions, this book is a joy to view and an endless source of ideas for the woodworker.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-08-03

It starts with a brief description of the DNA microarrays, their chemistry, and the sources of uncertainty in their measurements, just enough for a non-biologist to get the general ideas. It skips the steps of scanning and spot recognition, mostly, and jumps right into analysis of the array of spot readings.<br /><br />  That is where the text comes into its own. One happy surprise is the book's emphasis on quality control and error management. Quality issues are addressed first by themselves, then as they affect the design and analysis of an experiment's biological meaning. This covers a wide variety of issues, including dye swaps, array background correction, and inference in the presence of low-quality data. There are soft spots in the discussion, especially in handling of missing data. That fits the general tone of the book, though, by stressing understanding over rigor.<br /><br />  This book comes with a macro package for the R environment, an open-source system somewhat like Matlab or Mathematica. That is both the strength and the weakness of this book. The strength of course, is the working code. It lets you see a real implementation of the algorithms that the authors describe. The weakness is that the implementations don't explain how the algorithms were developed, why they work, or how to recognize when they've been pushed past their breaking points. If you need more than rote recitation of the authors' implementation, you may find this frustrating. Also, the book uses five data sets for concrete discussion, but the software kit seems to include only one.<br /><br />  Microarray data sets (a few individual with thousands of measurements each) are very different from standard statistical data sets (lots of individuals with few measurements each). Despite the dramatic improvements of the last few years, the processing of the arrays themselves still varis widely under even the tightest control. Microarrays really do need different kinds of analysis and experimental design. This is a very readable explanation of why and how those procedures are used. I just wish the procedures themselves were presented in a little more depth.<br /><br />//wiredweirdghtest control. Microarrays really do need different kinds of analysis and experimental design.

This is definitely a book for beginning OO programmers, the ones who aren't sure how to assign functions to objects and who aren't ready for design patterns yet. More experienced developers won't get much out of it, but that's OK. Every level needs its own reference books.<br /><br /> The book's layout and illustrations present its content well. UML diagrams, for example, use one color and typeface for the actual UML notation. The same diagrams use a different color and typeface for notes that explain the UML. Unlike other books, there's no confusion about which is the tool and which describes the tool. The text is gentle and reasonably jargon-free, but I think it over-does the friendliness in places. In discussing a program's normal and exception handling behavior, the term \\"happy path\\" described the execution in the absence of errors. The term may be evocative, but is just a bit hard to take seriously.<br /><br /> The sequence of topics makes good sense. It starts with the idea of a \\"responsibility,\\" the basic unit of application logic. The authors develop this into strategies for defining objects, defining relationships between objects, and defining the control strategies that implement those relationships. They continue on through error handling (reliability) and extensibility - handling of future features. Throughout, the authors keep a moderate, pragmatic tone, free of name-brand methodology. That's a good thing, since the real focus is on basic skills and decision criteria.<br /><br /> One aspect of this book is just a little confusing. It's definitely aimed at educating a new OO designer, but it doesn't lay out its educational objectives or plan very clearly. It certainly lacks the didactic rigor of a textbook. It would make a good supplementary text, though, and it might be very helpful to a novice working with more experienced developers. Best of all, it refers to additional texts (including Strunk and White!) that will help claify the programs as well as communication with other members of the programming team.<br /><br /> This book is great for anyone starting OO design on their own. It's also good for classroom students who just aren't getting it from their regular instructor and text. Experienced developers won't find much new here, except very clear descriptions of how much error handling or flexibility is enough.<br /><br />//wiredweirdncluding Strunk and White!) that will help claify the programs as well as communication with other members of the programming team.

At a more accessible level, it lists the frequencies of notes in several musical scales, information about common wire sizes, astronomical information, the chemical makeup of the human body, and ways to create carefully controlled humidity. That last one can be helpful to woodworkers; this book really does have something for almost everyone.<br /><br />Although it comes out every few years, most people won't need to update very often.

He's all the best and all the worst a boy about five can be, and that covers a lot of ground.<br /><br />If the others around him never quite see things Calvin's way, that's really not his problem. Hobbes will always understand, and generally offer some understated commentary on events. I prefer not to say too much about Hobbes. It's really best if you let him introduce himself.<br /><br />This book is a treasury of daily and sunday color strips. It captures a part of one of the best strip comics ever. If you already know C&H, you'll surely want this collection.

Hobbes is a mysterious being. With Calvin, he's a charming, philosophical, debonair spirit of the natural world. When Calvin's parents appear, he becomes something completely different - if you don't already know, I won't spoil the surprise.<br /><br />Calvin travels to distant planets, he battles dinosaurs or becomes them, he commands travel through time, and he is plagued by his evil robot alter-ego. His parents and teachers disagree, of course. Through it all, he remains blindly and merrily the star of his own show. There really is something seductive about his little world, and the way it spins only around himself. If there's a tragedy in growing up, Calvin leaves it for you to define for yourself.<br /><br />This is a wonderful collection of C&H strips. It's too bad that Watterson shut the comic strips down long ago, but he didn't want C&H to lose their freshness. Maybe he need not have worried - ten years later, these haven't lost anything.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-07-24

It could work well as a textbook, or one of several texts for a term course.<br /><br />It gives a systematic introduction to several high-level notations, describing the conceptual, executable, structural (or module), and code views. Most of the notation is well-formed UML, and the authors take care to add semantic notes to every part of the graphical notation. They supplement the standard notations with a few text-based extensions. These capture requirements, archtiectural decisions, risks and risk mitigation, and other operating features of a living software project.<br /><br />One real asset is the related set of brief case studies at the end of the book, three separate products with a common conceptual base. This book is aging, it dates back to 1999 - five years, as I write this. That's old in the \\"architecture\\" literature, and the authors fail to apply the \\"product line\\" notion. I take this book for its good, though, and lack of one buzzword is a small enough fault.<br /><br />The book uses a process-and-pipe model pervasively for architectural description. It's a good tool, but other tools are good for other purposes, and their omission is a problem here.<br /><br />Still, the book is competent on the whole. Its sustained product-line example ties the whole together, and it focusses on practice intead of mainfestos and brand-name methodologies. There's a lot of good here, and you can pick out out easily.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-07-24

Hoadley gives a variety of different points used in identifying the wood's species. He then discusses the effects of cutting green wood in different ways, drying it (how-to, how long, when it's done, etc), and machining it.<br /><br /> Hoadley doesn't discuss woodworking machines per se, but gives a lot of attention to the interaction of blade and material. He shows the details of how cutting tools affect the visible surface of the wood, and the problems that can come from poor edges, blade angles, pressure, and other factors. He also discusses joining pieces of wood, gluing them, and finishing them.<br /><br /> There is so much here that it's omissions are more noteworthy. It discusses glue joints, but says very little about specific adhesives. That's fair - there are so many, for so many purposes, that the topic deserves an encyclopedia of its own. Also, the adhesives and bonding techniques used commercially are very different from the ones available to home woodworkers or small shops. Any detailed discussion of adhesives would have missed someone's needs. Ditto finishes - the topic is mentioned only briefly. Hoadley's most surprising advice about finishes is the idea of skipping them altogether. He's passionate about the wood itself, and a \\"least is best\\" approach shows the material to its best advantage.<br /><br /> With it's profuse and beautiful illustrations, this could be a coffee table book. The information around the pictures is the book's real strength. I find something new in it each time I come back.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-07-21

This book makes a good effort at filling that role, however.<br /><br />The graphics programmer is likely to find this very useful. It integrates C application code with shader examples. It also discusses on-the fly compilation, use of resources for shader source code, the relationships between vertex and pixel shaders, texture samplers, and 'techniques' for pulling all the pieces together. Performance programming gets some discussion, but isn't a central topic. Appendices specify the shader language in dryly formal terms, but the descriptive chapters make most language features very clear.<br /><br />The shader programming model is decidedly non-standard. A rendering program does not work at all like a C program. Yes, a C/C++ programmer will be able to follow a shader's internals easily enough. The problem, though, is that a C program is in charge of what data gets handled when. Everything in a rendering program is silently a callback, however. It's invoked by some execution engine that sequences the input and output data, and even synchronizes multiple (and almost invisible) threads of execution. The hardware rendering program also interacts strongly with the application running in the main processor, partly through \\"semantics\\", reflective \\"annotations\\", and various parameter-setting mechanisms. There is a huge amount of mechanism at work, and it gives the real meaning to the interacting programs on the host and graphics engine. That mechanism is described in a black-box way, what it does rather than how it works. I think I've reverse engineered the workings, enough for my purposes, but this book did not address my needs directly.<br /><br />Still, it's the best I've found. Real graphics programs, like games and scientific visualization, are much more than lines and circles. This book, with its examples, will surely help the beginner acquire a working knowledge.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-07-19

The original form, before short-lived \\"Outland\\" or the current \\"Opus\\", is long gone, though. Picking up this book was a wonderful piece of nostlagia.<br /><br />The series peaked some time in the early 80s, and \\"Babylon\\" offers a sample of that time. I had forgotten how topical it was, full of references to then-current supermodels, presidents, movies, and sitcoms. Despite that, much of the humor has aged well. Milo's anxiety closet, for example, never needs to end. Various bogey-men (and -women) will reside there for their times, and move on. The anxiety will always be there, however, no matter how silly it looks to everyone else.<br /><br />Even a book this size can't capture every strip in the five years (82-6) that it covers. That means that some of my favorite characters, like winsome Pistachio, barely even had cameo appearances. I'll take what I can get, though, and this is a pleasant sample.<br /><br />If you ever liked any strip comic, you liked Bloom County or will like it. Maybe the 80s were before your time, but the characters will still look right up to date. Enjoy!<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-07-19

It phrases its points as a series of theorems, with a number of case studies at the end. The theorems all stop just short legible technique. The examples, though exciting, all presuppose command of technique. I regret that I never found that missing piece within myself. That piece was the one that connects deep theorems about abstract N-dimensional pseudodistances into working fluency about CAT scans.<br />I did, however, get some understanding of the kinds of problems that the authors address. They are some of the analytic functions, with linear or nonlinear constraints. In particular, they are functions of high dimensions - thousands or millions of constraints - amenable to fairly fine-grained optimization. They are not discrete problems, like the Travelling Salesman. They are not problems with hugely jagged reward surfaces, like &quot;motif finding&quot; problems in bioinformatics. They are not genetic algorithms, Monte Carlo searches, or combinatorial problems. The authors do in fact parallelize a number of important optimization problems, including CAT scans, transportation planning, and radiation therapy, but not all optimization techniques.<br />Those problems span only a small part of the parallelizable world. The broad promise in the title &quot;Parallel Optimization&quot; was only partly kept. Some parallelization techniques were presented, as well as some interesting perspetives on numerical optimization. Optimization is a large field, however, and this is only a small map.<br />Still, for that range of problems, it seems to offer the right reader profound insight. I can not be sure, though, since I'm not the right reader. I give it three stars, just because I had to give something. Different people will assign this book very different value.	2004-07-19

There's too much of everything in it: fear, love, certainty, and uncertainty. There isn't any \\"happily ever after.\\" The story ends up happy, for as long as we can see it, but the ever after has a dark cloud hanging over it.<br /><br />Froud and DeLint have written a compact story about a modern woman's encounter with the other side of nature. It comes and goes at the edge of her mind, until it takes her in completely. When it does, she finds a man there - someone who seems to step between the worlds at will.<br /><br />Each chapter starts with some of Froud's spidery artwork. Unfortunately, the artwork isn't the book's main content. The story mostly makes up for that disappointment, though. It's a completely modern story, but projects a timeless sense of mystery. This one is definitely worth coming back to.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-07-19

This is a completely adequate reference for the basic ARM architecture, including the Thumb instruction set.<br /><br />This is a reference book, not an instruction manual - you'll probably be happiest with this book if you already know at least one or two other assembly languages. Given that background, you might like the ARM ISP. It's a very regular RISC. The Thumb subset is even more stripped-down, but lets you pack parts of you code almost twice as densely as usual.<br /><br />If you've gotten this far, you already know that there are dozens of ARM implementations, with different add-ons and special features.

That seems hard to come by. Microsoft's documentation, in web-entangled form, is hardly a tutorial. Vendor documentation mostly points to MS standards, but those are hard for us mere peons to acquire in any intelligible form. This isn't a langauge ref book, but will do until I see a real one.<br />Second, it gives a good bunch of tips'n'tricks, with lots of listings for illumination models, shadows, and fog. The careful reader will look into the references, the places where new knowledge makes its debut, and will be stronger for it. There's also a chapter that devotes itself to v1 vs. v2. vs v3 compatibility and more. Compatibility is the pits - if you've never dealt with it, your career is probably happy and probably very young.<br />I was looking for something a little different, though. I just wanted the HLSL and assembly references, with versions, with complete syntax and semantics. This gives enough info for me to guess my way through a lot of it, but really does leave me guessing. For example, p.47 talks about the &quot;_bx2&quot; modifier. It shows three different ways to coax the compiler into emitting that suffix. After about ten minutes of looking at source and asm code, I finally figured out what _bx2 meant - something the authors neglected to tell me.<br />Shader programming is still a [forgive the phrase] dark art. This book offers a few chants and incantations, but does not make it a science. Still, it's the most coherent reference I've seen, and I'm sticking with it.	2004-07-16

It has the two female leads (including the girl soldier), always a moment away from disaster, a moment away from rescue, and a moment away from bouncing out of the costume.

It's not about encryption, it's about secure protocols. This is great stuff. It includes secure key exchange, where you and I can agree on an encryption key in a public conversation, but none of the other listeners know what we agreed on. It includes zero-knowledge proofs, ways of establishing authorization without releasing your identity. It includes lots more, as well. The next brief section discusses different modes for using encryption algorithms, key management, and other logistics.<br />The third section is what you might have expected: detailed descriptions of many encryption schemes, taking up at least half the book. That includes public key schemes, private key codes, secure hashing algorithms, and all the other details needed for implementing the algorithms. One of the most useful subsections here is a set of pseudorandom number generators. It's not exhaustive, by any means - it omits the Mersenne Twister, for example. Still, it gives a fair set of algorithms, some of which are &quot;cryptographically secure&quot;. That means the generator's output strongly resists attempts to find regularities, just the way a truly random sequence would.<br />The last two chapters give a brief summary of the practice, legalities, and even culture around cryptography.<br />This won't make you into a crypto professional. Despite its  600+ pages, it barely introduces the world of crypto and certainly doesn't release anything from the &quot;closed&quot; world of government agencies. It will, however, give you useful algorithms, a basic background, and an appreciation of just what real crypto is about. That last may be the most important part. Too many people think inventing a good code is like making love: anyone can do it, and they instinctively do it better than most people. Wrong! Real crypto is not for dabblers, and this book gives some sense of what is involved.<br />The first edition of &quot;Applied Cryptography&quot; was a landmark text, but the second edition is even better. It's so much better that, if you just have the first edition, you really should upgrade to the second, and I've never said that about any other book.some sense of what is involved.<br />The first edition of &quot;Applied Cryptography&quot; was a landmark text, but the second edition is even better.

It addresses the classic kinds of optimization targets: differentiable (mostly) and unimodal (mostly), with or without constraints of various kinds.<br /><br />Maybe that sounds a little naive and optimistic by today's standards. It still describes a large class of useful problems, though, and may help with end-stage refinement of local optima found other ways. Even genetic optimization algorithms can benefit from classical techniques - a Lamarckian mutation operator may actively seek local improvement instead of relying purely on random perturbation.<br /><br />Gill covers a variety of techniques, using the first or second derivatives or discrete approximations. He also presents a simplex technique, not to be confused with the simplexes used in linear optimizations. Throughout, he puts strong emphasis on numerical stability and on the relative strengths and weaknesses of each approach, all the way back to the linear systems that approximate each step of the analysis.<br /><br />It's not a recent book, but that is part of its value. Many of its techniques are almost lost. They have been included by specialists into canned analysis tools, hidden from sight, and forgotten even by the people who use them. I often need to go back to these basics, and very few more recent books are as clear or complete, over this book's range of topics.<br /><br />Gill has written clearly enough for a careful programmer to implement the algorithms. There is not much here for theoreticians or cut&paste hackers, but it's a useful reference for someone willing to put the time into understanding.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-07-13

As with so many other crafts in Japan, it is both like and very unlike matching Western craft.<br /><br />First, there is the wide variety of different binding styles. Some are very distinctive. In the accordion and 'flutter' books, the first and last pages are bound to the covers. The rest of the pages are fan-folded, either one long strip or sheets pasted together. Other bindings, whether Chinese, Korean, or uniquely Japanese in style, tie or glue the pages into a more Western stack. The end of this book shows traditional outer covers for books, partial or complete boxes. The are made uniquely for each volume or set, to give it additional protection.<br /><br />The tools, materials, and techniques are laid out clearly. The authors show first show the traditional craft, as it has been practiced since the Heian era (ca. 1000 AD). They also show how modern materials can be used instead of or in addition to the older ones. The technique for each binding or box is spelled out in clear pictures and text.<br /><br />Clear technique is what makes this book. It gives the scholar a good understanding of how a master artisan would prepare or repair each artifact. It also gives the home crafter the ability to adapt classic techniques to modern uses, from keepsake albums to collections of a child's art. The structure of most Japanese books is simple enough for a child to imitate with some kind of success, even though the book's examples approach museum quality. With a little thought, the techniques can be adapted to almost any level of skill.<br /><br />This is book is very enjoyable, even if you just read it. If you go ahead and try some of the techniques shown, you'll enjoy it even more. You may even get results that you'll enjoy for years to come.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-07-12

Each two-page spread shows a new piece, well printed, together with at least one quote from the artist's writings or interviews.<br />&quot;Brief&quot; is the key word, though. There are only a few dozen of his works here. The quotations are nearly all one-sentence sound bites, cut loose from the context that gave them their original meanings. What's even more confusing is that, although the pictures are in time order, the quotations are not. In fact, very few quotations have anything to do with the pictures they accompany, except in the compiler's mind.<br />Anyone unfamiliar with Matisse will find this a brief, digestible introduction. The afficionado will be disappointed.	2004-07-08

That hasn't changed. What has changed since the 70s is how that wealth is use. Back then it was hoarded, now it is bought, sold, leased, borrowed, traded, and invested.<br />This book covers a wide range of business models, both good and bad, with case studies for each. Most samples are mentioned only briefly, like RCA's response to the transistor. (They invested more in vacuum tubes!) Three major case studies show three major strategies for the trade in ideas: Xerox, Intel, and IBM. The Xerox model never successfully opened itself to the marketplace of ideas, and Xerox suffered for it. Intel, by contrast, went for years with no formal R&amp;D group of its own. accepting and improving others' technology. IBM showed how a company could transform itself from an innovation hermit to a gregarious buyer and seller of technology.<br />The book is very readable. It gives enough information to make each point clear, in terms of real companies in the recent past. The author avoids both MBA jargoneering and academic dryness, making this very accessible to any interested reader.<br />This is a quick and rewarding read. It lacks academic rigor, but it's at a good level for anyone wanting a practical perspective on innovation strategies, yesterday, today, and in the transition between.	2004-07-08

This is it.<br />The organization couldn't be clearer: the bulk of the book is the complete list of HTML directives, in alphabetical order. It also includes indices of names for special characters and colors. There's a lot of compatibility information, too, regarding both HTML versions and browser incompatibilities.<br />The &quot;Examples&quot; section is weak, and seems to assume a knowledge of SGML beyond what HTML really requires. It's also vague about specifics of style directives, and the relationship of HTML to CSS or embedded scripts. Other books fill those gaps, though. This book works as just one in a more complete library for web-page writers, and that's just fine.<br />There are better books to learn from, but this is the best I've seen for supporting experienced HTML users.	2004-07-07

It then works up to the design of entire families of books like the Penguin series, as of when this book was written.<br />No one text can possibly cover the whole range of skills in book design, at least not in any detail. This gives a quick introduction to the many concerns of the book designer. Many topics will look familiar, such as harmonious matching of different fonts and selection of layout grids. Other topics are technological, like the strengths and weaknesses of different typesetting processes. Some choices won't be available to all book designers - choice of one volume vs. three or four, or choice of binding and cover material. Yet other concerns have to do with the business of book design, estimating design jobs and working with the authors, illustrators, and others involved in the book. The coverage may be sketchy, but the whole of the design process is laid out.<br />The biggest problem is that the original edition came out in 1967. It predates effectively all of computer-based design. There are Jetson-like predictions of technology, though, such as the dream of Computer Composition: having typewritten text scanned (!?) automatically for typesetting. WYSIWYG never occurred to Mr. Wilson.<br />Beyond lack of computers, its technology is archaic in other ways. Hand typesetting is still used in limited, artisan printing, but is obsolete for all commercial books. The tools of the designer have changed, as well. The real weakness, though, is its treatment of color. Again, printing technology has made photorealistic use of color feasible in most contexts. Some of the commentary is completely up to date, though. The garish, cartoony textbooks he criticizes have, if anything, gotten worse.<br />There are some minor problems as well. The text makes reference to illustration 3-9, for example, which is not included in this edition. The &quot;cover flaps&quot; folded from the paper binding tend to get in the way. When they are the vehicle for a discussion of book design, the irony becomes annoying.<br />This is an outstanding introduction to the full breadth of book design issues. It has weaknesses, but was never intended to stand alone as a typographic how-to. It still complements other texts very well.nding tend to get in the way.

The idea of software architecture is finally coming into its own as a field of study. That includes the levels above individual software systems, including highly configurable systems and whole corporate product families. The subtitle, &quot;Adopting and evolving a product line approach,&quot; looked promising.<br />A few things early on left me skeptical. Section I.4.1, for example, discusses quality factors of an architecture. The approach is completely retrospective, though. It only looks backwards at what emerged in a system, not forwards into how a system should be designed. I agree with section I.5.5 that some quality requirement X will be implemented across some set of system modules. Summing that quality's presence across all modules to add up to X is a positively dangerous mis-statement. The strength of a chain is in all of its links, but is not the sum of the link strengths - the strength of a system's security is not increased by adding yet more insecure modules.<br />The treatment of &quot;software science&quot; metrics is deplorably shallow. If you must use that approach, it's best to use a wide variety of indicators with different sensitivities, ideally indicators that don't depend on the programming language. The author stops with one metric, a graph-theoretic number that would be nearly impossible to apply to XSLT, Prolog, UI specification systems, database schemata, and so on. &quot;Experience-based assessment&quot; proposes the use of external assessment teams, without suggesting any way of guaging that team's ability. The discussion of processes vs. threads, with respect to program reliability misses the most critical point: that processes normally have hardware memory protection and threads don't. Unwittingly or maliciously shared memory is the biggest threat to reliability, and is a threat in process systems without memory protection.<br />The same shallow approach appears elsewhere in the &quot;Transformation of architecture&quot; section, in the dicussion of design patterns. The failure to distinguish strategic from tactical design issues is disappointing. A facade pattern is a useful tool, at the level of a few modules or minor subsystem. It is not a fundamental organizational principle capable of guiding the system's future structure - it doesn't work at the architectural level.<br />Bosch's emphasis is on analysis of successful systems and on retrofit of older systems under active development. Good stuff - that really describes the large majority of software effort. The discussion never gets started, however, because it scarcely mentions any way of determining which existing subsystems demand the most immediate attention.<br />There are lots more problems with this book, but I hope the pattern is clear: shallow discussion, weak specifics, and sparse mention of commercially critical issues.ation of architecture&quot; section, in the dicussion of design patterns.

Start with the word \\"function\\" - he effectively takes it apart. Think of a car and its function for example. It can, at different times, demand attention from every girl on the block, it can open its back seat on lover's lane, rush a woman to the maternity ward, or carry kids to the soccer game. What is its 'real' function?<br /><br />It took me a while to catch the sense that Pye meant to convey. He uses a Zen-like approach of creating new meaning by undermining the old. Beauty, of course, is in the eye of the beholder, but people don't share eyes with each other. It's in each eye uniquely, and has to be defined again by each beholder.<br /><br />Beauty is also, he argues, a necessity of life and of society. Very often, beauty costs nothing. Any function can be met by an infinite family of forms, even within a rigid framework of requirements. Choosing an agreeable form is not just an option, it's a deep-set human imperative.<br /><br />This is a philosophical book. It's real point, I think, is that good design must be a personal act - the technical skills can be taught, but the craft must be learned. There is no advice here that you could follow, for example, in making a better chair.<br /><br />The advice is about how to make yourself a better designer.	2004-07-05

Outside of that, it's a great reference. Maybe the more advanced language features need more clarification, but it's plenty to get you going on your first few Perl programs.<br />Perl is a pleasant oddity among programming langauges. It has lots of features that make it great as a &quot;glue&quot; language, for holding other programs together and for doing those irksome little translations between incompatible formats. Those are the things that shell scripts used to do: setting up files, command lines, and environment variables, checking results, preparing reports. Perl does all that, better, and gives you the full power of a programming language on top of it all. That means the transformations aren't at the mercy of available filters, and don't count on the dozen different syntaxes of the dozen different filter programs. It's a great language for all those little one-off tasks that crop up, especially in system and web admin.<br />That's my problem with Perl, though - the free-wheeling, never-look-back, whatever-works spirit of the people who use Perl. I know there are disciplined, competent software engineers who develop and use Perl, and I don't mean to disparage them at all. Still, the gonzo style that's so common and the revival tent spirit of books like this put me off a bit.<br />The language is very useful, and make lots of hard jobs easy. This book, despite its true-believer style, gives a thorough introduction to the language and its core APIs.	2004-07-02

It's a handbook, and gives good, clear descriptions of every corner of the Java language. Java isn't a big feature-sodden language, but has a few obscure corners. If you just can't remember the syntax for up-reference from an inner class, you'll find it fast and explained well.<br /><br />The API guide is fairly complete, but terse. Well, it has to be - the API keep growing. No one book could hold a complete description of everything. Sad to say, earlier editions had more complete API descriptions. The second, for example, had a very good introduction to reflection. As the Java API grew, however, the old descriptions had to shrink to make way for the new, and the reflection discussion was squeezed out. Still, it gives a good quick look at the API. This isn't as complete as the Javadoc API information, but is hugely more browseable. Use this to direct your query into the right area, then use Sun's Javadoc to get the details.<br /><br />If you have room for only one Java book, make it this one.<br /><br />-- wiredweird<br /><br />2007 PS to the 2004 review: Flanagan's new edition on [[ASIN:0596007736 Java 5]] supercedes this version of the classic. The new version has all the strengths of earlier editions. It covers language basics and Java 5 extensions even better, except for some rough spots in generics. It covers the fast-growing standard library even worse. If coding Java pays your paycheck, then upgrade. If you work on legacy or casual code, the 3rd or 4th edition, plus easy access to javadoc, might still serve you well enough.	2004-07-01

It presents three techniques for reviewing the suitability of a software architecture. The presentation style is clear, complete, and reasonably frank about the problems an architecture evaluator is likely to encounter.<br />The oldest of the three techniques presented is SAAM, the Software Architecture Analysis Model. It's primary goal is to determine how well a system's structure addresses the technical requirements of the application, and its probable success at addressing future changes of requirements.<br />ATAM, the Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method, descends from SAAM but is far more complete. It starts upstream of the requirements, at the business model behind the application, then moves forward methodically through the top-level design. At each step, reviewers update the list of technical risks and non-risks (relatively safe items). ATAM is open-ended, in the sense that the project's own goals define the specific measures of quality that apply - it doesn't force-fit every project onto one Procrustean axis of measure.<br />If ATAM is SAAM grown large, then ARID (Active Reviews for Intermediate Design) is SAAM scaled down. Where ATAM and SAAM address strategic issues about complete systems, ARID incorporates tactical information about specific design issues. It's not as narrow as standard design review techniques, but not as broad as an architecture review.<br />ATAM is the main focus of the book, with more pages than SAAM and ARID combined. All three are described in full detail, however. The authors identify the specific skill sets, roles, and responsibilities that must be involved at each step. They present checklists for eliciting the kinds of information needed, even specifics of meeting agendas and meeting room equipment.<br />That creates my second impression of this book: I was very disappointed. This book is for meeting organizers, and deals very little with technical specifics. That is not at all what I hoped for. It is not the fault of the book that it fails to meet my expectations. In my present work, however, the authors present just about nothing to enhance my project's technical content.<br />This is a process book. It seems to be a good one. It takes what works in other design review methodologies, then expands that to the highest level of the software project. It gives enough detail that you can tune specifics of the process to specifics of your project. Still, it's just a process book.ped for.

Matlab is a helpful tool with legible syntax, and gives a good introduction to the first few dozen things I needed.<br />Matlab is very extensible. There are lots of specialty packages, GUI extensions, and hooks for custom programming. Fine. That's way past what I want right now.

A lot of that is taken up with sample code and with programming advice that seems to help beginners. If you just want a language handbook, that's way more than you need or want. I tolerate it, though, because of the clarity of the rest of the presentation.<br /><br />(If my emphasis on clarity seems excessive, that's because you haven't experienced Stroustrup's \\"stream of conciousness\\" style.)<br /><br />This book gives only minimal and incidental descriptions of the standard C/C++ libraries, the STL, and all the other necessaries of the C++ world. Well, you can't have everything. Not if you want to be able to lift the book, too. This picks a topics and covers it - you'll need additional references for the rest.<br /><br />This does what I want: it gives me the language, all of it, without requiring a linear search through the whole text.

This puts essentially all of that power in your hands.<br />You had better have strong hands. This is as thick as most two books on my shelf. That's what it takes, though, to describe something as featureful as Mathematica. Just about any function you ever heard of, it has. It also has the derivative and integral, in symbolic form, and maybe even a moment generating function, if that applies. It's all there and it's indexed fairly well.<br />That won't help the beginner struggling with the basic syntax or programming model. The pattern matching is not at all intuitive, if you've been programming in procedural or OO languages - a Prolog background would serve you better. Combinations of code, formatted text, and graphics are also possible, but no always easy to work out from this text. This is not a primer, it's an encyclopedia.<br />That's what I want, though: the language, the library, and an organization that doesn't hide them. It's not a user-friendly introduction, but I'm not a very friendly user.	2004-07-01

Lady Daibu was part of that efflorescence. In fact, among all of the memoirs that have lasted the millenium since that era, Daibu's work is distinctive for two reasons. First, it gives us a larger dose of poetry than other memoirs do.<br />More importantly, Lady Daibu's active period covers the end of the Heian era, the downfall of the Taira. It is almost maddening that women, by custom, wrote only about their direct experiences and emotional responses. 'Tales of the Heike' report that defining period in military and political terms. Daibu, instead, reports the loss of her Taira lover and the upwelling of feeling on seeing the foundation of his burned house. Her view from the court could have been so much more, but comes across as shallow and self-involved.<br />This memoir really is just a report of her emotional responses, generally in the form of five-line poems. Many aspects of this form were difficult for me to take in fully. For one thing, the poems often allude to other poems, famous in Heian times but now obscure. For another, dense, poetic writing often relied on 'pivot' words. Because of the language's structure, Japanese has many groups of words that have similar or identical sounds - puns, but used as a literary device for carrying multiple meanings. Of course, these can not be rendered into English except through ponderous footnotes. The forms of the ideographs also allow visual puns between words of similar written form, another subtlety that fails in translation. Although the translator provides copious notes, I felt as if I were watching some movie and had to have every joke explained to me.<br />As noted, this memoir starts before and ends after the events defining the end of the Heian period. Those events also define eras in Daibu's life: the Taira fell, and her Taira lover fell with the rest of the clan. From that point forward, her mood became uniformly bleak, maybe even clinically depressed.<br />Although interesting for its historical context, I don't get a lot of insight into Heian times from this work. The translation is a fine piece of scholarship. The annotations are plentiful and helpful, if sometimes dry. I give this four stars for competent rendering into modern English, but almost gave less for the weak content put into it by the original author.nically depressed.<br />Although interesting for its historical context, I don't get a lot of insight into Heian times from this work.

This collection moves that story forward, mostly in the person of Rose.<br />This book compiles a sequence of regular-sized comic books. The first story here stands by itself - a tribal tale of a place that could, some day, descend from our own time.<br />The rest of the book takes a very ordinary young woman and puts her in an extraordinary world. Taken part by part, it sounds fragmentary and disorganized: a nursing home, a bizarre convention, befriending a place, and facing mortal threat in an immortal world. The pieces all fit, though. They sustain a pace and a visual variety that makes this book hard to put down.<br />Best, however, is the glimpse of intrigue in the Sandmnan's world. We see a little of his own realm, and the plotting of his own minions. We also see his larger world, his sisters, and their covert push against the walls of his domain. This is just the second of a dozen or so collections - there is enough material here to drive that many volumes or more.<br />If you're new to comics, or just new to the Sandman, give this a try. If you already know the Sandman, you're in for one of the best books in the series.	2004-06-29

It's not exhaustive, but a good collection of his work from 1970s art school through the publication date. That includes illustrations for book covers, some of which I almost remember from the original books. It includes illustrations from unpublished children's books, material not found elsewhere.<br />Of course, it includes extracts from Griffin and Sabine. Those may be my favorites - I think there is material here that extends the G&amp;S story, but was never in the original books. It also covers The Venetian's Wife and Museum at Purgatory, both of which I enjoyed. There isn't enough from any of the books to spoil them for the first-time reader, though. This is a summary of Bantock's work, not a complete catalog.<br />There is some biographical information here, mostly covering his career from college through book publication. I was a little put off by parts of it, though. Bantock has certainly been successful as an illustrator, and rightly takes pride in that accomplishment. His pride tends towards smugness, though, not something the reader needs to see.<br />Still, it's a good coffee table book. It's easy to thumb through, and has material that was not already presented in his other books. It would have been even better with a bit more artwork, or at least a bit less self-congratulatory text.	2004-06-28
611932:US	35004134	R1FO3L6S1L1A8K	0321179366	137500157	The Object Constraint Language: Getting Your Models Ready for MDA (2nd Edition)	Books	4	1	1	N	Y	OK for experienced programmers	This book really is for experienced programmers. It presupposes a strong familiarity with UML, and even some knowledge of MDA. Given that, the reader should be able to place the OCL within the UML framework. The example used throughout the book is helpful, since it gives a moderately realistic setting showing how OCL describes real application logic.<br />Experienced programmers will also be able to unwind the non-intuitive order of presentation. The book starts with the examples, giving a rough idea of OCL's relationship to the more familiar UML class, object, state, and interaction diagrams. Next, it shows how the OCL can be rendered in Java langauge syntax, and finally the OCL language is presented. I would much rather have seen the language definition, then the example, then the sample langauge binding - a beginner is likely to need at least two or three readings to resolve all of the book's implicit forward references.<br />It will also take an experienced programmer to step over the book's occasional errors. For example, pp49-50 seem to confuse inclusive and exclusive OR semantics. An example on p.86 first confuses the Java equality test and assignment operators, then confuses object identity and value equality testing. An experienced reader will also forgive erratic editing, such as p.97's reference to a banana's &quot;peal.&quot; (As a matter of record, I tried pealing a banana the way I would peal a bell and got disappointing results.)<br />Most of all, it will take an experienced reader to sort out the different meta-levels of representation. At different times, the OCL is presented as a tool that talks about the model of the program and as a tool that specifies the content of the program. I can go either way or both ways, but a beginner would probably get lost at one meta-level or another. Experienced programmers will also forgive the vague connection between the OCL and other parts of the UML standard.

615538:US	35004134	RBKDB7C067ZHL	0471958697	97623796	Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture Volume 1: A System of Patterns	Books	4	9	9	N	N	Clear and wide-ranging	This is an unusual book in the pattern genre. It presents a number of patterns, categorized by archtiectural level. That's just the first part of the book, though. The third of the book is about the process of using, relating, collecting, and distributing patterns.<br />Only chapter 2 really addresses patterns for the strategic, architectural level of a software system. It does a very adequate job, using a variety of notations, examples, and analysis steps. This book is from 1996, so time has changed our view of some patterns. &quot;Reflection,&quot; for example, has become pervasive in applications based on plugins and software components. It is also a fundamental API in the major langauges (Java and C#) released since this book was published - perhaps reflection should be downgraded to an &quot;idiom&quot;. That's just nitpicking, though, since reflection is even more important now than when the book was written.<br />For contrast, the authors present additional design patterns (including some from Gamma's book) for use at tactical design levels. They also discuss idioms patterns that typically involve just a few lines of code within on function. The contrast between the three different levels of implementation and design gives a useful discussion. The authors also present a weak chapter on &quot;systems&quot; or &quot;langauges&quot; of patterns The discussion is OK as far as it goes. The weakness is in what it omits. After reading this brief chapter, the programmer has very little practical information about choosing patterns from some library for some task. The poor programmer has no information at all about how to link patterns together, and that's a real stumbling block for beginning pattern users.<br />The final section of the book is really sociology. It's about the pattern community, what that community is for, and how to be a working member. I find the discussion un-helpful, but I expect opinions to differ.<br />Even today, this is a good second book (after Gamma's 'Design Patterns') on patterns and pattern usage. It lack the depth and precision of Gamma's book, and tends to add words without adding meaning. On the positive side, it's broader than Gamma's, and addresses a wider range of implementation levels.ter Gamma's 'Design Patterns') on patterns and pattern usage.

In this volume, he bridges much of the gap from Morison's writings on typography up to today's practice.<br />There's a lot of good technical content here, almost all of it regarding nuances of letterforms and design of type faces. He offers some interesting history, as well, from the turn of the century up to about the 1950s.<br />Among other type designers, he describes Rudolf Koch, best known for Kabel. As presented here, Koch was the first type designer to bridge the gap between the blackletter German alphabets and the Latin letters used elsewhere in Europe, to the advantage of both traditions. Tracy also spends a fair bit of time on Frederick Goudy. Goudy is certainly worth study, for both his succcesses and his less graceful work. Tracy seems to focus on the latter - his description of Goudy reads like a left-handed compliment in essay form.<br />Tracy was active from the hot-lead days, through photo typesetting, and into the early electronic era. He notes the advantages and weaknesses in each technology, as of when the book was written. Digital technology has progressed since then. Scanning has almost granted his wish that &quot;.. vectorising is an automatic process ... [so] designers' work can be reproduced directly and with complete fidelity.&quot; Electronic design has also somewhat invalidated his claim that &quot;the method of manufacture has [little] influence on the design of type.&quot; Frere-Jones' Reactor font is one among those that could never have appeared in metal. Also, the punchcutter's craft acted as an engraved metal barrier to entry into type design. With that barrier gone, amateur type design has come into its own (for better or worse).<br />The personality, the history, and the commentary on type design all make this a worthwhile book. It won't help the beginner much, and deals only with typographic issues at the level of letterforms and letter spacing. Still, it's a view worth seeing.letterforms and letter spacing.

For them, the effort of picking Java sense out of C++ or Smalltalk may defeat the rest of the pattern discussion. For them, Java code samples and references to familiar Java library elements can make all the difference.<br />For the rest of us, this book has decidedly mixed value. The real problem is that Grand seems to equate the terms &quot;desgin pattern&quot; and &quot;good idea&quot;. Design patterns are good ideas, at least in the right context, but not all good ideas are design patterns.<br />For example, delegation of responsibility is a good idea. It's the basis of any system decomposition. I have trouble justifying that as a design pattern - you may as well say that passing function parameters is a design pattern. It's just too broad. At the other end of the spectrum, Grand points to &quot;marker&quot; interfaces, Java interfaces with identities but not content, as a design pattern. Again, this is a useful but language-dependent hack. Ada or C# would have done the same things with attributes, and C++ could have done the same using marker fields or values in the class. Language tricks aren't patterns.<br />Still, many of Grand's patterns are good ideas. The &quot;Object Pool&quot;, for example, is a common and useful pattern. It's closely related to two GoF patterns. It's like a Singleton, except there's more than one of them. It's like a Flyweight, except the units aren't distinguishable or shareable.<br />One real annoyance is the tendency of this Volume I to refer to necessary information in Volume II. If the author is going to create independently saleable units of book, they should be independently readable. I do not appreciate the implicit plug for the author's other work.<br />I use this book, but mostly for its bad examples. Think hard about whether this is the way to spend your budget for DP books.	2004-06-22

The architecture has deeper meaning and larger scale than any other aspect, and can't be discussed in the same ways.<br />This book opens that discussion. Among the &quot;architecture&quot; books I've read lately, this is the only one to offer concrete advice on describing, presenting, and analyzing archtiectural features of a system. It identifies a number of documentation types and variations. It also identifies a number of different readers - developers, future architects, users, etc. - and addresses their different documentation needs.<br />The authors use a little UML, but not a lot. For one thing, standard UML works at too low a level for architectural discussion. Classes, and even hierarchies of class inheritance are such fine-grained entities that architecture gernerally won't address them. Instead, the authors offer a number of diagramming styles of their own. For once, I agree with the need for non-standard notation.<br />Even so, I think they under-utilize the existing standards in favor of their own terminology and notation. They could have used a UML profile for lots of the discussion. It would have had to be a new profile, however, not just a force-fit of the real-time profile. They also under-used the existing architecture standards (IEEE/ANSI, DoD, NASA, and more) in favor of their own discussion. Maybe their approach can be used in any of those frameworks, but that should have been more explicit.<br />I see only one major flaw in this book, the assumption that a software system's architecture describes the program delivered to a customer. That's way too narrow. A large system includes things like test harnesses, debug instrumentation, application-specific QA tools, and user documentation of many kinds. Those can be major undertakings of their own. They are intimately tied to the delivered software, and may constrain the actual product.<br />On the postivie side, this book offer an extensive real-world case study. That probably doubles the book's value, by putting a concrete face on the otherwise abstract discussion.<br />There are two ways to use this book: you can agree with it, or think about it and disagree with it. If you really think about it, though, you get it's full value whether you agree or not.<br />In other words, you can't lose by reading this book.an extensive real-world case study.

The paper is tissue thin, so the book isn't a meter thick, but opaque and durable.<br /><br />The mini-printing can be a problem, though.

Maybe that's why Springer-Verlag published these cartoons. Springer (parent company of Copernicus) is generally known for highly technical books, and clearly felt that Harris' comics are a valued contribution.<br />Science is just another human endeavor, so it's full of humans. That means it's basically irrational at the bottom, just like the people that work in science. It looks as if Harris has devoted his life to reminding us that clear, consistent results come from silly, self-contradictory people. His cartoons tease scientists, but always with affection. That's why so many people in the sciences like his work, and even make it their own.<br />If you already know Harris' work, you're sure to like this.

As with so many other crafts, the Japanese start with the same materials used by workers anywhere else in the world. Then, they apply their own techniques to create something completely new.<br />This book gives clear, simple directions for making or improvising the tools needed. It takes a bit of effort to hold the incomplete work in place and feed in each strand as needed, so the tools really are necessary. You can't just grab a few strings and try the techniques. The tools are easy to put together from common household materials - film canisters, coins, and a few other things - so don't let that put you off.<br />The braids themselves are presented in beautiful photos, along with clear, complete directions for making each one. The photos also show how one braid can look very different according to the colors and kinds of strands woven together.<br />It's not something to pick up casually on a rainy day and try with your kid.

Outdoor copper and bronze show some of the greens and browns that are possible. This book puts that chemistry, and a much larger palette of colors, into the crafter's hands.<br />This book is encyclopedic. Three factors affect each patination: the alloy or element being treated, the chemistry of the solutions applied to the metal, and the way the treatment is applied (time, temperature, and so on). Hughes systematically explores all three dimensions. The discussion includes reproducibility of each patina, since some have squirrely chemistry that gives variable results. It also describes the mechanical and chemical durability of each patina, factors that define the kinds of applications where it may be used.<br />This book is not for the home hobbyist, though. It uses very harsh chemicals in most treatments. Many are highly toxic, and many present special hazards in handling and storage.<br />The only weakness I found in this book is the range of alloys covered. A number of interesting copper/gold combinations are traditional in Japanese metalwork, valued for the unusual colors of their natural oxides. These were severely under-represented. No book can cover everything, though.<br />Just thumbing through this book is wonderful, seeing the range of colors and textures that can be coaxed from the metal's surface. It's also helpful to anyone who loves metal artwork, as explanation of effects that you mught see displayed.	2004-06-18

Using only a sheet of paper, a hobby knife, and this book, you can create some very beautiful work.<br />The Pauls who wrote the book give clear directions for making a wide variety of different popups, using a variety of different folding techniques. They start simple, just single cuts and simple folds. They work up to some mind-boggling creations; those require significant precision and care.<br />Directions are in the form of patterns, ready to transfer from the book to your own paper. That could be a problem for some people. The patterns are shown reduced in size, and in somewhat schematic form. When multiple pieces of paper are involved, it takes a bit mechanical insight to figure out just how each piece fits each other - the directions aren't always explicit.<br />The directions are clear enough, though. With a little work, you should be able to put most of these patterns together, then start improvising on your own. Of course, you can add whatever illustration or decoration you want - the structure is just the beginning of your finished piece.<br />You'll find clear directions for projects of graded complexity.

Each pattern is covered in the ways you would probably expect: what it is, when it applies, what good and bad effects are likely to follow.<br /><br />This goes a few steps beyond, though. Most patterns are shown in class diagrams, as you'd expect. Interaction diagrams are much more common and complete than in most books, and clearly show the dynamics of different roles working with each other. Multiple different interaction diagrams show multiple different ways to implement the pattern or to put it to use. CRC cards are given for lots of the patterns - among other things, this book gives good examples for people who've never seen CRC cards used before.<br /><br />The exceptional part of this writing is the \\"implementation\\" section of each pattern description. It shows the different steps and factors needed for the analysis leading up to pattern use, a welcome change for people new to this level of abstraction.<br /><br />Finally, just about every pattern is illustrated in Java code. This will be very helpful for readers who need a concretion to bring the abstraction to life. I always have mixed feeling about code samples, though. I've seen too many design pattern beginners mistake the example for the rule. They lose out on the breadth of the pattern and the many valid ways to interpret it into a working system.<br /><br />The only drawback to this book is its basic level of presentation. Many of the patterns will be familiar to experienced readers, but that always happens with patterns. The descriptions, however, often miss important topics. This book is dedicated to patterns about resource allocation. They are helpful in resource-constrained embedded systems where deadlock is a real threat; the authors barely mention deadlock, if at all. Resource management, including replication and caching, is also important in parallel and distributed systems. Maintaining global consistency a subtle topic with many variations, and gets just a few paragraphs of discussion.<br /><br />Still the book is a good one over all.

It may be hard see the problem now, but the concept of zero was a tough one for people to accept. How can I do anything with something that is, by definition, not something?<br />This is a history of zero, the mathematical concept. As with most great ideas, it had no real beginning. Instead, Kaplan presents a patchwork where parts of the concept appeared, traveled, vanished, merged, and re-emerged many times. Persia, India, Greece - all have some claim to some part of zero's heritage. Europe was the latecomer, accepting zero only after declaring it the work of the devil or the devil himself!<br />There is no, or almost no math here. That shows remarkable restraint on Kaplan's part, since he clearly knows the mathematical history at least as well as the social history presented here. The low-math style keep the tone light, and makes it easy to appreciate Kaplan's far-ranging and amusing style. In fact, a few of the very last chapters are so far-ranging and draw so many distant analogies that they contain near-zero amounts of zero itself. That isn't a problem, though, since Kaplan's whirlwind tour of history, astronomy, literature, theology, and more is entertaining by itself.<br />It's a fun read and full of amusing facts, but comes across a bit 'lite'. Kaplan is explicit: weaving a whole historical cloth from these many threads would be demanding enough to kill the pleasure of the story. Academic rigor is clearly a choice open to Kaplan, and he declined.<br />This is a good beach book for anyone, but especially if your tan usually comes from the glow of a CRT.	2004-06-16

At least, his work on the Sistine Chapel was murdered, the way Beck and Daley describe it.<br /><br />On a technical level, this book is outstanding. Beck starts with a few hard, historical facts. First is that fresco has two forms. \\"Fresco buono\\" embedded pigment in wet plaster; it was always rushed by the drying plaster and limited in color by plaster's harsh chemistry. \\"Freso secco\\" was paint with animal glue binder, painted over dry plaster or buone. It gave plenty of opportunity for layers of subtle, painterly effects and for use of fragile colors. The second historical fact is that plaster dries in minutes or hours, and the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel took years. Beck offers volumes more historical data, but it's clear that a lot more than drying plaster went on.<br /><br />The so-called conservators of the Sistine Chapel insisted that the organic layer over the plaster was not Michelangelo's work. When they cleaned the ceiling, they scrubbed it down to raw plaster, the fresco buono. Any secco work literally went down the drain with the wash water. Beck argues, very convincingly, that all of the subtlety and all that made Michelangelo's work unique went with it.<br /><br />Beck offers many more examples of harsh, even destructive treatments of historical art treasures. That brings us to the book's second level, the social one. It opens the book with Beck under fire in four separate lawsuits in Italy. The case in point was his report of a disastrous treatment of a sculpture about which he had unique knowledge and insight. The plaintiff in all four cases was the conservator who had done the job, supposedly defending his personal honor, his profession, and perhaps all of Italy against any slight by a mere expert.<br /><br />If it weren't for the facts laid out, this would look like some weird conspiracy theory. As it is, Beck (and now artwatchinternational.org) is a voice that speaks for paintings and sculptures that can not speak for themselves, and can not plead for themselves against the solvents and scalpels of the \\"cleaners.\\"<br /><br />This book very clearly describes the threat to our legacy of artworks, and the wall of silence around those who present the threat. It is chilling.<br /><br />//wiredweirdor themselves against the solvents and scalpels of the \\"cleaners.\\"    This book very clearly describes the threat to our legacy of artworks, and the wall of silence around those who present the threat.

The glossary is worthwhile, and could have been expanded well beyond its 19 pages.<br />The weakness of this format is that, although each chapter contains introductory material, the book as a whole is not written at the introductory level. It's not quite a text, more like seven unrelated chapters flying in close formation. No one, clear underlying pattern unifies the different piece. Maybe there is a pattern, but the reader must know it already. But in that case, would the reader really need the introductions? Also, the glossary was written without respect to the other chapters so isn't really a glossary of the book that contains it.<br />Finally, I have to point out that this book's copyright date of 1996 makes it a bit old, by the standards of the field.<br />There are a number of interesting facts to be had here. They are all isolated points, though. The reader must already have a pretty good idea of the whole picture that these points fit into.	2004-06-13

You're almost certain to feel different body masses shifting with the motion. Moving figures really are different.<br />That's why this book is so valuable. Every image is dynamic and unstable, impossible as static poses. But that's true even of someone walking - it's a sequence of unstable positions.<br />The poses are all vivid and dynamic. The models are chosen to show not only the movement, but the shifts of body masses, tension of muscles, and play of hair, all things that contribute to the dynamics. The large majority of photos are of women - several different ones, and the variety is worthwhile. In this case, the male minority makes some sense. Most men have more lean mass than women do, so women tend to display more shifts of mass when in motion. There are a few male figures, though, and a few images with infants or more than one model.<br />This book really does show possibilities that other pose books don't, and that even live models can't. If you ever draw figure, this book will be very useful.	2004-06-11

As pointed out elsewhere, the models are all young. Still, there are a few different men and women with interesting differences between them. The fact of having a pregnant model at all is distinctive - pregnancy could be a topic for a whole pose book itself.

The UML is so broad, has so many parts, and has so exponentially many combinations that fitting it to any one discipline is a job for experts.<br /><br />Here is the book by the experts. This starts with the basics. First, they say what they mean by a component - valuable, because authors all differ. Then they cover a few of the development basics, including project management and requirements. This really isn't a process book, though, so those topics get just enough discussion for the rest to make sense.<br /><br />The real meat of the book starts in Ch.3, \\"Applying UML.\\" That opens the topic that this book is really about, and gives a quick review of the kinds of UML diagrams used. Ch.5-6 look a lot like traditional OO analysis, not surprising because OO is the implementation mechanism for any modern component mechanism. Also, like OO, component systems emphasize bundling of data with operations. In fact, the experienced OO developer should pay more attention to the differences between OO and component analysis than the similarities. Whether your development involves components or not, you'll still find a detailed case study of the UML applied to a realistic sample design. In particular, the many different roles of interfaces apply as well to OO software as to components.<br /><br />Ch. 7 goes into the real detail, esp. use of the Object Constraint Language (OCL) for interface specification. This is Meyer's \\"design by contract\\" specification technique, cast into UML/OCL terms. Although the material is good, I came away with mixed feelings about it.<br /><br />On one hand, the material involves a very high level of detail, possibly enough to put some readers off. \\"Design by contract\\" is a descendant of mathematical proof of program correctness. It's a whole new aspect of programming, with a whole new set of thought processes involved and a whole new set of problems to get lost in. My experience of typical production programmers is that the contracts will probably end up a) vacuously general, or b) a never-ending mesh of inconsistencies, or c) ignored. I like contracts, and I like formal specification of behavior, I just don't see that the average practitioner is ready for it.<br /><br />On the other hand, I found some maddening omissions. The authors repeatedly warn that aggregation has subtle semantic implications, that collections need special attention, and so on. They don't say what the problems are, though, or give pointers to readings that can be accessed readily.<br /><br />The authors note that CASE tools of the day are not ready for such broad, intensive use of detailed UML features. Worse, some UML features are mis-supported, and the user may have to fight the tools to get the results desired. That's fair; if anything, I appreciate the honesty. UML as a whole is too big, and its usage is evolving too rapidly for the tools to catch up. The best UML-related writings today, this included, describe usages that ought to work but, in commercial reality, don't.<br /><br />There is one peculiarity here that I never figured out. The UML is a standard from the Object Management Group (omg.org). So is CORBA, with its component model. Why, then, did the authors address COM+ and EJB components but not CORBA? Maybe the CORBA model isn't mature enough, but I really don't know.<br /><br />This the best, maybe the only book that pays serious attention to component software in UML terms.<br /><br />//wiredweirdst in.

Maybe his name isn't as broadly known as Gauss or many others. Still, the Hadamard matrices appear in modern error correcting codes among other places, and his name is known in other contexts. This is someone whose creative work is still an active field of study, over a century after some of it was originated.<br /><br />When someone of his stature decides to write about creativity, I am interested. He centers his inquiry on the thought processes of invention. That includes the place of sub-conscious thought, in several forms, and of abstract or verbal thought vs. imagery.<br /><br />This study is wholly descriptive, not prescriptive. It simply relates the introspective sensation of Hadamard's thought process, and that of many others including Einstein and Mozart. There is little here about the the process of cultivating a creative talent, just description of how creators perceive their own talent in operation.<br /><br />Although interesting, I found it somewhat dry. He cites many other studies of creativity, some of which are now hard to find. Many, however, come from an angle that I find un-helpful: the view a psychologist might take, rather than that of a mathematician or artist.<br /><br />This brief book may be of historical interest, but probably won't benefit the working creative professional.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-06-08

Today, that means databases, network protocols, incompatible languages, distributed processing on disparate platforms, and more. Building any one part on any one platform is easy enough. The problem is to guarantee that the database, the Enterprise Bean interfaces, the HTML forms, and everything else match each other. There are two ways to make matching work. First, you can spend the rest of your life running around and looking at all interacting pairs of things, hoping that nothing changed while you weren't looking. Second, you can derive all those parts automatically from a common source. That's what the MDA is about.<br /><br />The MDA defines hierarchies of meta- and meta-meta-models. If you read between the lines, you'll probably see that each level of meta-abstraction requires a successively more knowledgeable, capable developer. This book works at the highest levels, so probably won't make much sense to entry-level staff with a more concrete and immediate view. (I shudder to think about maintenance of high-level tools by entry-level staff, and it will happen, somewhere some day.) The MDA approach assumes complete fluency with the UML, MOF, OCL, and other alphabet soup. That is necessary because the MDA half-defines transformation rules that convert a specification, in successive steps, into code. It's a bit like the filter approach of XSLT.<br /><br />The good news is that one specification can be transformed into a database schema, a Java Bean, a web form, and more, by applying different transformations to the spec. Consistency is ensured, at least to the extent that the different transformation rules are correct and consistent.<br /><br />There are a few problems with the MDA approach. First, the authors point out that it's just not there. It's a blue-sky spec, with no underlying implementations. A few vendors have declared their products MDA-compatible. I'm reminded that a block of wood with two nails driven in wass compatible with the electrical safety specs from the old Ma Bell days. Non-interference is a form of compatibility, just not a very interesting one.<br /><br />Second, if you have a small problem, though, you're stuck. The only apparent way for MDA to handle a small problem is first to turn it into a big problem, then solve that. Victims of heavy-weight CASE tools in light-weight projects will have some experience of that already.<br /><br />Third, and most critical, is that it just isn't complete enough. The transformation rules, at least as shown here, don't really have the expressive power needed for generating compilable code. That operation, the one that matters, seems to be \\"implementation dependent\\", i.e. jungle rules. Also, despite the authors' assurance (sec 12.1.3) that MDA really will generate code that doesn't need manual involvement, they have no shown that. Quite the opposite. The sample application (p.120) shows how the model generates a business-rule method, but gives no indication how that method's body is to be defined!<br /><br />The MDA is interesting, but perhaps not the \\"paradigm shift\\"  that the authors claim. In many ways, it's like the common code-generating CASE tools writ large. Getting to the authors' ultimate vision will take years, many incremental steps, and probably a good bit of pain on the developers' part.<br /><br />Still, software is getting bigger and software problems are getting bigger. They need to be tamed somehow, and maybe the MDA will address important parts of the problems. I'm watching and waiting, but getting on with my business in the mean time.<br /><br />//wiredweirdminded that a block of wood with two nails driven in wass compatible with the electrical safety specs from the old Ma Bell days.

I know that this short volume is supposedly about modern art, and even mentions a few other artists. Really, though, this is by Dali and about Dali.<br />He was a consistent man. His art was finely crafted, but gave new definitions for the surreal and the impossible. His writing has the same character. He often spoke in a private vocabulary that, perhaps, only he understood. Even in English translation, his sentences have a rolling sound, and some roll on for half a page or more.<br />In spite of himself, Dali sometimes let an intelligible thought come through. He had the highest regard for Vermeer and Raphael, and the lowest for Picasso. That last is uncertain, though. He may have seen Picasso as the hero who opened the way for a new rise of modern art by first dragging it to the lowest depths.<br />This is not Dali's only writing, and not his longest or most focussed. Oddly, Gala (his wife and muse) is mentioned only in some of the calligraphic scrawls that adorn the page. Other of his writings are more revealing and more explicitly autobiographic. Still, this brief book is an interesting look at one of more fascinating minds of the twentieth century.<br />Best of all, this is Dali. It's not by someone else, about Dali. It is Dali.	2004-06-06

I read these collections of the original comics out of order, as I encounter them, and started with some of the later collections.<br />That's why I found this Sandman such a surprise. I really didn't like it that much. I think it suffered from two big problems. First was a problem of the comics business: there's nearly no such thing as a new series. The big publishers, at least when Sandman first came out, felt the need to graft new characters onto old story lines, perhaps to spark initial sales. Sandman really didn't benefit from that surgery.<br />Second and more understandable is that a new series, esp. something so different from DC's usual, needs a little time to find itself. The good news is that, by the end of this collection, the Sandman story line really did seem to come into its own. The last piece in this book, 'The Sound of Her Wings,' is the Sandman I've come to enjoy. I'm just worried that new readers might be disappointed by this book and not come back to the later, better work.<br />This isn't bad by any means, it's just a fitful start to an exceptional series. After this, it just gets better.	2004-06-06

C'mon.<br /><br />First, let me say that fuzzy logic and fuzzy arithmetic are great tools. They're valued parts of the 'soft logic' kit that includes probability, interval arithmetic, Bayesian and Markov networks, and lots of other good stuff. Fuzziness involves many of the formal techniques used in probability and elsewhere, and gives a useful, alternative view of the systems it addresses.<br /><br />The basic fuzzy idea is that most descriptions involve shades of gray, that few systems really match the black/white, on/off, either/or duality of standard formal logic. That's fine, I can get along with that quite well.<br /><br />My problem, though, is that Kosko presents the fuzzy world-view vs. the traditional or \\"scientific\\" in exactly the black and white terms that he rejects. He also argues that fuzziness describes the world more effectively than \\"scientific\\" terms, that the rules of arithmetic, probability, and calculus are just games. They are played for their internal consistency, not because differentiation or factorials occur in nature.<br /><br />That's true, and as a heavy math user I know enough to distinguish my models from reality. Two facts remain, though. First, the models very often do describe reality in ways that can be checked easily enough: the bridge doesn't fall down and the TV receives its signal. Both happen because the bad old exact arithmetic has some kind of correspondence (no, I don't know what) to the real world, giving real ability to predict real results. Second, fuzzy logic and fuzzy arithmetic are themselves mathematical formalisms, games like all the others. Once you get past the gee-whiz stage, there is mathematical content as rigorous as in any other field of study. It's not either/or, it's very often a different way to interpret the same self-consistent games people have played for years. It adds interesting rules to the game.<br /><br />The great thing is that you really can use the new interpretations and tools along with the old ones. Fuzziness doesn't demolish the old structures, it bolsters them and adds capacity.<br /><br />And you can get all these benefits without shrink-wrapped, bite-sized pieces of Eastern philosophy.<br /><br />//wiredweirdn't demolish the old structures, it bolsters them and adds capacity.

Both are very readable translations, with the smooth, idiomatic style that Cleary always delivers.<br />I found TMDV to be a baffling piece. Its aphorisms are all simple, even obvious statements. I really felt as if I were missing something: perhaps there were depths that I couldn't pierce, or the translation did not capture the text's intent, or the text assumed common knowledge of the Warring States period that has since been lost. I suspect the latter. Cleary offers a very helpful commentary on TMDV, just after the text itself. When I reread the text, referring to the commentary, I found it much more interesting.<br />TMHS stood by itself much better, and does not have a commentary. It extends the ideas on statecraft presented in the Lao Tzu, but has a more prosaic and straightforward style. In some ways, it seems to be a bridge to the Confucian thinking that dominated the era. It emphasized the belief that social hierarchy is part of mankind's natural order, and especially that farming and weaving are the proper duties of the agrarian classes. A modern reader may note, however, that The Way placed others in positions of power or learning and that these people needed much less encouragement to exercise that power or knowledge.<br />These seem not to be central works in the Taoist canon. Still, they are enjoyable, and the translation is clear and modern. This book will help develop a more complete library of the Chinese classics.	2004-06-03

This is the most complete, clearest introduction to the basic problems and practice of component software development that I've seen.<br />After the introductory chapter, about the first third of the book discusses object oriented development. That's no contradiction: OO technology is usually the implementation vehicle for component systems. Szyperski adds (or at least collects) real content about OO technique, including the problematic relationship between 'contracts' and callbacks, language features for containment and control, and the many needs that current OO languages don't meet. Lots of the discussion sounds like 'the loyal opposition' - he supports OO practice, even demands it, but is harshly critical of the OO techniques that cause real problems.<br />The remainder of the book describes requirements of a workable component system and a workable component industry. If done right, component software really could solve a lot of problems: squabbling in multi-vendor environments, maintenance across multiple generations of releases, and more. The theoretical discussion is backed up with case studies, including JavaBeans, CORBA, and OpenDoc.<br />The would-be component user won't find a lot here; this book is really for the component or component framework developer. Developers, however, should not expect a lot of direct, technical detail. This discusses principles, not implementation. That's my one real disappointment in this book: the lack of detail. Even the case studies are brief and somewhat shallow. Those problems are easy to fix, however, with other books on specific APIs, systems, and development techniques.<br />If you are planning a component-based system, whether as a component user or a component developer, this book may be essential. It gives a complete, critical view of what components can do and what they should but cannot yet do.

Best, Mack has put some real knowledge of Japanese culture and history into the story. It's not all pleasant history, but not all history is pleasant.<br />The artwork is all black and white. I like that, when it's used well, and Mack uses it to the fullest. The drawing styles are varied and expressive. My only complaint is that some of the white-on-black lettering eroded during reproduction. To print well using inexpensive paper and process, the white-on-black should have had a heavier line weight. Ink naturally bleeds into the white areas; bleeding in from both sides of the lettering's stroke made some of the text hard to read.<br />I almost gave this five stars. Mack has continued the Kabuki series, though, and it gets better as it goes along. He keeps raising the bar for comic excellence - this doesn't quite measure up to the later books in the series, either for art or for story. His later work beats just about every other comic out there, including this earlier work.<br />It's good, though, and a good intro to the later books.	2004-05-31

The earth is all but destroyed. The reclamation requires further devastation, in the short term, and that's where the story takes place.<br />It just does't come across as strongly as it should have. The good guys are poor but honest farmers. The bad guys' downfall is their greed for gold. Sarah's transport from one episode to the next is the comic sidekick, just a little too eager for the next dollar. Good stories can be made from such ordinary pieces, but it takes a little more skill than I saw here.<br />The line drawing is competent. In fact, the scenery stole the show in most of the underground panels. There appears to be some ink-wash drawing in the first few pages. Sad to say, the coarse half-tone screen lost all of the subtlety that the artist put in originally.<br />\\"Mother Sarah\\" is readable, even enjoyable, just not memorable.	2004-05-31

The vignettes are all well drawn in Foglio's amusing style, and are all gentle and consensual. Some (maybe most) are a little kinky, but there are no dark or hard edges here.<br />I have trouble calling this erotic, even though every tale (and occasional tail) is 'anatomically explicit.' Foglio's stories are just too comical and cartoonish. The SF angle allows for some otherwise improbable premises, so there are many different angles on mankind's oldest entertainment.<br />The series is funny, affectionate, and memorable. You may not remember any one story a month later. The happy, funny tone is what's worth a return visit, maybe again and again.	2004-05-31

Bringhurst is a poet. He loves language, written language, and all its parts. That love comes through in the text and the visual presentation of every page.<br />Bringhurst advocates a subdued typographic style. This makes good sense in the vast majority of cases, since typography is the servant of the text that it carries. Like any good servant, it should be unobtrusive, well dressed, and competent to handle every task it is given, quietly and promptly. Bringhurst demonstrates nearly everything he says, starting first with this book itself.<br />The book is a beautiful artifact, with an elegant and informative page layout. Body text, side- and foot-notes, references, running titles, and more - they all fit together well on the page. Each kind of information is set off only slightly, but clearly and predictably. The content is well organized: prose in the early chapters, reference material in the later chapters and appendices, and all the intermediates in the middle of the book. Diagrams and tables are minimalist and communicative.<br />The text spans centuries, from ancient Egyptian page layouts to the rationale behind Unicode. Bringhurst is passionate about typography's history, and insists that it inform every modern decision about print and printing. He embraces the new just as much, and is careful to note the strengths and weaknesses of each typographic technology.<br />Bringhurst discusses far too many topics to touch on here. In every case, though, he brings his poet's sense to all of the writing, using witty, descriptive language for even the most mundane of technical issues. The one weakness I saw was in the geometry of page layouts. I like his mathematical rigor and esthetic practicality. Still, I think that the number of different constructions was more a tribute to what can be done than to what serves a real need.<br />This is the best, most complete text I know on book design. As Bringhurst points out, there are lots of other uses for type than books, but he chose books as his subject - I have no problem with that limitation. The only problem I saw, and not really a problem with the book itself, is its subtlety. The nuances (well, most of the nuances) he discusses are important. Beginners, however, may not see the significance of small matters. Once a reader's eye it tuned to the fine detail, however, this book is the most helpful I know.ringhurst points out, there are lots of other uses for type than books, but he chose books as his subject - I have no problem with that limitation.

The approaches are varied. Some are very nuts&amp;bolts, others operate at a much more philosophical level. Some of the more interesting topics involve component-based systems, hardware design, and several applications of design patterns.<br />The whole thing, including 50 pages of end matter, weighs in over 700 pages. The writing is dense and packed with data. It's a real goldmine of information.<br />The problem is that a goldmine, these days, typically yields one gram of gold per tonne of ore. Extracting this book's information, the real usable content, from its data is about like extracting that gram. Maybe that's appropriate, though. Framework development is not as well understood as lots of other kinds of software, and the first step in any science is to collect specimens. I've found my nuggets in this book, as other readers have found theirs, but different people find different nuggets according to their needs and interests.<br />If you have an active interest in framework development, and if you have time and energy to distill over 650 pages of raw data on your own, this book may be for you. It really is not for the beginner or the casual reader, though.	2004-05-27

The good news is that the book gives me plenty to work with.<br />First is the writing style. Nearly all of the text is bulleted lists or hierarchies of bulleted lists. At best, it's an un-natural reading style. This isn't the best, though. Some of the lists go on for pages. Most annoying is that most bullet items start with incomplete sentences. At times, I felt desperate for a whole sentence with subject and verb.<br />Second is the style of illustration. I don't insist that every author be a trained graphic designer. A few basics should be obvious, though. Here's one: at least within any one picture, use different line styles to encode different information or to create contrast. Figure 2-8 uses lots of different styles to say the same thing, fig. 3-7 uses one style to say lots of different things, and fig 5-7 appears to use one line drawn in styles (weights) that change when it turns a corner. These are just examples, by the way, not a complete catalog of problem illustrations or even of kinds of problems.<br />The worst, though, is the technical content. The first half of the book isn't UML at all, it's an introduction to OO design (compared to two different earlier styles) and development process. I generally found the discussions so brief as to border on meaningless. If I wasn't already familiar with the topics, I doubt that I could have figured out what the machine-gun bulleted lists were trying to express. I feel sorry for the beginner trying to learn from these chapters.<br />Even the UML, the second half of the book, suffered from the same brevity and opaque style. The section on state charts, in particular, managed to show only the pieces but never how they fit into a whole state machine. It was as if I showed you a box full of nuts, bolts, wheels, and handles, and expected you to understand what a tricycle is. The section on activity diagrams, however, was short enough to qualify as negligent. I can't even criticize the content, because there's almost nothing there to criticize.<br />I can not recommend this book.r, was short enough to qualify as negligent.

Given the importance of XML, XSLT is going to be a critical tool at anyone's workbench sooner or later.<br />XSLT is also a hard language to work with. That's where this book comes in. When I needed to write an XML-based application of my own - one involving DocBook, HTML, and XSLT itself - XSLT was the natural choice, though a daunting one. Using only this book, I managed to pick up the XSLT programming model (hint: there is almost no such thing as flow of control) and get the job done. Kay's discussions of XML name spaces and other basics were part of what got the job done right.<br />This book should be on the shelf of every serious XML programmer. I don't know whether a programming beginner would get the full value from it, but experienced readers will find it dense, well-organized, and above all helpful.	2004-05-26

He represents an interesting departure from them, though.<br /><br />He holds the same high regard for order, hierarchy, and ritual as the earlier Confucians. He combines it with some of the thinking from other schools, though. He flirts with Han Fei Tzu's Legalist pessimism about human nature. Xunzi, however, asserts that proper behavior can be learned and taught. Deep understanding would be best, but even rote performance of one's proper roles and rituals are enough to save people from their innate flaws. He also takes on some of Chuang Tzu's mysticism. Xunzi's \\"sage\\" seems almost to spread his upright influence just by standing among the lesser people, with a magical lack of causal relationship.<br /><br />It's clear that Xunzi wrote as one among many different schools of thought. He spends a good bit of time explaining the errors of the competing philosophers, making it clear that his own thinking needed justification in that environment. He does, however, add a few notes of his own. For example, section 9 describes a king's duties. The king, through his deputies, is expected to regulate fishing, forestry, and other use of renewable resources. This is not meant to deprive anyone or to enrich the king artificially, but to keep the resources productive for the long term. How I wish that today's leaders would learn from the knowledge of 300BC.<br /><br />Xunzi was not among the first rank of influential thinkers, but well up in the second rank. If you are building a library of Eastern classics, this certainly has a place on your shelf.<br /><br />//wiredweird<br /><br />PS: This appears to be the same material as Watson's \\"Hsun Tzu\\" (ISBN 0231086075).

He goes over all the main categories of UML diagrams showing what they mean and usually how they relate to actual code.<br />This is, by intent, a very brief book about a very large topic. Part of its value is in giving the quick tour without dragging the reader through the thousands of pages of OMG specifications. That means a lack of rigor, reinforced by the informal writing style - all very approriate to an introduction.<br />The UML can be intimidating in its mass and in the level of detail it prescribes. Fowler cuts through all that very well. Best of all, he keeps a slightly skeptical tone. The UML is a tool, meant to serve the developer. It is not intended to take over the development process, so don't let it.<br />There are just two things I wish this book decribed better. First is the unification problem. The UML offers dozen or so different representations of different aspects of a program's structure and behavior. The question is, how do I get all those representations to relate to each other so it's clear that they describe the same thing? The complete answer may be too long for this book, but this isn't a book about complete answers. A few more clues would have strengthened the discussion.<br />Second is the discussion of state diagrams. It's a concept that beginners seem to stumble over: what do states really model? The best answer I know is that it describes situations where one input elicits different responses at different times, in different operating modes. The number keys on an ATM keypad are an example: first they represent the PIN, then they choose the banking operation to perform, then they may represent the numeric dollar amount of a transaction. Fowler just says to use state diagrams for &quot;interesting behavior.&quot;<br />It's a good intro to UML with a good (though aging) bibliography. It should not be your only book on UML, but never meant to be. Beginners get a gentle start to a tough topic. Seasoned users can jog their memories on fine points of notations they haven't used in a while. This book really is for everyone.to be. Beginners get a gentle start to a tough topic.

There's a galactic war going on, and our hero (named Faith - for real) is assigned to a theocratic world. There are traitors, good guys, and lots of SF hardware to work with. The story shows ordinary originality, but very good development and pacing.<br />The art is what caught my eye, though. It appears to be painted work, acrylics or maybe gouache, very well done, and well printed. The style has a posed look that somehow makes every picture seem important - a good thing, when the sequence of pictures carries the story.<br />It's clear that this artist learned a lot from Howard Chaykin's work. The style and craftmanship are there, without being slavishly derivative. Come to think of it, things like the corrupt theocracy may be Chaykin-inspired too. Well, good artists have been learning from each other probably since the Lascaux cave art. This work was educated by Chaykin's, but stands on its own.<br />I like this one, and I'm coming back for more.	2004-05-25

I've shared the same beliefs for years, but it was good to see them clarified and codified. I really have changed some of my practice after reading this and books like this.<br />I have two broad kinds of problem with this dogma, though. First is the near-abolition of documentation. I can't defend 2000 page specs for typical kinds of development. On the other hand, declaring that the test suite is the spec doesn't do it for me either. The test suite is code, written for machine interpretation. Much too often, it is not written for human interpretation. Based on the way I see most code written, it would be a nightmare to reverse engineer the human meaning out of any non-trivial test code. Some systematic way of ensuring human intelligibility in the code, traceable to specific &quot;stories&quot; (because &quot;requirements&quot; are part of the bad old way), would give me a lot more confidence in the approach.<br />The second is the dictatorial social engineering that eXtremity mandates. I've actually tried the pair programming - what a disaster. The less said the better, except that my experience did not actually destroy any professional relationships. I've also worked with people who felt that their slightest whim was adequate reason to interfere with my work. That's what Beck institutionalizes by saying that any request made of me by anyone on the team must be granted. It puts me completely at the mercy of anyone walking by. The requisite bullpen physical environment doesn't work for me either. I find that the visual and auditory distraction make intense concentration impossible.<br />I find revival tent spirit of the eXtremists very off-putting. If something works, it works for reasons, not as a matter of faith. I find much too much eXhortation to believe, to go ahead and leap in, so that I will eXperience the wonderfulness for myself. Isn't that what the evangelist on the subway platform keeps saying? Beck does acknowledge unbelievers like me, but requires their exile in order to maintain the group-think of the X-cult.<br />Beck's last chapters note a number of exceptions and special cases where eXtremism may not work - actually, most of the projects I've ever encountered.<br />There certainly is good in the eXtreme practice.

They show many different ways to approach the physcial act of love, both in body and in spirit. That much of the book was easy to enjoy.<br />The range of pictures is somewhat limited, though. The majority are Chinese. It's not that I object to the Chinese paintings or style, but that the authors under-represent the Japanese tradition. Shunga print offers a vast amount of material, but not much appears here and maybe not the most distinguished examples.<br />The commentary on each picture was vapid beyond belief. It generally emphasized that facts that were obvious on casual inspection, but added the traditional name of the position shown. It would have been so easy to add descriptions of real interest: the attitudes behind threesomes or other unusual presentation, the relationships of positions to Taoist alchemy, the social meaning of a woman unclad below the waist but covered across the chest, or more. I'm quite discouraged when I think about all the opportunities lost.<br />Other books offer better collections and better commentary. The pictures are ordinary, of their kind, but reproduced well enough. There really isn't a lot that makes this book stand out, though.	2004-05-23

At first, I simply enjoyed the peaceful scenes and happy people that Sturges portrays. Many of his subject are young people, though, and my mind drifted back to myself at their age. Somehow, it all came rushing back to me: that sense of mystery and awe, about fifth grade, when I first started seeing the girls around me becoming young women. Sturges has a unique talent for showing the steps between child and adult with respect and innocence. I was not prepared for the evoked memory of myself at that innocent age.<br />This book collects some of the most beautiful figure studies I've ever seen.

This brief book is a socratic conversation between three speakers: Mondrian's representative of the new, an agent of the old, and the naif in need of explanations.<br />The translator's notes quote Mondrian, in some other context, as saying that &quot;writers are the worst criminals.&quot; Mondrian goes on to prove that in the example his own writing. The tone is strident and authorative. The line of development, however, has no apparent basis in logical reasoning. To my eye, it is barely comprehensible. (The two brief 'stream of consciousness' pieces at the end border on gibberish.)<br />As near as I can tell, Mondrian uses this book to predict some Edenic future where the arts have mostly passed away as separate activities. Instead, artistic expression would be fully integrated into the acts and artifacts of daily life. (OK, I'll go along with that.) He further insists that individual personality would be excised from art, replaced by self-working laws of esthetics and balance, somehow defined by the 'spirit of the times'. This writing dates from the era (1919-1920) when Bauhaus thinking was being developed and deployed, so I'm not surprised to hear Mondrian echo what was being said elsewhere.<br />What left me baffled, however, was a pair of assertions. First was that the new kind of vision was developing in the world, with historical inevitability, the vision that Mondrian attempted to explain. Second was that only a new kind of man (women were not named) would be able to share in this sensibility. It seemed that an esthetic that did not yet exist would be expressed only by a species that did not yet exist. Huh?<br />I did not pick this book up to be swayed by its logic or commentary. If I had, I would have been disappointed. Instead, I wanted to see the words actually set down by one of the twentieth century's influential thinkers, and I succeeded in that.<br />'Natural Reality' is fascinating as a historical document and as an exercise in rhetoric.

In Confucian China, this was a radical and subversive notion. It undermined the traditional notions of filial piety, even social hierarchy, since it eliminated the special status of one's own parents in the web of personal relationships.<br />He compounded the breach of filial piety by insisting on small, inexpensive funerals and brief mourning periods, also in the name of universal love. Mozi believed completely in the spirits of the dead and in honoring them properly. He believed even more strongly in supporting &quot;the people,&quot; usually meaning the farming classes. Confucian funeral garb, coffins, and rituals inflicted staggering costs, and harsh mourning practices literally endangered the mourner's health. Mozi's utilitarian philosophy required that wealth be used to meet the needs of the living, since the dead could not use it. Utilitarianism also argued that mourners should return to normal, productive life as soon as possible, without risking the strength needed for their livelihood.<br />Most surprisingly, Mozi's universal love justified the militia composed of his followers. Mozi held that the small and weak were of equal standing with the large and strong, and that bullying (or invading) of the weak was unjust. He backed his notion of justice with arms, coming to the defense to small states when unjustly attacked by the larger.<br />Historically, Mo taught after Confucius (who is treated to special excoration in Mo's text) but before Mencius (who in turn attacks Mo). Mo appears to have been well known down to the current time, even if his actual influence on Chinese history was minor. I wonder, though - his drab utilitarian outlook may eventually have been informed Maoist policy.<br />This is a brief and enjoyable addition to any set of Eastern classics. It's divergence from the main stream of Chinese philospohical history makes it especially interesting, since it provides contrast to the better-known thinkers.<br />Perhaps Mozi isn't for every reader, but the serious student is sure to enjoy it.f and enjoyable addition to any set of Eastern classics.

The first few chapters, for example, presented particular extensions to the Haskell programming langauge, intended to support parallel programming. Lord knows that parallel systems need all the help they can get. If hard-core functional programming is the answer, though, I'm not sure I heard the question. Functional programmers have been beating their drum for at least 30 years, and still have little effect on the main parade of software development.<br />What they call &quot;skeletons&quot; seem to be fairly ordinary constructs for parallelism, including co-begin and pipelining. I have trouble getting excited about seeing them presented in obscure notation. I would also have hoped to see more demanding kinds of applications. Ray-tracing was a common one, but ray-tracing is &quot;embarassingly parallel.&quot; It's almost hard not to get a parallel speedup approaching 1:1 with the number of processors.<br />The remainder of the book operates at a very different level. Instead of specific syntax in a specific language, it presents a number of design patterns at a very high conceptual level. Instead of particular implementations on specific processors, it discusses techniques that can be applied across loosely-coupled, web-based ensembles. The design pattern discussion was adequate, but seemed an odd mate for the low-level detail of the book's first section.<br />Even though I work every day with highly parallel computation, I just didn't come away with much I could use. I found this book frankly disappointing.	2004-05-21

If you really want to know what the mice and microbes think, let Harris be your interpreter.<br />The end of the book came way too soon. That just means that I have to find more of his books - and don't ask to borrow mine. I keep coming back to them, and enjoying them all over again.	2004-05-21

His topics are often serious. This whole book is about what we've done and continue to do to the world we live in. Harris knows that a  serious topic doesn't always need a grim discussion, and his teasing makes his points better than any harangue ever could.<br />This book was published in 1996, and collects many cartoons that originated earlier. Most haven't aged, though. There's the gas station attendant sitting dejectedly, for example: &quot;I just saw my first electric car.&quot; As of today, the issues have only become more sharply draw - electric (or hybrid) cars are on the roads now, and the fossil fuel companies really haven't changed.<br />Science is too important to be reserved for scientists. Harris' humor does a lot to deflate over-stuffed egos. Even better, his humor creates memorable images about important ideas.<br />Enjoy!	2004-05-19

Even a number like 0.1 has no exact representation a computer's binary arithmetic - the number comes with an error already built in. When you start combining numbers (i.e. doing arithmetic), things just get worse.<br />This book addresses the two biggest areas of numeric computing: polynomials and linear matrix algebra. The first half of the book goes over a number of techniques for finding roots of polynomials, in the ways that give the most answers of the highest quality. The second half of the book discusses ill-conditioned linear systems and solution techniques that avoid common pitfalls.<br />Unfortunately, the book discusses these critical topics in terms of 1963 technology. A modern eye finds it jarring to see computer arithmetic described in base 10, when binary is the natural language of machines. Wilkinson discusses fixed-point arithmetic, which is still used heavily in computing for multimedia and embedded systems. His approach is haphazard, though; a more systematic development would have served fixed-point users much better.<br />In its day, I'm sure this book was current and practical. It's easy to see how the author has distilled more complex discussions into applicable analysis. A lot has happened between that day and this, however. Techniques have developed (and are still being developed), and expository techniques have improved for the topics that the book does cover. IEEE floating point has since become the standard, and demands discussion of its own.<br />The modern reader looking for a practical guide should keep looking.	2004-05-19

The drawing is outstanding and varied. There are science fiction scenes, fantasies with demons and dragons, sword-and-sandal, and lots more.<br />The real surprise for me was the huge and detailed black and white drawings. Pencil is a seriously under-rated medium. Lockwood shows just how much expression and detail the medium can support.<br />Still, the world of fantasy art is a large world. It is populated with people like Boris Vallejo, Julie Bell, Frank Frazetta, and too many others to name. Lockwood's work is creative and competent. I just don't see the spark in it that would let his work stand next to the greatest masters of the field.	2004-05-19

Two big problems are that the distribution buried in the analysis may not be the right one, and that the assumption might not even be visible in the analysis. &quot;Nonparametric statistics&quot; (NPS) make no assumptions about the distribution. They work no matter how the data are distributed. Even better, they sometimes work to determine whether the standard techniques have any hope of giving answers.<br />For the practitioner, this book is the broadest catalog I know of how-to for NPS: when each analysis applies and how to apply it. Even more, it gives insight into how some of the tests work. That gives the reader a better chance to understand each technique's strengths, weaknesses, and applicability. For the student, including self-taught, it's a clear and well-organized textbook. The exercises are varied and generally meaningful, and half have answers (though little discussion of how the answers were derived).<br />I wish the book gave more background, including how some of the distributions are derived. Most times, seeing more of the derivation gives me more confidence in using an analysis. Face it, almost every real-life situation needs to be bashed a bit to fit the format expected by a test. Knowing more of the background gives me more assurance that my machinations don't break any important assumptions. Still, it's the author's choice to emphasize practice over theory and I have to respect that.<br />More seriously, I would like to see the bootstrapping section enlarged. Many modern applications, particularly in biology, deal with data so complex that they define analysis or even real understanding. Bootstrapping is just one of many randomization and resampling techniques used for such data. More discussion on the design and analysis of resampling techniques would have been very useful.<br />The book meets its goals, though, and does so admirably. I'm not a stat specialist, but this is the book I'll recommend for heavy users who want a little more than rote recitation of analytic techniques.so admirably.

It's full of Corben's exaggerated figure drawing, the women even more exaggerated than the men. The characters and settings are improbable - I really wonder why the &quot;fish people&quot; are so bulbously mammalian. The stories move fast, and don't present too much of a demand on the intellect. Good, uncomplicated fun.<br />Den 5 continues the stories of the Nar stones, the ones at the center of the &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; movie. They date back to the 80s. Corben didn't stop there, however. His artwork and story telling have both developed since then. If you're looking for good comics, you might like Corben. The later work is generally better and certainly more accessible, though. Only the serious collector will try to hunt down the older material.	2004-05-19

It's just that I don't see a lot of his novelty in this second trilogy. In the first series, a man is driven to some unseen fate by correspondence from a mysterious, other-wordly being. In this series, a couple is driven to some unseen fate by correspondence from a mysterious, other-wordly couple.<br />The format is very evocative. It's a voyeuristic look at the letters and postcards between the dramatis personae. We actually open the envelopes and read their mail. It gives a sense of naughtiness - &quot;Is it OK for me to do this?&quot; It's the same format as in the first series, though. The freshness is off it, it can't be a new experience again.<br />I would have been a lot happier if this series gave new information. Where is Paolo, or the Sicmon Islands? Who or what is Frolatti, and what is Frolatti's involvement? How does Sabine do - well, I'm not sure what she does.<br />I like Bantock's layered art (even when it's over-worked) and his fascination with stamps and postmarks. I really do want to see the story of Griffin and Sabine move forward. The tale seems to have stalled, though. Perhaps his success with the original G&amp;S has left Bantock nervous about changing his formula.	2004-05-17

Despite its critical and growing importance, it has always been a specialist topic.<br /><br />Sweeney just changed that. I'm no coding specialist. Still, I need a working knowledge of error control coding (ECC: detection, correction, or tolerance). This is the first book I know of that presents ECC at a non-specialist level. It still requires some college-level math: finite fields, probability, and a flexible attitude towards notation. It does not require the reader to hack through pages of theorems, though. Instead, Sweeney makes each point using worked examples.<br /><br />The book covers a wide range of useful topics. It starts with the basics. For example, I now know what \\"coding gain\\" is. Next, Sweeney introduces convolutional or streaming codes. He not only shows the techniques, but shows the figures of merit for each code and how to compute them - knowledge I can use.<br /><br />He brings the same clarity to the more common block codes, including cyclic, BCH, and Reed-Solomon codes. This discussion is followed by more analysis, showing at least a half-dozen ways to understand the strengths and weaknesses of any code. On the way through, he shows how the ECC interacts with the signal's analog encoding. We see how the \\"constellation\\" of a communication signal affects choice of finite field and ECC, and how that differs from codes suited to magnetic or other simpler representation.<br /><br />The final sections discuss the elements that make up the most advanced codes in common use today: the turbo codes. By the time this discussion appears, the reader is already familiar with different ways to combine codes and to evaluate the combination. The reader also understands hard and soft Viterbi decoding, and when they are preferred over max-MAP techniques. Unlike older ECC books that seemed desperate for simple decoding circuits, Sweeney shows us the computation-intensive techiques of iterative decoding.<br /><br />I find only two systematic faults in this book. First, the index is weak, and the table of contents isn't detailed enough to make up for that lack. Second, all of Sweeney's diagrams adopt the bizarre convention of introducing a data stream from the right, so that computation proceeds towards the left. This practice may make sense for trellis decoding. For data flow or circuit diagrams, however, it not only violates convention, it violates normal English left-to-right reading order. It was a real struggle sometimes to pull the proper sequences of events from a diagram, when the reading order was \\"backwards.\\"<br /><br />The book's strengths far outweigh those minor problems. As I said, I'm not a coding specialist. Until I see a better book, though, this is the one I'll recommend to anyone needing a basic literacy in ECC. If someone needs more than the basics, I'll still recommend this for its introductory content and bibliography.<br /><br />//wiredweirdws us the computation-intensive techiques of iterative decoding.

The original Griffin and Sabine series had a wonderful spark of originality. This series is just too derivative.<br />I wanted to like this new trilogy. I like Bantock's art. There is so much in each picture that I can barely pull myself away for the text. I like the new plot elements that Bantock introduced. The cat with a name, Isabella's roar - these could have been rich new elements in the G&amp;S mythology. They never went anywhere though, and left us re-reading the G&amp;S story in somewhat different words.<br />If you're new to Bantock, the first G&amp;S trilogy is your best bet.

It's one of those books that make 90s comics stand out so well. The images are painterly and generally well printed, except for the occasional problem in color registration.<br />Although well drawn, the figures always look static. Every pose seems balanced and stable, as if drawn from a live model. The problem is that motion, even walking, is inherently unbalanced and unstable.<br />The story is a series of shorter pieces put together. That comes from a fine tradition of story-telling, and can work well. The narrative never pulls the episodes together into a whole, though. For example The Mercenary leaves the end of the first chapter with a magic crystal and a canteen unwittingly filled with poisoned water. At the start of the second chapter, we discover that the crystal will never work again and that a detoxifying pill cures The Mercenary and his mount in just a few minutes.<br />I'm not getting rid of this one. Still, I want comics in my collection to meet a higher standard. Look this one over carefully before you buy, since there are many tastes that &quot;The Mercenary&quot; will not satisfy.	2004-05-16

First is just as a coffee table picture book. In that role, &quot;Boundaries&quot; gives a photographic tour of many varied monuments and installations. Lin is best known for the Vietnam Veteran's memorial. At the time, it was an unprecendented look and a deep controversy. Since then, I think it has become what Lin had hoped: one of the most personally involving war memorials ever. Lin has moved on since then, and this book shows many of her more recent works.<br />Although her family heritage is Chinese, Lin identifies herself as American. That gives her the freedom to use concepts from many Asian traditions. Many of her later works show a sense that I see as Zen-like. They are centered on stone, water, earth, and light. Like that first memorial, they invite the viewer to touch and become involved in the work. &quot;Waves&quot;, for example, is a large-scale earthwork to be explored, offering surprising privacy in an open, sunlit lawn.<br />The second reading of this book comes from its text. It explains Lin's approach to her work. I was quite surprised to fined out how important collaboration is for her. Most of her installations are undertaken with archtitects, writers, or preparators of various kinds, quite opposite the 'lonely artist' stereotype. I was also surprised to learn that her first conception of most pieces is narrative, not pictorial. To me, translating word into image and structure is a complete mystery. My own thoughts work in the other direction. That difference intrigues me.<br />The book itself is a pleasant artifact. It's well printed, well organized, and displays some thoughtful, unusual typography. It's a vehicle well suited to the material it carries.<br />&quot;Boundaries&quot; was printed in 2000. That means that the catalog of Lin's work has developed since then. More of her work surely exists that was locked out by the publication date.

The artwork is sound, and the story has a promising start: mysterious phenomena augur the coming year millenium, and possibly the end of the world.<br />Although workmanlike, the story and art never really grab me. The renderings are all good and figures are drawn realistically. They are all static, though, and the characters all seem to talk &quot;into the camera&quot;. Page layouts tend to have a predictable grid, and don't push the story along as well as they could.<br />The art is good, but lots of other artists are at least as good. The story is adequate, but other stories are better. I'll come back to this book sooner or later, but probably not sooner. In the mean time, I recommend it only to the serious Segrelle fan.	2004-05-16

This book was first published in 1928, and seems to have been the founding manifesto of the &quot;Swiss school&quot; of typography. This is a must-read for all serious students of type, and for a few others as well.<br />First, the messages for typographers. The book itself is part of that message: sanserif body text, bright white paper, and geometric red and black graphics. Tschichold uses a few conventions that I quite like. Footnotes are indicated inline and at the end of the page by a heavy black mark. At first, it looked like a blot on the gray of the body type. After seeing it a few times, though, I realized that the heavy mark was very helpful for recovering my place in the reading after my eyes moved away to read the footnote. Emphasis is shown with heavy rules in the outer margins around text, much the way I mark books myself. My only complaint about the book as a whole has to do with indistinct paragraph breaks - there is clue from indentation or line spacing, so it is actually possible to miss a pragraph break altogether.<br />The second half of the book shows a number of examples, good, bad, and (today) historically interesting. Almost all examples are bold red and black - the first two colors to be used up in most sets of crayons. It is easy to forget that these examples were often designed for letterpress, since photocompostion barely existed as we understand the term. Despite Tschichold's passion for modernity, the style now looks as dated as Bauhaus, streamlined locomotives, and Art Deco.<br />The first half of the book is for typographers, but also for any modern student of polemic. Not many people have strong feelings about typography, so the ranting can be considered by itself. Tschichold's style is based on &quot;the spirit of our age&quot; somehow revealed to him alone, and on Germanic philosophical absolutes. It is ironic that, during the cultural purges of pre-WWII Germany, Tschichold was among those rounded up for politically incorrect artwork - another absolute in conflict with his own.<br />Happily, Tschichold was able to emigrate to Switzerland before war broke out. He had a long and influential career, and later regretted the strident excesses of youth that this book captures.<br />This is useful as a guide to typographic style, but beginners will probably get more from modern texts. It gives a very informative view of the DIN standards for paper and business correspondence. Most of all, however, it captures a time and a mentality that no longer exist, but that guided one strong school of typographic practice for over 80 years.for politically incorrect artwork - another absolute in conflict with his own.<br />Happily, Tschichold was able to emigrate to Switzerland before war broke out.

I do like the artwork, watercolors of exceptional skill. I showed a page to a friend and her first reaction was &quot;Oh, photography.&quot; The book is well printed, so all of Muth's artistic care comes through.<br />If the story had lived up to the visuals, this comic would have been among my all-time favorites. It centers on a murder in a church play, giving a paradoxical &quot;God is Dead&quot; message. Although clues are scattered throughout the story (as a crossword junkie, the crossword puzzle stood out for me), I just never caught a real sense of suspense.<br />This book may help round out a collection of comics, but probably won't be a center-piece.

It really begins, though, when women of the East meet a woman of the West.<br />This brief comic is about dualities: rank vs. power, public vs. closed societies, and real vs. fable, to name just a few. The dualities are so much sharper for being so close beside each other, as close and as far away as the harem behind the women's door.<br />Some of those dualities appear in the comic's imagery, with watercolored stories and photo narrative. I use the term photo loosely, since the images are heavily filtered, colorized, fuzzed or sharpened, and generally hand-tailored to their purpose in the story. The lettering is undistinguished, but suited to the female narrator or to the slightly fabulous story-within-a-story.<br />On the whole, this magazine is well done, an unusual mix of reality and fantasy. The art is thoughtful and interesting. It's not truly outstanding among comics, but it's one I enjoy and come back to.<br />This isn't an &quot;adult&quot; comic, but there isn't much here for a young reader.	2004-05-13

That means that it skips most of the quantum mechanical modeling of more advanced computational chemistry texts.<br />Nothing is lost, because Schlick covers her chosen topic (molecular modeling and dynamics) in such detail. She starts with a very clear discussion of the structure of large biomolecules, with emphasis on the features that need quantitative description for modeling. That covers protein structure at ever level. It also covers DNA/RNA structure in the best detail I've ever seen. The double-helix is the just the starting point. There are alternative helix forms, non-standard binding between nucleotides, and asymmetries caused by nucleotide composition. The next chapters describe the geometric model and, briefly, the forces acting between atoms.<br />The second half of the book gets down to the nuts and bolts of modeling. This includes numerical techniques, minimization, sampling and Monte Carlo techniques, and the start of dynamics. Schlick attacks some of the nasty points of the calculations, such as modeling of forces that act on very different time scales. As with the simpler material, the development is clear, descriptive, and free of pointless theorems. The meticulous reader should come away able to implement most or all of the techniques described. The level of presentation is consistent and approachable. I think freshman physics should be enough preparation for most students to get most of the value out of the discussion.<br />The book is written with clarity as a top priority. The glossary is in the front, making sure that the reader knows it's a first-class part of the text. After that, every chapter starts with a list of the mathematical symbols and variables used and a one-line description of each. These are small things, but they increase the book's readability immensely. The illustrations are generally informative enough. On the whole, though, they don't seem quite up to the level of the textual and mathematical presentations.<br />I needed a crash course in the mathematical techniques used for describing molecular structure and behavior.

Potential energy surfaces make sense. Molecular mechanics has a good, intuitive feel - it's the springs-and-balls model, elaborated to include plane and dihedral angles, representing force fields derived from other sources.<br />After that (i.e., after p. 80), it's quantum mechanics for a few hundred pages. The premise is that the layout of electrons across a molecule determines its chemistry, and that the wave function tells where the electrons will be. Since the wave equations can't be solved exactly for anything with two or more electrons (!), it's actually approximations to quantum. That leads to two levels of opacity: quantum itself, and all the facts that were scraped off in the approximation process. At this point, the chice is binary: become fluent in quantum, or move on. There are a few nuggets to be had for the non-fluent, including some of the techniques for solving these horrendous integrals. Mostly, though, I moved on.<br />After the \\"ab initio\\" quantum mechanical methods, Lewars presents the semi-empirical models. These deal with simplified models of wave functions. Unlike ab initio methods, which stand on almost purely theoretical models, semi-empirical methods are informed by experimental data. They are based on the electron wave functions, as are the ab initio methods, but use approximations calibrated by experimental results. The book's final section presents density functional theory (DFT), another technique for estimating where the electrons will be.<br />This book demands a lot of the reader, more than I came in with or had time to develop. I was able to use it to get a working vocabulary of the major kinds of computations, the general categories of approach to modeling, and a rough idea of the techniques and complexities involved. I need a little more information than that, but not the immediate leap into the deep end presented here.<br />I look forward to a review by someone more knowledgeable. For now, my only real criticism of this book is lack of glossary. Initialisms and acronyms abound. It would have made the going a lot easier if the book had one place where I could refresh my memory on the dozens or hundreds of abbreviations.nto the deep end presented here. <br />I look forward to a review by someone more knowledgeable.

He even arranges some interesting (and quite businesslike) travel. He also has some suggestions regarding her would-be boyfriend. As it turns out, the suggestions aren't needed. Something larger than Conti is also involving itself with Sara, and is quite the opposite of the ominous, evil force that Sara might have feared.<br />This story may be Bantock's finest. It includes all of the themes that seem to fascinate Bantock: the alternatives to life and death, exchange between the human and the supernatural, and the growth of intimacy as a force in itself. Also, the story is wholly contained in one volume. I like that: I can see how the plot plays out without waiting  a year or two for the next chapter. Some people might feel that closure impairs the sense of mystery. That's a matter of personal taste, though, so I can neither agree nor disagree.<br />Sad to say, the &quot;Wife&quot; includes less of Bantock's incredible artwork than any other book I've seen. His layered, complex story almost makes up for lack of his layered, complex art, but not quite.<br />Bantock fans: this a must-have. Bantock newcomers: you'll find more of his signature art in any of the other books published to date.	2004-05-11

Hsun Tzu followed Mencius, Confucius, and the other better-known names of Chinese philosphical history. He represents an interesting departure from them, though.<br />He holds the same high regard for order, hierarchy, and ritual as the earlier Confucians. He combines it with some of the thinking from other schools, though. He flirts with Han Fei Tzu's Legalist pessimism about human nature. Hsun Tzu, however, asserts that proper behavior can be learned and taught. Deep understanding would be best, but even rote performance of one's proper roles and rituals are enough to save people from their innate flaws. He also takes on some of Chuang Tzu's mysticism. Hsun Tzu's &quot;sage&quot; seems almost to spread his upright influence just by standing among the lesser people, with a magical lack of causal relationship.<br />It's clear that Hsun Tzu wrote as one among many different schools of thought. He spends a good bit of time explaining the errors of the competing philosophers, making it clear that his own thinking needed justification in that environment. He does, however, add a few notes of his own. For example, section 9 describes a king's duties. The king, through his deputies, is expected to regulate fishing, forestry, and other use of renewable resources. This is not meant to deprive anyone or to enrich the king artificially, but to keep the resources productive for the long term. How I wish that today's leaders would learn from the knowledge of 300BC.<br />Hsun Tzu was not among the first rank of influential thinkers, but well up in the second rank. If you are building a library of Eastern classics, this certainly has a place on your shelf.	2004-05-10

Well, they're supposed to be clean and they're supposed to be fun, right?<br />These are basically feel-good stories, and they work. I mean &quot;feel-good&quot; in the emotional sense. Despite a few harsh scenes, all who deserve it (and some who don't) live happily ever after. The entertainers and the clientele certainly feel each other well, too. That, however, is all hidden tastefully off stage or under euphemism. I wouldn't have any qualms about any kid I know reading the book.<br />You may find this book filed with science fiction. That's probably because of the writer's other work and not because of these stories' content. The SF-ish parts appear only briefly, once to get a story started and once to get a story ended. If you're not a SF fan, there's still plenty here for you.<br />It's light, fluffy, and fun. When you're done with deep meanings and grand literature for the day, give this one a try.	2004-05-07

Systematics is the art, the science, and the ongoing debate of assigning organisms to phylogenetic groups. If you're from bioinformatics, you may think, \\"Oh. Tree-building.\\" This book is much more fundmental: it talks about the biological data and philosophical approach needed for any kind of organization. This book informs the beliefs behind your choice of algorithms and data to involve.<br /><br />Modern bioinformaticists usually assume that tree-building moves forward from DNA or protein strings. That blinds us to the 200 years of classification based on physical features, behavior, and even geographic distribution. In that time, huge numbers of debates have sprung up, too many to list here. A few caught my interest though. First, suppose that \\"all pterogyte insects have wings\\". The fight starts when an apparent pterogyte shows up with no wings. Personally, I don't see the problem. If having wings is a defining feature, then it's a non-pterogyte, mutations excepted. If having wings is a pattern we noticed but not part of the definition, then the pattern needs work. I'm not a taxonomist, though.<br /><br />Another debate (p.53) is whether to accept parsimony, the principle of least mechanism, as a taxonomic tool. The objectors claim that it's suspect because of the assumptions behind it, whether or not anyone has \\"... stat[ed] precisely what the assumptions are.\\" Well, someone may come up with an assumption some day, so we may as well get our objections in early.<br /><br />This book is distinctly non-mathematical. I don't know all that much, but I do know to ask what background probability model is used to decide whether a similarity or difference matters. That was never mentioned explicitly, but was silently buried in half-page descriptions of jack-knifing and boot-strapping.<br /><br />It's non-mathematical content is very valuable, though. Its glossary gives clear descriptions of subtly different terms. The chapter on nomenclature, the formal process of naming, was a real discovery for me. I had no idea that the rules were so elaborate.<br /><br />Perhaps it's the nature of the field, but I was surprised at how few recent references appeared at the end of most chapters. I appreciate the classic papers, back to the 1900s. The 1970s were well represented. References from the 1990s, however, were startling when they did appear, since there were so very few of them. Considering the book's 2000 copyright date, the source material seemed older than I would have expected.<br /><br />This won't give you any insight into algorithms or mathematical techniques, which disappointed me initially.

The drawn narrative is a varied as the stories. Some pictures, like the whole-page birth scene, are entire stories in themselves. Not many people can put as much into black and white a Vess, as this book demonstrates.<br />I wish I could give this book five stars, but this isn't the greatest presentation of his work. His best work has a very delicate line. Maybe it was just the printing process, but this book came through in a coarser style. His black and white work is outstanding, but I like his color work too - this book was not able to show any of Vess' skill as a colorist.<br />These short stories fit nicely with Vess' renderings of operas and other long pieces. I recommend this book to anyone who already like his art. If you're a newcomer, though, other books give a better idea of why his work is so special.	2004-05-06

It starts with a lengthy discussion of polymorphism and inheritance, presumably addressing a reader to whom those would be unfamiliar. Even in 1994, when this first came out, object orientation had wide acceptance. There may have been some readers back then who needed the introduction, along with the OO-savvy readers. The OO-positive readers didn't need the introduction, but the OO beginners would have had a very hard time with the more advanced discussions that follow.<br />Pree's whole concept of metapatterns seems to have been dropped from the literature. It's not that the ideas were bad, or even obscure. Quite the opposite, they were so pervasive that they mostly seem to represent language primitives. For example, creating a variable of type X and letting it reference an object of some X subtype is incredibly basic. Yes, it needs to be handled in introductory programming courses, and subtle cases can cause real confusion. On the whole, though, it's about like calling a &quot;for&quot; loop a meta-pattern.<br />Still, some of the OO advice was sound, and still worthwhile today. For example, the &quot;principle of testability&quot; says that a module should be testable independently, without regard to its environment. The whole discussion of frameworks is interesting, but more recent writing is more informative.<br />The book does discuss design patterns, as we generally use the term now. The DP literature has matured, though, and settled into a fairly predictable way of describing patterns. This book predates those descriptive conventions, so comes across as scattered or hard to read.<br />I can't fault a book for being written at some particular time. Back in the 90s, I would probably have four stars, maybe more. Literature and common practice have moved on, though. This book's ideas have been developed, extended, and cast in modern terms by more recent writers. Other writings now present the same material, more clearly, and in more current terms.<br />This book gives an interesting look at the debates and developments that were current back when it was written, but is no longer on, or even near, the wave of current practice.erial, more clearly, and in more current terms. <br />This book gives an interesting look at the debates and developments that were current back when it was written, but is no longer on, or even near, the wave of current practice.	2004-05-04

This is work ca. 1990, with some copyrighted earlier, and it's not even his &quot;early&quot; work.<br />It is, however, the best demonstration I know of Vess' versatility as a comic artist. Most of the brief stories are black and white pen drawings, the style for which I know him best. Other pieces are tonal, with much less emphasis on line. Yet other pieces show Vess as a colorist and a good one. His recent opera work tends toward pastel colors, but the &quot;Fire's Kin&quot; story is full of varied and saturated hues. Very few other comic artists seem able to sustain such high quality imagery in so many different ways.<br />Vess has been doing great work for so long that a lot of it is out of print now. It's a pity because, as these stories show, he's being doing skilled, distinctive work for decades. If you like Vess' art and stories and you ever find a copy of &quot;Book of Night&quot; at a reasonable price, considering buying it. If nothing else, you may be surprised at the longevity of this outstanding comic artist.	2004-05-04

As the name says, it's about purgatory, but not Dante's. This is a place where people have work to do, and our protagonist works as a museum keeper. That sets the scene for a series of peculiar vignettes, the kind that make just a little too much sense.<br />Also like G&amp;S, there's a distinctly autobiographical sense about the story. The last section is explicitly a fictional autobiography. Somehow, though, the stories have a grounded feeling that doesn't let me believe they are pure fantasy.<br />As much as I like the G&amp;S imagery, I like this better. Bantock has moved his improbable talent for assemblage and collage into 3D. He has created several series of fictional artifacts, are as complex and multifacted as his works on paper. These images, so many being photos, have a clarity that G&amp;S sometimes lost.<br />This is a brief but very enjoyable book, and one worth re-reading. The pictures just get better with each reading, and the stories seem to stay fresh.	2004-05-03

Determining what they are, and what genes, proteins, and post-translational modifications interact is a major and exciting field of study.<br />I just didn't come away from this book with that excitement. I was hoping for more about the large-scale regulation networks, but these papers go down to the quantum mechanics of interactions between pairs of molecules. I appreciate that the exact interactions matter, and that computation is probably the only way to examine some kinds of interactions (e.g. the ones in lethal mutations). It's just not what I think of as a &quot;network.&quot;<br />I was also hoping for some more specifics about the computation techniques. There were some interesting insights here. For example, I never thought about the similarities between steady state chemical equilibrium and steady state Markov model behavior before, but the formalisms have striking similarities. I was also interested in some of the information-based measures for determining how well a model represents a system. I learned that the statistical assumptions behind normal chemical &quot;equilibrium&quot; break down at the scale of bacteria - instead, presence or absence of individual molecules matters more. Still, those were isolated kinds of facts and never came together into a whole for me.<br />The range of views was worthwhile. On the whole, though, the models all seemed very low-level to me, probably not well suited to handling more than a few dozen interactions, and the computation specifics were not always explicit. I'm still looking for a book with more information that I can apply directly.	2004-05-03

In either case, this book might be one of the best around.<br />The first half of the book is background: a little probability, a little bit about sampling and experimental design, a little about the most basic and common statistics (means, quartiles, etc).<br />The second half of the book offers a number of basic parametric and non-parametric significance tests. Langley describes each one, when it is applicable, and how to perform the calculations. He doesn't stray far into the slick computing tricks of the pre-calculator days, so the structure of each calculation stays reasonably clear.<br />The only real weakness in this book is its lack of index. That is especially incovenient because the tables, a staple of most stats books, are interleaved with the text. The table of contents is descriptive, but doesn't replace an index. The other problem, and not really a flaw in the book, is that it's easy to outgrow this text. Even moderately heavy stats users need a bit more theory and background, to allow meaningful adaptation to new conditions. The author has chosen an audience, though, and has addressed that audience and its needs very well. If your skills are beyond those of the intended reader, that's not a fault of the book.<br />Basic, clear, and reasonably broad - it's everything that an ordinary, casual stat user could want.	2004-05-01

Like the subjects, though, the beauty has a scary side to it.<br />There's a lot more to say. The pictures are intense, and more intense as a collection. I'm sure everyone who sees it will have more to say, and everyone will say something different. For that matter, I could discuss this in three or four contradictory ways. This time, I prefer to let the pictures speak for themselves and to let the readers form opinions of their own.	2004-04-30

They're presented in a readable, useful, and well-organized way. Often they just clarify and put a name to something you've probably been doing anyway. The standard Dependency Inversion Principle is there, for one. (I'm glad to see that other people have trouble with the name. By today's reckoning, there's nothing inverted about it, but the name dates back to less enlightened times.) Others, like the Interface Segregation Principle, are less well known but reinforce lots of other good practices, such as data hiding and prevention of &quot;interface leakage&quot;.<br />The &quot;Agile&quot; section is blessedly short, and doesn't much contaminate the otherwise good presentation elsewhere in the book. There's a lot of good to be extracted from the agility movement, but there's a lot of rabid dogmatism too. Martin managed to keep it well under control. He presented the Manifesto (ugh) early on, but that was the worst of it.<br />A few points marred the book, but only slightly, The drawings came across as &quot;cute&quot; - unprofessional and tangential to the topics at hand. Semi-fictional conversations in books like this always seem fatuous to me, and Ch.6 was no exception. The technical content managed to withstand this presentation anyway.<br />This book has lots of good ideas. It relates those ideas well to common and useful design patterns. A few aspects of the book tried to be funny, but came across as more annoying than anything else. That was only a few, though - the meaningful content of the book came through despite those flaws.<br />I recommend this book to any serious student or practitioner of OO design and implementation. I really mean &quot;any,&quot; since even project-scarred veterans are likely to see some of their hard won knowledge set into clear text and into the context of other ideas.	2004-04-29

It starts with a review of basic algebra - linear equations, graphs, and just what all the symbols mean. It works its way up through various kinds of graphs, sampling and correlation, with lots of examples and very clear writing.<br />Personally, I would have put the probability chapters earlier. My feeling is that stats derives from probability, it's not an add-on to examine after learning stats. This author clearly knows what he's doing, though, so I won't push the point. My math background puts me outside of his target audience. I have a friend struggling through the book, and she is very happy with the level and presentation. She's the kind of reader for whom the book is meant, and it seems to work for her.<br />If your math skills need resuscitation more than review, this book could well meet your needs. It's easy to read, business-like, and doesn't talk down to the reader. Work all the way through it, and you should have good basic skills at handling numbers, and at sniffing out the BS behind numbers thrown at you.	2004-04-28

It's a definite skill, a definite thought process, and very hard to convey. I do it by setting people specific problems to solve with specific patterns and hoping they develop the mapping for themselves. That usually works, sooner or later.<br />The first half of this book is like sitting behind Vlissides while he works at the keyboard, and listening to him talk to himself. It's very informal and conversational. I don't know how well it generalizes to other patterns in other contexts. For some people, though, a concrete example like this seems very helpful.<br />The second half of the book didn't give me much useful information. It continues the informal, conversational style. This part, however, involves several developers in the process of identifying, characterizing, and sometimes disqualifying candidates for design-pattern-hood. As much as I respect the people in the conversation, that section has a Disney-like fictional quality that I don't like. The old conversations have been reconstructed and morphed into some cleaned-up and picked-over form that reads well. Mostly, they just don't say anything that I can really use.<br />Seeing an example worked may help some people. On the whole, though, this book has less information per inch of shelf space than many others. Populate your bookshelf accordingly.	2004-04-28

In fact, it would be fair to call this 'Re-Design Patterns'.<br />It follows closely in the DP community's habit. For each way of improving a program, it systematically presents a name, set of conditions when it does or does not apply, and (unlike most DP books) clear, demonstrative examples and variations. As with design patterns, many of these recommendations have a sense about them of &quot;I already knew that.&quot; That's a good thing - it means you bring familiarity to the reading, instead of starting cold. That lets Fowler get on with his real business, which is to systematize the knowledge and regularize the process of choosing a technique to use.<br />I hope this follows another habit of the DP community, too: the public cataloging, collecting, and sharing of new techniques for refactoring. I could add bunches to the list, as I'm sure any other seasoned programmer could. One thing is distinctive about the refactorings: the number that come in matched, opposite pairs. This just emphasizes the context dependency of refactoring - each technique has its place, but is not appropriate in all places. Also, paired opposites effectively double the number of choices a practitioner has.<br />Design patterns are very helpful, almost like power tools for programmers. Face it, though: initial design and implementation are only 1-10% of a large program's life. Maintenance, extension, and re-design are the other 90-99%. DP techniques get a program started, refactorings keep it going.<br />If you started programming before most of your co-workers were born, you may not get the most out of this book. Get it anyway, and make sure the young pups read it. This knowledge needs to be spread.	2004-04-27

The full analytic technique should include<br />-- patterns (what works well)<br />-- antipatterns (what fails miserably, sooner or later), and<br />-- refactoring or reengineering (connecting the two).<br />So far, that trio hasn't been put together in a systematic way. This book is a fair first stab at the list of common offenders, though. It has an exploratory style - it distinguishes major and minor (mini) problems, while trying out different ways of expressing evils of different scales. It proposes a systematic way to diagnose each problem, identify causes, and overcome the problem that left the mess in the first place. This is all good, even if Brown et al. haven't left the study in its final form.<br />This book may have lasting value, if only because it's the first to use the &quot;patterns&quot; methodology in studying what not to do. It's good for beginners who haven't seen the messes first-hand, and good for experienced developers who want to systematize their scars and war stories.	2004-04-26

Other authors need more than raw UML gives, so start adding cruft any way they want - wrong! UML was meant to be extended and has explicit points at which extension is allowed. This shows extension as it's meant to be done.<br />Second, it is a worthwhile application area. Frameworks have been around for years, important all out of proportion to the relativley small number of them and relatively small number of framework developers. Framework development deserves attention as a specific discipline, and it's good to see this kind of attention being paid. The authors have chosen parts of well known design patterns for examples, keeping the ideas readable and understandable.<br />Best, it doesn't try to pull the entire UML standard into the discussion. To tell the truth, if I printed out the whole set of UML standards documents, I'm not sure I'd be able to lift the pile. This uses a well-chosen subset of the standard, but still lets the afficionado use as much more of the standard as desired.<br />Still, it's just notation. It's a set of tags for making statements about frameworks. The book doesn't really go into the design of frameworks. Framework design appears to be a premise, something the reader already understands well - perhaps not a good assumption.<br />The real problem with this notation, though, is that it is barely useable without tool support. It's based on sets of tags, which refine other tags (using something like inheritance), which refine yet other tags. Looking at tag A, though, there is no way to know that it refines tag B. Nothing about the tag indicates its family tree of inheritance, or even where to look for the information. Also, the UML extension mechanism for tags appears not to have dealt with global uniqueness at all. Nothing prevents me and you from coming up with the same tag names independently, then causing collisions for our common customer. XML deals with global uniqueness fairly well. If XML conventions are compatible with UML, they should be used - if not, UML needs to create conventions.<br />On the whole, this is interesting and informative. It's nearly impossible to put to practical use without significant automation, however, and that automation is not available to me.eals with global uniqueness fairly well.

This is not about frameworks, it is about the team process involved in constructing a framework - a specialized topic, at best. This may not be the best, though. Let me use a few anti-patterns to say why:<br />Neologism: There are lots of terms in common use that already describe lots of common experiences. Creating slick new buzzwords for the same old thing causes more confusion than it's worth. Calling section 6.3 \\"Mini-frameworks\\" or 4.2 \\"The Kitchen Sink\\" would have been a lot more descriptive and idiomatic. Crumbling cookies and someone else's distant relatives aren't nearly as communicative.<br />Cliche: Take, for example, \\"There is no 'I' in 'Team'\\". Bad enough that it's a cliche, worse that it's a bad cliche. Such writers should be buried alive under piles of motivational posters, then drowned in tepid convention center coffee.<br />Wandering stream of conciousness: A number of times, especially \\"Iterate, Iterate, Iterate\\" and \\"The Great Communicator\\", I kept flipping back to the start of section to remind myself what the topic was supposed to be about. Going that far afield in just three pages is a major accomplishment, but not one I appreciate.<br />Inside-out jokes: Insider jokes are just fine, as long as you're an insider. They just don't work outside the original context. The \\"inside-out joke\\" is what you get when the insider joke is exposed to the outside world, and the insiders spend the next few years explaining why it's funny. \\"Tor's Second Cousin\\" falls well into this category.<br />Despite the authors' best efforts, it's not all bad. About 1/4 of the advice is specific to framework development. The rest is applicable to just about any kind of project, and they really are good ideas. On the whole, though, other books describe frameworks better and describe process better.	2004-04-25

This is my first exposure to Zane, but certianly not my last. It's fun to read, it's well written, and it's the kind of eroticism that both involved are supposed to enjoy - my kind.<br />It's also my first exposure to recent Black American writing. I like even more that it's literate and fun to read. Too much of the popular media time shows off the punk/gangster mess. There isn't nearly enough attention paid to the educated, successful, and pleasant African Americans - the large majority, to judge by the company I keep.<br />I know at least a few people that avoid erotica, based on second-hand opinions of bad writing. This book, if you can coax them to read it, might show them that physical affection, good sex, and enjoyable writing can all be found in one place at one time: here. This book deflates lots of bad stereotypes all at once, and I like having my point of view widened like that.<br />Enjoy!	2004-04-22

This volume is about the Sandman myth, of course, but connects to other myths from the Arabian, Greek, and Old Testament worlds.<br />The art is varied and enjoyable - P. Craig Russell is reliable as an artist and a visual storyteller. The other artwork complements and contrasts with his delicate style. Some is stark, almost geometric; use of color ranges from subtle to shattering.<br />It's good, varied material. I like the stories, I like the art, and that's enough for me. I'm relatively new to the Sandman, but I'll keep coming back for more.	2004-04-22

This should be the first book you buy.<br /><br />It gives a detailed look at the specific marks that characterize each technique for printmaking. It shows, in microscopic detail, the traces of the printmaker's tools. It also readies the reader for the idea that printmakers can and often do use multiple different techniques in preparing a plate.<br /><br />I just wish there were slightly more of this outstanding material. The printing is black and white, because of the economics of book printing when this first came out. That does real disservice to the various color processes. The verbal description of color is good, but doesn't stand by itself. Its discussion of lithography could go into more detail about the marks from the stone itself, ditto side-grain vs. end-grain blocks for woodcut and wood engraving. It gives very good examples of some drypoint marks, but doesn't describe the sign that I consider most diagnostic. That's the asymmetric line, hard on one side and soft on the other, caused by the asymmetric drypoint burr. In other words, I just wish there were more of the book's outstanding content.<br /><br />This isn't about process, much, just about the result of each process. That's fine. Once a novice print-lover learns which marks are the most personally intriguing, I assume [s]he'll find more from other sources. This is just an introduction, and a lovely one.<br /><br />(...)	2004-04-21

Type foundries create and sell fonts as a matter of business. Trades like printing and advertising have historically publicized type by using it, and driven the creation of new fonts. Typography is also distinctive in that, for such small field, it has so many large personalities.<br />Stanley Morison is one of those personalities, and one of the people who made 20th century typography what it was. He had a unique insight into the type trade of the first half of that century, as well as a wealth of history about several other centuries of type design and designers.<br />The most strinking feature of this book is the way each chapter about some important typeface is set in that face. Seeing and reading a whole page of body text, set and spaced in the usual way, is fundamentally different from seeing menu of &quot;quick brown foxes&quot; or pages of nonsense words. Reading the type is different from looking at letterforms, so this gives real information that specimen books can never provide. (As a personal matter, I realized just how much I dislike the italics with slope angles different in the capitals than in the lower case.)<br />Don't pick this up as a text on typography; beginners won't get much they can use. If you already appreciate that subtle art, if you want to learn more about its history and practice, this is a very enjoyable way to learn.	2004-04-21

This one is, at best, informative. Even then, it's not the best translation of Sun Tzu that I've seen.<br />Every comic has a visual style, and I don't need to like it to respect it. It just has to show craftsmanship and aptness to the text. This fell down seriously on craftsmanship, partly by replicating panels or parts of panels (e.g. pp 13/27 and 77/83). Duplication is fine when there's good artistic reason for it, but this just looked like laziness.<br />The English was generally good, but had a few rocky moments. For example &quot;Good maneouvres is like water ...&quot; - someone should remind the translator that agreement between nouns and verbs are important.<br />Still, the Sun Tzu text is strong enough to overcome even this rendering. One phrase had real meaning today: &quot;Attack only to win. Don't move in if there is nothing to gain.&quot; I'm writing this during the reign of Pres. Bush the Second, while his Iraqi war is still festering. How I wish that Bush knew today what was common knowledge somewhere around 300BC.<br />This book has value only for keeping Sun Tzu alive in the Post-Literate society. If the reader doesn't require picture books, though, I'd suggest a different translation.	2004-04-18

It is about one thing only, and about forging oneself into the tool that can do that one thing.<br />The writing is earthy and practical. However blunt and direct it may seem, I get the impression that the translator softened its style. The second translation in this book, from about the same time, is more literary, more refined, and alludes to a much wider range of the educated person's reading. Next to Musashi, and embodying so much of what he disdained, it simply looks foppish.<br />I do technical work. Much of the process of design and debug has the feel of facing intelligent, determined opposition. For that reason, large parts of Musashi's advice seem true and fresh. He advises that a warrior to become master of all tools, not some just some favorite - today, he would call that the &quot;golden hammer.&quot; In 'Letting Go Four Hands,' he advises a prompt change of attack when the first assault deadlocks. In 'Mountain and Sea Changing,' he advises against repeating an approach that has already failed against a given opponent. All those are things that work as well in the lab as on the battlefield.<br />The Five Rings should be in the library of any professional, artist, or technical worker. Cleary's translation is modern and readable. I would give it five stars, except that so many classics from China and Japan discuss not only tactics but strategy as well. It's not about any flaw in this book, but about the excellence of the other books that this one complements.	2004-04-17

Volume 1: Manhunter Project	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Not the usual	The art is at least half the reason I buy comics, and the art is what hooked me in this collection. Every panel is monochrome, black and white with a second color. That color sets the tone and seems to identify the point of view: tans appear center on Our Heroine, blues usually shift the focus elsewhere. The black and white illustrations have a raw, realistic style that works. Page layouts have a patterned black background that sets off the panels well, and good printing makes the blacks dense and rich.<br />The story is exciting and good for a long run: super-spy babe on the run from the evil organization and her one-time partners. OK, it's been done and redone. Every new version has its own variant, and the twist to this story makes it worth reading (no, I won't tell). The story isn't wildly original, and the color schemes didn't originate here either - remember Ms. Tree? As long as the story and art are strong and work together, I'm not going to worry too much.<br />There were only two things I disliked about this book. One was the typography. The captioning was a bit of novelty that just didn't work. With so much else so well done, that was a disappointment. The other was that the book literally fell apart in my hands. Grr.<br />Five stars for the artwork, four for the story, less for the text, and zero for the binding.	2004-04-16

I can not recommend this book.<br />I find it confused and confusing, with no clear line between Larman's own diagrams and actual UML notation. Starting on page xvii (before the text even starts), this book mixes the UML comment notation with Larman's own boxes-and-arrows. Similar mixes appear on p.7 and many other places. By p.22 Larman has already confused comment and use-case notation. Diagrams like 17.4 use multiple different arrows to say apparently the same thing - or maybe not, it's not for the reader to know. A number of UML diagrams suffer similarly from creativity. It's never quite clear what marks are defined by the standard and which ones by Larman's over-active imagination.<br />It would have been so simple to fix that confusion, too. Even something like tinting the official UML and leaving his own markup in black and white would have shown which was which.<br />He uses common terms in baffling ways. I've been developing software for many years, and I thought I knew what development was. It's what a software developer does - it's all the work needed to start from nothing, then deploy and support the product. I was quite surprised to learn that planning and analysis are not part of the development cycle, but the start of Ch. 8 assures me that they are distinct. Larman asserts that development is architecture-centric, but makes this assertion when almost 90% of the how-to section has gone by. If archtiecture is so basic to all other design, then it really should have been there at the beginning. I've seen attempts to declare an architecture at the end of the project, and they are comical (as long as I'm nowhere near that project). I was also baffed to see &quot;contracts&quot; so deeply embedded in the UML methodology proposed. Contracts are good, I agree, but they don't become part of UML simply by wishing they were. This is the kind of presentation that will leave a UML novice (the book's intended reader) thoroughly misinformed.<br />Most other authors distinguish between design principles and design patterns, a line that Larman fails to draw. Principles give an idea of how to divide responsibilities, irrespective of what those responsibilities are. The Law of Demeter, cohesion, and the idea of polymorphism are design principles. Patterns state specific responsibilities and assign them to specific (if abstract) classes. Publish/subscribe (aka Observer) is a pattern. It states which object type originates data and which receives it. It states how the receiver makes itself known to the originator. Patterns apply to specific relationships or behaviors, principles apply to any relationship or pattern. Losing the distinction is a real loss of descriptive power, and a disservice to both principles and patterns.<br />The flaws go on, but this book has already taken up enough of my life. I strongly suggest that the reader look at any of the many other books on UML or on patterns. Even picking at random, you're likely to get a better reference.distinguish between design principles and design patterns, a line that Larman fails to draw.

Swiss school.&quot; Some of the diatribes from the early Swiss school proponents came across as 'full of sound and fury, but signifying nothing,' so that left me leery.<br />Hochuli has moved past the dogmatic phase, though, and into something better-reasoned. The paper is a warm, humanist tan (where I expected a stark white), the body copy is a serif font, and Hochuli lets esthetic judgement moderate geometric purism. It may seem surprising that setting up a scientific text jolted him out of the &quot;scientific&quot; Bauhaus mindset. After thinking about it for a moment, perhaps only a science text could have done the job. More than any other genre, science books tend to mix illustrations and photos, graphs, charts, equations and in-line math, footnotes, references and cross-references, and all the other factors that complicate typography. Even more, because the science content of the book can be so complex, it calls out for typographic help in organizing the material for visual presentation.<br />The book is a lovely object. The wide margins give the text a statuesque look. References on each page are set off clearly and legibly. Unfortunately, the text is quite short - only about half the length of the book, and half of that is illustrations. The second half of the book is a brief catalog of Hochuli's work. The material is worthwhile, but it seemed like filler, meant to bring the book up to some mandated minimum length. I also found it a bit too large to read one-handed, the way I do with most papaerbacks. Hochuli seems to have broken his own rule about the size of a book, the way it is read, and the way it is held for reading.<br />The only place I seriously disagreed with Hochuli's advice had to do with bibliographies. I don't think the italic needs a different 'color', as long as the slant and dynamics of line weight are clear. I think he missed out completely on mixing European and Asian names. Western tradition uses &quot;first-name last-name&quot; order for personal name and family name. Many Asians and some Africans put the family name first and personal name last (as if saying &quot;Jones Chris&quot; instead of &quot;Chris Jones&quot;). Typographic convention can preserve proper order and still distinguish family from personal names.<br />Nothing is perfect, but this book is a pleasant and informative discussion of typography in the large - the steps above letterforms and paragraph structure.

This book describes how Tharp, and the intent reader, can amplify their creative energies and direct them into creative output. It is so effective that, just a few pages in, I had to put the book down to go back to some writing that had languished.<br /><br />When I got back to the book, I enjoyed it immensely. If anyone thought for a moment that creativity is some little light that flips on when it will, they are seriously mistaken. Occasional, random flashes do not support a livelihood. The good news is that, whatever your field, creativity can be cultivated. Someone working hard enough and working the right way really can generate what is needed, on a reliable basis.<br /><br />The process she describes is grueling. It involves massive amounts of training and effort, every day, for years at a stretch. Like it or not, that's the way it has to be. Scientific creativity requires identical dedication and single-mindedness, as described by Santiago Ramon y Cajal in his [[ASIN:0262681501 Advice for a Young Investigator]]. The good news is that the training works. The process is the same for a mathematician as for a painter or dancer. It is certain and effective. This doesn't mean that every painter will become a Picasso or that every dancer can be a Tharp. It does mean that a sufficiently dedicated worker can generate new ideas, good ones, predictably.<br /><br />Maybe, at this point, you can imagine some whiner mewling \\"I'm dedicated, but that's way too much work and it's boring.\\" Such people have no idea what dedication means. Don't argue with them. It won't do them any good, and it will waste time you could have used productively.<br /><br />I admit that I never learned to appreciate dance, let alone Tharp's oeuvre. I still respect her as an artist and innovator, even though I do not understand her art. This book was very well written - surprisingly well, since dancers I've known tend not to be verbally oriented. I enjoyed the way she opened her thoughts to the reader. It even felt voyeuristic at times, when she shared few words of her private vocabulary. I recommend this to anyone who creates new ideas of their own, or who wants an insider's word on the act of creation.<br /><br />--wiredweirden felt voyeuristic at times, when she shared few words of her private vocabulary.

Other books at this level are condescending arrays of garish color, blaring typography, and irrelevant pictures. They assume that the students biggest concerns are dinosaurs and cheerleading.<br />Instead, COMAP treats the reader with respect. (Yes, teenagers deserve it.) The book is laid out clearly, with a minimum of distractions. The topics include the best place to locate a firehouse, and many different meanings for the word &quot;best.&quot; Its discussion of game theory uses the Cuban Missile Crisis as an example. It describes problems directly related to Internet routing and optimal connectivity. It does lots more, too, with only a very introductory amount of algebra.<br />This book does at least three things very well. First, it teaches the student many different tools for solving any problem. Second, it shows the students many problems suited to each of the tools. Third, it encourages the student to think in a constructively critical and self-critical way: Is this answer really the right one? What does the equation actually mean? What parts of this problem just aren't suited to mathematical analysis? Can I solve this at all, given the information at hand?<br />Every student comes out of this program with solid skills. Even the ones who aren't math whizzes must master the basics to pass this course, unlike other math books that just encourage them to write down how the feel about math. The best students are given a gentle but solid shove forward. You have to look for them carefully, but one or two problems in each section require serious creativity and insight. Any student who cracks one of those gets a real sense of accomplishment. I'm not talking about feel-good arithmetic where the warm fuzzies are compulsory, I mean a sense of having pushed personal limits and become stronger in the process.<br />The book does not name a particular grade for which it is intended, but basic algebra would probably come one or two years after this. In the mean time, it gives students a wide variety of different tools and a sense that they're solving problems that matter. I've looked at only one other textbook at this level, and it was terrible.

Concepts and models, yes; methods, a few; algorithms, nearly none that you could actually code.<br />This book's strength is its breadth. It offers brief tastes of many topics. It discusses early data preparation, including reduction of dimension and handling of outliers and missing values. It emphasizes that different kinds of questions must be addressed in different ways. The rest of the book then covers decision rules of different sorts, clustering, neural networks, genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic, and data visualization. Each chapter includes references and comments on what to expect from each reference - a nice touch. The end of the book names a wide variety of web sites, products, and companies dedicated to data mining.<br />The big problem, however, is that the book is shallow. With a few exceptions, it just names techniques instead of giving descriptions that a programmer can use. For example, the discussion of missing data barely mentions the idea that imputed (made-up) values must be tailored to the specific analysis technique, so as to minimize their effect on results. There are exceptions, of course. Neural nets get a relatively detailed treatment. The author gives illustrative examples of genetic algorithms, but those were thin and tangential to data mining. The section on data visualization could have been much more lively. There is a huge body of visual technique, some bordering on artistry, that can present high-dimensional data to the human pattern-detection faculty, and samples are readily available. This book's examples were small and drab, though. Also, it completely ignored the research in auditory and tactile data representation, and omitted discussion of graphic design principles required for effective presentation.<br />What really bothered me were examples of sheer carelessness. A number of figures, including 4.8 and 9.9, contain errors severe enough to interfere with the point being made. Important relationships are simply illegible. Books like this aren't cheap - I would have hoped that the author would show a little more respect for the people paying the money.<br />This book may have value as a survey resource, but isn't for the reader who wants to implement the algorithms.

The second one (I'll come back to the first) introduces a new Promethea. That plays by the rules - there have been lots of them and will be lots more. This plane of reality just has one at a time, though. The new one embodies &quot;punk&quot;, in attitude and style.<br />Promethea is a semi-mythic ideal of womanhood - certainly too rich and complex a topic to embody in any one person. Various Prometheas carry various parts of that vision: motherly, raw and angry, innocent, and sensual, but always powerful and involved. Some parts of the complete image are unpleasant but needed for the image to be complete, and that's where Promethea/Stacy fits. She exorcises demons by being more demonic than them.<br />The book's other direction explains why the first Promethea was off duty. She is on a trip through the mythic planes, led by a succession of spirit guides. She acts as a passive display of each realm she traverse, and that seems a real under-use of a very worthwhile character. It's a verbal and philosophical trip, but Promethea is a character of action. Worlds of fantasy, sensuality, and judgement could have been settings for active exploraiton of each idea, but Promethea just talked about them while passing through. I consider that an opportunity lost.<br />Still, the series is readable, well-drawn, and full of ideas well beyond the usual comic. Despite some flaws, I intend to keep reading.	2004-04-04

It gives a unique look back to the late 18th, when Yamamoto was active as a samurai. The view is unique, in part, because Japan was unifying and there was less need for each minor lord to have an armed class. The warrior ethic was changing as war became less common. In part, these notes seem to mourn the passing of the clearest, purest form of that ethic.<br />The warrior ethic only changed, though and still underlies many aspects of modern Japanese thought and policy. The feudal caste system still gives a fair decription of different levels of management.<br />This book is not just about a time and a culture different from that in the modern West. It teaches personal responsibility, a lesson that many too many people still need. In part, this means responsibility to one's self, in maintaining professional skills and personal credibility. It also means responsibility towards one's employer. I do not feel crass in saying that, by accepting the pay that feeds and houses me, I have a duty to return the value given. Self interest, if not personal honor, should encourage me to support my employer well enough to keep supporting me and to support me better in the future.<br />I was also interested to see that a strict code of honor can include a strictly preserved set of personal freedoms. Yamamoto stresses the need to tolerate a few flaws in order to use a person's strengths. He also notes that samurai - or, I think, any professionals - can be effective only when free to make decisions on their own. This is not insubordination, quite the opposite. The skilled employee must be able to make decisions based on that skill. Too tight a managerial rein just strangles the professional's effectiveness.<br />I was surprised (but perhaps should not have been) that this book describes the modern professional so well. Yamamoto's advice is right in line with my own business experience. I think that more of today's skilled workers, and their managers, would be more effective if they applied this book in their lives.<br />It was also surprising, but satisfying, to read Yamamoto's most secret advice: to do what you love most. I certainly see why this maxim must be held back. This advice can only enrich a person who is already so trained that their loves are honorable, loyal, and productive. Keeping with Yamamoto's Zen spirit, though, I would say that such people do not need that inner secret. Today, as then, such people already follow what they love.at more of today's skilled workers, and their managers, would be more effective if they applied this book in their lives.<br />It was also surprising, but satisfying, to read Yamamoto's most secret advice: to do what you love most.

It combined the versatility of intaglio prints with the production capablity of letterpress, and made printed reproduction accessible and affordable. Back when copying meant hand-copying, it was quite remarkable (to use his example) to have fifty copies of a meeting's minutes an hour after the meeting. What amazes me is not just the fact of the copies, but the low cost that made it worthwhile to record even mundane meetings.<br />The most remarkable fact about lithography is that very nearly every technical aspect of the craft was developed or foretold by one mind, that of Alois Senefelder. Very few other branches of knowledge have been so completely laid out by their founders. Shannon's information theory and Einstein's general relativity occur to me, but not much else. This book is where Senefelder lays out the history, the materials, and the technique of early lithography.<br />History, his invention and commercialization of lithography, is the first of the book's three sections. Mostly, this is Alois' writings on the wonders of Alois. Anyone who's read Cellini's autobiography will see a similar ego.<br />The book's second section describes the making of lithography's tools and materials. I imagine that it was authoritative and practical in the 19th century. It was also aimed at the complete do-it-yourselfer, down to etching watch springs in acid to make nibs for pens. Today's reader will probably file his recipes next to mysterious alchemical concoctions. Senefelder assumed that the reader had ready access to sulfuric, nitric, hydrochloric, and phosphoric acids (but he does note that the latter can be prepared by burning your own phosphorus). In preparing different inks and crayons, he would have us combine hog's lard, tallow, soap, minium (lead), and vermillion (mercury). Other steps involve burning some material until its smoke turns yellow. Truly, that was the age before the EPA and OSHA. However it may look to a modern reader, it shows Senefelder's thoroughness and energy in trying every combination of techniques accessible to his rich imagination.<br />I found the book's final section to be the most interesting: the techniques of preparing the stone and pulling the prints. Much of this advice is still applicable, especially the many ways of marking the lithographic stone or plate. A few of the techniques, those that imitate intaglio processes, seem to have fallen out of fashion. Partly, the modern litho plates do not allow some of the freedoms of the softer limestone. Mostly, I think, litho developed around its unique features. The intaglio techniques may have been like training wheels, easing traditional printers in the new method, and lost when they were no longer needed. Still, it was worth seeing that Senefelder managed to emulate nearly every intaglio process in stone, except maybe for mezzotint.<br />This book is not for the modern printmaker, since materials are so different and since technique is taught in more accessible ways. This is, however, for anyone interested in the history of printmaking and willing to put up with its florid 19th century style.to a modern reader, it shows Senefelder's thoroughness and energy in trying every combination of techniques accessible to his rich imagination.<br />I found the book's final section to be the most interesting: the techniques of preparing the stone and pulling the prints.

I'm not a very romantic person, but I started to feel that longing for a thoughtful, simple life as I read these essays.<br />The four cover an 800-year period, starting in China then moving to Japan. The earliest writing, by Po Chu-I, may be my favorite. The first part is brief and business-like, a description of the hut, its environs, and the views from it. Although the writing is plain, I can't help imagine the drifting Chinese landscape paintings I've seen, with mists and peaks off to the edge of vision. This piece ends with two brief poems that express some of the writer's quiet passion. I was quite taken by the way the prose and poetry are used to express different parts of the author's experience.<br />The second writing in this book struck me, at first, as disingenuous. Again, the hut is simple but sturdy and well-made, and the environs capture many different aspects of natural beauty. The landscaping is completely man-made, though, and the property was acquired and developed at huge expense, near the capitol. My second impression was that yes, the scene has some Disney artificiality about it, but the urge that drove it was as real as any. Even at that time, the start of the Heian era or just before it, urban crowding was a reality, and urban gentrification was as much a factor as in any modern city. If \\"The Pond Pavilion\\" could not be an actual withdrawal from the world, it was a lovingly built homage to the ideal.<br />The third essay, the Ten Square Foot Hut, has appeared elsewhere, and is still worth reading. This focuses less on the hut itself than on the process of withdrawal and the life of the near-hermit. It is pervasively Buddhist, and does not promote complete isolation from the world. It does, however, offer an appealing look at an old man, usually alone but never lonely, doing what he has worked for many years to do.<br />The final essay may be the shortest. It is certainly the most recent, written some time in the 17th century AD. It is also a symmetric end to the collection - Basho's lttle essay reads much like the first.<br />This book is quite brief, and even shorter if one skips over the translator's noted. It seemed to be over much too soon. Still, the book's brevity and simplicity are modeled after the scenes it describes. It was hard to close the book and come back to the reality of the modern world.essay may be the shortest. It is certainly the most recent, written some time in the 17th century AD.

Java programmers have used it every day for a decade or so, but barely one in ten appear to know anything about it.<br />The content of ISO standard 10646 (successor to 8-bit ISO 646), goes way beyond just a charcter set. It contains information critical to the correctness of any program that steps outside the English-language world, i.e. every program on the Internet, and many others sooner or later. This is the basis for correct handling of numerals (there's a lot more than 0 to 9), letters, and text. It's also the explanation for some program behaviors that might otherwise baffle a programmer, or at least a programmer with the wit to be baffled.<br />More than just crucial, the content of this standard is plain fun. Its snippets of information from every major world language give wonderful insight into how people express themselves. It drives home the delighful diversity of human language and experience. It's also a near-bottomless source of stump-your-friends trivia.<br />I admit, I'll never use every fact in this incredible assembly.

That word seems so narrow; Waugh covers much more of solar time-telling than just dials. One thing that amazes me is his passion. He writes with clear pride about his own sundials, good to within (he says) ten seconds!<br />This book covers graphical or analytic techniques for laying out sundials on just about any surface that doesn't move, horizontal, vertical (facing any direction), slanted, or even the ceiling. He also discusses the movable kind, like a &quot;shepherd's dial&quot;. It has nothing inherently to do with sheep, but can be used anywhere, even without knowing true north.<br />The historian may be disappointed. This is not a catalogue of sundials through the ages, although bits of history are scattered throughout. In one sense, though, this is a view into the time of its writing (1973). A modern reader, with access to modern calculators and computers, will be amused if not puzzled by some of tricks used to make hand computation more feasible. I don't know anyone any more who multiplies by adding logs, and the circumlocutions around negative logarithms look positively quaint. The only real flaw in this book is its systematic omission of half the world: the southern hemispehere. It wouldn't have been so hard to add just a paragraph or two about sundials that work &quot;backwards&quot;.<br />Although this book celebrates the craft and art that can go into a sundial, its real value is technical. This book gives the essential methods for the functional side of a solar time-piece; bring your own artistry.	2004-03-29

For readers just interested in the how-to of the algorithms, not even that is needed. Koblitz does a thorough job of leading up to each algorithm and proving its formal properties. He also presents the algorithms themselves, unencumbered by denser material of interest to mathematicians.<br />The book covers a variety of topics - public-key encryption, primality testing, factoring, and cryptographic protocols. It introduces zero-knowledge proofs and blind transfer, techniques that offer real hope of personal privacy in a world where data transfer is mandatory. I was a little disappointed by the chapters on elliptic cryptography, however. I hoped that Koblitz would bring is explanatory powers to bear on the algorithms. Somehow, I never quite connected with his descriptions of elliptic curves - perhaps I'm just thick, or perhaps a bit more introductory material would have helped.<br />The rest of the book is a very fine example of clear, readable math writing. Its clarity its range of topics earn it a place with anyone interested in cryptography, factoring, and prime numbers.	2004-03-28

It goes well with William Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement, in its nostalgia for the 'humane' individual craftsman over the commerce and industry. Gill comes back, again and again, to question the proper places of mass production and handwork with respect to each other. He was an idealistic, but still realized that industry was here to stay - it could not (and still can not) simply be wished away. The real goal is \\"an industrialism ... [with] many noble and admirable features.\\"<br />Gill uses typography and printing as the vehicle for his social thoughts, and offers a good bit of advice on typography throughout. He discusses letter forms as ethetic, practical, and historical objects - especially interesting from a man who made so much typographic history himself.<br />I never did quite work my way through all of his social arguments, however. He seems to hold \\"engineers\\" as the opponents of art and perhaps creativity. I known that many engineers then and now lack training in esthetics and visual presentation. Anyone who's seen the Brooklyn Bridge or Eiffel Tower knows, however, that engineering is also a creative act. Gill ridiculed the practice of one worker designing a font, a second preparing it for transfer to metal, another cutting the master tools for each letter, and so on. I have to agree, the assembly line mentality is not suited to all tasks, especially when each product is as unique as a letter form. Still, among all arts, printing is perhaps the one most typified by team effort and division of labor. It would be a very rare individual who could create a text worth reading, create the font in which it is presented, set the type and run the press, and carry out all the other tasks needed to create a bound book. The question is not whether parts of a job should be handed to different specialists, but which jobs should be subdivided - a question I never saw answered.<br />This is a wonderful work by a man whose livelihood, art, and spiritual life all worked closely together.

It's written in a much less poetic style, but I find Zhuangzi more readable for that reason. The style is more conversational, and well rendered into contemporary English by Burton Watson.<br />These inner chapters contain only the core of a much longer work. Over the 2200 years since its writing, many accretions had crept into the work, including commentaries and addenda by other authors. Watson strips those away and leaves only the central and most vivid writings. Some of those may already be familiar to today's reader. For example, this book originates the man dreaming to be a butterfly dreaming to be a man. Zhuangzi offers many more of these anecdotes, too long to be analogies but too short for fables. He also calls on the history and mythology of his time - not always distinct from each other - and creates mythology of his own, whether he meant to or not.<br />That mythology lived on in Chinese alchemy, when Zhuangzi's magical sages were taken as literal beings. Zhuangzhi lived on, too, in Taoism's eventual alignment with Buddhism. His cryptic, non sequitur style of answer seems to foreshadow the koans of the distinctly Chinese and Japanese schools of Buddhism.<br />This is a wonderful complement to the Lao Tzu. If that book is the art of enlightenment, then this is more like the practical craft. I recommend it highly to any student of eastern classics.<br />I must add that Zhuangzi is a more recent romanization of \\"Chuang Tzu\\" - different renderings of one name. It is easy to become confused and think that the two were different writers. It is especially confusing since Watson published this same material many years ago under the \\"Chuang Tzu\\" spelling, and now as \\"Zhuangzi.\\" While I have the highest respect Burton's scholarship, I think that this difference-without-a-difference should be made more explicit.	2004-03-24
735993:US	35004134	R1N8VXSSB7XVXE	0231129696	662063736	Han Feizi: Basic Writings (Translations from the Asian Classics)	Books	5	17	20	N	N	A chilling classic	Han Fei's &quot;Legalist&quot; writings on government may be the most brutal and amoral in China's long written history. I can't even call it vicious - his grasping, avaricious view of human nature displays the same bizarre innocence as a snake crushing a rat.<br />The Legalist school built itself around laws or duties that defined every part of life. Enforcement was rigid, both in punishment and in reward. This, oddly, was where the Legalists diverged from the duty-bound Confucians. Han Fei stopped short of openly criticizing Confucius, but would have reversed every Confucian decision based on compassion or familial bonds. (Han Fei's &quot;everyone vs. the world&quot; view accepted even wives, parents, and children as potential enemies.)<br />Although Legalist punishments were permanent and severe - mutilation or death - rewards were intentionally small. No farmer should ever have a reward that let him stop farming, no under-lord should ever have wealth that could support his own power base. A happy populace was important to Han Fei's government, but only because a satisfied peasantry was harder to stir to revolt. Han Fei also argued against a large educated class. That argument helped me understand (but not justify) purges in more recent history.<br />There is a lot more to say about this book, but I have to rein myself in. However repulsive I find Han Fei's philosophy, though, this book has given me plenty to think about. It's a slim book, Burton Watson's extracts from Han Fei's ouvre, but well chosen. Also, it is another sample of Watson's outstanding translations. I've read a number of Watson's works, and I find his translations uniformly well written. His scholarship appears impeccable, and he has done the English language a wonderful service by making these classics available.<br />I have to recommend this book to anyone who's read Macchiavelli. I don't expect any sane person with a trace of compassion to follow this way. I do hope that readers will let Han Fei teach them the signs of tyrrany. I take this book as a warning light that has shined for over 2000 years, and still illuminates current dangers.ei teach them the signs of tyrrany.

It's for everyone who wants to understand what their taxes pay for, and for everyone who wants to know when the fear-mongers are howling nonsense (again).<br />I really enjoy this book. It's based on understandable facts and it covers a number of specific cases. It's well written, without a lot of intimidating terms. Best, it gives the reader some specific signs that often indicate the phonies: barely-there statistics that never seem to get better, a peculiar mix of grandstanding and secrecy, and a tendency to ignore results that don't give the \\"right\\" answer. Most of all, the frauds seem uniform in demanding that they be judged as people, not that their science be judged in independent labs.<br />Parks does an especially good job of describing the fools and frauds who attract attention in Congress. Somehow, we seem to have gone downhill at separating verifiable fact from wishes and pseudoscience. He mentions the man-to-Mars mission proposed by President Bush (the other mission proposed by the other Bush) - space opera, not science. He mentions only briefly confusion of personal values with verifiable fact - I can think of too many current cases that show the confusion is still there. Junk science in the service is junk morality is not new. I'm sure the reader will come away better able to recognize it in every day's headlines.<br />This book shows that real scientific reasoning is accessible to everyone, using the delightful example of Emily Rosa. She clearly demonstrated absurd claims of \\"aura alignment\\", published 'solid gold' statistical analysis in the Journal of the AMA, and was awarded a research grant many times the cost of her original study. Not bad for a fourth grader. I wish more adults had that clarity of mind.<br />I can't give this five stars, since it one good book among many other good books on the topic. That does not detract from this book in any way, but it has so much good company that it can't really stand out. It's a quick read, and very worthwhile.ead, and very worthwhile.	2004-03-16

Craig Russell's drawing style seems especially apt for stories of enchanted lands and beings. His lines are light and airy, and he sets a mood nicely with color. In other words, he is ideally suited to illustrate this story.<br />He does a delightful job of it, too. He amplifies all of the characters theatrically beyond the believable, and has one small advantage over true opera - he is never at the mercy of the set designers, costumers, or other effects.<br />I am very glad to see this classic of western culture (and the others coming soon) made available in this format. I confess, I have not fully acquired the taste for opera, or the ability to derive the story from the way it is sung. I do, however, want to know at least a bit of the story, and this is a very digestible form. Russell's drawing makes it more than digestible, it's a real confection. I also appreciate the fact that Russell has adapted the story, and not created a new one from fragments of the classic.<br />Opera buffs - I hope you can accept this for what it is. One way to look at this is opera appreciation on training wheels, a painless entry into part of the operatic art. It's also a way to spread some knowledge of this classic across a generation that might not have been exposed to the story otherwise - certainly a good thing.<br />If nothing else, it's a well-drawn comic by a very capable artist. It's that \\"else\\" that makes this comic stand out. I'm looking forward to the next Russell operas.<br />(This reviews the book without the CD.)	2004-03-14

The are short, memorable, and widely applicable. They are practical advice - Riel consciously avoids creating yet another methodology. Sooner or later, though, every methodology comes down to the tactical exercise of implementation. That's when you'll find Riel's advice useful, irrespective of how you started.<br />Riel certainly does not list the only heursitics possible. I might have added &quot;Create classes when behavior differs; create objects when data differs&quot;, and I'm sure an experienced reader could add lots more. Some of these heuristics don't apply in all cases. &quot;All base classes should be abstract,&quot; for example, might be tempered with concrete default bodies for some or all methods. Also, &quot;All data should be hidden&quot; is too dogmatic for me. It disregards 'const' or 'final' data elements including control constants, and deserves more discussion in the case of a subclass/superclass relationship. Still, the suggestions are generally good. Even better, they are phrased so as to invite thought and thoughtful critique by the reader.<br />I'm afraid that I did not find this book to be the ideal setting for these gems. Although the aphorisms are clear and concise, the prose around them is not. I know that publishers often prefer books of some minimum length, but padding does not serve the content well at all. Most of the book's second half is code listings. They certainly add bulk, but the book and the code both would have been better served by putting the code at the publisher's web site or on an included disk.<br />The discussion of each rule of thumb would have benefitted from a more disciplined style, too. For example, each heuristic could have been described methodically according to its applicability, the symptoms indicating that it should be used, and the code transformations needed to apply it. That's not the only format Riel could have used, and probably not the best. Almost anything would have given the book a more regular rhythm, however.<br />I like this book and I'll recommend it. It has aged a little since its 1996 printing, and wants desperately to be a more concise book. Still, it's a good complement to more recent discussions of patterns, antipatterns, and refactorings.

As usual, the glib sound-biters omit not only the interesting parts of the points they quote, they omit the real point of the essay.<br />If anyone reads the second half of this essay, they see that it writes about the widening gap between rich countries and poor - the technologically trained and untrained. Yes, Snow writes about the schism and even mutual suspicion between the communities of liberal arts and hard sciences. That's just a fact, at least as true now as it was 45 years ago. That is not what's interesting.<br />The consequence is what matters. Overpopulation, mass starvation, and destruction by war or disease are political problems. The solutions must involve tools provided by technology. The tragedy of &quot;the two cultures&quot; is the breakdown between the politicians who must wield the tools and the technologists who must create them. This is not about technology controlling the world, it is about creating a generation of thinkers who can reason about both social and technical problems. It is about education that allows people to examine the physical facts of the physical world that underly so many curable causes of human misery. It is about understanding the technology of possible solutions well enough to weigh the costs and rewards in a rational way.<br />As I write this, the 2000-era Bush administration is busy firing science advisors who don't give the &quot;right&quot; answer, is cancelling the space research programs that have given the largest volume of new knowledge, and creating new scorched-earth policies for environmental management. It's a problem not just in the US, but worldwide. This is exactly the failure that Snow hoped so fervently that educated men and women would have the wisdom to prevent.	2004-03-12

The art is good, the story is engaging, and it's just a bit more literate than most comics. The women in this story are a lot more believable than most. Barabara (I'll miss her) lacked the customary hourglass figure, as does Sophie - though in different ways. Maybe Sophie shows a bit too much delicacy and refinement, and maybe Barbara showed a bit too little. I like the human flaws.<br />Promethea's quick trip through the major arcana of the Tarot was interesting. The oracle is meant to be interpreted in many ways, and the creation story was a different spin on it. Moore's connection of the Tarot to the hebrew alphabet eludes me, but I'll keep reading.<br />As much as I like Promethea, a few things jar - Promethea seems to buy hats where Galactus does, and shares an eye color with the Silver Surfer. These are little things, though, and don't really bother me.<br />One passage did bother me, though. I have no problem with a few Tantric moments, but I am shocked at the attitude towards safe sex. The idea of condoms came up, but was discarded since the man involved promised to hold back. WRONG! First, it's pretty easy for any guy to get carried away. Second, a few sperm can leak out even without ejaculation - a quick way to put any woman on the \\"mommy track\\". Third, condoms prevent exchange of disease in both directions. Maybe Promethea is so magical that she's immune to conception and other little living things, but maybe Sophie isn't. The book's reader's certainly aren't. It would not have hurt the narrative flow to demonstrate a little adult responsibility as part of the adult pleasures.	2004-03-10

It really does have large amounts of practical advice.<br />I truly wish I could recommend this book, but I can't. Its notation and vocabulary get in the way of its many messages. Every book has some boxes-and-arrows notation, and UML has become the accepted standard. This book predates UML, and offers one of the most ornate menus of different boxes I've seen. (The word &quot;menu&quot; comes to mind because so many of the diagrams look distractingly like a Big Mac to me.)<br />Page-Jones also edged into neologism, creating vocabularies for ideas that already had an established terminology. I know that, strictly speaking, he did not invent &quot;connascence&quot; or most of its friends (contranascence, disnascence, ...). Still, he seemed to cut the words out of their original context and wedge them, uncomfortably, into usages distant from their accepted meaning. That far a stretch is about the same thing as making the word up from scratch. It may be OK for advanced mathematical usages; a book for mainstream readers should stick to the main stream of common terms.<br />The technical advice in this book deserves much better than three stars. Its obsolescent notation and opaque vocabulary interfere with a modern reader's understanding, though. Beginners, the ones most likely to benefit from the advice, would have the hardest time with it. I like the book and will come back to it, but I can't recommend it.	2004-03-08

Unfortunately, it also fixes a number of that book's strengths.<br />First, the benefits. Lots of beginners like the informal and case-oriented approach the authors take. This reads a lot less like someone's PhD dissertation, and shows Java and C++ samples to explain many patterns and concepts. (For some, translating a Smalltalk or even C++ example into Java is difficult enough for the real topic of discussion to get lost.)<br />It also uses the sustained example of a CAD/CAM system to show specific, concrete cases where a pattern might apply. This prolonged example means the reader doesn't have to switch gears to a new application context every time a pattern is put to work, and gives a chance for interactions between multiple patterns to emerge.<br />As near as I can tell, this book came from the class notes of a course taught by one of the authors. That explains the many additional hints about good programming and tips on OO style. It also explains the idiosyncratic order in which topics appear - although it stays close to the content of Gamma et al., it certainly does not stay close to that book's organization.<br />That's where I think Shalloway and Trott start to falter. The organization of this book seems to be built around the CAD/CAM example, not around any inherent properties of the patterns or logical connection to OO topics. That's fine, until you go to an application different from theirs. The focus on specific examples is also a weakness. Design Patterns are too broad to be defined by any one implementation. That means that any example, while it represents one way to apply a pattern, fails to represent a half-dozen others. The literal-minded student comes away with much too narrow an idea of how the pattern can be applied. I'm not sure that replacing the generality of Gamma et al. with exact point solutions is an improvement.<br />Still, enough students tell me this book helps that I believe them. There's a large body of DP literature out there, and some is pretty awful. I find this book undistinguished, but it's on my list of references for beginners who struggle with DP concepts. This may help clarify Gamma et al., but doesn't replace it.this book helps that I believe them. There's a large body of DP literature out there, and some is pretty awful.

The OO design world was still in the \\"warring states\\" period before unification under UML. The company that created ROOM tools, if I understand correctly, was absorbed by another company that was absorbed by another company - I'm not sure how much of ROOM in its pure form is still left.<br />That doesn't matter. In its time, ROOM was wild, innovative, and a topic of heated debate. It created a visual, highly abstracted language (back then, a questionable novelty) around an intensely parallelized model of computing (also a questionable novelty), at a time when \\"real-time\\" often meant lots of assembly programming in command-line environments. I was doing embedded development back about then - based on the mind-set of the time, I'm surprised that ROOM had the success and influence that it did.<br />Surprised but pleased. Lots of the ROOM techniques and notations survive in UML and other development tools. Modern component programming environments, JavaBeans included, show many signs of direct descent from the ROOM techniques. Still, there's a long way to go. ROOM may have been way ahead of its time, and languages still haven't caught up fully to its models of communication and parallelism.<br />As impressive an achievement as ROOM was (and is), I have some reservations about it. It relies pretty heavily of state machines for modelling the interacting components. State machines are a good tool, but quite unfamiliar to most software developers these days. I'm not sure whether that's a fault of the methodology or of today's programmers. I also have reservations about any methodology that requires me to buy someone's tools. The authors state that the design methodology can be used without their tools - based on ROOM's complexity, I doubt it. Also, I have a serious distrust of any programming environment that takes over so much of the process. Such tool sets tend to leave me feeling cramped, with little way to express my ideas in different terms. Finally, I'm sure it does all it says it does. Even so, the moment always comes when the tool-generated subsystems need to be opened up for debugging, or when the system has to be open to interaction with other development tools. Real-time and embedded systems tend to be so idiosyncratic and demanding that both kinds of openness in an IDE are compulsory. I just don't see the way out of the closed ROOM.<br />My present interest is not so much in the ROOM methodology itself, although I'm interested in methodology in general. Instead, I'm studying the visual notation it developed for expressing complex computations. Whatever ROOM's faults and whatever its later history, it's still worth attention.eeling cramped, with little way to express my ideas in different terms.

My own experience is that reverse engineering is at least 20% of a typical software engineer's typical day. It's the study that a developer puts towards understanding a system well enough to make necessary changes, rediscovering enough about the system to enable the task at hand. The authors addressed their book to specific re-engineering projects, as isolated events, but they really wrote about the everyday life of almost every programmer.<br />As Johnson points out in the foreword, much if the information has an \\"everybody knows that\\" feel about it. I found a few new tips or new phrases, but mostly I found a clear, systematic organization of facts and techniques that are widely applied. The authors' arrangement of known techniques makes them especially valuable, much the way an arrangement of ordinary playing cards can become a valuable hand in poker.<br />Among other things, these authors are the first to convince me that software metrics can be a net gain to a developer. My own, sad exposure to metrics has been normative, a stick wielded blindly in the name of misunderstood \\"quality\\". This book shows how to use metrics in a constructive, exploratory way. The complexity (or whatever) scores are not the output of the process, they are intermediate results to be discarded as soon as they've pointed the way to the real problems.<br />I found only a very few points to disagree with. For example, the authors point out pros and cons of prototypes, but missed the biggest danger of a working prototype: that, no matter what caveats are given, it can be mistaken for a real system. Over-eager clients or managers driven by a false sense of efficiency may demand that the developers just add a feature or two (usually, system's  entire capability) and ship it tomorrow. Elsewhere, the authors noted that converting from a command line interface to a GUI can be jarring for users, but did not point out that a GUI can provide a command entry field, at least as a transition aid. I would also have been happier with a longer discussion in ch.10 of type checking - I agree with the authors completely, but feel that they missed some common variations on the type-testing theme and reasons for it.<br />The authors suggested using dot plots for describing similarity between bodies of code, a representation I first saw in genome analysis. It strengthens the image of a program as a living, evolving thing, but also suggests that other genomic tools could possibly have value in understanding software. Programs are really just long strings, and geneticists have a huge box of subtle tools for analyzing long strings. Mating of the two fields could spawn a new generation of techniques for extracting information from existing software.<br />I recommend this book very highly. It's thorough, practical, and readable. It addresses software maintenance - i.e., most of the software industry - as a valuable task, worth serious study and investment in tools. A brief review can't do justice to the book's rich content.

This book opens a series that is sequel to Griffin and Sabine, one of the most imaginative sets I've ever seen.<br />Like G&amp;S, we see our characters only through their correspondence. This gives a delicious sense of voyeurism, of peeking in on unguarded moments between intimates. The book presents the postcards at standard size, usually with images on one side and text on the other. The letters are separate sheets, in envelopes that are built into the book. This creates a distinctive reading experience - the physical interaction between book and reader is very different from normal turn-the-page, and evokes a sense of personal involvement.<br />The imagery is rich and layered, in Bantock's signature style. The best of these pictures contain many elements, where each retains a distinct identity within the whole. Sometimes, though, the different components seem overworked and run together, an effect I find murky.<br />The plot is cryptic and eerie as in G&amp;S, partly because this extends G&amp;S. As in real life, the story moves forward in uneven increments, a step forward by this character, then a step by that one. It holds my attention, but doesn't seem to carry the drama of the original series.<br />This is a wonderful book and an uncommon experience in reading. Bantock struck sparks in the original Griffin and Sabine series that he tries to recapture here. 'Gryphon' continues the story capably, but lacks the freshness of G&amp;S. Still, I'm looking forward to the next books in this set.	2004-02-21

This short book came off to a satisfying start: a comparison between a small-town fix-it man, a motorcycle restoration devotee, and art conservators faced with an uncommonly demanding situation. It discussed the various ideals of \\"whatever works\\", the sacred factory spec, and the professional responsibility of anyone who touches priceless works of art.<br />It turned out that those cases formed the first half of a set of analogies - Spelman's true interest seem to lie in the social repair of ruptured human relationships. OK, I was a bit disappointed, but I reserve the author's right to her choice of topic. I tried to shift gears to follow her.<br />First, Spelman proposed the home as the first line of repair for the broken spirit or body. This turned into a woman vs. man competition that I found frankly disappointing. The discussion seemed to center around a \\"Leave it to Beaver\\" household of Mom, Pop, and their children by each other. Last I heard, that described about one in six US households. Spelman completely ignored the modern piecemeal family: his, hers, theirs, and other, plus a baffling array of outliers and part-time parents. My limited experience says that there is the real need for repair - the little rifts and the interactions that never worked quite right, needing continuous soothing for any semblance of harmony.<br />She goes on to a chapter about restorative justice, built around context-dependent bargaining between the victim (referred to as \\"her\\") and the wrongdoer (\\"him\\"). There certainly is merit in exploring alternatives to punitive justice. I'm not sure how far this concept can be pushed, though. Context-dependent bargaining inherently favors the slicker bargainer, and inherently favors the people with sufficient power to define the social context.<br />Spelman also makes much of the power of apology. I acknowledge that apology can have power, and Spelman cites Clinton's apology to those wronged by the notorious Tuskeegee study. My own experience is less rosy, though. I've heard the same apologies repeated for the same wrongs by the same people too many times. Apology, too often, does not take responsibility for wrongs done. Instead, it is the height of irresponsibility, a self-declared amnesty, a cheap and easy alternative to making a difference.<br />I expect other reviewers to rank this book very differently than I do. I was not at all happy with shallow gender stereotypes about how familes work. Perhaps \\"restorative justice\\" is effective in some limited circumstances - I would have to see it work more, and I'd have to see handling of its failures before I follow her enthusiasm.

This volume's artwork carries the story in a very capable way. It's consistent enough for continuity but varied enough to express the dreaminess that pervades the series. I like the art in this volume, but it's the story that dominates.<br />How does an immortal quit his job? I won't tell, but it's hard on the mortals who become involved - those are the \\"brief lives.\\" This book also makes an interesting point: an infinite life may have a definite beginning, then go on eternally. Likewise, an infinite life with an infinite past may have a definite end.<br />I'm not sure what to make of a main character in this book, Delirium. Her former role (not depicted here) was Desire. That clue helps me distinguish Delirium from madness, and Despair has clearly different character. Perhaps, as I work my way through the series, I'll learn more. For now, I'll just enjoy the character's ambiguity. This title certainly gives me reason to read the rest of the seies.	2004-02-18

Phylogenetics tries to estimate &quot;family trees&quot; given only the family members visible today - exact lineage is guesswork, since the parents, grandparents, and shared heritage can never be known.<br />This book offers deep analysis of one family of techniques for deducing possible trees. It gives a very thorough, formal description of ways to examine and resolve different sources of information, or to determine that they can not be resolved. It offers minute analysis of ways to take subsets of the whole family, analyze the subsets, then merge the subset conclusions together, as much as possible. It also addresses the statistical character of the tree-building problem. The reader who masters this material has a powerful set of tools for phylogenetic analysis.<br />That reader must be truly dedicated, though. The first two chapters read like mathematical graph theory (because they are). The next few chapters are also highly mathematical, but offer a bit more biological insight. I'm not a mathematician, so I find this book tough going. The graph-theoretic conclusions give wonderful insight into combining information from multiple traits and in noting points of conflict. It takes me a while, though, to unwind the formal notation enough to attach biological meaning to it. There are a few helpful statistical analyses, but they could be missed - the more familiar kinds of statistics are hidden among the combinatorics and tree perturbations. Later chapters revisit familiar topics like parsimony and Markov models, but with theoretical depth that's hard to find elsewhere.<br />Within the whole gamut of phylogenetic techniques now used, this book addresses only one range. Within that range, however, Semple and Steel have done a fine job of showing the theory behind those techniques. I value the insights that this book brings. Even so, it's not always easy to dislodge those insights from the solid slabs of proofs in which they are embedded. I appreciate the demonstration of NP-completeness of specific problems, but I can't always apply that knowledge to the biology I want to address.<br />Anyone devoted to mastering every nuance of phylogenetic analysis should read this book. It goes beyond the needs of most application developers, though. It probably won't say much at all to those who just use the results of analysis; it simply does not address any particular application that an analyst might use. If you have the determination to understand and the patience to pick out the understanding, you'll find a lot to like in &quot;Phylogenetics&quot;.ys easy to dislodge those insights from the solid slabs of proofs in which they are embedded.

If someone wants a first introduction to fine prints, this is the book to recommend. It is well organized by technical process and well illustrated. As with any specialist topic, detailed discussion of prints and printmaking can turn dry. Lambert has avoided that error, mostly through brevity. She's curator of one of the world's finest collections of prints - I admire her restraint.<br />Lambert focusses this book on the technical processes of printmaking. The reader comes away with the basic vocabulary of prints, and a good idea of how each technique serves expressive or commercial needs. I hope the reader will take this knowledge to a museum, to see first-hand how each process looks in life. Although this book is very well illustrated, the reader's new knowledge really must be tried on actual prints, since reproduction can not convey the real subtlety of each technique.<br />I almost wish this showed a few more examples, like a Picasso drypoint showing the split line that can appear, or the delicate texture that a rocker leaves in a mezzotint. Any book can be made longer - on reflection, I favor Lambert's decision to keep it brief and readable.<br />This book is not about the history of printmaking, except where history places each technique relative to the others and to other arts. I think that decision makes this book ideal for beginners. This gives the reader knowledge that can be put to use immediately, when the reader sees an original print. Once this book stirs the novice reader's interest, it will be up to the reader to seek out more information on specifics. It's a practical approach that I think works well.<br />I'm already a nut for prints and print process. I didn't need this extra push. It's a lovely book, though, and I can't wait to pass it on to someone just learning to love prints.	2004-02-16

It's almost take on a life of its own, though - maybe the term really does apply.<br />In any case, this is a very enjoyable book about the history of the hypothesis. In many ways, this book is more about the people who pursue that elusive proof. That small, distinguished crowd includes the reticent and the outspoken, the loners and the social thinkers, the meticulous and those who think by leaps and bounds. Sabbagh has a strong emphasis on the living mathematicians who hunt this elusive quarry. He has spent long hours interviewing these mathematicians and watching them at their work. At bottom, this may be a book about intellectual passion and the people for whom its reward is real.<br />The book contains a few disconcerting mis-statements:<br />-- one says that plutonium occurs naturally - on Earth, it does not,<br />-- another on p.11 makes a statement about prime factors of the number 60 (I'd believe that same statement about all of 60's factors, including non-primes), and<br />-- a third on p.143 appears to have applied parentheses incorrectly in describing Skewe's number.<br />None of these, by itself, affects the main thrust of the book. Still, they leave me wondering about every fact I read. When I find such errors, I have to wonder how many I didn't find, ones that I don't have the information to check.<br />Because of the book's emphasis on the people dedicated to the hypothesis, there is no one place where the hypothesis' history is laid out in full and in order. That's small enough loss, if you accept that the book's topic is really mathematicians and not mathematics. The author does give a brief and clear statement of the problem itself - that takes math at the level of high school calculus to understand, but the reader won't be punished for skipping past its details.<br />This book has real nerd appeal (I like it). It's a readable case study of a famous problem and of the people tracking it down. It won't really expand anyone's intellectual horizons, but there are lots worse ways to spend a few hours. Despite flaws, I found this book quite enjoyable.f the people tracking it down. It won't really expand anyone's intellectual horizons, but there are lots worse ways to spend a few hours.

This book is the only introduction I know to the original thoughts of this great painter.<br />Delacroix presents a paradox: a skilled, expressive writer who argues against writing as an expressive medium. In his day, there was some kind of contest. One would be superior, either images or words. Even if the one-must-win mind seems silly now, he surely wrote his point about writing much better than the writers drew theirs about drawing.<br />Back then, his use of color was considered brash or worse. A mind like his must have its own way, though, and his critics are mostly forgotten. There was very little outlet for his views of art, so he planned his own art encyclopedia. It was really to have been an encyclopedia of his own thoughts on art, but would still have been a magnificent work.<br />It would also have been 150 years ahead of its time. Like the Journal itself, this dictionary was to be highly non-linear. Instead of alphabetical or other order, it would present a structure relating each part to others through footnotes. Give or take a technological vocabulary, it sounds like a heavily linked hypertext to me. He also, without using modern words, expressed fractal, self-similar structures like the recursive branching of trees.<br />The Journal did not follow strict time sequence - events were reported in contradictory orders and also revised at various times. This is where Hannoosh's scholarship adds its value. She has not only made the text available to French-deficient readers like me. She has also unwound its convoluted structure, and pinned it to other historical sources.<br />The proper balance is delicate, though. I wanted to read Delacroix's journal, not a commentary on Delacroix. The translator and scholar makes the original accessible, but also injects her own voice. The last chapter or two is almost exclusively about Delacroix, not by him. Even though Hannoosh seems to be a fine scholar, it was not her words that I hoped to hear.<br />There is a brief pictorial section in this book - black and white (although Delacroix was a famed colorist) and of uncertain sharpness. I respect that. It indicates the structure of paintings noted in the text, but makes no pretense at being a proper rendering of Delacroix's work. If you want to study the images themselves, you really need another book. These reproductions support the text. But isn't that where we came in, discussing the text vs. the painted image?<br />The book has voluminous footnootes. It also offers the original French for many of the passages presented in English translation. Together, these cut perhaps half the apparent bulk from the text. That makes this book a brief and very informative lesson in a great man's thinking. Although a bit dry, I really do like this one.seems to be a fine scholar, it was not her words that I hoped to hear.<br />There is a brief pictorial section in this book - black and white (although Delacroix was a famed colorist) and of uncertain sharpness.

This book is a fair introduction to the questions that typography addresses. It shows a number of ways that typography affects the sense and understandability of text. It shows how type can solve technical problems in display media, including mosaic, LCD display, or neon. It even gives a little typographic history, including the people and technologies that formed modern use of text. As an aside, the book also catalogs brief samples of a wide variety of type faces.<br /><br />The book itself is a sample of typography, and the appearance of every page is intended as an example. I'm not sure that the examples are all good ones, though. The layout is dense to the point of crowding. The book's layout follows a regular rhythm, examples on the left of each spread and text on the right. That rhythm could have been relied on to carry more of the book's information. For example, text pages reserve the right margin for additional notes. Those rubrics are distinuguished from the body text by placement, type face, letter size, color, and the density of the text's \\"gray.\\" I find that a bit heavy-handed; two or three distinguishing features would have sufficed. The book's ongoing catalog of type faces could also have been more effective. The samples were too small to display real nuances of difference, and could have helped more in showing good and bad combinations of letter forms.<br /><br />I think this book's value is in training the eye to problems that type can solve (or create). Recognizing the problem is the first step in solving it. Unfortunately, the reader must look elsewhere for the second and later steps. This raises the questions but provides very few answers.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-02-08

His writing style is very different from the plain, clean lines of his drawing. The text nearly smothers the reader in adjectives and tangential detail - an affectation that reinforces the description of dissipated foppery.<br /><br />Unfortunately, not all of the writing is Beardsley's. His early death left this work unfinished. A \\"posthumous collaborator\\" in the 1950s finished it, perhaps to his own satisfaction but not to mine. The break in style is quite abrupt where the modern writer took over, and I found his turn of plot inauthentic. [I think the first paragraph p.80 is where the impostor began writing. See ISBN 1871592127 for a comparison text.]<br /><br />The book does reproduce a few of Beardsley's wonderful illustrations. There are only a few of them, though - this book is not primarily about Beardsley's drawing. If it were, I'm sure the printing and paper would have been upgraded to show more of the pictures' detail.<br /><br />Any fan of Beardsley's art will gain insight from his writing. The reader should take care, however, in distinguishing Beardsley's writing from anyone else's.<br /><br />(By the way, this is not for the squeamish. This is part of Beardsley's history, and some history is not very nice.)	2004-02-08

The writing is filled with first-person passion: not the grim, militant kind, but affection that can afford a good laugh at its subject. Best of all, Angier's affection for her topic (herself included) seems equally based on romanticism and research.<br />Being in a species with two sexes is interesting, but news from the other side is rarely balanced, complete, or even comprehensible. I value Angier's eloquence and clarity. I also value her ability to incorporate new information into her views, instead of shouting down whatever doesn't match some political manifesto.<br />The only fault I find in this book is that there is not more of it. The years since she wrote the book have added intriguing facts to the pile such as the genes in embryonic brains that express differently in male and female, long before hormonal effects take hold. Even when \\"Woman\\" was written, though, there was plenty of information about matrilineal mitochondria that she could have used - it would have enriched her discussion of genetics. Also, she omitted discussion of the relatively rare women who succeed in the hard sciences. Keeping with her tone, there would have been no need to compare them to the men in the field. They would have been interesting enough in their own right.<br />I am not a woman myself, just an admirer, companion, co-worker, and occasional visitor. I was very happy to see a writer who not only has such agreeable views, but brings such a wealth of knowledge to the discussion and brings herself, too. Brava!	2004-02-07

This book covers the common ones, maybe all the distributions a student sees in the first stats course or two.<br />The coverage is quite good for routine, and some non-routine purposes. I find the characteristic functions especially helpful. Each distribution's description of how it arises is also very useful - it's the kind of information that a practitioner needs in order to apply distributions to problems in meaningful ways.<br />I know that no book can say everything, but a few additions would have improved this book significantly. More discussion of applications would have helped. So would a discussion of general techniques for generating random numbers - inverse distributions, rejection, etc.<br />The two real weaknesses I found were in the extreme value and the empirical distributions. Extreme values don't stand alone. They often arise in ways dependent on other distributions. An extreme value distribution might describe the results of many experiments that find the largest of N values drawn from distribution P - with different results according to P. These distributions don't have convenient closed forms, but are amenable to some kinds of analysis anyway.<br />Perhaps the authors do a reasonable job of empirical distributions in the continuous case, but discrete (categorical) cases arise more in my work. Discrete distributions must answer such questions as: given that my sampling may not have found objects of all possible types, how many unknown types are probably still out there? Lots of problems have distributions too complicated for analysis or too poorly understood for book formulas to work, and must be handled empirically. More discussion of empirical techniques would make this a much stronger reference.<br />Despite its soft spots, this is a very practical reference. I expect it to be a productive member of my technical library.	2004-02-07
795796:US	35004134	RH8Z1EHSSA9GD	0471183865	88319630	Statistical Analysis with Missing Data	Books	5	54	55	N	Y	Cautious and applicable	I'm working with data sets where up to 15% of measurements are unusable. If I'm going to get any results at all, I have to get them despite the lost values.<br />This book provides a huge library of techniques for working around the holes, as well as techniques for filling them in. This is not a cut-and-paste text for programmers - it gives the basic theory and algorithms for each technique. Still, the presentation is quite readable and fairly easy to put into practice.<br />The book's emphasis is on imputation - filling in values so that analysis can move forward. This is something to approach with real caution, though. The imputed (synthesized) values must not perturb the analysis, so the imputation must differ according to the analysis being performed. The authors present a variety of imputation techniques, as well as bootstrap, jacknife, and other techniques for measuring the quality of the results.<br />The authors also dedicate chapters to approaches that work only with available data, and to cases where missing data can not simply be ignored.<br />This is the most thorough and practical guide I know to handling missing data. In an ideal world, experiments would all produce usable results and surveys would all have every question answered. When you have to deal with reality, though, this is the book.	2004-02-06

The assumption may be explicit, may be hidden inside a chi-squared phrase, or may stand silently behind discussions of mean and variance. If your data don't match that assumption, stated or not, the tests give wrong answers.<br /><br />Nonparametric stats work without that assumption. In fact, most work without !any! assumptions about the distributions of data. These are very robust techniques, and this book demonstrates a number of simple and effective ones. The author describes everything you need to know about a number of tests: when each applies, how to perform it, and how to interpret results. It's a very useful guide for people who need high-quality answers from low-quality data.<br /><br />Best, many of these procedures are simple enough to apply routinely to almost any data set. I find them helpful for quick checks before applying more detailed kinds of parametric analysis. If your data fail the loose bounds of non-parametric testing, you know that fussier, more high-strung tests have no hope of reasonable answers.<br /><br />There are no theorems here, and very little development of the underlying principles. That's good for someone who just wants the answers. On the other hand, it's a real weakness if you need to customize analysis for an unusual problem. You just won't find the fundamentals you need for sound improvisation.<br /><br />//wiredweird<br /><br />(This review describes the first edition.)	2004-02-04

There's no theory here, but there are large numbers of practical procedures, including significance testing, regressions, and simple experiment design. Each chapter cover a wide variety of circumstances, and forces a reader to think very hard about just what information is available and just what answers are expected of it.<br />If you're used to books that list the tests, the procedures, and the tables of p-values, this will probably offer more choices and more detailed discussion than usual. It won't help a lot if you have an unusual circumstance that requires customized analysis, though, and doesn't talk much about the principles under the procedures. Also, it makes almost no mention of non-parameteric techniques.<br />The one warning I have is that it dates back to pre-computer days. It's full of slick tricks for pencil&amp;paper calculation, with approximations that let you skip a step or two. Back then, computational tips were very welcome. Today, though, they just put a false face in front of the actual operations being performed. The insight available in the basic statement of a computation is often lost.<br />If you just want basic answers to basic problems, this is about the most useful book I've seen. It won't make you a statistician, but will put you well ahead of most stats users.	2004-02-03
803068:US	35004134	R1FHW9WLY7J8ZI	1563896672	316129890	Promethea, Book 1	Books	4	2	6	N	N	A good read	This is all I expect in a comic: characters, plot, and action to pull me along, story and art that work together, and situations that don't tax the mind too much. This one is a bit more than a typical super-heroine with mystical powers and a brass bra. Her off-duty persona is bookish, a feature that I empathize with, in an urban world that satirizes what ours might become. When that college girl takes on the Promethea role, she doesn't know who she is, or what or where - she just knows that she's under a bizarre attack, defending herself in ways that she finds equally bizarre, even to herself.<br />The artwork in this book is very competent, and supports the story well. I can't say that I find it memorable, though. The story's allegories are a bit heavy-handed, and mystical symbols are deeply piled everywhere you turn. They are so pervasive that I find they lose meaning, becoming background decoration rather than signs with real significance. The story comes down to mis-understood good vs. mis-perceived evil, mysterious advisors of uncertain loyalties, a mousy alter-ego, and a few other staples of the genre.<br />Still, the pieces come together well. The book is good amusement, and worth coming back to. It won't be the centerpiece of any collection and won't shake the world of comic art or story. That's OK - it's still a pleasant and undemanding way to fill an evening.	2004-02-01

This book is helpful, within its limits, in understanding and constructing a few specific families of block designs. That is the book's strength and weakness. The strength is it's readable, applicable approach to construction - a welcome change from the tantalizing lists of existence proofs that other authors offer. The weakness is its specificity: it appears to address only 2-designs, and my interests are a bit broader. Still, with support from other sources, I may be able to stretch some of this book's results to meet my needs.<br />If you're not familiar with design theory, you're in good company (and lots of it). Perhaps the defining problem in design theory is Kirkman's Schoolgirls. They are fifteen friends who walk to school every day, on a path wide enough for only three at a time. To avoid jealousies, every girl must have walked with every other by the end of the week. In other words, divide 15 elements into sets of 3, so that every unique set of 2 appears 1 time in one or another of the triplets. (All of the numbers in that sentence may be changed to give define different designs).<br />Unforutnately, design theory has not yet made it into the main stream of applied math. That means that the writing I've seen falls into two extreme categories. First, there are a few isolated and popularized facts - Latin Squares or design of statistical experiments, cut off from all of their supporting reasoning. Then, there are the dense tomes, by and for mathematicians, abstracted unreachably far away from applications. This is truly a pity, because design theory informs modern cryptographic protocols, replicated databases, error correcting codes, computer architecture, sports playoffs, and gamblers looking for &quot;the system&quot; for Lotto. I am sure that applications would be wider and richer if the literature had more for the middle tiers of readers, myself included.<br />This book is certainly not for the popular press, but is a step in a more readable direction. It seems to have more applicable content and less opaque notation than other design theory I've read. Still, this book is for the specialist only.It seems to have more applicable content and less opaque notation than other design theory I've read.

After two thousand years, the story is still fresh and charming - the sign of a true classic. It's about young love, eager and inept, with gods, pirates, and other harmless excitement. The writer included the happy fumblings of physical affection that a modern author would have shied from, sweet and not at all salacious. The story finishes with an improbable and triumphantly happy ending. Good happy fun, and not a lengthy read.<br />Beyond the story itself, I found this book very informative. The story is supposedly one that Shakespeare read, and it shows. Some of the Bard's endings look a bit recycled once you've read Daphnis and Chloe. I also found that it explained Marc Chagall's cycle of lithographs - the images make more sense, now that I've seen their inspiration. In addition, there's satisfaction in knowing that this story, with such influence on such great minds, and is now a part of my education, too.<br />All that was extra reward, though. I wanted the book because Chagall's illustration. It's there, in dozens of beautiful color reproductions, including some two-page spreads. Up til now, Marc Chagall has always been in the lower ranks among my favorite artists. After seeing his work in this book, I have a new respect for it. He's still not among my very favorites, but I enjoy the lithos shown here. Even more, I enjoy them as a coherent body visual work and as a narrative.<br />Best, though, is quality of this book for its price. It's well printed on heavy stock, and the color printing is strong and nuanced. The production values in the color pages and the sheer number of them are quite astonishing for a book that costs so little. I plan to enjoy this book for a long time.	2004-01-31

That's a good thing - the opinions are founded on long experience and on broad familiarity with software development. The authors, true to their &quot;pragmatic&quot; promise, often omit the theory and case history that justify the opinions. They offer reams of advice on nearly every part aspect of industrial programming, and I think that all of the advice is good.<br />I don't agree with all of it - good advice is good within its limits, and my work often lies outside of their limits. Take, for example, their editor fanaticism. I've been hearing for 25 years how much more efficient my work will be if I use editor &lt;xyz&gt;. First, I move between development environments so much that learning funny key-pokes for one environment just gives me the wrong reflexes for the next environment and the one after that. Mostly, though, text entry is about 5% of my problem. Suppose, after a &quot;near-vertical learning curve&quot;, that the cult editor cuts 20% off my editing time - data entry would then be 4% of my problem. The cost/benefit ratio underwhelms me. If you really love your escape-meta-alt-control-shift (emacs) editor, though, don't let me get in your way.<br />I still think that almost all of the authors' views are good ones, with good reasons behind them. I rabidly agree with lots of them (especially DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself), and for lots more reasons than they give. The book is helpful even where I disagree. When I rethink my own circumstance, it's not that their reasoning is wrong, but that different reasoning is more right.<br />This is one to keep, not just for the programmers in the trenches but for their managers, as well. Best, it doesn't try to dress up the -ism of the day as holy law - as the title says, it's about pragmatics.	2004-01-28

Lessing's criticism of the twentieth century is pointed, somtimes funny, and ultimately hopeful. The other four books in her 'Canopus' series are much stronger, though.<br />Shikasta - the outsider's name for Earth - is presented in a series of vingettes, case studies, and partial exchanges of letters. Perhaps the intent was to create a mosaic from those many pieces. I just found it fragmentary; somehow, it never formed a whole, coherent image for me. Also, this book is longer than the others in the set. In those, Lessing makes her points concisely; this book's increased length just gave more of the poor organization.<br />I recently re-read the other four books (not the proper order of the set of five), and came away more impressed than ever. Singly and as a set, they are wonderful. I'm glad I read this one last. If I had read this before the others I might not have bothered with them - that would have been a true loss on my part.<br />I recommend the Canopus series most highly. The other books are among the finest literature I know. It is unfortunate that Shikasta does not rise to their standards, and it would be sad if a new reader judged the series by it's first member.	2004-01-26

It is a wonderfully clear explanation of how almost any two entities, interacting over time, develop a mutualism more profitable than greed.<br />The experimental support for these claims comes from a series of contests. Dozens of authors provided computer programs to play in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma - a simple model, but one that describes a surprising number of real-world phenomena. Most importantly, it's a testable model. It almost puts a common aspect of social interaction into a test tube. What came out of that test tube was startling in its clarity and simplicity.<br />The book is very readable. Axelrod segregates the mathematical and non-mathematical discussions with some care. Math-free readers see the whole set of experiments and conclusions, clearly explained, and need to skip only a few paragraphs during the main discussion. The last few chapters reward math-positive readers with additional precision and rigor. Even then, the math is accessible to someone with good high-school algebra skills.<br />Axelrod's discussion truly timeless, except for references to the Cold War as current events. I can accept that. Even though that un-war is mostly over, it's a critical part of modern history and it still informs current policy. Any insight into that madness helps, and Axelrod is very helpful.<br />This book stands above any one category. It's one of very few that I recommend to the bookshelves of every educated person.	2004-01-20

The stories are dark, apocalyptic, and frankly disjoint. The reason to read Druillet, though, is the imagery. It is deeply layered in scale - the finest pen-marks turn out to be human forms wrenched from Dante's Inferno. At larger scale, he builds textures up from textures, crushing the tiniest humans into mere structure. His figures, often, are grotesques. The major characters, especially women, are rendered in human ways. He often uses degree of grotesquerie to show degree of human worth, and precious little worth is to be seen.<br />The book has long been out of print. Maybe things have their time, and maybe this time has past. Excellence is timeless, though. The serious reader of comics and comic art will find much to enjoy here, or at least to study.	2004-01-17

It really does seem to have full descriptions of all the language features. I'm not sure, because I have to flip to so many different sections to see one feature described, that I really don't know whether I found everything.<br />This book reads like a standards document, designed by commitee. (If you're never read standards, imagine reading 'War and Peace' by selecting pages in random order.) In the bigger standards, any given component tends to make sense only when you've mastered all other system features, so you understand how that component fits the system as a whole. That means the learning curve includes a jump discontinuity, from zero up to where you've absorbed some critical mass of information. That's what this book is like.<br />Yes, Ada is a complex language, so a truly brief description is impossible. A better writer knows, though, that brevity (to a point) improves clarity, and that the organization of content is at least as important as the content itself.<br />The one real strength in this book is the many examples. They are sometimes over-long for the points they make, but seem to demonstrate most of the important language features.<br />If you already know a few languages including at least one with object orientation, you should be able to hack a trail for yourself through this thicket of information - the author has not paved a clear path for you. If you are a beginning programmer, you're likely to have a hard time of it.	2004-01-16

If nothing else, the range of media is incredible - one image might contain watercolor, collage, lettering, and computer processing. The next might be three or four other media.<br />This is not a book to read once and put down. It deserves more than one reading, maybe many readings, to capture everything in this story. The plot itself is well done but ordinary. It's the imagery that can't be absorbed at one sitting, including lettering and private notes. These additional texts don't drive the story along the plot line. They do, however, sustain the mood and express the characters' inner experience of their situation. There is no clear dividing line between text and artwork, though.<br />Other artists may use experimental media and non-linear text as a substitute for technical skill. Mack uses the media to express his skill - his drawing is outstanding, and he clearly has a passion for figure.<br />I have many favorites among comics, each for different reasons. Mack's Kabuki is a favorite among my favorites.	2004-01-16

This collection is a feast, a treasure of daily and sunday strips. Now that I see them collected, the recurring themes and characters are even more apparent and enjoyable.<br />My one complaint about this book is density - or lack of it. Other comic strip collections in this format print at least five or six dailies per page - this usually prints just two or three. Yes, I like being able to see additional detail in each panel.

Details of statistical and analytic techniques were too scattered, if present at all, to hold my interest.<br />If you want the biological or medical answers from the programs without worrying too much about how they're derived, maybe this book will help you.

In many areas - string matching, signal decoding, model-building - it is used without any special mention, like any other fundamental. It seems hard to remember that, not too long ago, likelihood and Bayesian techniques were the topics of impassioned debate - somtimes on different sides of the debate. This little book dates back to that era.<br />The book addresses the use of likelihood in a number of familiar applications (parameter estimation, etc). The examples are numerous and clear. I find more recent writings to be more directly applicable, though.<br />The real value of this book, for me, is the historical perspective that the author brings to the discussion. Early in his career, he worked with Fisher - one of the founders of modern statistics. Edwards describes how likelihood-based analysis grew out of that tradition. He also restates some of the philosophical objections to Bayesian analysis, especially questioning the use of priors.<br />I didn't come away from this book with any new analytic skills, though I suppose I could have mined the text more deeply. I did come away impressed by how much applied math and probability modeling have changed just since the 70s.	2004-01-14

It starts a lot more slowly, but builds to a higher crescendo. The characters are more nuanced, less like cardboard cutouts labeled \\"good\\" and \\"evil.\\" Finally, more than the others, the ending is clear, timely, and very satisfying.<br /><br />It's hard to describe this book, but try to picture Orwell's 1984 rewritten from a Christian view. The world had not reached Orwell's nightmare, but was headed decisively in that direction. The leaders of that putsch had all too familiar an appearance, and were ready to make every use of people uncertain of their own morality.<br /><br />The end of the book, just a few pages following the end of the conflict, took me quite by surprise. (No, I won't give it away.) In retrospect, though, it makes a lot of sense. Lewis was acutely aware of mankind's combined nature, physical and spiritual, with no need for distinction to be made. In \\"The Screwtape Letters\\", Lewis stated the importance of physically kneeling to pray because of how the physical act of kneeling affects the mind made from that physical body. I am quite sure that the ending was written to be as devout as Lewis could possibly make it, and it is a very beautiful vision of sacred duty.<br /><br />This book is immensely more mature a work than the two that preceded it. The others create context for this one, but this stands very well by itself. If you have patience with its slow start, you may be happily surpised.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2004-01-12

Although a few principles (like pigeonholing) apply in many cases, every combinatorial problem has unique features. Attacking a new situation is almost like starting all over again, unless you can recognize an old problem in your new one.<br />This book gives a number brief case studies. Its 18 chapters (not counting intro and closing) span a variety of interesting topics. Cameron doesn't write down to the reader - it takes serious thought and some mathematical background to get full value from the reading. The examples are nowhere near as concrete as you'd expect in a popularized version. Still, the author avoids opaque references to specialist terms, and keeps the text approachable.<br />I have personal reason to like this book more than it's high quality warrants. I was thumbing through it in a store, and skimmed a page that described Kirkman's schoolgirls (a two-level problem in selecting subsets). Quite abruptly, I realized that those charming young ladies exactly represented a problem I had in connecting the parts of a multiprocessor. One or two references later, I had a practical way out of a potentially ugly quandry. This material is not just fun for its own intellectual challenge, it has application to real engineering, too.	2004-01-09

The book itself is beautifully printed. Pages are heavy stock - I've seen flimsier business cards. Color is rich, and only one page had any registration problem that I could see. This is more than just a monograph about the artist, it reproduces a book by the artist (and I'm grateful for the English translation). I have a passion for primary sources -  Matisse isn't among my favorite artists, but I'll listen when an undeniable master speaks.<br />Unfortunately, two major features of the book interfere with my full enjoyment of it. First, the original Jazz interleaved images with text in Matisse's own hand. A little of the hand-written text has been reproduced, but certainly not all of it. The original relationship of text and image has been lost. Second, and related, is that the translation appears in the back of the book. It's only a minor nuisance to flip back and forth between the book's real content and back matter. I had real problems, though, with the fact that the back matter gives the whole of Matisse's text, but the main content does not. The translated part gives no indication of what it provides that the reproduction doesn't, so it was a &quot;Where's Waldo&quot; exercise, trying to resynchronize my reading with viewing of the images. Perhaps economic decisions about printing forced the omissions. I can still wish that different tradeoffs had been used in the choice, or that the book's organization could have compensated better for the losses.<br />A final point, and a relatively minor one, is that Matisse provided a visual index or table of contents, showing a thumbnail sketch of each work in the book. I was fascinated by Matisse's own view of what mattered in each composition. The way it's reproduced looks a bit like a ransom note, however. Each annotation has been cut out into its own little box and laid out according to the book designer's idea of proper organization. Perhaps there is good reason for this; maybe the thumbnails would have been illegibly small if the page were reproduced to scale. Still, I would have liked to see the original page's organization, even if the reproduction also showed the sketches at readable size.<br />Despite the book's flaws, it seems to be an adequate presentation of a coherent body of compositions. Warts and all, I looking forward to enjoying the book over and over.uld have been illegibly small if the page were reproduced to scale.

It gives a strong description of the basic language features, including the ones usually skipped in intro texts. It skips the baby steps of logic design, and shows examples of most language constructs, including overloading.<br />I never thought I'd say it, but this VHDL book is actually a bit weak on the hardware side. It's description of processes and events seems incomplete, and the discussion of timing-related features is scant.<br />The description of synthesis is too brief to cover many of the common variations you'll come across. If you have scars from a few optimizing compilers, though, you'll be able to pick up what you need from your tools, co-workers, and experience. Place-and-route is worth understanding. Taking real control of it, though, is usually something done cautiously and within the context of specific tools and chip characteristics.  A few chapters of the book focus on specific tools - naturally, not the ones I use. I found those missable.<br />On the whole, I find this book helpful. Perhaps other books are better, but lots of books are lots worse.	2004-01-08

The problem is that VHDL is a complex (or \\"rich\\") language, and needs an intense focus of its own. This book does the best job I've seen.<br />I've learned lots of languages, usually one or two a year. I know what to look for. I want a book that lays it all out clearly enough that I can find what I want. That includes complex data types, overloading, and especially configurability. VHDL really does have almost all the capabilities of a C-like language, plus a few more features, and the author has succeeded in making them accessible.<br />Configurability deserves special attention - it is an explicit part of the VHDL language. It's a pre-Object-Oriented language but was developed when OO ideas were solidfying in the industry. Although it lacks OO flexibility, Ashenden does point out how \\"use\\" and \\"configure\\" can give a few of the same effects.<br />Hardware description languages aren't like regular programming languages, and shouldn't be, and can't be. Still, they're not that different, either. Perhaps you're already a good programmer and already comfortable with digital system basics. If so, this may be the book to give you the language knowledge you need with minimal repetition of what you already know.	2004-01-07

How did the programming business ever forget this?<br />I once worked for a company where one manager used &quot;craftsmanship&quot; as his vilest epithet. He truly wished that developers would be as interchangeable as wingnuts. He wasn't the one who assigned a power supply designer to e-mail maintenance, but he was close. It's no suprise that the company was bought not long after - by one of its own spin-offs!<br />Maybe it sounds old-fashioned, but this book is really about the moral statement that engineers make by signing their work. Doing a job well is not just a paycheck (though doing the job badly should be reason to lose that paycheck). It's a personal statement, and embodies the creator's values. Is it strong? Is it durable, in a world of changing requirements? Does it really keep working once the creator turns it over to a successor? Properly viewed, software development is part of the human interaction, between provider and purchaser or between co-workers. With corporate loyalty dead, as a working social force, the software industry needs new standards of behavior and social worth. I really think McBreen is on the right track.<br />The idea of apprenticeship is still strong today, especially in life- and safety-critical professions. Doctors serve their internships, and commercial passenger pilots spend a lot of time in the right seat. A few years back, a blaster's license in California required five years of apprenticeship. When software is in your pacemaker, antilock brakes, and even in a building's &quot;active compensation&quot; for earthquake, programming is in well into that same life-critical category. As he says, the best programmers really do serve unofficial apprenticeships (I know I did). The only problem is in making it visible and respectable.<br />I can't stand the cult of personality, but that's not what mastery of craft is about. It's about a sustainable, living culture of service, and of personal and professional excellence. Yes, tools like CMMI can help. Without a basic, personal belief in the value of one's work, reinforced by the work environment, they're just scraps of paper to push around.<br />McBreen is really writing about the cultural value of competence, and about creating more of it.

This book is about the computations that find the &quot;family trees&quot; based on molecular (or other) data.<br />The book is a goldmine. Among phylogeny programs, PHYLIP (supported since 1980) could well be the most popular - Felsenstein wrote it. In this, he covers an incredible number of techniques, drawn from dozens of fundamentally different insights into the problem of relatedness. Felsentein desribes many techniques, their variations, and their relationships to others. He describes every phase of the analysis, from interpreting raw data, through deducing trees and evaluating them statistically, to displaying them visually. Despite this book's thud factor - ove 600 pages - it can not cover every topic in full detail. That's when the book's references, about 50 pages of them, become valuable. Felsenstein welcomes the interested reader into every aspect of the field's literature.<br />Despite the huge body of theory and practice, there are still many disputes about the proper interpretations or approaches to some thorny issues. Felsenstein goes over the issues in some detail, and is not afraid to take sides when he sees reason to.<br />Felsenstein gives clear descriptions of many basic algorithms. There's no code here, but a diligent reader should be able to develop implementations of them. I could have hoped for better indexing of algorithms, but the chapter organization is clear enough to make any search brief. I could also have asked for more of the algorithms to be spelled out in implementable detail, but the book would have needed thousands of pages to include them all. He seems to have chosen a variety of well-known and important algorithms for full description, and left the minor or complex ones for the references.<br />If you just want to use one of the common phylogeny programs, you came to the wrong place. This is about fundamental techniques for creating programs - there's almost nothing here for the user who just wants the results. Such users won't even learn much more about the results they do get. Developers and statisticians who need detailed analyses will probably find what they they want, and lots more.<br />The only problem with the book is that it reads like an encyclopedia. Lots of developers can get lots of good work done without this level of knowledge. It will take a truly devoted reader to plow though it, as well as a good foundation in algorithm development and in probability and stats. If you are dedicated to becoming an expert in the practice and problems of phylogenetic analysis, though, I doubt that any other book will give you a third of the knowledge or a tenth of the breadth.ame to the wrong place.

His characters all seem to stare blankly into the distance. Maybe they're trying to remember somthing that seemed terribly important at the time, maybe they caught glimpses of something ominous out of the corners of their eyes. Maybe they just realized that something is horribly wrong, but no one knows what. I'm never sure whether to laugh out loud at his images or to start looking back over my own shoulder.<br />His penwork is as familiar to PBS &quot;Mystery!&quot; fans as to the Gorey hard-core. He uses color, occasionally, but only to set off the black and white drawings. His little stories approach, but never quite reach either disjointedness or the truly macabre. I'm not quite sure where to file this one, but it seems comfortable half-way between the comics and the fine art.<br />If you are determined to know what's going on, Gorey's work may not be for you - possibly, because Gorey never quite knew either.	2004-01-05

It's aim is to give a basic competence in the use of logistic regression, related techniques, and the software that deal with them. This, it does very well. By intent, it leaves many other needs unmet.<br />The format is 13 chapters, possibly representing the 13 or 14 weeks in a typical school term. Each chapter has a specific statement of teaching goals at the front, a summary outline of the course to date in the back, and a few pages of questions or exercises with answers. There appear to be sample data sets available, formatted for popular stats packages, but I did not figure out how they are made available. Within the main text of each chapter, every page reads like a blackboard lecture: equations on the left and narration on the right. The presentation uses a minimum of math, just a little algebra and exponentials in a few specific forms.<br />For the aspiring tool-user, this book may be worth a semester's tuition. I can fault it only for an annoying habit of writing out in words equations that appear on the same page (&quot;e raised to the power of the sum of products ... &quot;).<br />This book is NOT meant for people truly interested in the theory or practice of the exact computations. For example, its use of probability scarely mentions joint or conditional distributions. As a result, some of its formulas (e.g. p.48) come across as rote memorization, instead of natural expressions of the laws of probability. Lacking joint probability, the covariance matrix can not have meaning. It is just something produced, somehow, by an oracular computer program.<br />The repeated phrase, &quot;according to statisticians ...&quot; makes it very clear that statisticians are a breed distinct from intended audience. What they do is quite alien, but somehow, sometimes leaves the student with formulas to grind through.<br />Before you buy this book, be very clear about what you expect from it. Beginning students may get a lot from it.

When Lewis writes, the idea actually makes sense.<br />The book retells the Eden story, but one that went the right way. I was surprised at a few things in this book, including the eventual relationship between god and man on Lewis' other planet. I was also surprised at how completely Lewis focussed the story on the Eve figure and her dealings with the 'snake'. The Adam figure really never appeared until the last few pages, once she had been through the hard part.<br />It's hard to remember that this story was written almost 60 years ago, during World War II. Back then, the protagonist's physical conquest of evil probably had a very noble meaning. Today, it looks quite different when our hero whips himself into a religious frenzy, then batters another man to death, spending a day or more inflicting increasing levels of injury before bashing his face in with a rock. It is chilling to see the hero justify this by declaring the other human to be an 'Un-man', so not worth human consideration. It is even more chilling that he experiences less feeling at brutally murdering his one-time compatriot than at the taste of an unusual fruit, judging by the amount of text spent on each. I just can not read today's headlines and see the act as wholly virtuous.<br />On a more positive note, Lewis' apparent idea of sin does strike a chord with me. Given that evil is a different thing, one of the gravest sins in Lewis' world might be in the modern phrase, &quot;It's not my job,&quot; or worse yet, &quot;I don't get paid enough to do that.&quot; Many necessities are no one's job, but necessary nonetheless. No, there is no pay for many moral and requisite tasks - if anything, the doing may cost the doer dearly. Need and duty are the issues. Lewis barely wastes breath on the idea of fairness.<br />The book, of course, is a classic. Like so many, it must be read in the spirit in which it was written; modern values only corrupt its original intent. I like the book for itself, but I also appreciate the contrast it shows between Lewis' time and our own.ppreciate the contrast it shows between Lewis' time and our own.	2004-01-04

Of course, in Holt's world, the niceness becomes an overpowering miasma, sort of like the wall of perfume around that aunt you never liked. Young love, of course, is inept, tongue-tied, and utterly baffled, about the way it is in real life.<br />If you want a brief, amusing read, this could do the job for you.

The quality is there, for sure, but I have to wonder about how much is fiction.<br />The elements are all too familiar in real life. An eager young couple sets about raising a family, and succeeds far too well. They can not support their own ambitions, whether measured in dollar amounts or in units of work caring for the children. The fifth child embodies a tragic accident of birth, and the fragile sitation implodes.<br />I don't mean to trivialize Lessing's story - even when I saw what was coming, I was hypnotically compelled to see it through, like the proverbial bird in front of a snake. (I've also avoided spoilers as much as I can, so vagueness is intended.) Taken in literal terms, the story carries a gut-wrenching sensation that's much too close to life.<br />One step above literality, I parented a \\"fifth child\\", or tried to. It wasn't my own spawn; it had been cast out by it's natural parent, the one that hadn't bailed out long since. My concerns for the child were twice the usual: I had a duty to prepare the child for the world, but had a second duty of protecting the world from that child. (That unpleasant period didn't last, and I was truly relieved at its end.) I did not need to grant Lessing very much poetic license to see the fact in her fiction.<br />If I let the immediacy of memory die down, I can read the story at more metaphorical levels, too. I suppose that many parents have high hopes, before the reality of a pimply teenager sprawls on their couch. Outside of parenting, I know that I have undertaken tasks way beyond my capacity, with some silly faith that things would work out somehow. The more I rely on faith, the worse the outcome.<br />I understand that Lessing has written a sequel. To tell the truth, I don't think I have the stomach for it - and I mean that as a compliment. She is far too successful in invoking the dark spirits that resemble my personal demons, and no other author has ever come close.has ever come close.	2003-12-30

After just a day or two with this book and a compiler to play with, I had the level of skill that I wanted. The Verilog language description is just one chapter in this book, though, and not even the longest one.<br />This is lots more than just a language book. It also shows a higher level of design than most students see in their first few logic courses. The example developed in the book's later sections works up to a supersclar ARM processor core! This book is not about hooking up a few gates and latches. It actually starts to address problems of practical size and complexity. Big problems really are different from small ones, and I was very happy to see techniques for the larger systems.<br />That said, beginning logic designers may find the book frustrating. It works at a high conceptual level and fast pace. The author assumes that the reader already has good command of the basics of boolean logic, synchronous design, and computer architecture.<br />Initially, I just wanted a competent language description. I got that, plus some worthwhile design technique. Best of all, I did not have to sit through yet another lesson in the baby steps of logic design.	2003-12-30

It's also a wonderful classic.<br />Lewis lays out a stark set of characters: the amoral scientist, the money-grubbing capitalist, and our protagonist, a bit of a blank slate. As in H.G.Wells' Time Machine, our correspondent arrives in a land where different faculties of modern thought have been split into distinct species. The first is the literati, the poets. They are agrarians for a living, but exist for expression in the spoken (not written) word. They are also warm - by measured body temperature - and fuzzy. The next are almost an intelligentsia, but it turns out that their thoughts are all second-hand. They know about their world and about other wolds, but it seems that their instruments and insights were all given to them by agencies unspecified. This species, not surprisingly, is tall and pale - a walking ivory tower. Going beyond Wells' two-way split, we have a third sapient species: a combination of sculptor, engineer, and grovelling toad.<br />After that, the further divisions become more interesting. There are the eldil. They are very nearly invisible, and their voices can't always be heard. Wherever they appear, though, they carry the word and will of some superior being. There is also Oyarsa, the law of the world, but a unique and living being. Oyarsa is just the law of one world, though, and knows that there are other worlds and other laws. Finally, there is the undefined Maleldil, to whom all Oyarsa are subordinate.<br />Mankind, of course, is measured and found wanting. With Lewis' Christian orientation, though, it could be that human Original Sin is just a local aberration, caused by a defective Law that created our defective world. Lewis also makes it tempting to infer a hierarchy of seraphim and angels, below a planetary hierarchy of Oyarsan archangels. By distant inference, higher, galactic levels of hierarchy could also exist.<br />This is almost a morality play. Our hero is Ransom, held ransom against our species' good behavior. The miser is Devine [sic], perhaps by opposites. The amoral plunderer is Weston (western?). It reads well next to Piers Plowman, for example.<br />C. S. Lewis followed all the canons of good space opera. He also turned C. P. Snow's two worlds into two literal worlds. By today's standards, this is a slim volume.

There's a princeling, not yet of age, around whom the intrigues and fights for dominance center. McKillip turns these basics into a very readable, enjoyable fantasy.<br />There's enough left unsaid at every step to hold a reader's attention: what is that other city, the one without daylight?

I won't spoil the story by saying too much - there are many other questions to be answered before the book is over.<br />This book is clearly aimed at readers with more interest in the people involved, and less interest in weapons and combat.

It's like that, but with lots more people and doors that connect whole worlds.<br />Good silly fun - I enjoyed this one a lot.	2003-12-23

The author seems not to distinguish between opening a discussion and failing to finish a thought. The quantitative statements are sometimes incorrect - his decimal points seem to wander as much as the rest of the presentation.<br />Visually, the text is a mess. Maybe he wanted it to look lively and creative, instead of putting the life into the text itself. His typographic \\"creativity\\" tops out around the Crayola level, though. It's what I'd expect of someone who just discovered all those cool controls over fonts, sizes, layout, etc., but has not yet discovered they don't all need to be used on any one page. In fact, this typography interferes with a good reader's perceptual habits. I actually like aggressive use of type, like some of David Carson's - but Carson brings visual competence to the page.<br />The one graph (p.147) is uninformative even by USA Today standards. It would probably have Tufte spinning in his grave. (As far as I know, Tufte is alive as of this writing - that graph might well kill him.)<br />Toffler's 'Future Shock' needs continuous replacement, because the future keeps getting here and keeps being something we didn't expect. I'm glad to see people writing about the ever-changing future. I welcome thoughtful, communicative visual presentations. This book just doesn't give me either.	2003-12-20
859446:US	35004134	R1ZOGS2QB12H36	0802713483	159232292	Eniac: The Triumphs and Tragedies of the World's First Computer	Books	4	4	5	N	N	A cautionary tale	This is a brief, enjoyable history of possibly the first programmable, electronic computer (Colossus has its fans, but is less well known). It tells how Mauchly and Eckert together created something truly new in the world - something that, today, we could hardly live without. The historical research is good, the writing is very readable, and the inventors' prescience is almost beyond credibility. That is the first half of the book, a worthy but ordinary piece of the history of computing. The book's second half is where its true value lies.<br />The second half is filled with grasping incompetents, great men at their pettiest, conspiracy, and bizarre workings of so-called justice. It's about Mauchly and Eckert's trust in  the people around them, and in trust violated. It's about the engineer and the scientist, a little naive, trying to hold their own in a world that wants to take it from them.<br />It's about the ugly part of creativity's contact with greed for reputation and commercial success. It's scary.<br />This book was suggested to me by a startup entrepeneur, someone who clearly identified with the two inventors. Not much has changed since Mauchly and Eckert's time, except that the legal attacks are more likley and more rapacious. I'm not sure how to read this suggestion. It warns against real dangers of personality politics, but doesn't show any way to defend against those dangers.<br />It's a good book. I take parts of it very much to heart. Even if the story has no personal meaning for you, it's still a vivid bit of history, it talks about events within living memory, and it shows part of the twnety-first century's origin. I recommend it to any citizen of the modern world.	2003-12-19

Properly speaking, they are barely 'Sandman' stories: I think the Sandman makes just one cameo appearance. They're still good stories.<br />The format is familiar: strangers wait out a storm at an inn unfamiliar to all of them. They pass the time exchanging stories. OK, it's an old bottle, but Gaiman fills it with new wine. The stories range from the biographical to the fantastic and satiric.<br />The most mythic story, I think, takes place in the politics of a world much like modern America, or maybe 70s America. Mythology isn't about distant times, it's about grand heroes and their quests - I like to be reminded of that occasionally.<br />I usually read comics for the artwork first and writing second. The various artists in this book are all capable enough, but that's not what carries the book. I was quite happy to be pulled along by the story-telling.	2003-12-19

I use math and enjoy using it, but never really learned to love it for its own sake. In other words, this book wasn't written for me.<br />I work with combinatoric problems a fair bit, and hoped that sign-solvable systems (SSS) would be directly applicable to some of my work. I also look at questions where sloppy data prevent exact solutions - if a technique promises at least partial answers when precise answers aren't available, it has my interest. The SSS premise is that, in some cases, I can tell whether parts of my answer are positive, negative, or zero, knowing only whether the inputs were positive, negative, or zero. The simplified character of the questions and answers could possibly work well in special computing environments that I use. I really wanted to like this book and its content.<br />I just wasn't able to connect these abstractions to my real world, though. The focus of this book is on the abstract structures behind SSS, and on formal proofs about specific features of special cases.<br />This book does have a practical side. It specifies a number of algorithms for handling sign-solvable systems of various sorts. It would take a lot of effort to reduce these algorithms to practice, but the information is all there. As books of pure advanced math go, this one seems relatively clear and approachable.<br />Perhaps a more astute reader than me can connect SSS to problems of practical interest. Perhaps, some day, I'll take the time to work through this book in detail. These days, though, I can't spend a lot of time away from the problems I need to solve. Building up a working knowledge of SSS from this book would take intense effort. I really have to put my effort elsewhere.	2003-12-19

Its real strength is in the basic quantum mechanical principles that bind atoms and that cause molecualr interactions.<br />The authors carry this forward, using concise mathematics, to derive electron distributions and small-scale molecular conformations. The third chapter addresses conformations of larger molecules, starting with rigorous computations of each conformation's energy, then backing down to some approximation techniques. The fourth chapter packs in a number of concepts, prehaps too many: solvation, statistical mechanics, and a little bit of molecular mechanics. Chapter five skims over protein and DNA folding, and chapter 6 discusses small-molecule (drug) interactions with proteins.<br />Although the authors start the book noting the intense computational requirements, they never give explicit techniques for performing those computations efficiently. The math is the abstract form, close to the quantum mechanics, and rarely the form of a practical computation. In fact, the math is abstract enough that I'd be hard pressed to come up with real limits of integration in many cases. The authors make some effort to use their equations to support intuitive understanding, but sometimes focus too much on the formulas themselves instead of their meanings.<br />I can't fault the book for being written in 1995 - by the standards of computational chemistry, that's a bit dated now. Still, almost all of its references date from 1990 or earlier. They weren't the freshest even when the book was written.<br />The book does give a broad view, high-level survey of the quantum mechanical view of chemistry. It omits many more modern practices though: finite element approximations to molecule structure, grammar-based analysis of RNA folding, and Markov models for structure prediction. It also omits the knowledge needed to reduce abstract physics to practical calculations. Use this as an introductory survey, but use other books for knowledge you can put to work.knowledge you can put to work.	2003-12-17

They depict physical attraction and affection many ways, all of them charged with happy eroticism. I enjoyed the different focus each story had - some centered on women and some on men, some from a woman's sensibility's and some from a man's.<br />Suspension of disbelief is a must, but these stories are fiction after all. They are literate and thoughtful, not the 'organ recitals' of cruder authors. It's not necessary to like every one of the short stories - if one doesn't suit your taste, there's another one a few pages along.<br />Next time I need a vacation of just a few hours, I may spend it in another of Barbach's collections. I just hope it meets the standard that this books sets.	2003-12-14

This book is decidedly a mix: some very good information, combined with some very puzzling omissions and uneven editing.<br />First, the good. The description of stochastic context free grammars is the best I've seen. I don't know any other reference that even hint at how to use generative grammars to evaluate likelihoods. Once they caught my interest, though, the authors did not carry through with training and evaluation algorithms I could really use. I suspect that parts of the information are there, but I'll have to go back over their opaque notation again to work out just what they've given and just what's been left out.<br />This same pattern - an interesting introduction with missing or mysterious development - recurs throughout the book. The discussion on clustering and phylogeny goes the same way: a number of techniques are mentioned but not developed. The authors mention a tree drawing problem, not just building the tree's topology, but ordering the branches for the most informative rendering. Again, a critical topic and one that most authors miss - in the end, these authors miss it, too, by mentioning but not filling in the idea.<br />Their discussion of neural nets suffers badly from the authors' partial presentation. Evaluation of network output for a given input is relatively straightforward, and they present it in some detail. Training the net is the real problem, though, and is given less than a page.<br />Baldi and Brunak give more of the fundamentals than most authors. For example, they explain the maximum entropy principle well enough that I'll use it in lots of other areas. They give some coverage to topics of intermediate complexity, such as the forward and backward algorithms for HMM training. Finally, they fizzle out at the higher levels of complexity - the Baum-Welch algorithm could have followed from the forward and backward methods, but is left as a reference to another book.<br />There is some good here, especially in the fundamentals behind important techniques. The discussions I wanted - the more avanced topics, in forms I can use - are often weak, missing, or impenetrable. Just a bit more work, clearly within the authors' capability, would have made this a landmark reference.nd important techniques.

It's a dark alternative, but it's an alternative to an even darker reality.<br />This is another of Mack's lavish painted comics. To call it 'painted', though, is faint praise. Drawing, lettering in a few different hands, collage, painting - the visual layering and intensity are incredible. The story itself is stark, physically static the with dynamics all in Kabuki's mind. Somehow, Mack conveys and sustains that moment when even desperation fails.<br />Mack's images are filled with deconstructed text. My eye instinctively tries to read it all, but that would defeat the purpose of the imagery. On the other hand, ignoring it defeats the purpose of the writing. This is a book I'll come back to, to give it all the different readings it deserves.	2003-12-11

Not that it matters.<br />Whatever they say about &quot;the Golden Age&quot; of comics, I think that the 90s reinvented the medium. Printing process advanced enough to capture watercolor, pastel, and more painterly kinds of work. Remember the two-solid-color-plus-black of Dr. Seuss? That was a technological limit of the cost-effective printing processes available. Comics' &quot;golden age&quot; arose from that same printing technology. Whatever the merits of that time, visual subtlety was not on the list. When good, affordable color reproduction became real, it kindled a wildfire of visual expression.<br />Gaiman found the artists to match his vision, the artists found the printers to make it work, and Vertigo found the courage to put it into print. (It's still hard to believe that DC was so stodgy and Vertigo was DC.) The media, color scheme, and rendering style all tell parts of the story. I, for one, enjoy the way each artist's style shapes the narration.<br />The magic is real, by the way.  Enjoy the story. Wonder what comes next and what came before, and wonder what it really is that you see.	2003-12-10

Stekel covers everything, starting with selecting the probes and printing the arrays. Next comes raw array analysis - scanning, image processing, and measuring the effects of the array itself on the results. That covers the first six chapters. The next three go over analysis of the result, one more chapter covers experimential design, and the last chapter discusses storing, labelling, and sharing the data. Some of those topics, like experiment design, address issues that most other authors neglect.<br />Still, I came away feeling that I had read only half of each chapter. Going back, it turned out that I hadn't missed anything that really was there. I missed a lot, though. For example, probe selection includes a discussion of self-hybridization - good stuff. It stopped short of giving me any clear idea how much self-complementarity is too much. It mentioned DNA melting points, but without enough information for me to understand what is really melting, or how or why to choose one melting point over another. Handling of raw array data discussed Loess regression as a way to cancel out process differences across a single array. Again, it's good stuff, but what exactly is a Loess regression? Expression analysis mentions Spearman correlation as an alternative to Pearson correlation - it give Pearson's formulas, but not Spearman's. Later, when the author does give a &quot;formula&quot; for selecting sample sizes, it turns out to be some macro reference for some stat package. Throughout the book, I felt the same lack: I learned the names of many things, but not what they really are.<br />Maybe this book is OK for a first introduction. If you've had that introduction and want to take the second steps, this book probably won't meet your needs.	2003-12-08

It's clear and intuitive, but covers all the basics:<br />  -- chemical shifts for a variety of binding structures,<br />  -- the various isotopes,<br />  -- line-splitting and spin coupling,<br />  -- equilibria in chemical and physical state,<br />  -- Overhauser effect,<br />and lots more. In other words, it covers everything needed for more advanced analyses, but does it without dragging the reader through every wave function. Somehow, the author packs all that into fewer than 90 pages without making it all indigestibly dense.<br />To get the book's full benefit, you'll need some background in chemistry, including a little organic, and maybe some physics. You won't need a lot of either - the first or second college course in each should be enough. The treatment uses a little algebra, but not a lot in the direct line of its arguments. The real emphasis is on the basic phenomena: on the concepts of electron shielding, on effects of different kinds of bonding, and on interactions between magnetic nuclei.<br />This book won't make you an analytic chemist. It could help, though. The text is well-suited for a prepared novice. It's illustrated with simple and descriptive diagrams. If you need to get the basic ideas of analytic NMR, fast, this book may be the best around. Other books cover advanced topics like NMR for protein structure. Read this book first, like an introductory chapter, and you'll have a much easier time with those more complex discussions.<br />This much information at this price is an incredible deal - it has my highest recommendation.	2003-12-06

A great book describes all times. Most of this book is great, current and pertinent a century after its first edition.<br />I was glad to see a scientist describe science as a personal, passionate, maybe even religious act. He describes the progress of a life in science, from young researcher, to professional, teacher, and finally retiree. At every step, he describes the emotional, social, and even spiritual value of that stage of life. Best, he speaks from an acknowledged place within the world of science.<br />Only a few parts of this book seem dated. Many specifics of a biologist's education have changed, though some - like the Zeiss brand name - have not. Marie Curie notwithstanding, he assumed that men would generally make or direct the real contributions. Women mattered mostly as support for the husband, though he did note that educated and professional women might be the most understanding company.<br />What he says about scientists is equally true about serious artists - the dedication, intellectual honesty, and rewards are much the same. His examples are nearly all drawn from the sciences, though. That may prevent artists from seeing themselves in his descriptions and prescriptions.<br />This book is true inspiration. I can't wait to pass it along.	2003-12-06

There is a loose connection from the un-named master of dreams, through a cat, a minor goddess, an elfin king, and an angst-ridden female Metamorpho. (That's a 60s comic character, one I had to look up.)<br />Gaiman's stories are always good, and these are no exception. Vess' art is uniquely well-suited to the Midsummer Night's Dream - maybe not to the play, but certainly to the audience. His slender lines can be as fragile as hair or sharp as a razor's edge, all within one panel. The other artists, also good, follow their own visions in telling Gaiman's stories.<br />It's a comic. I can't take it too seriously, even though I've been reading Vess since Star*Reach. It's good, though, and I'll be coming back for more - lots more.	2003-12-02

That depends on the structure of your problem, and is up to you. This book helps with the second step: figuring out what set of values for that distribution's parameters give the best fit to your data.<br />It was certainly interesting to see least squares regression derived using ML, instead of the usual geometric interpretation. It was quite worthwhile to see a mutual dependence metric that works when normal &quot;correlation&quot; doesn't. It also broadened my view, a little, to see standard linear and non-linear solution techniques in a different notation than usual.<br />As you can see by the breadth of topics in this slim (82-page) book, the author covers a good bit of territory tangential to ML - in a larger book, that could have turned into a serious organization problem. About 10 of the book's pages give sample code in the Gauss language. That language isn't in the main stream of engineering computing, but a Matlab or Mathematica user can read it easily enough.<br />I did learn a few useful things from this book - I won't be giving it away. It probably won't suit either the beginner in statistics or the specialist, though. If you're in the middle, like me, it has modest value.	2003-12-01

They imagine that everyone responds fully to their surveys, and that every experiment yields legible results. Oh, for such a simple world.<br />Allison deals with the harsh reality of incomplete data sets. The book starts with a brief description of techniques that drop incomplete data from analysis. The large majority of the book, however, discusses ways to fill in the blanks.<br />The author rightly points out that &quot;imputation&quot;, or creating  values to replace what's missing, is not to be taken lightly. He gives techniques, each suited to the statistical character of some set of problems, and each matched to some technique for analysis. The mathematical goal is to create proxy values that won't upset the outcome of analysis.<br />That is quite a bit different from finding values that represent reality. Even though imputation is supposed to be mathematically innocuous, faking experimental data seems almost immoral to me. My data sets are about as dirty as any around. Also, they have the opposite of usual form: instead of a few dozen measurements on large numbers of samples, they have thousands of measurements on relatively few individuals. I have not convinced myself that Allison's manipulations are valid in this case. I would have been grateful for more discussion of techniques for stepping around the dropouts, and for statistically deciding whether I can ignore them.<br />Still, this book has worthwhile content. It's brief, clear, and informative about a very important topic. I will refer back to it, but maybe not the way the author intended.	2003-12-01

And, like all true classics, it paints a picture very much like some women of today.<br />The book is not organized as a story, or even as a particularly strong description of events. Instead, it's a first-hand description of moments that roused especially strong feelings, positive or negative. Nijo (not her born name, but the only name that has come down to us) wrote this book late in life, so the literal truth of events often seems layered under decades of nostalgia. The first passage, for example, takes pains to draw a teenage girl, tearful during her first nights in the emperor's bedroom. 'The lady doth protest too much' - that is about the last time we see her hesitate in accepting a man's overnight company.<br />After her heyday in court society, Nijo retreats and finally takes vows as a nun. She takes the robes and duties of nun in full, but her thoughts never settle into that role. I don't mean to say that she in insincere. Still, a part of her never lets go of the happy times in court. Although she carries out her religious duties, she keeps coming back for another look at the people and rites she loved. Gradually, the people from her youth move away and pass away. The court was all she knew; in the end she doesn't know even that any more. It's like the woman whose greatest day was being prom queen. Now in her forties, she lives by remembering a time and place that doesn't remember her.<br />Nijo conveys a pervading shallowness. She spends more time describing some outfits than the children she bears. She could have moved closer to the inner imperial circles; the retired emperor publicly acknowledged her first-born as his scion. Nijo never had aspirations so high, or never realized what could have been open to her. She was content for the child to be brought up elsewhere while her life drifted on as before.<br />The irony of the final sentence may be the happiest moment in the book. &quot;...

There is no real point to this book, but that is part of its charm. It is just a look at one woman's world and at the woman herself.t in the book. &quot;...

This one carries its weight, though, and maybe a bit more.<br />The first section gives the clearest and most detailed description of nucleotide sequence comparisons I've seen. I'm no biologist, but it really got me thinking about some new ways to talk about substitution matrices.<br />The bulk of the book covers what I hoped for originally: phylogenetic trees. The authors choose an unusual approach - it doesn't quite meet the authors' initial promise of math-minimization, but doesn't climb too far up the ivory tower, either. I find it a very practical, usable level of presentation. I'd be nervous about going beyond their formulas, since the math for real understanding isn't all there. Still, the phylogeny discussion covers a lot of material, and covers it well enough for me to write programs about most of it.<br />The final section addresses population genetics. I have nothing against population genetics, it just never seemed to point where I'm headed. Nei and Kumar corrected my mis-impression. Population gentics is the background model, the null hypothesis, behind the functions that score population differences. It really shows what happens when the tree of life branches out.<br />The book has some minor weaknesses. It emphasizes nucleotide sequences at the expense of peptides; I can't fault an author for writing what they want as opposed to what I want. On page one, the authors decline an intensely mathematical approach. By page 25, they're up to Poisson and gamma distances. The typography make the section breaks into a &quot;Where's Waldo&quot; experience. Nei's favorite author, based on citations, is Nei. Well, false modesty is no virtue. This book seems authoritative and Nei seems to be an authority, maybe not just in Nei's opinion.<br />This book really has given me a lot more to work with than most.

It's stiff and formal, as you might expect of a guide to proper behavior. It was meant to guide young men of the warrior class in an era when war was a fading memory. Even in its day, somewhere around 1700AD, during the Tokugawa era, it was probably a bit old-fashioned.<br />For all that, Shigesuke's advice is remarkably applicable to modern society. Things like loyalty to an employer have almost gone out of style. Today's employers are different, but some employees need the reminder that a paycheck imposes obligations on the receiver. The advice about treating one's wife with courtesy is painfully up to date, as counter-examples in every day's news will show. The idea of maintaining professional skills, even when not immediately needed, is still quite current. So are the needs for basic skills in social setting and for basic education.<br />I am not a student of martial arts. I am a participant in today's business world.

Kamo-no-Chomei starts the book with recollections of a series of disasters that struck Kyoto in the late twelfth century: fire, plague, famine, and more. The descriptions are personal and vivid. The near-poetic form of the writing puts intense feeling behind the words. Although Chomei wrote many years after the events, his grief and horror came through as very fresh.<br />The second part of the book describes Chomei's gradual withdrawal into solitary monasticism. The string of successively less grand homes ends in his famous 'ten square foot hut.' He was not strictly a hermit, but seemed mostly content with a small and simple kind of life. I was especially moved by his descriptions of time spent with a small boy. It brought to mind the end of Hesse's Glass Bead Game.<br />It would be easy to write a review longer than the work itself, so let me finish with a few words about the translation. The text is readable, elegant, and unaffected, quite an achievement for a book of this sort. The historical footnotes add real insight to the text, they are not just academic filler. It won't take long to read this book, but I promise time well spent to the thinking reader.	2003-11-22

The authors come back to it a number of times as they introduce new variations on the string-matching theme. They give about the clearest description of the Needleman-Wunsch and basic variants (including Smith-Waterman) of any book I know.<br />The bulk of the book is devoted to Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), as one might have guessed in a book with Eddy as co-author. It covers the basics of model construction, motif finding, and various uses for decoding. Again, it covers all the basics so clearly you'll want to start coding as soon as you read it.<br />The later sections of the book cover phylogeny and tree building, along with the relationships to multiple alignment. Good, solid, clear writing prepares the reader for texts that may be more specialized, but possibly less transparent.<br />The next-to-last chapter, on RNA folding, is weaker than the ones before, in my opinion. It ties to the other chapters reasonably well in terms of algorithms, but I don't think it does justice to the thermodynamic models of RNA folding. If there is any weakness in this chapter, though, it does not detract from the strengths elsewhere.<br />The final chapter, the &quot;background on probability&quot;, is the one that I think needs the most support. If you don't already understand its topics, I doubt that this will help very much. (If you do understand them, you won 't need the help.) There's nothing inherently tricky about probability, but individual distributions carry many assumptions, and I did not see those spelled out well.<br />This shouldn't be the only book in your bioinformatics library. If you really want algorithms, though, it's a good book to have in the collection and one you'll keep coming back to.	2003-11-22

What is unusual is his approach, and the specific targets of his barbs.<br />'Court', by the way, seems to have the sense of 'Imperial Court' rather than 'Court of law'. Animals of the several kinds meet, and Shoeki creates clear precedence among the lords and under-lords, the generalissimo (I wish I knew what word led to that translation), and all the other ranks within each kingdom. Shoeki establishes the proper role for animals of each type - including the roles of predator for the larger and prey for the smaller. The humor lies in showing how behavior proper to an animal is quite unsuitable for a human, no matter how common it may be.<br />The whole story is backed by hundreds of years of folklore about each animal, combined with alchemical beliefs about the five elements (fire, air, water, metal, and wood), plus a huge mythology or philosophy of Shokei's own. The story was written in the 18th century. Scientific thought was well established in Europe back then, but seems not to have been as strong in Japan of that day. The contrast is fascinating, even if Shoeki is not an accurate representative of his time.<br />Most interesting, though, was Shokei's choice of targets. Shinto priests came under fire. Buddhists of the half-dozen major schools took more of his sarcasm, as did doctors. Shokei outdid himself, though, in repainting Confucius, Mencius, Lao Tzu, and Chuang Tzu as criminals against the proper humnan spirit, as parasites on society, and as breeders of other human parasites. Other historical masters are less well-known to Western readers, but suffered the same fate at the hands, paws, wings, and fins of Shokei's menagerie.<br />As I said, I wonder about parts of the translation. I also wonder whether Shokei had trouble sustaining his initial writing energy. Each chapter is shorter than the one before and, I think, less sharply written. Still, the book as a whole is delightful. The commentary within is interesting, but the 18th century social and scientific Japanese thought behind the book is what really held my interest.as a whole is delightful.

It's not a Sandman story. (OK, I came in late. Everyone else read Sandman long ago.)<br />That passed fast. Everything about this book is amazing. Big things first: The art, the reason I picked it up, shows very advanced craftsmaship. The pictures are built from striking elements, composed well, and worked heavily. Everything is fair game: figure, watercolor, found objects, photography, ... all of it. I like Nick Bantock and I like the best of David Mack. Bantock overdoes sometimes, and gives a muddy image. Mack doesn't always reach the real limits of the medium. McKean does not suffer either flaw, except sometimes with type. Words can not capture the images.<br />On a lower plane, the book itself is wonderful composition. These are small things, but they matter to me: the printing, the book design, and the page layout all bolster the imagery. The physical book is heavy, glazed paper; it has substance in my hand. The whole book is consistent: description on the left page, cover art on the right. Once that rhythm is set, there is room for wide variation. I will not mistake the sketches, negatives, and notes for the cover art, though. Comments left, covers right. Anything else can vary.<br />Within the lefthand commentary, there is yet more discipline. The artist and writer alternate in their own voices, and rubrics describe the materials and provenance of the art. Fonts and column position on the page change, even overlap. The visual structure is so clear, though, that the overlap is not interference; the mix of fonts is message, not mess. The rest of the page is open to any format, as long as I know how to extract the meaning.<br />I was disappointed at first - well, I'm wrong a lot. If you like an artist's monograph and like the first-person commentary, it's a good bet that you will like this. Whether you do or not, I do.	2003-11-19

The first is strong visuals - good drawing, deep imagery, skill with materials, composition, and lots more.<br />The second is optional if #1 is good enough: story. David Mack gives everything. The story is good, in a Femme Nikita Japonaise Noveau kind of way. The art is all I look for. It is dense - many marks carry different parts of the narrative. It is skilled - watercolor, pen, photo, I lost track of the amount of process that goes into each page. Text, imagery, and typography interact without clear bounds. There's just so much that I can't remember it all, so I have to it over and over. (That's a good thing.)<br />Not for kids, but not everything has to be. Not 'adult' either. Just really good. At least, I think so.<br />One small warning: not all of Mack's Kabuki books sustain this level of visual intensity. If that is your reason for buying a book, this one's good. Only some of Mack's Kabuki books conduct this much power. Well, he's only human.	2003-11-19

Maybe today isn't really different from all the other days in all the other years. As I read this book today, though, it speaks directly to today's triumphs of self-serving word-play over honesty and sanity.<br />Lessing's point is scarcely exaggeration: the intangible faculty of reason is subject to contagious disease, just as the physical body is. The first part of this book is a case study of a particularly acute and severe attack of rhetoric. Though not scientific, it gives enough detail for you to recognize the ailment when you see it yourself (and you will). Except for the details of topic, that poor sufferer's rantings could have come from yesterday's TV news.<br />Although I found the first half of this book very strong and clear, I felt that it weakened towards the end. The trial, prosecution of a culture instead of a person, barely sustained the thesis. I found the final passages of the book frankly disappointing, given its promising start.<br />In spite of the book's weaknesses, I find it very worthwhile. I will probably find it worthwhile and up to date when I read it again, years from now - although timely, this topic is timeless. Even more, it makes a satisfying companion to Lessing's other 'Canopus' books. I recommend it.	2003-11-15

The observations on people and their manners sound a little old-fashioned, but still applicable.<br />At another level, this book is credited with the first clear statements of esthetic principles that guide modern Japanese design. The translator's footnotes show how it draws on works from Confucius, Lao Tzu, and other Chinese classics in building a uniquely Japanese text. I believe the translator missed an allusion to Chuang Tzu in essay number 42, but that does not detract from the generally high quality of scholarship in this presentation. This is a remarkable, first-person statement of the sources of Japanese culture.<br />Finally, these essays are uniquely products of their place and time.

I have only a general background in science, but hoped I could pick up an outsider's knowledge of the basics.<br />This book has been helpful. Any problems are in my own preparation for reading it, not in the book itself. This dives straight in at the deep end, going over the quantum mechanics of spin-coupled nuclei. Given that base, it follows an orderly path through the menagerie of biomolecules. That starts with structures of single proteins, even in cases where they can't be crystallized. The discussion includes a number of brief case studies of specific proteins. Next, it covers enzymes in bound and unbound states, also in terms of case studies. This section makes clear some of NMR's advantages over other techniques: cryological studies of intermediate states, in vivo studies, and information from light-isotope tagging. The following section discusses DNA at length. I guess that interest in RNA secondary structure entered the main stream after this book was published - more discussion of RNA structure would have been helpful. This section also addresses DNA/drug interactions, a topic of clear interest. The chapter ends with a short discussion of saccharides and glyoproteins. This is an area that I keep my eye on. Sugar chemistry is more complicated than DNA or proteins - it can be non-linear, for one thing - and just as important in a functioning organism. (Because of polysaccharides' complexity and indirect connection to genetic molecules, they are not well studied. I look for this to change in coming years.) The next section follows logically: protein interactions with lipids, as found in cell membranes and virus interactions.<br />The book's content is very rich - a bit too rich for me, in truth. I usually pick up technical information pretty quickly. I struggled with this book, though, and just didn't have time to get the full value from many sections. I imagine this book will be essential to serious NMR chemists. I'm still looking for a more digestible introduction.imagine this book will be essential to serious NMR chemists.

That was the landmark period after Maxwell and before special relativity. I was fascinated to read this snapshot from such an exciting era in scientific thought.<br />This first-person view is set in the era when the all-encompassing ether was still considered seriously. People had recent memory of debates about whether electrons were real. There was no unification of rays from uranium and radium with cathode rays, x-rays, and ultraviolet.<br />The intellectual seeds of modern science had been sown, though. Experiments with ultraviolet foretold Einstein's photoelectric effect. Lorentz had already stated some of the invariants that led to relativity. Probability was just entering mainstream scientific thought, preparatory to statistical mechanics, quantum theory, and Heisenberg.<br />As Poincare covers the science of his day, he does so in the style of his day. He is quite unashamed in describing the British scientific temperament as boldly intuitive, but informal and sometimes spotty. By contrast, he describes the French as rigorous and inclusive, although maybe a bit too staid. Not just the science, but the social attitudes of the day come through in the pleasant little book. If you study the history of science and are partial to primary sources, I recommend this highly.	2003-11-07

This book worked well enough, for students who didn't need real analog analysis.<br />Despite its title, this is a more of a \\"First Course\\" in discrete signals and systems. It does not, in fact, derive much at all from first principles. The Nyquist sampling theorem, for example, not proven but taken as a premise.<br />If you want a quick view (or review) of digital signals and filter design without having to plod through proofs knee-deep, this might work for you - it works for me.

Solo homework assignments may be due in two weeks - projects with tens of people may be due in two years. Classwork typically teaches technical skill. Real projects demand organizational skills for moving a volatile roster of team members towards a single goal.<br />Braude's book tries to bridge that gap. The book is clearly meant for a classroom, and is built around a term-long team project. It drives home the point that a project is bigger than any one person. Its documentation is what holds it together and gives it continuity. What's written down is the project's memory.<br />This is where computing professionals step ahead of the children. Face it: programming is the fun part, and project documentation is not. The paycheck is not for play-time, though. Grown-ups understand their responsibilities to their employers, to their teams, and to their project's future. This book helps instil that understanding.<br />Braude's text uses the IEEE software documentation standards as the basis for project organization. It's easy to nit-pick the that huge, dry body of standards - I've done so myself. Still, they are the product of long thought and experience, and they provide a complete, well-tested framework. Braude summarizes that corpus of standards, and makes it clear that hair-splitting compliance is not useful. Instead, the standards act as a checklist, making sure that no major points are forgotten. Practitioners can then add or omit as needed, based on knowledge their projects' needs.<br />For its intended purpose, I can't imagine any book being much better. As an extra, Braude gives a sample project and other class materials at the publisher's web site. I've had real success teaching from this book. Toward the end of the term, one student declared himself a convert and said the standards were &quot;worth their weight in gold.&quot;	2003-11-06

Somehow, though, they never come together to form a coherent whole.<br />Most chapters read like essays, meant to stand on their own. That means that many chapters repeat introductory material already covered, and remake points already made. Yes, I appreciate that silver staining does not properly represent the whole range of protein expression levels. I do not appreciate the need to stat that three or four times.<br />Despite its &quot;Introduction&quot; title, the author seems to forget what a novice will need to learn. For example, there's a discussion of isoelectric focussing for protein separation. That includes mention of the technique's history, and why it used to have reproducibility problems. I never did see an exact description of what the techique actually is or how it works, though. Likewise, the author describes a number of important software packages used in proteomics. There are no screen shots, though, comparisons of capabilities, details of usage, or even references for letting me find out more on my own.<br />When I got to the the end of this book, I wanted to go back and review a few points. Because of the generally poor organization, it was always a struggle to figure out just which discussion covered the topics I wanted.<br />Other books cover almost all of this title's content, and do so more clearly. I suggest that the interested reader keep on looking.	2003-11-04

This book was it.<br /><br />Although brief, it is thorough and well-organized. The first two chapters are mostly an introduction. Chapter 1 states the problem being solved. The next chapter briefly introduces older technologies, including chemical techiques and 60s-80s mass spec technique. The next two chapters summarize modern mass spec hardware, then start to show how proteins behave in the environment inside the instrument. That gives the fundamentals of protein sequencing: how the molecules break down, and how the fragments help recreate the molecule. The authors go through a few examples in detail, starting from a mass spectrogram and moving forward to sequence. I was especially impressed by the examples that fail. Mass spec analysis is not a magic wand for producing sequences, it is a deductive process, and can not complete an analysis when clues are missing or ambiguous.<br /><br />The next three chapters are not about mass spec directly. Instead, they discuss how samples are prepared for analysis. This includes the clearest, most informative description of gel electrophoresis that I've seen, along with features of gel chemistry that do or do not interfere with mass spec measurements. This includes a discussion of protein digests, enzymatically produced fragments, and their place in analysis. I would have liked a little more discussion about combining information from digests produced by different enzymes, but no book can cover everything.<br /><br />The last three chapters extend the discussion of analysis, working upwards from fragments to complete protein sequences. The three chapters respectively address three topics: using standard internet databases for recognizing fragments of known proteins, using combinations of strategies to analyze novel proteins, and using mass spec to identify post-translational modifications. That last one suffers from brevity; perhaps it was only meant to define a problem that deserves a whole book of its own.<br /><br />Despite its throughness, the authors resist the urge for boggling detail. They present detail up to the point needed for understanding the mechanism and meaning of their topics, then stop. Lots of other writing would benefit from that kind of restraint.<br /><br />I came away from this book well-informed, and ready to address specific topics in greater detail.

They seemed born with knowledge of themselves and their visible environment. With Canopus' teaching, they were developing as a culture, strengthening their social structures and integrating new knowledge into their world-view. They knew that their whole people had a future planned among the stars, as citizens of star-spanning society.<br />Then their sunny, warm planet started to chill. Within a generation, tropical landscape became snowscape everywhere on the planet. Conditions changed so that the promise of their future could not be kept.<br />It takes some time for the stage to be set properly, but I think this where the real story begins. It is about a people struggling to adapt to increasingly harsh truths presented by the world around them. As conditions worsen, they harden themselves to successively more drastic steps that must be taken to survive. That, I think, is the tragedy of this story: the determination to survive, knowing that the only way goes against all that ever mattered to them. It is about the personal cost of sustaining faith and hope in the face of crushing realities.<br />More than the others in Lessing's Canopus series, I find this book ambiguous. It is as well written and well paced as the others, and it conveys the same serenity and certainty. This book, however, addresses especially complex issues. I do not share the view that Lessing expresses. I don't have to, though, to appreciate this as a remarkable, personal expression.	2003-10-31

This is an introductory guide to scientific photography. The text will work for a novice as well as a photographer experienced in other kinds of images.<br />Above all, this is a book about communication - about visual presentation of knowledge. In a chapter of his own, the book's designer makes it clear that the book itself is an example of visual communication.<br />Perhaps some people think that art and science are somehow opposed to each other.

This book did the job admirably.<br />Roughly the first half concentrates on the physics and chemistry(!) of MS, although there is a quick tour into protein sequencing early on. Gradually, the book's later chapters switch over to more explicit discussion of biomolecules, proteins in Ch. 10 and RNA/DNA in ch11. I was tempted to jump ahead.<br />I was very glad I stayed the course. Every beginning physics student knows that there's no such thing as a \\"measurement\\". It's really an interaction between the measurement tool and the material under test, in some environment - a fact that people tend to ignore. This fact is central to mass spec: the tool and the way it's used have critical consequences for the measurements that come out.<br />The first three chapters cover the plumbing and physics of the instruments. Chapters four through nine talk more about the many ways of preparing the ions measured by the mass spectrometer: radioactive decay products, electon beams, lasers of many colors, and more. Each energy source has a different effect on the sample, and different effects on different samples. Modern techniques dilute the sample material in a liquid or solid matrix. That's another variable: reactions between the sample and matrix, depending on energy source. Even the inert gases chosen for the instrument's interior atmosphere can change the results of a measurement.<br />I would have thought all these reactions were incidental annoyances, unintended degradation of the real sample. Quite the opposite. Reactions with the energy source and matrix define the kinds of chemical features that can be deduced from the MS. They are part of the analytic tool suite. For example, proteins, with generally weak UV absorption, can be handled one way. Nucleotides, with strong UV absorption, need other techniques.<br />Chapter ten says the most to a biologist. It goes into some detail describing what mass spec can say about proteins. The first thing in most people's minds will be protein sequence: the list of amino acids, and the order in which they occur. MS, with proper help from chemistry, handles that question well.<br />Other factors affect protein behavior at least as much. Insulin, a protein, can be harvested from animal sources for human use because it lacks sugar side chains. It is almost unique: other proteins fail as human medicines because, not because the animal amino acids are incompatible, but because the sugar side chains are too un-human.<br />MS deals quite directly with these sugar chains, as well as other chemical tweaks that have biological meaning. In fact, MS may be the most effective tool now in use for analyzing the sugar chains. This book isn't a lab manual, but gives the reader a general idea of the kinds of answers to expect from MS.<br />The last real chapter, DNA sequencing, decidedly dates the book (1997). DNA has too many chemical quirks to work well; MS can handle strings only a few tens of bases long.

I'm no MS specialist and never will be, but this met my needs very well.g what mass spec can say about proteins. The first thing in most people's minds will be protein sequence: the list of amino acids, and the order in which they occur. MS, with proper help from chemistry, handles that question well.<br />Other factors affect protein behavior at least as much. Insulin, a protein, can be harvested from animal sources for human use because it lacks sugar side chains. It is almost unique: other proteins fail as human medicines because, not because the animal amino acids are incompatible, but because the sugar side chains are too un-human.<br />MS deals quite directly with these sugar chains, as well as other chemical tweaks that have biological meaning. In fact, MS may be the most effective tool now in use for analyzing the sugar chains. This book isn't a lab manual, but gives the reader a general idea of the kinds of answers to expect from MS.<br />The last real chapter, DNA sequencing, decidedly dates the book (1997). DNA has too many chemical quirks to work well; MS can handle strings only a few tens of bases long. The authors hope the MS would been the sequencing tool of choice has been overtaken by technology.<br />In short, the book is a great intro to mass spec, and has a very effective focus on biological questions.

It actually comprises a group of specifications covering thousands of pages. Without some guide, a beginner can get lost in the forest of detail.<br />This book is the best guide I've seen so far. It covers all of the major kinds of graphical notation - over a dozen - that UML uses for describing systems and software. The first part book follows a clear, logical path from the original exploration of requirements, into basic, static design of program elements, and on to the dynamic behavior of software and the systems built around it. UML isn't just about software - it's about meeting real human needs using complex systems.<br />One strength here is that the authors show Java-based examples of wht the UML notations really mean. That has always caused difficulty for beginners - which Java language constructs are the 'right' representations of UML specifications? The answer has ambiguities, but the authors show some ways to create a proper correspondence.<br />The later parts of the book describe successively higher levels of system representation, as supported by the UML. They show how design patterns look in proper UML - a real help, since the best DP books predate modern UML. The authors also demonstrate how UML can be extended to meet new needs, or to represent fine, application-specific levels of detail.<br />I admit to mixed feelings about extensions to the standard. In some ways, extensions are necessary. I have found even basic class diagrams desperately in need of extension - when they address my program design issues at all, they immediately lock in details of implementation that should have been left open. On the other hand, an extension to the standard is, by definition, non-standard. Extensions almost automatically violate UML's goal of uniformity and shared ways of expressing shared concepts. Perhaps I need to see more real-world examples of successful extensions.<br />The final chapters of the deal with the fundamental concepts needed to make UML work properly: the Model Driven Architecture and broad script for using UML within that paradigm.<br />Although the authors do a good job of presenting the material, this part of the UML spec is where I have my strongest reservations. I'll agree that analysis and architecture are different from programming, and probably deserve different ways to express their concepts. I certainly agree that all of the different ways to view a system need coherency and cross-validation. My notation should be my servant, though, not my master. Forcing myself into the mold of a person for whom UML works is painful and unproductive. If the notation is so complex that it can only be used within elaborate tool suites, I wonder how well it will accept the sets of tools that I already use. Can I really get UML tools to integrate with Mathematica, Java, Word, VHDL, and source control? If not, then they do not really work with my system. I know, my combinations of tools are idiosyncratic, but other development environments use tool combinations at least as complex. Finally, if UML requires such tool support, does it really meet my needs as a mere human?<br />UML is real, it has wide value and acceptance in the industry. This book, from the OMG press, comes straight from the UML standards body. I recommend it as a good way to start with most of UML's features, almost an index to the reams of OMG standards documents. I advise the reader to approach UML carefully, though: use it to support your design needs, don't subjugate your design to it.deal with the fundamental concepts needed to make UML work properly: the Model Driven Architecture and broad script for using UML within that paradigm.<br />Although the authors do a good job of presenting the material, this part of the UML spec is where I have my strongest reservations.

The form of the story is a first-person journal, written in a deliberately academic tone.<br />The content, though, is one person's total change of her place in her world. The writer's initial view looks down on the world around her, as filled with inferior beings. After some time and much confusion, she learns to look up towards the higher qualities she might aspire to.<br />The crucial moment in the book may be the phrase, &quot;They should be treated as they treat others.&quot; Of course, the author (at that point) can not say &quot;I should be treated ...&quot; From then on, the author's broadening of view accelerates. Lessing may romanticize personal advancement, but is brutally honest about the costs that it can entail.<br />Lessing carefully paces the book to end at the highest point of the story. It's a pleasant change from authors who run out of things to say 50 or 100 pages before reaching the back cover. A small accident of history mars the book only slightly. Many years after the book was written, a new sleep medication was put on the market: Ambien, the name Lessing coincidentally assigned her protagonist. This book has a few slow moments, when that accident of name seemed apt. Still, this is an excellent book for unhurried reading.	2003-10-20

Some people never learn anything else. This is by that Waterman. Although written in 1995, it still has some of the best discussion I've seen on the topics it addresses.<br />The first few chapters deal with the &quot;digest problem,&quot; reconstructing a DNA or protein sequence from the fragment sizes of enzyme digests. The technique is not used as much now as it was then, but it's always good to know the background of modern techniques.<br />The digest problem doesn't stand alone, though. It introduces concepts - islands, anchors, etc. - that still matter. The problems in reconstructing molecules from digests yield the same kinds of intermediate results and the same ambiguities that arise in modern sequencing. As Waterman advances the discussion, shotgun sequencing appears as a logical extension, at least mathematically, of digest assembly.<br />Sequence assembly involve end matching, perhaps in the presence of sequencing errors. That introduces the topic for which Waterman's name is famous, approximate string matching. The next few chapter progress through dynamic programming and multiple alignments. The logical connections between the techniques shown are so tight that chapter boundaries are almost artificial. It was a real pleasure to see the computational and practical relationships laid out.<br />The final topics, RNA structure and phylogenetic trees, lack the continuity that characterized the first dozen chapters. The RNA structure may be the weakest chapter in the book, but still a very competent introduction.<br />Throughout, Waterman emphasizes mathematical rigor without insisting on uninformative theorems. Every topic is presented in rich detail, with special attention to scoring and background models. Perhaps there are newer discussions of some topics. I don't know of any clearer discussions, though. Best, I think, is how Waterman prepares the reader to ask all the right questions in any future discussion: what are the elements of the computation, how can elements be recombined, how good is a result, and how does the result stand out from the statistical background.<br />The final chapter is what a bibliography should be. It doesn't just list authors, titles, and dates of publication. It actually discusses the contribution that each source made to this book. Rather than leave the reader to wander aimlessly among obscure titles, Waterman shows which sources are most informative on which topics. I wish more authors took the time for such commentary.<br />This is a book worth having. It covers topics that I haven't seen elsewhere, and shows how many different topics relate to each other. It is rigorous without giving distracting detail. Most of all, it keeps the biology in sight of all calculations. Some authors seem to forget that anything exists but the arithmetic; Waterman puts the math clearly in the service of its subject. I enjoyed it immensely, and look forward to applying its content in my own research.estions in any future discussion: what are the elements of the computation, how can elements be recombined, how good is a result, and how does the result stand out from the statistical background. <br />The final chapter is what a bibliography should be.

I was very pleased that a fresh reading lived up to that memory.<br />On its surface, it examines the roles of men and women, represented by two estranged, neighboring Zones. The first is pastoral, prosperous, and ineffective. The second is harsh, militaristic, and also ineffective. The two are not really reunited, but they break their polarization and isolation. Peaceful exchange between them is restored, and both are healthier for it.<br />Saying anything more would be saying too much. I was interested, though, that the nations seemed to imitate the mating of their ambassadors. One nation was archetypically male, the other female. The ambassadors, like germ cells, are living things that pass from one nation to the other, and are united. I never though about it before, but fertilization is destructive both sperm and ovum, even if somthing new comes from the fusion. The protagonists, the envoys of the two Zones, similarly suffer for the greater future. Other metaphors emerge from the story, too, and some may have strong personal meaning for you.<br />I really can't do justice to the elegance and peaceful pace of Lessing's writing. That, you'll have experience for yourself. Although this book is second in a series of five, they can be read in any order. Each book's story is unrelated to the others, but the set as a whole is far more than the concatenation of its parts. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do, and eventually enjoy coming back to it again.	2003-10-13

Respect comes for reasons, though, and this book shows many good reasons for respecting this educator and her co-author.<br />This would be a good book for a second or third course in comptuer science. Even so, seasoned pros should take this book seriously. The reader is assumed to be familiar with basic programming and data structures. The reader is also assumed to be familiar with Java -  &quot;development in Java&quot; means that Java is the vehicle, not the topic being taught.<br />Techniques in this book are a level above the most concrete. It's premise is that any piece of code must be viewed in many different ways; right and wrong answers are the least of it. The book starts with a simple but rigorous set of commenting conventions - it makes one wish for a truly rigorous programming language. For each method, one specifies its prerequisites or assumptions, the set of objects with state chaged by the method, and the specifics of the change being made. The authors focus clearly on ambiguous specification at this level; explicitly undefined behavior has a valid role in many rigorous designs. This leads naturally to discussion of parameter checking, error handling, and proper use of thrown exceptions.<br />The authors develop a few unusual but critical ideas, including mutability - the possibility that an objects data content can change after creation. In well-disciplined programs, this property has far-reaching implications. Liskov and Guttag involve mutability in equality testing, object identity vs. data equality, and valid naming or indexing.<br />Encapsulation and data hiding have long been design staples, but the authors' examination keeps the idea fresh. They discuss, from the standpoint of provable correctness, how data exposure puts programs at risk. They also make clear how, viewed with an eye to maintainability, the risks of even read-only exposure of an object's data content. They stop short of discussing true formal verification or industrial practice, though, a decision I think appropriate to the book's level. Readers with deeper knowledge can still appreciate the discussion at its implicitly deeper levels.<br />By the time the authors address high-level system specification, it seems almost obvious. Without high-level specification, there would be no way to fill in the more detailed specifications that now come naturally to the reader. The authors also address that tricky moment between specification and implementation: the intuitive process of design.<br />Only the end of the book disappointed me, a half-hearted presentation of design patterns. It seems almost perfuctory, presenting DPs just because it's the done thing, not because the authors add their usual depth to the topic.<br />I really wish I had more upper-level students and professional colleagues who had been trained according to these authors' program. Their software designs, as students and as professionals, would be stronger and safer if they had.ng true formal verification or industrial practice, though, a decision I think appropriate to the book's level.

If a student has already made some headway in bioinformatics, she is likely to want a peek at the different directions and depths that future study will offer. This book gives a good preview.<br />Its fifteen chapters are almost all by different authors, on different topics, in different styles and with different mathematical tools. Except for some introductory material, each chapter stands by itself. The chapters are uniformly well written, they keep their computations close to the biology, and they offer depth without falling into a morass of detail. The book uses math but is not too demanding; readers should not be put off by its &quot;Computational&quot; title.<br />Once inside the book, its authors take us on a quick tour of selected topics, including RNA splicing, high-level annotation of DNA meaning, and several views of protein structure. Computational techniques include traditional decision trees, as well as more modern hidden Markov model techniques, neural nets, analogy to vison processing, and much more.<br />This book presupposes a bit of knowledge of biology, chemistry, and probability, but not daunting amounts. It's a nice way for the beginner to see which directions look most personally interesting. It may also give the more focussed student a quick look at current highlights in nearby fields. This isn't as complete as a 'survey' book would be, but very good in its own way.<br />(I've had the pleasure of studying under Prof. Kasif, one of the editors and authors, and hope that familiarity has not prejudiced this review.)	2003-10-10

It provides a cursory introduction to the assembly problem. That intro is so brief, however, that I don't think a reader will come away understanding what genome assembly is really about.<br />It continues with a disappointing analysis of nucleotide frequencies. The probability analysis is competent enough, within its limits, but I don't see any mention of why the analysis is interesting, or how to extend it the same techniques proteins. The author proposes spectral analysis as a tool, and argues for Walsh vectors as basis functions. Spectral analysis is offbeat, to say the least, but the author does not explain what (if any) biological insight the technique generates. More mainstream tools, including Markov Models, get little or no mention.<br />The chapter on sequence comparison is so short and skips so much critical material, that I'm tempted to call it negligent.<br />Perhaps you have specific reason for wanting the narrow and idiosyncratic view that Percus brings. ...	2003-10-10

The book gives outstanding coverage of all that goes into building HMMs - one of the most important tools in genome analysis and structure prediction. It covers the field in extreme depth. More depth, in fact, than needed for building useful HMM systems. It not only presents the forward and backward algorithms leading up to Baum-Welch, it presents all the extras - convergence, etc.<br />This additional depth of coverage may go beyond many readers' needs. It is very helpful, though, for people who need more than the usual algorithms. By giving the background in such detail, a persistent reader can follow to a certain point, then create modifications with a clear idea of where the new algorithm actually comes from.<br />Regarding the current practice of HMM usage, I found it a bit thin. Widely-known tools based on HMMs are mentioned only occasionally and in passing, and HMM-based alignment is discussed only briefly. Well, this book isn't for the tool user. Perhaps more important, I found scant mention of scoring with respect to some background probability model (\\"null\\" model, as it's called here).<br />My one real complaint, and this is truly minor, is the quality of illustration. The line-drawings look like Word pictures - not necessarily a bad thing, if done well. These aren't particularly professional-looking, though, and oddly stretched or squashed in many cases. Still, they're readable enough and make all the needed points.<br />A lesser point, and not the author's fault, is the editorial implication that this book introduces probabilitic models in general. It does not. This is strictly about HMMs, not Bayesian nets, bootstrap techniques, or any of the dozens of other probabilistic models used in bioinformatics. That is not a flaw of the book, just a flaw in how it's represented.<br />If you are dedicated to becoming an expert in HMM construction and application, you must have this book. It's a bit much, though, for people who just want the results that HMMs give.ve.	2003-10-09

And, as others have pointed out, the tools change but the book doesn't.<br /><br />I think this is a good, brief introduction to the wide variety of bioinformatic tools and databases on the internet. It describes the major features of each, and the kinds of results that each tool is good for. After that, the serious user will go to the sources of each tool or database, to learn more about the specifics as of the moment. No book can hope to keep up with the weekly enhancements at the major repositories.<br /><br />I emphasize that this is for tools users, not tool makers. It addresses the working scientists who already know their subjects and their needs. This skips over the algorithms in favor of higher level descriptions, and skips over many of the biological reasons for the tools described. Better-informed tool users get better answers from the tools, true. At some point, though, the biologists want to skip the theory, skip the introduction to subjects in which they're experts, and get on with their science. I don't think this book was ever meant for people - and I'm one - who want full details of the algorithms.<br /><br />I agree, the book treats its many subjects in a shallow way. I think that is by intent, since the book's real goal is breadth and its target is a reader who knows the basic science. It's a bit off the center of my interests, but I've found it helpful.	2003-10-08

If I can just slam my shoulder against the door and jerk it loose from the frame, the fancy lock is irrelevant.<br />Passwords, encryption, and all the rest are the lock. This book is more about making the door and frame strong. Remember the Blaster worm? That wasn't a 'security' problem. It exploited bugs in Windows that supposedly had nothing to do with security.<br />This book is about building programs that resist attack. That doesn't mean copying a safe code fragment into your program and declaring it safe - that idea is ludicrous. Instead, this book is about the process that designs and implements strong programs. It starts with architecture and design documents, then follows through to design and maintenance.<br />The weakness of this book is lack of detail - how to build fail-safe code, what needs to be on design and inspection checklists, etc. There's good reason for that: each sub-topic needs books, if not whole libraries of its own. Take fault tolerance, for example. It may not sound like security, but an attack is meant to cause system failures, and fault tolerance is design to withstand failures. Fault tolerance is a huge topic, with journals and literature all its own. This book can barely mention the idea, while still giving other topics their due. It's a start, though.<br />Much of the advice may sound drearily familiar: code reviews, security audits, configuration control, error checking, and all the other things that take the 'fun' out of programming. If people want that kind of 'fun', then stop calling them software engineers. They're not ready for adult responsibilities.<br />Before anything else, software security requires correct behavior from a program. I really hope I don't hear objections to that as a basic design goal.	2003-10-08

Her self-induced misery is completely up to date, though.<br />This piece is divided into three books. The first was mostly a series of conversations, held in short, oblique poems, often in terms of proverbs lost to history. My western eye found little to cling to.<br />The second book is more readable, describing the long slow fall of her relationship. She was concubine to Kaneie, second to his actual wife. Even so, she had a large household of her own. Perhaps she was a she was a kept woman, but she was very well kept. Not well enough for her taste, though. She constantly demanded more of Kaneie's time, but seemed to reward him, most often, with excuses or aloofness. She really could not see how hard she worked to put him off, while faulting him for being put off.<br />The third book completes her estrangement from Kaneie, not in any harsh way, but with a mutual numbing of interest. It's not for me to say - still, I wonder whether this is a first-person account of clinical depression. She finally shifts her interest to her son's future, then leaves us with the most dramatic cliff-hanger ending in all of literature.<br />\\"Gossamer Years\\" is a good addition to a well-rounded library of Eastern classics. I wouldn't suggest that it be among the first in that library, though. Shonagon's \\"Pillow Book\\" is a much more enjoyable piece of Heian women's literature.	2003-10-08

Yes, we wake up at the end and find that it was all a dream, or something like that, except that some people don't wake up and just dream on.<br />Not heavy reading, by any means, but it does a nice job filling the gap between Pratchett's releases.	2003-10-07

His autobiography is a series of repeating vignettes, stealing from the people who tried to help, running afoul of the law without quite ruining himself or his family, leading neighborhood protection rackets, spending himself into deep debt, and beating his wife. At age 21, he was still running away from home when things got tough, in a day when a 15-year-old might be head of a household. Somehow, though, he never reached a status I could call 'evil' - his wrongs were all too small and meaningless.<br />Although the translation is very readable, I found the book hard to read. I am sad to say that I've known people like Katsu, seemingly bent on screwing up their lives and never wholly succeeding. Katsu's story hit just a little too close to home for me to enjoy the reading. I was morbidly fascinated, though, by the similarity of today's losers to a fallen samurai of the early 19th century.<br />The translation is modern and well-written, a very good rendering of a very unpleasant man. I do not fault the translation, just the material being translated. Still, Musui's story is an interesting contrast to writings by more honest and educated writers. It fills in the grubby flip-side of Japanese history of the era. It's not a view I like to see, but it's honest in a strange way. Even when he conspicuously lies to his reader, Katsu still reveals his true self. This is not a book that will appeal to everyone, but some readers will find value in it.	2003-09-29

Knuth carries that idea forward by one bold, logical step: in Literate Programming (LP), the main goal is to get technical ideas across to people. Programs are a co-product of the description process. This inverts the premise of JavaDoc and the like, in which human communication is incidental to the code.<br />A literate program, by the way, reads like a standard human document, whether an essay or an IEEE standard specification. JavaDoc output reads like an HTML dump of a cross-linked tree data structure - which it is. JavaDoc serves a valuable purpose, but does not permit system description in the order required by human reasoning.<br />My own experience with LP (a custom system) was very happy - I actually reached the &quot;impossible&quot; goal of true requirements traceability. I unified the system requirements, design, multi-language implementation, configuration control, and even tests under one document set. With HTML output, traceability was made real using interactive links. Anywhere else, traceability is mostly wishful thinking shared by the many owners of physically disconnected documents. (Process gurus - I hope you're paying attention.)<br />LP practice, however, has not caught on. LP, in today's form, does not support programming in the large. What LP does to the compilable form of a program brings C++ name-mangling to mind. I don't know of any WYSIWYG LP systems, so today's window-icon-mouse-pointer (WIMP) programmers will have nothing to do with it. And, ironically, the people who need the most support in communicating with their peers are the ones most resistant to tools for effective communication.<br />It's a grand vision and an exciting experiment. LP deserves more attention.	2003-09-26
963688:US	35004134	R363MBU88YLQSS	0471228869	282026839	The Art of Software Architecture: Design Methods and Techniques	Books	3	20	22	N	N	One extra star for trying.	Ever since &quot;The Mythical Man-Month&quot;, it has been clear that lack of strong architecture will sink a software project. (It was probably true before TMMM, but that was before my time.) Architecture, implying an architect, is a requirement for any major piece of software.<br />I can agree with Albin only to a point: architecture is not implementation, analysis, or software engineering. It's different even from &quot;design&quot;, as the word is usually used. An architect really does a different job than other members of a software team (but the architect may design and implement, also).<br />That said, I didn't quite make out how to go about -<br />- training someone as a software architect,<br />- developing a sound and appropriate architecture,<br />- measuring its success in objective and repeatable ways,<br />- making it a part of the project plan and documentation, or<br />- preserving it across generations of maintenance.<br />Most importantly, I did not see any discussion of adapting an existing architecture to new needs, or of extending an archtecture beyond its original bounds. Typical software spends 10% of it's life in design and implementation, and 90% in maintenance. The initial 10% is the fun part. I have real reservations about authors who choose not to discuss the other 90% of the problem.<br />The book has value to the extent that it opens the topic for discussion. Too often, though, it confuses the skill of architecture with the tools of an architect - sort of like looking at a pencil drawing by Rembrandt and saying &quot;Wow, if I get a pencil like his, I'll be able to draw like that too.&quot;<br />I've been looking for books and articles about software architecture. This one has some value, but I'm still looking.	2003-09-25

This was the winner, almost before I read the content.<br />First, it is easy to follow the flow of each page. MMOW offers a clear organization of its content. The other - which shall remain nameless - bounces the eye from one brightly colored distraction to another. The [dis]organization of each page reflects the [dis]organization of each book as a whole.<br />The book's strengths stand on their own, though. MMOW treats the teen reader as an intelligent, capable individual - not a child to be amused with colored toys. MMOW develops truly creative thinking, by picking a problem and working on just that for weeks at a time. Students attack each problem from many angles, using every different mathematical tool at their disposal. I really wish I knew more adults who could look at one problem in two ways, or more.<br />Most importantly, MMOW develops a healthy faculty of self-criticism. Any of a student's solutions will have strengths and weaknesses. MMOW encourages students to weigh a solution's merits against the merits of other solutions. MMOW also encourages students to explore the weaknesses in their own solutions, and to create stronger solutions in response. The student's eventual math may end at the checkbook or fly to Mars; either way, checking and correction are critical for success.<br />MMOW actually adresses both kinds of students, those who need to solidify basic skills, and those who leap ahead. The other book treats struggling students deplorably. They are thrown a few watered-down problems and an &quot;everybody wins&quot; grading plan. MMOW tries to make sure that all students master the basics.<br />Having seen just that one other book at the pre-algebra level, I give COMAP my strongest approval.	2003-09-25

Two disputants, under blanket amnesty granted by brandy, present supposedly opposing views. The first, in Western clothes, orates at length on democracy, personal freedom, education, world relations, and (of course) national wealth. The second, representing Japanese tradition, argues for military expansionism in order to attain a secure place in international politics and (of course) to attain national wealth.<br />I say supposed opposition - it seemd to me that the two were really discussing different aspects of the cultural identity. The master, in the end, advises modernization within reason and defensive armament within reason. Although his house set the stage for the other two and his point made the most sense, I found it the least interesting part of the text. The two extremes held my attention much more closely.<br />In retrospect, we can see that Japan has followed both courses. It armed heavily up to mid 20th century, and has since participated on an even footing with the major Western powers. This book seems have predicted both.<br />I don't know whether to file this little book closer to Confucius or Johnathan Swift - no matter, I welcome it to my library.	2003-09-22

I found it a gentle, clear exposition of material that can be hugely complicated. The text works upwards from amino acids, the building blocks, through the interactions of shape and chemical affinity, to views of proteins in action. By the time they appear, muscle fibers and virus capsules follow naturally from the discussion. This gives simple, concise descriptions of how proteins' shape emerge from its sequence. It goes on to describe protein control of DNA, to explain virus and muscle structure, and to hint at modern drug design.<br />'Protein Structure' requires some background in organic chemistry and in the ideas of molecular genetics. For example, you should already be familiar with steric hindrance and with the idea of regulatory regions in DNA. Branden and Tooze reward the prepared reader with a well-considered series of discussions. These include enzyme action, photosynthesis, virus self-assembly, muscle fibers, DNA binding, and more. I had never seen an actual chain of chemical events that turn light into usable chemical energy. This book stepped through it (for a bacterium, at least) in just few paragraphs and drawings. But the whole book is like that - it sustains a remarkable density of information, always in a very readable style.<br />The text is laid out in a simple and appealing way, and is profusely illustrated. The illustration is one of this book's wonderful strengths. Almost all of the discussion is carried in diagrams as well as in words, and the authors freely use as many different diagrams as needed to make each idea understandable. The illustration style is simple and consistent; most drawings use one of three or four conventions for describing proteins. Almost all of the illustrations seem to be hand-drawn with colored pencil. Still, the corpus of illsutrations is among the most communicative I have seen in any book. Artists aspiring to illustrate science (or to communicate any idea) should read Tufte, then treat this book as a uniquely successful case study.<br />My only complaint about this book had to do with the quality of its printing. A few pages in my copy have bad register, colors are not consistent from page to page, and the one major photograph is weirdly over-sharpened. I must also admit that I do not need a deep knowledge of protein structure and function - I scanned the book quickly, and read only parts with care. The book repaid that effort richly, and I expect that it will reward more careful readers even more. I'm not a biochemist, but I strongly recommend 'Protein Structure' to anyone at all interested in the topic.dea) should read Tufte, then treat this book as a uniquely successful case study.<br />My only complaint about this book had to do with the quality of its printing.

Nearly a third of software projects are simply scrapped before completion. That waste may account for as much as US$85 billion, approaching 1% of the US gross domestic product. This topic is critical, in a world where everything, down to the pacemaker in a patient's chest, is driven by software.<br />A topic so important deserves a more stirring author than Ewusi-Mensah. I found this book dry, repetitive, and poorly organized. The book centers on a handful of case studies. Those case studies are barely mentioned until chapter four, though. Even then, I found it hard to follow the examples. The author does not present the samples one at a time, in their entirety, though. Instead, he presents one aspect of all five examples, then another facet of all five, and so on. Only in chapter seven, when the book is winding down, do I really see any depth in any of the case studies. Even then, just one is covered in any detail.<br />Ewusi-Mensah rightly describes the &quot;code of silence&quot; surrounding software project failure. His description the phenomenom seems shallow, though. Bruised egos and painful memories may well be part of the reason that failures get so little mention. Software training and practice may have more to do with the tendency to ignore failure, though. In every other field of engineering, practioners rely on knowing yield strengths and &quot;absolute maximum&quot; ratings of their parts and materials. The idea of failure is central to the practice, even to the legalities and forensics, of those fields. Programmers, though, are barely ever shown good examples of their craft, let alone bad examples. Management, design, and project control of software are even more ethereal - there simply is no common set of terms in which the failure can be described.<br />Petroski's writings show that engineering failures can be described in informative, constructive ways. Perhaps this book's target is more difficult - it discusses not the failures of the software itself, so much as failures in the process by which software is built. Perhaps, too, not every author can be a Petroski. Maybe the academic treatment really is more appropriate to this topic. If so, I would hope for an author who cites more of the field's literature and cites less of his own prior work.this book's target is more difficult - it discusses not the failures of the software itself, so much as failures in the process by which software is built.

I'm already quite familiar with hardware design, so I wasn't looking for a book to teach me that. I already have the IEEE VHDL standard document, but that's like reading a phone book. I wanted a readable handbook of the VHDL language - I never found that, so I settled for &quot;VHDL for Designers&quot; instead.<br />I come from a software background, programming in the large. I was looking for a book to teach me the language. For a programmer, that includes the record types (like C structs), 'generate' and 'generic' for parameterizing my design, recommended style for combining operator overloads with component definitions, proper use of libraries, packages, and multiple architectures, and so on.<br />This book is just the baby steps of VHDL. It's very focussed on its examples, and seems to give just enough VHDL for each example. It's OK for design at the &quot;Hello world&quot; level, but not much past that. It has most of the basic language constructs, but shallow discussion of them. The organization doesn't really lend itself to use as a language handbook.<br />Still, it does cover the basics. I'll just have to tough it out for the rest of the language. I still use the book, but I'm still looking for a better one.	2003-09-18

It starts with &quot;A Crash Course in Java.&quot; (Somehow, I never learned to like any &quot;crash&quot; in the context of program design.) This is much too brief to teach the language, or even summarize it well. Any of many other books would be better for teaching Java to C++ programmers.<br />Next, the book goes through two chapters of object oriented design. These chapters are over in about 100 pages - again, not nearly enough time to address OO design in with any real insight. The OO paradigm is truly different from previous generations of software design, and can not be summed up in a few pages of rote rules.<br />Worse, the author identifies &quot;javadoc&quot; as a design documentation tool! It is not. Javadoc does a very good job of documenting implementation, but it documents design very badly. If you're not a programmer, trust me - implementation and design are as different as carpentry and architecture. Neither is better than the other, and both are needed to build a house. Implementation is not design, though, and the two require very different documentation.<br />The rest of of the book continues in an odd pastiche including:<br />-- ideas the programmer already needed to understand the earlier material,<br />-- afterthoughts on the Java language, scattered among other topics,<br />-- a weak discussion of design patterns, and<br />-- a severely flawed discussion of multithreading.<br />Only this last deserves attention. Multithreading is a subtle topic. It's easy to write multithreaded code, but very hard to write it correctly. The author actually does a good job of discussing interruption in threads. However, the book's description of synchronization and deadlock is so brief that it leaves me worried - student programmers might read that material and come away thinking they understood the topics. Insufficient knowledge may be worse than none at all, in this case. Most distressing, the author makes no apparent mention of &quot;volatile&quot; data in Java. Multithreaded applications don't need to use volatile data. The programmer MUST understand when volatility is a problem, though, and avoid it or address it directly. It is unacceptable to ignore the risks addressed by &quot;volatile&quot; declarations.<br />I can not recommend this book. It claims to address object oriented design, Java, and design patterns. I feel that it does an inadequate job on all counts.r makes no apparent mention of &quot;volatile&quot; data in Java. Multithreaded applications don't need to use volatile data.

This last is Prof. Braude's specialty. He addresses industrial SWEng directly in another book, in far more detail than this book attempts.<br />This is not \\"SWEng-lite\\" though. It presents SWEng as the context in which software is designed - the environment in which design patterns are applied. Other design pattern books seem to address design as an isolated event, with no context and no further concerns than design. That, in my opinion, is how other books fail. Design is just a fraction, typically 10% down to 1% of a program's lifetime cost. SWEng addresses the whole of a software project's life.<br />This book exists to place design, in terms of design patterns, in its proper place in a software system's time line. In part, it's a commentary on the \\"Design Patterns\\" book by Gamma et al. In part, it's a summary of SWEng process. Other books do each job better. This book unifies the two fields, though, and may be unique in taking on that unification as its main goal.<br />For the general reader, this book's discussion of component software may seem shallow and tangential. Perhaps it works well in Prof. Braude's classroom, but I think it adds one concept too many to an otherwise good book. The component and .NET sections may have value in his classroom, but I think they add little to an otherwise interesting approach to two important topics.<br />I think this book has a place in a complete software engineering library. Maybe not the highest place, or second highest. Still, it will give the knowledgeable reader a uncommon view of individual design as part of the professional software practice.	2003-09-13

I disagree. The real problem is that the formulas almost never apply exactly to the subject at hand - they have to be adjusted to each application.<br />That's why this book is so helpful. It gives huge numbers of results I can use immediately, but also shows me where they came from. That means that I can rephrase the formulas as needed in special computing environments, but still be sure that I'm getting a meaningful answer. The book has a secondary emphasis that I value very highly: checks that the techniques are giving meaningful answers. It's pretty silly, and perhaps dangerous, to apply a technique without knowing how good its results are. This book gives me the checks I need to measure the quality of the results from each technique.<br />No, there's no C code to cut and paste. This is a math book. The math is clear and well-developed, though, and mostly limited to linear algebra. As I type this, I have the book open to &quot;Discrimination and Classification,&quot; and I have my protoype C program on the screen. That's how directly applicable the book is.<br />I admit, I haven't appplied every technique in the book. All of the book is equally well-written, though. When I need principal components or basic clustering, this is the book I'll grab first.	2003-09-10

When I need to provide proof that I'm over 21, for example, I may present a driver's license. That can confirm that I'm over 21, certainly. It will also release my exact age and birth date (very different questions), as well as my name, address, license number, and whether I need glasses! The store certainly has a right to know that I am of legal age for some purchase, with a certificate at least as trustworthy as my driver's license. The rest of the information is irrelevant, but can expose me to a lot of unwanted attention, even real danger. I must, however, present all of it or none.<br />We really can have it both ways. Brands' protocols can give that seller the information needed - am I at least 21 - with extreme certainty. The protocol will release ONLY that information, however - not my exact age, address, or the rest. If I want to release my address, too, I can do that without releasing my driver's license number. The &quot;infrastructure&quot; in Brands' title is the set of mechanisms make this possible. It uses modern cryptography to create the required level of trust. It also uses Brands' techniques to let the owner of information control how it is released.<br />Brands has given clearer and more detailed meanings of personal privacy that I would ever dreamed exist. He then shows how mathematical techniques can protect each facet of privacy, while releasing all the information I must for living in a modern world. The text is quite mathematical - enough for the dedicated reader to implement any of the protocols described. It is possible, however, to skip past the math. What's left is an excellent discussion of living a safe and dignified life in a society of information.	2003-09-05

Then I found this book - it covers more material, and does it beautifully. I give the book my highest recommendation.<br />This covers component software from the standpoint that I prefer: the underlying technology that make components work. This book is not for the cut&paste programmer. It's for someone who wants to understand what really happens when a program (or component) starts execution. It's for someone who wants real control over code activation, or someone who just wants to execute every test() method in every class, without having to type in the ever-changing list of class names.<br />This book also has a place in any library on code security. For example, reflection exposes a lot more of your program than you may have thought, and serialization creates a whole new family of possible data exposures. Security is not an explicit topic, but lots of the material has security implications.<br />The only major topic this book misses is long-term (XML)serialization. Well, that's new at Java 1.4, and the book seems to predate that API. Maybe the second edition will cover it better. The book doesn't mention EJB styles of serialization or the Java Activcation Framework either, but those are just applications of the basic technologies described here.<br />There was good reason for this book to be written about Java. I look forward to a .NET companion volume, when (if!) .NET provides the same capabilities. In the mean time, I'd recommend this to any advanced programmer, since analogies to Java will help readers understand environments other than Java, too.	2003-08-20

That's why I value a book like this. It's very approachable, given some linear algebra, a gives a great, practical review of linear regression.<br />This book doesn't just give clear descriptions of regression and linear discriminators. It also shows how, and more importantly why, I should set control parameters. Best of all, it shows how to measure the quality of the results given by most techniques. Too many people just turn the crank on their algorithms blindly, never knowing what they've computed (if anything). I am very happy to see a text shows me how to determine whether its techniques are working well on any specific problem.<br />On the whole, I find the presentation readable and practical. There's some theory, but just enough to give real understanding, and to give some ability to tune the techniques to the problem at hand. This book is one of my real workhorses - I recommed it highly.	2003-08-19

The writing is clear and well-paced, and Moore covers the topic with surprising thoroughness.<br />There are more modern books, specific to applications of interval arithmetic. More recent authors apply intervals to error analysis, to constraint propagation in solving non-linear systems, and to hardware design. All the newer books I've seen are improved, however, when Moore's book is used as the introduction.<br />I'd even suggest this book as a preparation for fuzzy arithmetic. Fuzzy numbers' conceptual base may be different, but many ideas translate directly.

Some students, through chance or a teacher's skill, may manage to glean some mathematical fact from this book. It will do them little good, though. The book's complete lack of continuity gives no reward for that success, measured in skills used later in the course.<br />Students who can't squeeze understanding from this book - the ones it calls \\"alternative assessment\\" students - are very nearly abandoned, as far as any real education goes. Instead of being offered meaningful help, they are invited to draw pictures and write essays about their feelings. Such students are not only left in the dust, they are patronized and insulted in the process.<br />I have examined earlier editions of this book, back to 1997. The only thing I can say in favor of it is that, in preparing the 2001 edition, some of the worst errors and blatant commercialism were removed. It improved, but its basic flaws remain.<br />Do yourself and your math student a favor: find a different title. A little web searching will point you to sites that review and recommend better books, as well as more detailed analyses of this one. Or just pick another title at random - this is so bad that almost anything would be an improvement.<br />(based on the 2001 edition)	2003-08-17

If you haven't read this book, you don't know biological string matching. The book's focus is clearly on string algorithms, but the author gives good biological significance to the problems that each technique solves. I came away from this book understanding the algorithms, but also knowing why the algorithms were valuable.<br />No, there isn't any real source code here. That should not be a problem - this book aims above the cut&amp;paste programmer. The book in meant for readers who can not only understand the algorithms, but apply them to unique solutions in unique ways.<br />String matching is far too broad a topic for any one book to cover. The study can include formal language theory, Gibbs sampling and other non-deterministic optimizations, and probability-based techniques like Markov models. The author chose a well bounded region of that huge territory, and covers the region expertly. The reader will soon realize, though, that algorithms from this book work well as pieces of larger computations. The book's chosen limits certainly do not limit its applicability.<br />By the way, don't let the biological orientation put you off. DNA analysis is just one place where string-matching problems occur. The author motivates algorithms with problems in biology, but the techniques are applicable by anyone that analyzes strings.	2003-08-17

I've had this book for years, and keep coming back to it. Many books define fuzzy numbers in various ways, and hint at combining them with some kind of arithmetic. Kaufmann and Gupta actually carry out those operations. Since fuzzy addition is a kind of convolution, they also show why fuzzy subtraction does not reverse the operation - deconvolution does. If you want to use fuzzy arithmetic for constraint propagation, this changes the basic nature of backwards propagation.<br />I just wish the author's clarity had extended a little farther into the mechanics of the various kinds of convolution. They handle discrete cases only, and offer about the least readable presentation of convolution that I've ever seen.<br />I'm not a theoretician, so I appreciate the book's clarity and examples. It is so clear and thorough that I refer to it for ideas quite unrelated to fuzzy arithmetic. If a sign of a great book is the number of unrelated topics that it clarifies, then this title is very good indeed.<br />This title may not suit the beginner and may not suit the expert. For us in the middle, though, it is incredibly helpful.	2003-08-17

Every image is filled with incredible detail, a wild ride through a bizarre universe. (Druillet's recent 'Chaos' was flat and disappointing, given 'Yrgael Urm' as precedent.) Once you've spent a few minutes with this book, you may never forget its illustrations.<br />That said, the plot is inscrutable and the text is barely coherent. You're not here for the story, though, so don't worry about that too much.<br />If I must pick a nit, it has to do with translation. As near as I can tell, the book originally appeared in French. Apparently, the text was later whited-out and re-lettered in English. The new lettering is wonderfully expressive. The art suffered a little in the process, though, since some of the original lettering overlapped artwork. These maculae are minor, and shouldn't stop anyone from enjoying the book.	2003-08-17
