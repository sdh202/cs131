Barbara Plum addresses the troubles of a woman having it all, and the price of being \\"Queen of the Universe\\".  Kelsy Chandler, is late 30-something lass, beautiful, sexy and seemingly has it all her way.  Her life is fairly well ordered.  She loves her five-year-old son and he loves her.  She has a great job in television - okay she has one creep of a boss, but a lass cannot have everything.  She has a sexy man - a decade younger than her - who sees her as the Queen of his Universe.<br /><br />Only, life is never that simple.  Her fianc&eacute;, Finn Bishop, is an undercover cop, so sometimes he has problems \\"being there\\".  Job comes first, it seems.  Then there is so little time for romance as son is always around eyeballing the couple.  Small cracks in the perfect world are showing up.  She is in her late 30s, with a much younger fianc&eacute;.  What happens in ten years when he wants children of his own and she doesn't?  Fears of the relationship disintegrating as \\"sag\\" sets in, she wonders if she shouldn't concentrate on her career.<br /><br />As Finn's job and her work to separate them, communication stops and their love begins to falter.  They are no longer talking to each other about these issues that matter.  A career advancement is offered to Kelsey, but she holds back from discussing it with Finn, fearing it will make matters worse between them.  The less they talk, the worse things become and Kelsy's perfect world is no longer so perfect.  Fear keeps them locked into this silent relationship that is spiraling beyond her control.<br /><br />Plum has demonstrated in her previous works, a bent for not following formula.  Some might not \\"get her\\" if they are looking for a \\"quick read\\".  She asks the reader stick with the story, and for that request she rewards them with emotional involvement.  At times, the reader will want to smack Kelsy, other times they are howling at her antics.  In this society of two career couples, addressing whose career is more important is a decision face by many couples, so Kudos for Plum tackling the problem with such original flare.<br /><br />Plum's insistence to do fresh tales that don't follow typical formulas will gradually find her audience.  Until then, the ones of us who `get her' will just have to spread by word of mouth what a talent she is.

Popp caught my attention with her first book, TOO CLOSE TO THE SUN (Lovespell 2003).  Then nothing!  ARGH!  The book was highly imaginative, original, with strong characters.  Popp had all the ingredients for a super book and she delivered.  I kept waiting for more tales from this talented lass.  Surely, a writer of this caliber would soon have more.  It's been a dry two years, but finally Popp has a new book out from Warner Forever line.  OUT OF THE NIGHT once again proves Popp is a writer to watch.<br /><br />Lanie Webes is a firemanÂ¯(firefighter person???  lol) and EMT.  This was no delicate miss, but a woman who faced life and death situation as part of her daily routine.  When her father, a scientist, dies at his research center deep in the Amazon jungle, she has to travel there to really settle in her mind that he is truly dead.  The trek there is not a simple choice.  She must hire a private charter plane.  And while she dashes into burning building to save people, getting into that dilapidated plane summoned all her fortitude.<br /><br />Her Uncle Charles arranges for Mac Knight, the pilot of that thing he called a plane, to fly her deep into the Amazon jungle, then drive her to the top secret research centre where her father died under mysterious circumstances.  The pilot is a former Navy Seal, and has worked for `Uncle' on missions before.  Lanie is floored when she meets the pilot - the man is drop dead gorgeous.  By the same token, Mac is little prepared for the quick action lady.  When he is attacked and bitten - by a `creature' (won't say more than that to keep from spoiling the fast ride), Lanie's actions are automatic, drawing on her EMT skills to keep him alive.  As Lanie fights for his life, her attraction grows for Mac.<br /><br />The story is mesmerizing, rapid action that keeps you turning page after page.  As with her first book, the characters are vivid, the action strong. Just one great vamp read.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />Welcome back, Popp!  Don't take so long for your next book, lass!br /><br />Welcome back, Popp!  Don't take so long for your next book, lass!	2005-10-03

BRAVA is Kensington's current Romantica/Erotica line.  While this book is great reading - I really enjoyed it - fans of pure Brava style might find this a little light in the erotica \\"heat\\".  The writers are solid.  I especially like Jen Nicholas' story.  It has GREAT premise for a series, and I hope to see it done down the road.  However, by Brava's hot hot hot standards, the story is slower developing.  About 80-page novella and the Hero and Heroine don't meet until chapter four.  I am not saying this is a fault, just a \\"meter\\" for those trying to gauge the level of their romances.  If you go in wanting Red Sage level, you might be disappointed.  For those of use just looking for a great sexy Romance Anthology then this is dead on target.<br /><br />Jen Nicholas shows bright promise as a Romance writer.  THE CUPID CURSE is engaging, breezy.  She is very strong with quirky characters and an original premise that lends itself more to a sexy romance series than erotica.  I hope she follows through on this premise and does some CUPID tales.  We learn there is not one Cupid, but thousands.  There is Cupid Central where they handle details of romances.  Like a Romance Publisher who receives a flood manuscripts from hopefuls, Cupid Central is flooded with letters that are along the lines of `Dear Santa' letters, only these are `Dear Cupid, please find me the perfect man (or woman...lol).  When Valentine Lewis sends in her request, they naturally sit up and take notice.  Gideon is a cupid in training (along the lines of a nun - how they have novices and you get an idea of Gideon's standing in Cupid Central).  This is THE case to put him over at CC and get him promoted to full Cupid.  Only when he shoots his arrow meant for Valentine's chosen, he ends up accidentally shoots himself in the bum!!!  Love has to ensure.  The story is bright, witty, engaging, but it's until chapter for until the Heroine and Hero meet.  Fine by me, but other erotica readers might get antsy.  As I said, the premise is perfect for a series of stand alone titles and I hope to hear more from this talented writer.<br /><br />MESMERIZED is another funny tale.  Amanda Dillon has men dropping at her feet, but she discounts that as they are hypnotized at the time.  The one man she wants on his knees is Derek Armstrong.  Derek is a reporter and he is on the trail of the elusive Amanda and wants the scoop, even if he has to permit her to hypnotize him to get the down and dirty to prove Amanda is a scam artist.  This one sizzles, as Amanda doesn't quite know what to make of the sexy reporter.  A delightful tale.<br /><br />FUZZY LOGIC is by Erin McCarthy and is another enjoyable tale.  A bit more Brava style, this story has Ashley Andrew, confession shopaholic, is shocked when her credit cards are maxed to the limit and beyond.  She is forced to take on a second job to make payments on the massive debt.  She to accept a job as a Pleasure Party consultant.  She accidentally leaves her case of \\"party favors\\" on the doorstep of sexy next-door neighbor, Lucas Manning.  This story is a riot.

I grew weary of Regencies, for a simple reason - no matter how good they are, they just blended in my mind.  When I finished one, they soon faded into the \\"Regency Collective\\", sort of like the Borg on Star Trek!  So, it's delightful to see one standing out from the crowd.  And this one does.  So a big hand for this first time writer - Janet Mullany.<br /><br />Fabienne was a fresh-faced seventeen-year-old when she first saw rake Adam Ashworth.  With the sparkling passion of first love, she gave him everything, her innocence...her heart, only to have both treated with little value.  So when they meet again, twenty years later, Fabienne still feels the sting of Adam's betrayal.<br /><br />Now widowed, Adam lives in the country, but is summoned to town because his ward has developed an obsession to a young female artist.  Fabienne has become a patroness of the arts and is the sponsor for the young woman.  She defends her prot&eacute;g&eacute; against Adam's slanders.<br /><br />While Fabienne is very popular in society with her elite salons, she is a widow and feels very along.  She finds solace in correspondence with a reclusive author, Mrs. Ravenswood.  Through the letters, their friendship deepens to where Fabienne reveals her stinging pain of Adam's betrayal, how the pain of the young love still hurts her heart.  Need a bond to another, Fabienne sets out to find the recluse.  Instead, she finds Adam.  She assumes Mrs. Ravenwood is Adam's mistress, so is destroyed to find the one person she has revealed her pain to is likely laughing at her.  Her betrayal is receiving another turn of the screw and she is so hurt.<br /><br />Adam is Mrs. Ravenwood, but he is not sure how to confess.  He hoped to draw Fabienne to him through the charade, but now sees it as a mistake that could destroy any chance he hopes to have with Fabienne.  Despite all this, Adam and Fabienne are pulled into a relationship.<br /><br />Brava for Mullany eschewing the darling belle of the ton just coming out for giving us an older, more mature woman.  Her writing is sexy, savvy and she has created a story of adults who have been hurt, who want love, but cannot see to get past the pain to the love still there.  Adam and Fabienne are living,<br />breathing characters not Regency stereotypes.  They have a full range of emotions and complexities that draw the reader and will keep this Regency living in your mind.<br /><br />This book shows confidence way beyond a first time writer and should mark Mullany as an author to watch.<br /><br />One of the best Regencies I have read in years.coming out for giving us an older, more mature woman.

Lynsay is back with another long-awaited Argeneau tale, and new sexy updated cover instead of the cartoon ones.  New Publisher, the vamps are no longer with Dorchester.  They're now put out by Avon (though Dorchester will continue to do her Historicals).  Originally, this was the very first Argeneau tale in the series, not Single White Vampire (Lucern's tale).  So it's great to finally get Lucern's little sister's story.  As followers of the series know, the Argeneau vamps are the modern day, intelligent sort, who know feasting in the wild can get \\"blood\\" with all sorts of problems.  In order to skip all this rather mundane ugliness, they've invested in blood banks that see them supplied with a full range of \\"flavors\\" and blood that is safe!  Only, Lissianna really has trouble with this popping her fangs into a blood bag and having a quick munchie.<br /><br />So Mama Argeneau sets out to give Lissianna the perfect present - one sexy male tied up and waiting.  Well, Lissianna wants Mr. Right, not just Mr. Available.  She's tired of her vamp immortal life, and would like someone to share it with.  Lissianna has other problems, such as her fainting at the sight of blood, an annoying trait for a vampire.  For a Birthday gift, Mama has gone out and fetched Dr. Gregory Hewitt, used mind control to get him to tuck himself up in the trunk of her car, and now has him tied up nekkid on Lissianna's bed.  Wouldst that all mums were so obliging on birthdays!<br /><br />Greg was planning a much-needed vacation.  The last he recalls is leaving the office and planning on getting away.  Instead, he wakes up in a stranger's bedroom.  Well, he's male - this cannot be all bad.  Okay, she's a vampire romance may be a bit difficult to work out, but to quote Joey Brown in Some Like it Home, \\"nobody's perfect.\\"<br /><br />A great tale which you can sink your fangs into!

As with all first writers, you see the small things she will learn to polish in time. However, what hits the reader immediately is her true love for the romance of the period. As a Scot and someone who has dealt with the history of the country a big chuck of my life, it takes a lot to impress me. Burroughs does. First off she knows who Andrew de Moray is - big points for that, lass! Burroughs has written a wonderful Scottish Medieval full of heart and adventure.  <br /> <br />It's set in the period just before the rising of William Wallace. Her tale uses the Scottish struggle for independence against Edward Longshanks, Edward I of England. Grant Drummond vows revenge against the English man who killed his father, and in the quest for vengeance, he kidnaps Victoria Blackstone to use against her father. Little does he know, Victoria has long born the hatred and indifferences of Blackstone.  <br /> <br />Victoria is a gentle woman, long hurt by her father's coldness, promised in marriage to a disgusting man. Despite her fear what her father will do, she is determined not to be another of the poor women who have wedded her betrothed, only to die an early death. She has suffered, often harshly under her father's tyrannical control; she is determined this will not be repeated in a husband. As she plots her escape, she little knows that fate is conspiring to play a role in her life.  <br /> <br />Grant is a dashing hero, though he definitely is an alpha warrior, willing to do what he must. Naturally, Grant and Victoria get off to a rough beginning, but slowly he breaks through Victoria's reserve. Burroughs, writes in prose that touches the reader, makes them feel as they watch the struggles of this couple. Soon, the Captor turns into protectors, as Grant vows Victoria's father will never harm her again.  <br /> <br />Burroughs has done a thorough job researching the book in an effort to tell a story that is strong, memorable. She shows promise of being a very delightful writer of this genre. Her next book The Highlander is in the works, so I am sure everyone will be looking forward to another heartfelt saga from this wonderful writer.  <br /> <br />Look for the sequal Her Highland Rogue out now. It's a beautiful sweeping saga that shows Burroughs is a talent to be watched.	2005-08-25

Roni has wanted Taber, been in love with him since she was sixteen, but Taber ignores this and tries to be a big brother.<br /><br />Taber keeps his distance because he is Feline Breed.  In Wolf Breed the genes are recessive, but not in the cats.  Many of the feline traits are evident, so he feels he has no right to love Roni.  As Roni pushes for more from Taber, he marks her.  Something about the Felines, that physical mark their mate, similar to a passion mark, but the mark never vanishes.  Due to Roni thinking Taber didn't' want her and Taber getting a message Roni wanted nothing to do with him, they keep their distance for over a year.<br /><br />However, when the news of the Breeds exploded on the television, her father becomes aware Roni carries Taber's mark.  Instead of keeping his mouth shut daddy dearest sees it as a way to make big bucks.  The covert operatives that ran the Breed Program are hunting them down and killing them.  They also want more information on the mates, the women whom they are claiming.  Roni would bring a big chunk of change for her father.  When she refuses to cooperate, he reveals her bond with Taber, forcing Taber to come claim her to save her from those hunting him.  He knows she is a target now, that he must come and claim his mate.<br /><br />Only Roni is unprepared for what that means, and really doesn't want to be his mate now that he turned his back on her for so long.<br /><br />It's erotica, not the more mainstream of the brilliant Elizabeth's Wolf.  So know that going in.  Leigh is a talent to be reckoned with.  Where she really excels is her characters.  She makes you know these people, makes you care.  I eagerly await her jump to NYC publishers and see what she does with a bigger showcase.she is a target now, that he must come and claim his mate.<br /><br />Only Roni is unprepared for what that means, and really doesn't want to be his mate now that he turned his back on her for so long.<br /><br />It's erotica, not the more mainstream of the brilliant Elizabeth's Wolf.

She knows how I like powerful stories that grab the reader and won't let them go.  I have three of the \\"Breed books\\" and am naturally reading them out of order, typical for me.  Still, that is often a good lit test to see if the book is really stand alone.  Though this is fourth in the Breed Series, this one truly stands alone well.  The Feline books that I have read are super, but Lora Leigh is at TOP FORM with Elizbeth's Wolf.  At points in the feline books, while I am really enjoying them, the romance is eschewed in favor of breed matings.  While it's powerful writing, it loses the true romance in favor of animal traits.  However, with Elizabeth's Wolf, the power of the romance is dead on target.  This is Lora Leigh at sheer perfection.  She is so concentrated, so in tune with her characters, on the power of a predator finding and protecting his mate.<br /><br />In this case the \\"scent\\" comes through letters from a little girl to a soldier, Dash Sinclair, who has been injured.  No one sends letters to Dash.  He is truly a lone wolf, a man genetically engineered with wolf in is coding.  Unlike the feline breeds, whose traits are more obvious, his wolf breed traits are recessive.  As a man born in a test tube, he is so utterly alone.  When he is injured, his sight nearly taken from him, his commander sees Dash needs a lifeline, and offers it when letters from Cassie comes in.  She has picked his name off a list of soldiers who didn't get mail and began writing Dash.  As his commanders reads the letters, Dash begins to think of Cassie and her mother Elizabeth as his.<br /><br />It's clear to Dash almost immediately, there's problems in Cassie's life with her mother.  Her mother is sad and scared.  Quickly, Dash needs the letters, needs the woman and child.  He arranges presents for Cassie of the year of receiving letters.  As he is checking out of the hospital, he learns Cassie and her mother Elizabeth have been killed in an explosion that destroyed the apartment where they were living.  So the wolf goes on the hunt to kill the people responsible.  He soon gets a letter from Cassie.  They escaped, she has another name and her mother and she are on the run for their lives once again.  So the hunt switches for Dash, a race to find the child and mother and claim them before the men hunting them catch up kill Elizabeth and take the child.  We guess the reason early on (especially so if you have read the other books), but it's not the plot that pulls you.  It's the power of Dash's need to protect the woman he now claims and her child.<br /><br />Lora Leigh is SO POWERFUL with this story.  It alone marks her as a talent to watch.  This story is just so emotional, so vivid that you won't be able to put it down.  Few writers reach this level of craft.  So if you haven't read Lora Leigh, this is the one to start with.illed in an explosion that destroyed the apartment where they were living.

Brooches, buttons, belts, pins, hair accessories, chains, pendants, fingers rights, bells, purses, mirrors, combs, cosmetic sets, needlecases and more.

One of the things I enjoy as a reviewer is discovering new writers.  Too often readers - myself included - go with what we know.  The author that delivers the same thing time-after-time:  Nora Roberts, Jayne Ann Krentz, Linda Howard.  Only after reading these writers for decades, they are \\"comfort\\" reads.  Like that old fuzzy sweater you curl up with on cold winter days.  It's faded, nothing special, but you know it will keep you warm.  Readers opting for that often will grow bored with Romance writing in general.  Then it's time to branch out, find new voices.  Reviewing gives me to chance to check out new talent and I am often surprised how refreshing it is to come across a new voice that has a fresh view on the basic formulae.  Sure, they might not be as polished as Roberta, Krentz or Howard, but they bring something even more enchanting - passion! - a burning enthusiasm for writing that the big names often don't have anymore.  Alyssa Goodnight is one of these delightful finds.<br /><br />The plot is nothing really new.  It's what Goodnight does with it.  At twenty-five, Emily Sinclair is a spinster, firmly on the shelf, so has the advantages younger marriageable age misses are not permitted.  However, she is burden with an overbearing father and shrew of a stepmother who are determined she marry within a month - to the worm of a nephew of the stepmother.  Worn down, Emily agrees - with the provision if she finds another marriage proposal before the month is up, she marry this man instead.  In a huff, and determined to grab life by both hands before she is caged up and married against her will, she crashes into Brandon Davenport, Viscount Ashwood.<br /><br />Brandon Davenport is weary of the marriage mart and being a target for mothers with lasses needing titled husbands.  He is determined to remain a bachelor.  So he is delighted to find Emily is not the typical ton belle.  She is mouthy and enchanting.  Neither knows who the other are when highwaymen ambush them.<br /><br />It doesn't take long for Emily to decide Brandon is the answer to her husband needs, but the lad has sworn never to marry.  Yes, the formula is one seen dozens of times, but Goodnight brings such energy into the tale, she makes if fresh and a delight to read.  Goodnight's story is imaginative, the characters charming, complex.  They make you care.  A sexy romance moves at a heady pace showing this is an author to take note of for future books.<br /><br />So this is one of the wonderfully \\"fresh\\" voices that are a delight to discover.

It's not bad enough the writer gets SO many facts wrong, out of order or does about faces on her own statement - it's a marathon of WRONG - she actually and consistently contradicts herself!  One can write a small book on the errors this author carelessly makes.<br /><br />Take this as TOTAL FICTION and you MIGHT enjoy it.  If you are looking for a feel for the period, look elsewhere.  Save your money - and the headache!  To see a writer do so much research and get it ALL so wrong, jumping around in chronological order with the consistency of a ping pong ball, had to be a fine madness.<br /><br />I don't think someone could deliberately set out to get something so wrong and do half a thorough job as Murray did.	2005-07-21

They were destined to find their fates together, but something happened, and each took a wrong turn and died.  Now with their guide Borrrisssssssssss, they are sent back, Jack to do it again and hopefully get it right.  It's a delightful tale with Boris stealing the show, but isn't that natural???  Worthy buying for Owens tale alone.<br /><br />Rebecca York has been a long time fav of mine with her consistent work for Harlequin and now her werewolf series.  Again, she comes through with a delightful tale called \\"Shattered Dreams\\".  Miranda often thinks of her teenage love Caleb.  Once he sculpted her in stone.

Their bond that defies all calls him to save the women he once loved before from an evil wanting to claim her life.<br /><br />Sherrilyn Kenyon gives us a charming tale, though the weakest of the three, about \\"Knightly Dreams\\".  As with all Kenyon tales read for the charm of the story not for the historical accuracy.

So I was curious how she made the jump into Contemporary Romance with a NASCAR theme.  I must say Britton is hitting her stride here, her voice more fluid as a Contemporary writer.  She's obviously done her racing homework, and strongly portrays the NASCAR world.  It's a nifty drama that leaves me hoping Britton does more contemporaries.<br /><br />Cece Blackwell is a FBI Agent.  She's in the middle of a case ready to break open when her boss yanks her from that assignment and pushes her into a racecar circuit case.  She has to work undercover, posing as a NASCAR groupie, while trying to get to the bottom of a racecar driver's death.  She threatens to quit her job because of it, but her boss is determined to keep her on the case since she is the only one with enough knowledge to be believable in the high-powered, high-states world.  Exacerbating the upset is the fact her high school crush, Blain Sanders heads one of the racecar teams.  Sanders' NASCAR team employed the man who died.  When she confronts Blain, he says he requested she run the investigation.  He knows she is good with the cars, the circuit and can blend in well, so will cause minimum fuss while the investigation runs its course.  Blain would accept the death of the other driver was an accident, but for the threatening letters, which came just before the man died.<br /><br />Cece must race to find a killer, while the throttle on her attraction to Blain is thrown wide open.  The fast pace of the writing matches the racing theme, and the hero and heroine are deliciously attractive, drawing you in to the high-profile world of stockcar racing.  Britton makes the transition from historical romance writer to contemporary romance writer with ease.  It's pedal to the metal fun.	2005-07-03

She is beautiful, has an incisive mind, a soul who loves justice and comes from a high-society pedigree background. Only problem, she has made lousy choices in boyfriends. An up and coming attorney in Palm Beach, Florida working for the U.S. Attorney General's Office, she made the first mistake falling for Harold Lowell. In his bid for the office, he accepts illegal campaign contributions. The second mistake she made - in Harold's eyes as well as many of her co-workers - she turned Harold in for committing the crime. This saw her fired. Now she is rebuilding her career in the private sector, forming a firm with her two friends Carling Dent and Nichole Sterling - The Law Offices of Dent, Rochelle and Sterling - and she is embarking on her first case. Only the stigma of her turning evidence, along with a long-ago mystery of the disappearance of her grandfather and grandmother - with the grandfather a judge who supposedly took bribes - Kate has a hard road ahead of her. Now she thinks of herself as a hired gun. When someone does you wrong, you cannot take the law into your own hands and have a shoot-out at high noon - you hire her to be your 'gun'.<br />It's a case everyone wants Kate to turn down for different reasons. The first to approach her not to take the case is her Aunt Hilary. She is really Kate's great aunt but prefers to be called aunt because it makes her younger sounding. A woman, Grace Roberts - assistant to her aunt - has been murdered. She was helping work on the restoration of the old court house when she was killed. Lloyd Sibler, the project coordination has been arrested for her murder, though Kate refuses to believe this. Lloyd is not the type to kill someone, especially when the reasons for the murder was Lloyd and Grace were having an affair. Kate knows Grace was planning a high-powdered, big-money engagement with a drop-dead gorgeous CEO and would not waste time own meek Lloyd. Next pressure comes from her uncle Colin. Colin insists Kate has never had a murder case before, and since this involves the death penalty, he believes Kate is putting Lloyd's life at risk. Then her godfather, in the running for the Supreme Court, approaches her about how the high profile case might adversely affect his chances. All this does is make Kate more stubbornly determined to see Lloyd gets a fair trial.<br />Suddenly, odd things are happening to Kate. A mugger mugs her trying to steal her briefcase, yet doesn't try to take her laptop. Then someone breaks in the room where Grace was killed. The very chambers where her Grandfather used when he was Judge and vanished from decades ago.

Well, she is back with another Bad Luck book, though lacking that appellation in the title.  Her Bodyguard, the Bad Luck Curse jumps a generation as Trace's daughter Maribeth has her tale.  Two sisters are featured in supporting roles, so fans of Ms. Dawson are guaranteed at least two more Bad Luck stories.<br /><br />The book takes up in San Antonio in the late 1880s.  It's the eve of Emma's wedding, sister to Mari and Kat.  They are the famed McBride Menaces.

She warns the three girls they must find their one true love to end their doomed legacy.<br /><br />A couple years later, Emma is widow, so we assume her husband wasn't her true love to break the McBride's Curse.  Kate's fallen for an actor, but Mari is more settled and owns her own candy store.  Once day Luke Garrett comes into the store.  Daddy dearest knows this blackguard and tries to stop him for flirting with Mari.<br /><br />In Kat's quest for love with her actor, she is trapped in a fire in the theatre.  Only Mari refuses to believe her sister died.  She is determined to find her, and dashing Luke won't permit the sweet miss from the sweet store to go gadding about.  But this presents problems for Luke in more ways that one.  The Brazos Valley Gang are tearing up the countryside, and while her father thinks Luke an Outlaw - he's just plan law, a Texas Ranger.  So it's up to Ranger Luke to become Mari's bodyguard.  Look has to protect Mari and his Outlaw cover so it make romancing Mari tough.<br /><br />It's a delightful tale.  Dawson proves she is a wonderful writer, with a skillful weaving of this gentle heartwarming tale.  Mari is a heart-stealer, with her caring about her sisters, especially Kat, never giving up hope when everyone else did.  There are surprises along the way in a book that delivers from start to finish.  It leaves the reader eager for Kat's and Emma's story.

I have been waiting for Straif Blackthorne's story since Heartmate, the first of the Celta books from talented Robin D. Owens.  There was something about this solitary man that called for his own story.  I am delighted to see in this, the fourth book in the series his story, is finally realized.<br />Straif is the only descendent of his family line, years he has mourned this loss, years he has searched for the reason why.  On Planet Celta family is everything.  Ancient descendent from planet Earth, they value their lines, rites and traditions, and being the head of a first family carries great honor and responsibilities.  Only Straif is the last Blackthorne.  His ancient family estate has stood empty, unloved as he has journeyed hard and long trying to unriddle the curse that has plagued his family, but failed to claim him.  Finally coming home to Druida City, he hires Mitchella Clover to bring alive the long neglected manor house of his estate.<br />Mitchella has the key to discovering her heartmate and is determined to find him, but Blackthorne keeps cloaking the fact he is the one, knowing he cannot marry this woman.  To do so would seal the end of the Blackthorne line.<br />As with each set of lovers in Owens very original series, the premise is there is a Heartmate for true lovers.  As young men and women come of age they go through a series of three passages and if the have a heartmate they will generally glimpse this person.  Straif has glimpsed a woman, but like the family that bore him, their romance is doomed.  He must marry to produce heirs to carry on the Blackthorne line - heirs he hopes can survive.  The woman in his visions is Mitchella Clover, a woman who cannot have children.  This is very painful to her, as she comes from a very fertile family.  Her lack of the ability to have children is only magnified with so many nieces and nephews around her.  She longs for her own family, but knows her having suffered Macha's Disease stands between her growing love for Straif.  Mitchella soon learns Straif is her heartmate but he refuses to accept her because he believes it would be the end of the Blackthorne family.<br />There is a dark menace killing young first familiar members and as Straif tries to stop him, he fears the evil shall claim the one thing he loves - Mitchella.<br />Of course, there is another darling FamKitty.  This one is Drina.  Ah, sigh, if Straif and Mitchella would just listen to the smart know-it-all Drina!!  But such is the lot of a FamKitty!!<br />Owens paints with pictures, not mere words, pulling you into her very intricate world of Celta and kitties with telepathy and the power to speak.

Queen to two countries, two kings, she often was seen dressed as a man, riding a horse astride.  So it was not surprising she as patron of St. Jude' Abby, where women were taught to read, write and even fight.<br /><br />Lady Avisa de Vere came to the cloistered abbey when she was barely two-years-old.  There she was thrived in the freedom of learning.  She knows more than one language, is encouraged to speak her ideas and is trained as a warrior.  One of the most skilled fighters of the Abbey, Queen Eleanor calls upon her skills.  She wanted Lady Avisa to secretly guard her Godson, Christian Lovell, to prevent him from reaching Canterbury where he is to attend a wedding.  The political climate is about to heat up.  Becket (the troublesome priest...lol) Bishop of Canterbury has returned and King Henry is back, and Eleanor doesn't want Christian caught in the middle of the two powerful men.<br /><br />Soon Lady Avisa is having Christian \\"rescue\\" her from outlaws and entreat him to join a quest to save her sister, the diversion set up to keep him from Canterbury.  Christian is puzzled by this woman who uses a sword like a man, while Avisa must deals with her confusion of the world outside the cloisters and her growing desire for Christian.<br /><br />Jocelyn Kelley weaves a very imaginative tale that speaks to love, honor and ancient codes that bound women yet made them want to push beyond these imaginary lines.  The story might have been strengthened with Christian's POV, this is essentially a woman's tale so I understand the author's choice to eschew this.  It's a strong tale that should please Historical readers.<br /><br />Highly recommended for Medieval fans.	2005-05-26

Josie - as anyone familiar with small towns would expect - gets the cold shoulder and has to fight to earn her place.<br /><br />This book has all the right mix, but just misses target with me personally and why I am giving it four stars instead of five.  Why?  I was raised in small towns on both sides of the Pond and I know them intimately.  The sudden acceptance of Josie by the \\"small-minded gossips\\" just really stretched belief.  I found it hard to accept Josie suddenly wanting to be there, even more unreal to think everyone suddenly flipped a switch and ended up adoring her.

The Collectors were the rulers in this particular quadrant of the universe.  But their rule is not benevolent.

For these the Collectors employ the Shadowers.  The Shadowers hunt down and turn-in these rebels.<br /><br />The story starts on a hellish planet Calt, which is the `Dew Drop Inn' for the dregs of the quadrant (think of the bar scene in the first Star Wars Movie), where all creatures great and small come to do business.  Sabin has been tracking his latest quarry, but the target has proved elusive.  He only wanted to have a drink and relax.  He never expected to see the woman at the end of the bar.  Women like her are prey in this dive, so he cannot help but wonder why she is there.<br /><br />Moriah Cameron is a smuggler, only her ship was stolen, leaving her stranded on this hellhole.  Hoping to win money to pay her passage off the planet, she enters a game.  There is a brawl and Sabin manages to help Moriah escape, though her winnings are left behind.<br /><br />Moriah is not too happy with Sabin's protection.  If he was aware of how she was a smuggler, he would turn her in - or so she thinks.  Still, she has little option but to accept Sabin's ship as her ticket off Calt.  But rather than beg his help, she stows away on his vessel.  This puts her life in danger as she overhears confidential information.<br /><br />Sabin and Moriah are both strong-willed people, and in cases where the sexual attraction is deep, sparks fly.

Drawing heavily on Greek roots, they imbue this charming, first-person tale with sidesplitting humor and love.  I really appreciate writers who portray their ethnic heritage within their writing.  I do with my Scottish roots, so I just utterly adore when writers open up and use these rich textures to paint their stories and form their characters.  And the Carringtons paint with vivid, bold brush-strokes that show pure genius.<br />Sofie is in transition.  She was engaged to marry Thomas-the-(...)-Toad Chalikis - not that it was love, mind you - but being twenty-six and single was not easy in a Greek family.  It might not be love, but there are other uses for a man, such as carrying rugs up to her apartment.  Only, when she catches Mr. (...)-Toad on the day of her wedding locked in an embrace with her maid of honor (honor?), Sofie sees the handwriting on the wall, so to speak.<br />Since then, the lass has taken to rebelling against her family.  She stopped waiting tables at her father's and grandfather's caf&eacute;s (the caf&eacute;s are across the street from each other, mind you, even though there is long standing fuel between them!) dumps the groom, keeps the wedding presents and sets out to find her own way.  The biggest wedding gift was a six-unit apartment building her family bought as a nest egg for her new marriage.  Sofie now struggles to collect rent from her oddball tenants and also is taking over her uncle's detective agency.  So far, the cases haven't been all that exciting, such as dog hunting and wife tracking.<br />However, her newest cases does have promise.  Old Mr. Romanoff down the street - affectionately known as \\"the vampire\\" has vanished.  His equally creeping nephew came for a visit and suddenly the old man is nowhere to be found.  Odd, in the estimation of Sofie's office manager.  She insists Sofie find out what happened to the old vamp...man.  Then while tailing a wayward wife, Sofie lands in the middle of a shoot-out and is rescued by a sexy mystery man, Jake Porter.  Life is definitely looking up!  What is Jake doing in the middle of her cheating wife case?  Why is the wife wanted by the FBI?<br />It's a madcap, delightful story that is a gem from start to finish, showing the Carringtons can write anything they put their minds to.

What a talented, sensitive writer.  In this day where romance is dominated by `perfect people' I applauded the writer who recreates less than perfect characters and reminds us love comes in all forms and all walks of life.  The heroine is deaf, hearing-impaired to be more politically correct.  I have had two friends with hearing problems and knowing the frustrations they have put up with people's mishandling of them, it immediately put in with complete sympathy with McCarthy's heroine.<br /><br />Laurel Watkins is fed up with playing safe in her life.  She wanting some adventure, especially romance.  So she takes the plunge and makes a date On-line with a man called Russ.  She's excited meeting him in a coffee shop for their first date.  Only, things don't go the way she planned.<br /><br />Russ is really a special operative on the track of a man called Trevor Dean.  Trevor seeks out plain women that are naÃ¯ve, then robs them blind, stealing all their savings.  So when Russ makes the date with Laurel he is on the job.  Russ is taken with Laurel.  She is pretty, smart and doesn't let the hearing problem slow her down one bit.  She doesn't see it as a handicap and resents people who do.  Russ politely explains about Trevor, warns her from meeting men on the Internet.  Laurel, being a thoroughly modern woman, says fine.  She will stay off the Net provided he has a hot affair with her.  Naturally, Russ if floored!<br /><br />Russ wants to protect Laurel because he feels she's Trevor's next victim, but he is soon way past that, falling hard.  He soon has a sweet tooth for the lady who works in the candy store.<br /><br />McCarthy deals with Laurel deafness with forthright fashion, which has the reader applauding and cheering Laurel instead of giving her sympathy.  It's presented as this is a part of Laurel...so what?  It's great to see someone strike out against the stereotypical heroine, and with banners flying, gives you a steamy romance, great heart-stealing characters and one great read!  Mouth-to-Mouth gives you a great touchy romance with a smile.g, gives you a steamy romance, great heart-stealing characters and one great read!

In Get Bunny Love, a Zebra Debut Romance by Kathleen Long, it's more like run away train crashing rather than a simple attraction.  And Long's hero and heroine cannot be more opposite.  Get Bunny Love is not `bunny love' but the name of the heroine (I kept thinking of the old telly show Get Christie Love!).  Beatrice Love goes by the nickname of Bunny, and it tends to suit her better.  She is a graphics designer, working out of her home, but failing to make ends me.  So she answers the calls for an interview for an event planner for McNulty Events, owned by one Nate McNulty.  A family owned business, Nate is doing his best to prove himself, and he needs one special event to show his family he is here to stay.  He is a stuffy, control freak and that is reflected in the dismal offices Bunny faces.  Bunny is a New Age sort of lass, a bit of a free spirit, not what the natty Nate thinks is good for his firm, but he is desperate for an event planner.  Quickly, Bunny is arranging just not the big event - a dog show - but re-arranging Nate's office, his staff and even him.  Bunny would like to do more than re-arrange Nate, only he is already engaged to a woman his family deems the `proper type' for his wife.<br /><br />Nate must contend with finding himself and thwarting someone who is determined to ruin the dog show and Nate's chances of keeping control of the family business.  At times he is really a bit of a pain, but we know our heroine would soon have him sorted out.<br /><br />Kathleen Long gives you an engaging premise, charming characters and one fun read.  Long is a fresh voices coming from Zebra's debut line, and I am delighted with yet another of their talented finds and look forward to more her.	2005-05-21

Zebra is giving some fresh voices a chance to rediscover this style of madcap farce romance.  One is the very talented Flo Fitzgerald.  Another is Pam McCutcheon.  When I read The End, closing that last page, there was a smile on my face.<br /><br />Scott Richmond leave a charity gala.  He is bored with his society life.  This simple act changes everything.  He catches a teenage cat burglar trying to steal his family's jewels.  He has a very elaborate security system, which works to keep thieves out.  Failing that, it keeps them inside until the cops come to collect them.  Being this runt of a thief got in, Scott's curiosity tweaks his to know why she is trying to rob him.  He listens to her tail of woe, how her father was the valet to Scott's father and was dismissed with a merger pension and died penniless.  She spins a tale how she just wants to get enough money so she can go to Julliard and figures the money the gems would bring would compensate for the shabby treatment her father got from his after years of service.  Her tale wins Scott over and he lets her go - with the jewels.<br /><br />A short time later, Scott catches another female breaking into his home.  This time a bit more shapely.  Nicole the big sister of Chrissie the cat burglar, has discovered what her little sister did and she hopes to return the jewels to Scott, before the real `cat' is out of the bag - the jewels are fakes.  With Nicole's assistants, Scott sets off to learn what happened to the real jewels.  In their detective work, they are forced to play at being engaged.  Soon, both are secretly wishing their engagement was the real thing.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the comedic romance, with strong characters that make you care.

In this case more specifically Nessie made an Elevenses out of the business associate of the father of Marine Biologist Zach Wallace.  Wallace is coming home after nearly drowning in the Sargasso Sea.  He was on an expedition in search of a giant squid.  His return home is not something he is expected to be a happy occasion.  Angus, his father and he are estranged.  Worse, the father is under a lot of stress since he is accused of murdering his business partner.<br /><br />Things fall to Zach to help prove his father's innocent based on the claim there really is something in the loch, Nessie or otherwise, and it occasionally likes a people appetizer.  The sole defence Zach's father puts forth was that \\"something\\" are his business partner.  Of course, since this slander against Nessie comes on the fact Angus had just punched his partner in the face causing him to fall into the water, it doesn't help to make people believe Angus.  As the case goes to trial it becomes a media event - would you expect otherwise?  But this mania is blown full force when more people begin to go a-missing and half-eaten body parts are discovered along the shore of the Ness.<br /><br />Zach must have to come to terms with his father and their estrangement, build a bridge so he can mount a defence to prove Angus is telling the truth.  Not only must Zach put with news hounds, he must deal with Nessie Watchers, rival scientists and even a Knights Templar.<br /><br />Written in first person, Zach's narrative hooks the reader.  From Zach's coming to terms with his estrangement from his country of birth, his father, to just what is Angus really up to - did something get his partner or is this a convenient way to commit murder and get away with it - Alten keeps you guessing the whole way.<br /><br />Fans of Alten won't want to miss this one.

Though Master of the Moon is a stand alone title, you really will enjoy this even more if you have read Hot Blooded (a novella entitled \\"Seduction's Gift\\" kicks the series off), followed by Master of the Night.  Knight has a very original, inventive tale.  She takes old lore of Witches, Vampires, Faeries, Werewolves and mixes in Merlin, Arthur and the Gang, and creates something very fresh.  It's hard to recall, it's only been a year since she made her mainstream book debut with Jane's Warlord!!  Already, she is a force in red-hot romance!  Her tales are strongly written, well-conceived and she boldly goes where no writers have gone before, and does it with such panache!<br /><br />In this tale, you will meet characters you have touched upon in Master of the Night.  You will already know about Llyr, the King of the Faeries.  Llyr and his very evil brother.  Llyr riles one branch of the Fae - the Cachamwri.  His Nasty brother Ansgar rules the Morven Fae.  The brothers were cursed by daddy dearest on his death bed with a wish they cannot kill the other.  Well, being a nasty sort, Ansgar has gotten around this by killing the wives and children of Llyr.  In this battle to save the Fae, Llyr is seeking an alliance with the Camelot vampires and witches.<br /><br />Meanwhile back in the \\"normal\\" (lol) earth in present day, you meet Diana London.  She is a police officer in Verdaville, South Carolina.  Only, she is not too normal either.  She is a shapeshifter - a werewolf.  Diana is of the Dire Kind, a magical race conjured by Merlin as sort of a \\"police\\" to keep the vampires and faeries in line.  This makes her a great asset to Llyr in his struggle to save everyone from Ansgar's evil intent.<br /><br />Heads up, Angela Knight pushes the limited of everyday romance over into the romance-erotica blend called romantica.  So if you don't like blistering hot sex, and lots of it, then you and great aunt Tilly should give this one a pass.  Sorry, Ms. Knight makes no apologies.  If you don't like this sort of level of intensity, then go find a kinder, gentler romance writer.  Hey, there is room for all tastes in the Romance Market.  However, if you like your romance on the red-hot fiery side, but really want something more than erotica, you want a full-bodied tell that is fascinating, riveting, and so very original, then get all three Hot Blooded, Master of the Night and Master of the Moon.

They complains about the story line being unbelievable or a farce.  Well, not for one moment do I think Ms. Macalister every expected anyone to take her books serious.  She wants you to read for simple pleasure and to laugh till your ribs hurt.  As usual, Katie Mac delivers with both - simple pleasures and laughing till your ribs hurt.  People can huff and say I won't buy her again because she is silly.  Well, guess what, we do buy her for that very reason.  She is a FUN read.  Period.  She is not offering earthshaking discussions on the perils of life.  She is taking you an a rollercoaster ride into - well, who knows where she will take us next!

With these new demanding chores for her Guardian role, she thinks it wise to bone up and decides to check up on the necessary skills by checking in to a Guardian convention held in Budapest (and here we thought it was just another Trekkie...hum..Trekker gathering!).  Her former job was curious for her uncle, what landed her in the lap of Drake in the first tale.  Since she is heading in the right direction she agrees to courier another item of antiquity.

Shana Galen is another demonstrating she is a writer to keep an eye on.  In her debut novel, Galen has strong tale, with threads of delightful secondary characters promising more in a series.<br /><br />Set in England in the very early 1800s, Lady Lucia Dashing is manhandled by her drunken fianc&eacute; Reginald Dandridge.  To the rescue comes dashing...um...well sexy Alexander Scarston, Earl of Selbourne.  It's been give years since the earl has seen Lucia, and he is amazed how the week slip of a lass has gone into a sexy woman!

Alex is tempted by the adorable Lucia, but he has other fish to fry currently.<br /><br />Alex is a spy, and he has been asked by Lucia's father to find out what happened to her twin brother John.  John has gone a missing.  Lucia is determined to find her brother, too, but Alex really doesn't want her interfering or get in his way.  What Alex wants has little consequence, when the forceful Alex is determined to say the day.  As they work to solve the disappearance of John, they fall in love, but Alex believes he is too old for Lucia.  Lucia has other notions!<br /><br />It's an action packed Regency tale, that keep the reader turning page after page.

It's not an easy process, and if you cannot do it yourself, then you need to have compassion for those brave enough to achieve this amazing feet.  Only one in maybe one hundred thousand books ever see print.  So celebrate another writer who got that golden ring.  McFalls has a wonderfully fresh voice, which quickly pulled me into the story.

Currently in Bath taking the waters, hoping it will help his bad limp, he is a foul mood despite the teasing of his best friend  Lord Nathan Wynter, who is determined not to let his friend wallow in his fit of self-pity.  This day, Radford felt more than self-loathing - he felt trapped.  His mother arrived the night previous and is pushing Radford to find a bride.

Her first book Falcon's Desire (February 2003 was a Reviewers International Award Winner in Short Historical Romance - and impressive debut!), ensuring more \\"Falcon\\" tales. This book, Falcon's Honor (April 2005) is followed by Falcon's Desire (July 2005), so those of us who have waited for this next books of this promising historical writer gets a double treat.<br /><br />This one is the tale of Lord Gareth Faucon. Set in 1140s England, Gareth has made a vow to King Stephan to fetch Lady Rhian to her family. What sounded like a simple chore edges toward to a medieval version of the Ransom of Red Chief!<br /><br />Rhian is determined not to be fetched back to the bosom of her loving family. This family is not know to her. She's known little of her mother's side of the family, but rumors has run around they are evil and even worship the devil. They have never wanted to know her before so she has no intention of going blithely to them, arms open, just because some strange is supposed to marry her. At birth she was betrothed a man she's never heard of, and it just doesn't suit her plans to become the bride of someone she's never met.<br /><br />Gareth is having enough problems with the willful and resistant Rhian. Worse, he becomes aware that not only does Rhian hold notion of not returning to her estranged family, there is someone who has the same plan, but with a different mode of seeing this end. Assassins are following in their wake and dispatching Gareth's guard a few at a time in a grisly fashion. As they near their destination, the difficultly of his task grows as his attraction to the Lady also will causes interference with the king's plans.<br /><br />The characters are fun. Lynn writes with a growing strength in her voice, enabling her to paint her tale with clever characters, secondary as well as the hero and heroine, and give fresh touch to the typical medieval plot line, that shows her talent coming into it's own. I eagerly look forward to the third tale in this series.ng into it's own. I eagerly look forward to the third tale in this series.	2005-05-10

This one amazing tale from start to finish that will leave you clamoring from more from this new writer.<br /><br />Tempe Walsh is a translator.  She has a job with client Ray Decore.  Sounds simple enough.  She is to translate from Hindi to English and back again as needed as part of a deal with Kimali Khan, brokering a sale for a stature.  Tempe might raise eyebrows at the setting - Hot Harry's Bar in Bombay, but hey, a girl has to live a little!  Only trouble ensures when Tempe spots the statue is a fake.  Suddenly all hell breaks loose, resulting in her client getting killed.  Instead of standing and screaming, our intrepid heroine uses her lithe bod and her trusty earrings to escape, taking one \\"Strider\\" O'Brian (this is the third book I have reviewed this month with \\"Strider\\" heroes, glut from LOTR!), with everyone chasing in their wake.<br /><br />This is one delightfully wild, tongue-firmly-through-cheek tales that takes off and never lets up from start to finish.  It's seasoned with a wickedly funny sense of humor, that has a touch of movie adoration tossed in.  It is madcap comedy reminiscent of Hollywood romps of the 40s.  A great aim, but can the writer pull it off?  Yeppers, big time!  Hot Stuff is absolutely dead bang on target from the homage to films past to romance lovers at heart and those of us who enjoy a good belly laugh along the way.	2005-05-07

If you look hard at her backlist, while sold as romances, her books really aren't.  They are so much more.  She writes complex character studies, and since romance is a part of the make up of the human condition, it will play a strong thread through the stories.  But foremost, she is a writer who like to go where most romance writers fear to tread - or is permitted by their editors!  She like to challenge the reader, provoke them, make them think, so up front this is not your typical romance book.  For those seeking a richer story, told in the fashion you don't have see in romances today, then you will want to snatch up Susan Squires newest book.  Squires has been off the market for a year.  Changed publishers.  This switch gives her elbow room with the word count and the ability to tell her story as she wanted.<br />And wow what a story!!<br />As with most Squires' book, the hero is the grabber.  Ian Rufford is an English, living in the early 1800s.  He is sailing when pirates attack his ship.  He is taken prisoner, carried to Africa where he is sold into slavery to the very beautiful, but extremely heartless Asharti.  Ian is forced to trek across the desert while being cruelly punished by the vicious Asharti.  He comes to realize that Asharti is not just an evil woman, but a creature of the night, a vampire.  He thinks his nightmare is at end when he escapes.  Only there is no escaping Asharti and now Ian is that which he hates.  He is trying to make his way back to England and hopes there is and end to what he now is.<br />Elizabeth Rochewell has worked with her father an eminent archaeologist.  They are on a dig when a ancient pillar falls and kills her father.  So Elizabeth is returning to England.  On the ship, Ian and Beth meet.  They find kindred spirits in the other, a commonality in their love of adventure and foreign places, both abhorring their return to England and the strict dictates of Regency society.  They fall in love, with Ian resisting leading Beth into the life of what he has become.<br />Ian and Beth are strong characters in Squires vivid fashion.  They compel you to travel the emotional tangle of their lives as they seek the answer to what possesses Ian.  People looking for a vamp tale with fangs and all, should be warned the vampirism is handled in a very understated, compelling drama that takes you from Africa to Spain and England and then back.<br />Squires delivers on all levels.  Let's just hope it's not such a long wait until her next book!!They fall in love, with Ian resisting leading Beth into the life of what he has become.<br />Ian and Beth are strong characters in Squires vivid fashion.

They wish to pressure her into going to medical school, but at twenty-three, Chloe knows this is not the life for her - especially since she faints at the sight of blood.  This is a theme common to Stuart's writings, apparent if you are a long time fan - which I happen to be.

A pure case of opposites attracts to the power of ten.<br /><br />In this Stuart tale, Chloe is an American in Paris.

The parents refuse to accept one of their blood cannot be a doctor so they are keep the purse string tight hoping to bring Chloe to heel.  Chloe's roommate wants to dash off with her latest boyfriend for the weekend.  Only problem, she has accept a job to be translator for a group of businessmen for the weekend.  She hits on the idea of sending Chloe in her place.<br /><br />We quickly learn this was a bad idea.  That is the one sticking point of the whole tale.  Chloe is spirited to a secluded Chateau, and upon arrival the man hosting it want to send Chloe back.  Chloe is getting bad vibes about the whole situation, but instead of accepting him sending her back she convinces him to let her stay.  We are told Chloe can use the money and that she is restless looking for something to jazz up her life.  Still, those reasons seem just a tad week when she is having misgivings about this set up.<br /><br />These feelings of qualms continue to increase as she is introduced to the rest of the group, and they break into Italian.  Supposedly Chloe speaks only English and French, but actually she speaks nearly a dozen languages.  She thinks she covers well, listening to them discuss her and wanting her sent back to town.  Okies.  I would be out of there!  But since this is the Resident Genius of Dark Romantic Suspense, I let Stuart run with the tale.<br /><br />Chloe is immediately attracted to the sexy bad boy in the group.

He's been so deep undercover for a mysterious group called The Committee, and figures he will have to kill or be killed before the weekend is over.

It's often very hard to find good a Scots Dictionary or a Good Gaelic Dictionary.  This one is VERY good.  820 pages worth, not a little pocket size.  It has meanings, spelling variants,  pronunciation guide, information on when and were words are used denoting area and districts, grammatical information, and idioms & phrases.  What I like best about it - entomologies of the words.  So many dictionaries leave off the origins of words, which is so very important when writing history and historical fiction.<br /><br />It's painstakingly edited and without flaws from start to finish.  Best of all it's not teeny print.  The print is very clear and easy on the eyes!<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2005-04-14

This is a 13 part dramatization of Tolkien's work, not a \\"reading\\", but full BBC acting work caught for the magic of your mind.  It comes in a gorgeous sleeve box, with an inner sleeve that protects and hold four sleeved dividers.  Each sleeves fold out to contain 3-4 CD ROMS.  They are covered with maps of Middle Earth.  It lists the actors, and the narrator Gerald Murphy is absolutely perfect.  Ian Holm (playing Frodo here!), the late great Robert Stephens and a cast of couple dozen well chosen readers of the roles.  The Price is a STEAL...I cannot believe it doesn't cost three times this price.<br /><br />This is NOT a reading of the books but an abridge full radio dramatization.  So please understand the difference before assuming these are just the books read.  This is full acting, with sound effects, music, etc.<br /><br />A true experience for any Tolkien fan.

A winning point for American usage - it assumes the user has no prior knowledge of Scots, so it works very well for very basic beginners of Scots.<br /><br />It's set up with an accompanying audio CD (Sold separately; ISBN: 1842820265) which I highly recommend getting to use with the book.

After a dearth of writer Trish Jensen - no book since her Stuck With You, September 2001 for Dorchester Publishing - I am treated to two great Jensen efforts in one week! Without A Clue (Harlequin's Flipside) and now Phi Beta Bimbo from Dorchester. It's great to see this very talented, funny writer back in print.<br />This time Jensen asks the question - on the minds of women every where - who fares better in the workplace: the brassy bimbo or the plain Jane? Checking out if blondes really have more fun, Leah Smith decides for her doctoral dissertation for sociology to find out the bottom line. Trading in her mousy persona, drab brown hair and less than ample cleavage, she makes herself over into a bleached blonde, with a 'gravity-defying' chest. With mile-high spiked-heels and a miracle bra she takes on the question with 'hands on' determination. She hires on at Peachy Cosmetics with both personalities so she can get a real view of which one does best in the world of business. However, she doesn't realise Peachy Cosmetics is upset about recent leaks in formulae of their new cosmetics and has hired an security expert to plug those leaks.<br />Mark Colson is the security expert who has been hired to ferret out evil-doers of corporate espionage and the newest employee of Peachy Cosmetics is his number one suspect. He quickly spots she is posing as two completely different women. Ditsy blonde or more academic brunette. He feels it will be a matter of time before he catches her red-handed. But in order to catch Leah, he will have to trade secrets...<br />Jensen is so witty, charming and delightful, this book shines with her marvellous talent. It's great to have her back. Linda Howard was out of writing for a long spell at one point in her career and she came back to shoot to the top of her profession. I have a feeling Jensen will do the same!	2005-04-13

Her current projects is a Murder Mystery Weekend at a plantation.  However, the real mystery here is how poor Meg is going to survive the festival without turning into the corpse herself - not 'done in', but from a mortal faint from having everything go wrong!

He swore he had root canal surgery and explained he was not drunk - just before he passed out.  Well, that would have been fine if he waited, but playing dead to the world too soon has ruined the game of 'CLUE'.  One guest is a cat - really.  And things go to from bad to worse when the owner, developer Matt Rossi returns to his plantation where the event is being held and informs Meg she is trespassing.<br />Matt is an uptight business sort, but Meg is an irresistible force and she soon has her fiddlie-dee charm wrapping the man around her finger.  Not only does Matt not boot them out lock, stock and barrel, he agrees to play the corpse.  Meg sighs of relief that things are finally back to normal and running smooth, soon learns differently.  Her new corpse refuses to stay murdered, and her uptight, control freak of a 'body' is very warm and has designers on her!<br />The book is lively, charming and shows Jensen is sharp as ever.  This is just great fun from start to finish!!  Welcome Back, Jensen!	2005-04-12

But she really hit her stride with Day of Fire last May, the second book in the successful 2176 series for Dorchester Publishing.  The Book blew me away!  Nance is a near poetic writer, so that she wrote one of 2004 best Sci-Fi Romances really showed the range of her talent.  She dazzles me again with this tale of Techo-Thriller Suspense, leaving me believing there is anything Nance cannot write!<br /><br />Agent Daniel Chaplain, a computer specialist is running an intercept on a terrorists' computer transmission when it is interrupted by a message from Lokus.  Lokus is a `cyber soldier', a premiere hacker.  This is not the first time Lokus has caused problems with an operation Chaplain was involved in and he would like to see him shut down.  When he sees the name Isabella Q on a sex chat board on a web page of Lokus, Daniel has the odd feeling this may be a woman he was in love with once.  His Bella betrayed him four years ago when he proved her father falsified important scientific data.  Following her trail, he heads to Michigan to check on Bella, fearing that Bella just might be Lokus.  Daniel arrives on the scene to save Bella's life.  She was driving home on an icy road when her car is deliberately run off the road.  Daniel's timely appearance saves her freezing to death.  She is hiding `Fran' and artificial intelligent computer.  She created it using her father's original plans for which he was accused of falsifying information.  She plans on dropping the bombshell of `Fran' at an expose in a month's time.  Only Lokus has learned of Bella's plans and that she has `Fran' and plans to steal it from Bella and will do anything to get it.  Only Daniel stands between Bella and Lokus, but Bella cannot trust him after what he did to her father.  However, `Fran' seems to trust him!<br /><br />Nance delivers a taught sci-fi/techno thriller that has a relentless pace right to the finale.<br /><br />It has the same rock' em, sock `em power that Day of Fire delivered, the same nail-biting, cannot-put-down storyline that never forgets the romance.

They also took a tie with Best Story from an Anthology with License to Thrill from Marry Me...Maybe? and a third place with Sleeping with Secrets from Private Scandals.  The Awards only echo what fans already knew, they are the hottest writers to come out of the Harlequin line.  Be sure to check out their dazzling Sophie Metropolis (June 2005, Forge Books) a change of pace for the dynamic duo!<br /><br />In the middle of all their series they have running, they have their long running McCoys.  I love \\"family series\\", in the tradition of Nora Roberts' Macgregor series.  I come from a big family, Clan to the core, so these novels of a meddling family and a tight bond that keeps them together really hit home to me.<br /><br />`Tori' has run through the McCoy brothers, all solid alpha males, strong in family traditions and that tradition extends to all of them being in law enforcement in one form or another.  Now we look to the McCoy sister.  The sister is surprised by her full grown family.  Kate Buckingham is a defence attorney, showing the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.  She learns her biological father is alive, that she was adopted, and now has five hunks for brothers.  Very protective brothers!  As if that isn't enough upheaval in her life, she suddenly finds herself arrested for the murder of her fianc&eacute;.  Kate has been an independent woman, and thinks she can handle any situation, but being charged with murder rattles this belief.  Worse, she's nearly overwhelmed by her new protective brothers and father.<br /><br />But her brother isn't the only one flustering Kate.  There is gorgeous U.S. Marshal Harry Kinkaid.  Kat is startled to learn her fianc&eacute; was under the witness protection program, and she must set herself up as bait with Harry's help to catch the killer, despite all the McCoys protests.<br /><br />I REALLY appreciate these new Signature Select editions from Harlequin.

Her Quick books have been somewhat of a let down for this diehard JAK fan.  She is formula whether in Contemporary JAK or the Historical Quick.  A formula I adore, so I often forgive her things (such as a feel of word padding) I might not of another author.  I have been reading her and have everything she's ever written and until the last five years I would call her books \\"Keepers\\".  I'm not sure where the formula went \\"off\\", but it has in several of her books, especially her Historicals.  After reading Wait Until Midnight, I am glad I waited until paperback release instead of hardback.  It's not bad, and for any Quick/JAK fan it's a nice enjoyable visit to an \\"old friend\\".  But the formula lacks it's usual JAK dazzle.  She seems to hit and miss in the 2000's.  One powerhouse novel such as JAK's Falling Awake, then a so-so.  This is the so-so.  Enjoyable but soon forgotten.<br /><br />It has all the right Quick elements, just the mix doesn't gel with the perfection of other JAK novels.  Adam Hardesty comes into Caroline Fordyce's life, dark, dangerous and meaning business.  He's on the trail of blackmailer, who has turned murderer - or possibly a murderer who kills a blackmailer and intends to pick up blackmailing.  Adam is determined to find out which and put a stop to the threat to his family.  Caroline is the only link to the murdered Elizabeth Delmont, a medium in Victoria's England.  The diary with holds the threat to Adam's siblings is missing from the dead woman's home, and the only clues left behind - the corpse was wearing a wedding veil and a brooch pocket watch.  Nearly crushed in the killing blows from a poke, the watch is stopped at 12 o'clock.  The trail leads Adam to Caroline, since she was at the seance the night of Delmont's murder.  Caroline, too, is hiding secrets so Adam's forceful presence alarms her, despite the man himself intriguing her.<br /><br />Soon a second medium is murdered, with a broken watch left as a clue on the scene.  Only, this watch has Adam's name on it.  Fortunately for Adam, Caroline provides him with an alibi.  The mismatched duo of opposites attract (typical of all JAK heroes and heroines!) join forces to solve the murders, remove the threat to their families and fall in love along the way.<br /><br />Quick fans will enjoy this, though will hardly call it a `keeper'.  It's a nice enjoyable read, that could have been improved by tighter editing to speed the pace.  In the first 100 pages, Adam and Caroline are rarely in each other's company.  Also, JAK needs to rediscover the passion in writing romance, not just turning out her next book.  When she hits the target no one can touch her.  This one is just a little right of bull's-eye.  Not-devoted-fans, might want to give this a pass as they will be less pleased with this effort.  If you have never read Quick before, I recommend reading any of her earlier Quick novels for perfection to see JAK at her prime.r />Soon a second medium is murdered, with a broken watch left as a clue on the scene.

She uses this talent to create stunning weapons and statues.  But she is not just a regular armourer, she is from a family of people with psi power.  The \\"core family\\" uses their powers to combat forces of evil in the world.  Dela is not so strongly gifted, so she pours her psi power into the creation of weapons.  Having a deep love for swords and a collector of them myself, a character with the same passion really intrigued me.<br /><br />Hari is a tiger (love the imagery).  But like Dela he's more...much more.  He is a shapechanger.  Finally something besides werewolves...lol!  An evil Magi bespelled him, and has kept him prisoner in a puzzle box.  Dela is hunting antiques when she comes across the box.  She releases Hari and now he is bound to her.  Only her djinn from the bottle...hum box...is not a happy camper.  He's been imprisoned for two thousand years, so he's had time to build a royal mad on, not mention the backlog of hormones!<br /><br />Others covet the power and the box, are filling to kill to gain it.

When we last her was Master of Ecstasy (Dorchester Publishing, just reprinted so if you missed it before grab it now!)  Night Bites takes up from Master of Ecstasy.  Ganymede and Sparkle Stardust, those ole time-traveling troublemakers are up to their old tricks again.  When we last saw them it was 1785 and Ganymede looked like Paul Bunyon crossed with a Highland and poor sex-loving Sparkle Stardust was stuck in the body of a cat - a talking cat mind you.  Ganymede was running a time-travel come to an ancient Highland castle vacation business.  Only one problem, the owner of the castle one sexy vampire named, Darach Mackenzie, was still about and very unhappy the cosmic troublemakers were doing their thing in his ancestral abode.<br /><br />This time the table is turned.  Ganymede is stuck in the form of a cat, and Sparkle Stardust is up to her old mischief making.  It's 2005 and she wants to cause trouble for Cindy Harper and Thrain Davis.  This book is a delight from start to finish.  I laughed from page one to the very in.  It's sly, sexy and utterly a howl, showing Bangs at her very best.<br /><br />Cindy Harper is the owner of the Woo Woo Inn in New Jersey.  She opened the Inn six months before catering to two types of clients - the delusional or the curious.  She'd redone the Victorian manor, a la Adams Family, and  intentionally played to the souls seeking off the beaten path.  She loves technology, because the past is something that should stay...in the past.  She has werewolves, witches and vamps galore as customers.  Though Cindy does wonder why it's always were-wolves and not wereducks or werebunnines!  Even so, when Thrain Davis crosses her threshold she know the Highland vamp is not delusion or curious!<br /><br />Sparkle is now calling herself Prada Smith and with her `pet' cat Trojan, they are troublemaking cupids, looking to cause mischief in Cindy's well order, albeit unusual life.  And Thrain is the perfect temptation a.k.a. bait for Sparkle's impish fun.<br /><br />This stands alone, but it's so much fun when you combine it with Master of Ecstasy (a Reviewers International Organization Award of Excellence Finalist for 2004).

Barry blasted on the scene with Unearthed.  In the short time she has been published, her talent has catapulted her to the top.  She is a beautiful writer, that excels on so many levels.  Her Sci-Fi romances play on par with Indiana Jones in space.  She gives you cultures that are rich in lore and history, full of perils and monsters, and with strong female heroines who can stand toe-to-toe with their men and fight without flinching.  Sprinkled amongst these heart stopping, edge-of-seat adventures is a delicious humor that really sets her above the pack.  Unchained, her first book has been re-released, joining her Unearthed, Unleashed, Unraveled and now her newest, and likely strongest tale, Unmasked.<br />Quade's name was whispered through out the quadrant, they called him Laghato - the liberator.  For the past decade Quade has lived the life of a space pirate, robbing from the rich and giving to the poor.  A true Robin Hood, he is working in a desperate race to fight slavery.  He uses the money he gets from his robbing to pay for medication used to reclaim the memories of the slave zombies - people stolen against their will, their brain's fried so they obey their masters.  Underneath this valiant crusade is a fight to find his mother and sister who were taken years ago.  He will not give up until he finds them.  When he seizes the ship of Torrie Masters, the youngest child of the rich Masters shipping family, he gets more than he bargained for.<br />Torrie Masters is a beautiful redhead with a spirit to match.  The instant she looks into Quade's masked face, she knows she will not let him best her.  But he does - temporarily - seizing her shipment.  Torrie gives her word she won't send the galactic police on his trail in return for him not killing her.  Only she didn't promise not to track him down herself.  She does, and with her tiny light-beam computer NOD, she traces him to a warehouse.  However, she is caught by the black-marketers, and they plan on sending her to the slave auctions.  Quade uses her shipment of illegal meds to buy her from them.  Torrie is not happy, for she doesn't really comprehend the  danger that Quade saved her from.  Quade insists he has to go back to steal the meds, since they are needed to save the slaves he sends through Slipstream.  He insists Torrie go with him, since she, and only she, can track the shipment through Nod.<br />She and Quade do just that.  Only as they are racing toward the ship, under fire, Quade is stopped by a sad woman calling Laghato.  She gives him her two tiny daughters to save.  Torrie is almost ready to leave Quade behind, believing him a pirate and a slaver.  Only the look in his eyes as he holds the two children stops her from leaving him.<br />Soon Torrie learns there is a lot more to the mysterious pirate, learns how her family is involved with the problem of illegal shipments connected to the slavery.  Thus she begins a taught fight on the side of people who cannot defend themselves, at the side of the dangerous man she is falling in love with.<br />I love each of Barry's books, all earning a spot on my Keeper Shelf.

I could sit and read her prose without worrying where the words would carry me, just enjoying the beauty of her craft.  This gift is coupled with a second talent - a vivid imagination.  Jackson has taken us to Scotland where seven tears summons a Selkie and a ghost of a lonely piper still haunts and ancient castle.  She lured us down moonlit moors where smugglers still plied their trade.  More recently she has been taking us on one wild ride as the host of Fae fight the encroaching menace of the Goblin Horde as they peddle their dangerous Goblin fruit (and by the way, they were likely responsible for the mess in several cities of late!).  These tales mark Jackson as one of the most original writers in Paranormal Romance.  Often in Romance, you see books being similar.  No one touches Jackson.  She boldly blazes forth to write highly fresh tales, and Divine Fire is yet again one of these brilliant gems.<br />This time Jackson pokes her finger at Lord Byron and Frankenstein.  What really happened that weekend when they Shelleys, Byron and John Polidori wrote their tales of vampires and monsters?  Well, to learn the answer, you must approach Damien Ruthven.  A man with dark secrets and long memories of that night over a hundred years ago.<br />Brice Ashton has written a biography about Lord Byron.  She is surprised to get a message from Ruthven telling her she made three mistakes.  Three mistakes only he holds the knowledge to correct.  Intrigued, Brice accepts the invitation with the belief Ruthven has in his possession documents about Byron and Lady Caroline Lamb.  Only the knowledge is not on paper, it's locked inside Damien's head.<br />In 1816, Dr. Johann Dippel invites Lord Byron to his chateau with the offer of curing his epilepsy.  He did.  But it had side effects that have caused ripples through the centuries.  Ruthven's summoning of Brice now puts her in danger as there are those who want Ruthven to atone for that long ago night when vampires and monsters were born.<br />To say any more than that, would take the edge off this highly charged romance tale that delivers on so many levels.  Once again, Jackson weaves her magic as few can do!t long ago night when vampires and monsters were born.<br />To say any more than that, would take the edge off this highly charged romance tale that delivers on so many levels.

This book really fills that gab for words of Scottish origins. It gives history, origins and means of all the great Scots words like muckle, drookit, gawkie, flunkey, kenspeckle, pernicktie and more.<br /><br />So answer the riddles of why a black sixpence was forbidden currency, cauld coal not something someone celebrated or why a man better duck if he called a woman a maggie-rab!<br /><br />Great fun, something I think transplanted Scots would truly enjoy.  Also a great resource for writers.	2005-02-03

But the help they seek is not for the asking, they must \\"summon\\" their warriors, their marshalls. They are bound by magic, yet within the universe where they live the magic is waning, so they cannot fight the terrible monsters waiting to invade their beautiful kingdom. The Marshalls of Lladrana are bound to follow their ancient traditions to fight in the only way they can...summon the warrior from a distant land, one who leaves behind the desire for their own world, one who will pick up the sword. Or else Lladrana is doomed. <br /> <br />Alexa Fitzwalter is an everyday lawyer on unmagical earth. She's on an errand in the mountains of Colorado that has her doubting her sanity - she's following a song. Her life is at a point where she's not happy. She's filled with remorse over the death of her close friend, and worse, she is hearing things no one else does, such as chants and a gong. Only, this isn't the Gong Show. She's not expecting to be \\"summoned\\". To Alexa a summons is a legal paper served, telling you need to show up in court. This summons as is far from that as...well Alexa is in for a BIG shock. Alexa's journey starts with the words, \\"Help us. Come to us. We need you here as no one there ever will.\\" Unable to resist the lure, she follows the summoning, dropping into Lladrana almost Alice-through-the-rabbit's-hole, into a realm of monsters, of guardians losing their power, and a whole world that will depend upon her to save them. She lands - literally in this foreign realm, no by your leave, no welcome wagon, no take me to your leader. And that is just the beginning. <br /> <br />She little understands the intricacies of this unusual land, cannot understand the language. Yet, armed with only her wits, the help of a mystical companion and the sexy chevalier Bastien, Alex must assume her new role as one of the Marshalls of Lladrana. Alexa must discover skills from within herselfshe had no idea existed in order to battle the encroaching menace. Then she will have to face the ultimate decision, return to her world or stay with Bastien in this new land where she is needed. <br /> <br />Once again, Robin D. Owens gives us an alternative world, as richly defined as few futuristic/paranormal writers can deliver. In this one, instead of the Heartmates and kitty Fams of Celta, we have the first of three ordinary women, who are summoned to save Lladrana and learn they have the power within them to make a difference, to be more than they thought they could be. Owens has always impressed me with her magical ability to create a paranormal realm, people it with interesting characters that you care about and within a highly developed alternative universe. You just don't read about her 'worlds', you enter them. I especially compliment Owens on her deft use of Multi-POV (Point of View) that permits the readers the fullest enjoyment of knowing all the characters and their emotions. It's the difference between a paint-by-numbers landscape and the sheer brilliance of a Turner watercolor. <br /> <br />In a time when the market is screaming for new directions within the Romance Genre, looking for stories with more substance, this is just what you need. Futuristic/Fantasy with heart, soul and endless adventure. On occasion, I see comments on this style of book as not an \\"easy\\" read. Maybe. It depends upon the commitment of the reader. Frankly, I think it's so much more - it a worthwhile read, that delivers on all levels that take you away to a magic world where all things are possible, even within yourself. 'Guardian\\" is the first of three \\"Summoning Books\\". Based on this tale, I eagerly await the next two.	2005-01-18

Most of the time, I have to grit my teeth to get past the anachronism, Yankisms and general lack of really knowing Scotland, in order to read a Scottish Historical romance.  Two of the best writers of this genre of Sue-Ellen Welfonder and Susan King.  Few touch their level of understanding of the history, the people of Scotland.  This is one of King's best, without doubt.<br /><br />Angel Knight, originally seemed a rather silly title to me, but it soon became apparent it's perfect for this tale.  Drawing on the real history of when Edward I captured and made prison of Robert the Bruce's wife, sister, daughter and Countess of Buchan (the woman who crowned Bruce King).  The English king committed the unbelievably cruel act (even by his standards!) of fashioning wooden cages for Christina Bruce and the Countess of Buchan, and hanging the cages from the walls of Berwick.  Twelve-year-old Marjorie Bruce had one on the Tower of London.  They were left out in public site, to live, through the harsh elements.  Susan King draws on this atrocity and creates another Christina.  She is the Lady of Castle where a fortune in gold has been hidden.  She burns the castle in defiance of the English and tries to escape.  She is captured and meets the same fate of being imprisoned in a cage from the rampart of her own castle.<br /><br />Gavin Faulkener is an English knight.  But he's on Edward's bad side for voicing complaint against the English violence in the Sack of Berwick.  He has been put in charge of the half burnt out castle, as punishment and told to repair it - and find the gold.  He is horrified when he finds Christina near death.  He removes her from the cage, marries her to give her protection, believing she will die.  She recovers, and though is thrilled to no longer be held in a cage, she's upset at having an English knight as husband.<br /><br />It's a beautiful story told with love, romance, and adventure, yet with the true spirit of Scotland and a love for its history.  It just doesn't get any better than this.and adventure, yet with the true spirit of Scotland and a love for its history.  It just doesn't get any better than this.	2005-01-13

Well, you knew I could not resist that pun.  But it's quite true.  This is a great book to give your special gal-pal, because she will simply delight in the witty book.  Woof-Man takes the old premise that man still have a wee bit of the primitive in him, that all those movies with Lon Chaney were on the right track.  Man is a dog.  But the writer understands making such rigid generalities is wrong.  There are all kinds of men, just as there are all kinds of canines.  So she sets out to prove this premise by examining all dog breed.  She looks at their nature, their habits and how to, hopefully, train them.  The final comment on each breed is the life expectancy of the relationship...hum...ownership?<br />It's written with a breezy style and makes it one fun read.

A strange cat shows up and begins to play matchmaker.  It catches peppers attention, then dashes in front of the galloping chargers.  Pepper rescues the cat, and Walker MacPhail rescues Pepper from being trampled by the horses.  Pepper is struck<br /><br />that MacPhail is her true knight in somewhat shining armour, but then he opens his mouth and ruins the shimmering illusion by berating her for being stupid and risking herself for the cat.<br /><br />MacPhail is also a member of the Three Dog Knights jousting team and once was the man to beat.  But sort of like John Wayne in the Quiet Man, MacPhail injured his opponent in a previous match, and now keeps to the sidelines, training others in Knightly Ways.  Pepper is determined to convince him she is his destiny, but our lad in plate is a wee bit resistant to the notion.  It's up to Pepper and the magical kitty to see things are put to rights.<br /><br />Macalister captures the festive fun of the Ren Faires completely, bringing the jarring clash of contemporary settings and ancient codes into a wonderful mix that will delight anyone wanting to read a book that makes them happy!

To find her writing in first person is jarring.  Up front, take my review as a person who doesn't care for first person writing.  Me, I, Mine...can get so redundant that they stick out like a sore thumb in my brain.  That is why I am giving this book four stars.  I am not sure why she felt the story had to be in first person, other than maybe trying to draw the market from Chit Lit.  It severely limits the story to the first person point of view, not allowing me to know the hero better.  It was very distracting, in a story if told in third person could have been five stars.  Blair - the first person comes across as \\"talking to the reader\\".  It was a style that just came across flat for me.  Back to the days of old Sam Spade narratives?  I sincerely hope not.  So please read my review knowing that is MY tastes.<br /><br />As for the storytelling, it's Howard's classy style all the way.  Blair Mallory is a gal with everything on the ball.  She was the \\"it\\" girl growing up, a cheerleader who married the rising political star, Jason Carson.  After four years, Blair's Miss Perfect life is not so perfect.  She wins a large settlement in her divorce, thanks to holding damning evidence over the not quite so perfect Jason.  She takes that and opens a coed fitness center called \\"Great Bods\\".  Once again, Blair is on the bright side of life.  She really loves the business, the people working for her.  Only problems - along the lines of \\"Single White Female\\"  - starts to intrude into her new remade perfect life in the form of Nikki.  Nikki joins \\"Great Bods\\" and soon it's clear to all she's remaking herself into an image of Blair.  Nikki changes her hair to match Blair's, her clothing is just like Blair's.  But instead of adoration, Nikki hates Blair and everyone seems to be aware of this.  There are a lot of complaints about Nikki, so when it comes time  to renew membership, Blair refused to resign Nikki.  Nikki pitches a hissy fit, then storms off.  That should be the end of that - right?  Not in fiction!! lol.<br /><br />That night, as Blair starts to go home, someone shoots at Blair.  At least she thought they were shooting at her.  Blair instantly jumps to the conclusion that it's Nikki.  Blair calls the police and when they arrived, Blair is stunned to find Nikki dead with a bullet in her.<br /><br />In comes Wyatt Bloodworth, police detective.  Naturally, Blair once dated Bloodworth, still is attracted to him.  The press picks up on that Blair witnessed the killing.  So when the second shots ring out this time at Blair for real, the reader wonders if it's because she witnessed Nikki's crime or if Blair was the target all along.<br /><br />As Wyatt and Blair untangle the questions, they naturally fall for each other.  When Nikki's killer is caught everything seems fine, until Blair's brakes are cut, bringing up the question<br />again was Blair the target all along.<br /><br />It's a very taut book that will keep you on the edge of your seat.  If it just hadn't been written in first person.  Let's hope this is a quickly passing trend and Howard goes back to third person so the whole story is fleshed out, not just the 1st person point of view - at least for my tastes.kki pitches a hissy fit, then storms off.

Isadora and Juliet have taken a vow never to have anything to do with men again, but Sophie knows there is only one way to have the child she wants.  As dreams of a green-eyed stranger haunts her, she is startled to discover the wounded stranger - with green eyes - by the side of her favourite bathing pool.  She lays hands upon him, healing, but she cannot resist him so she uses the night to father the child she so desperately wants.  She leaves him sleeping and healed, and her with the child she craves.<br />A year later, still haunted by the visions of the angel who healed him, not quite believing her real, Kane returns to discover if the woman was real or a product of his being wounded. He finds the angel, only to discover she is not an angel, but a witch, and has his child.  He wants to marry her, yet Sophie is ever mindful of the curse and how his life will be lost if she binds herself to him.  However, fate pushes them together, when Shandley, a man who desire Sophie, kidnaps her child.  Kane and Sophie must join together to save their child from the evil Shandley.<br />It's Jones at her very magical best.

I love something that is fresh and original.  Unfortunately, sometimes readers are slow to shift gears and enjoy the sheer brilliance and fun, simply because it's different.  It breaks<br />the rules of writing romance.  Well, I am here to say, break those rules baby when you can deliver something totally dazzling.  And that is what Cathy Clamp and C.T. Adams do with<br />Hunter's Moon.<br /><br />An ex-Mafia hitman, Tony Giodone was turned into a werewolf by a mystery lady.  She did not take the time to give him the FAQs of wolfdom, and face it, watching Lon Chaney films just does not fill the gaps.  So Tony Giodone is still trying to get his feet...um, paws...under him.  It written from Tony's first person POV (point of view), and shame on you Clamp and Adam for daring to break the rules, how dare you be so innovative, so refreshing!  Just hurry and do it again!<br /><br />The sexy romance plays ala Mike Hammer.  Tony meets his new client, one Suzi Quentin.  She wanted someone offed.  Well, this is child's play to our boy...um...wolf...Tony.  Only she knocks him for a loop when she tells him the name of the person she wants killed - herself!  Poor Suzie is really stuck with the family from Hell and being dead is better than living with them one minute more.  Only problem is Tony the pony...um...wolf...catches Suzi's scent.  Wolves in the wild mate for life and Tony suddenly finds his mind on the same track.  He has been hit with the near crippling need to mate with Suzi - for life!<br /><br />Tony is being dawn into a dark coven with secrets, secrets that give him the key to his new lifestyle.  So he must battle this menacing evil, claim Suzi for his life mate, and learn what to do about those pesky dog hairs on his suit!<br /><br />Both men and women should enjoy this witty, action-paced romance.

Well saddle up partner, slap iron and wrangle Teresa Bodwell's Loving Mercy. It's set post Civil War era and gives you all the dust, doggies and a sexy cowboy that any dyed-in-the-wool Western fan can want. Mercy Clark is a widowed rancher. She's driven her herd of cows to Abilene to market them, desperate for the money they will bring. Now she has to make the return trip. Should be easy since she doesn't have the cows? Well, she has to travel five hundred miles through untamed frontier, carrying all that cash. It's important she get back with all the money, because she needs it to save her land from a greedy neighbor who will use anything to get Mercy's ranch.<br />Enter Thad Buchanan, Civil War veteran, he has been making a living off his poker playing. He needs a guide to get him from Abilene to his sister's home in Fort Victory - yeppers, five hundred miles away! Mercy needs a bodyguard, but the handsome gambler is not quite what she had in mind. He offers to pay her in gold if she will guide him to Fort Victory, but being an intelligent woman Mercy doesn't entirely trust the too handsome man with the gentle manners and a smooth way about him. After all, she's sworn off men for good...hasn't she? Looking into Thad's sexy eyes has her forgetting that promise. Used to handling women with the same skill he handles the cards, Thad isn't quite prepared for a pistol packing, whip-snapping Mercy.<br />Bodwell has a strong voice, is rich in her period detail and is able to draw the readers into this vibrant tale.

The later presents Athelstan with a beautiful gold and silver sword worthy of a king. But as Harald accepts the sword, Athelstan proclaims &quot;...you show all men to witness that you are his subject.&quot; Naturally, at this slight of hand Harald is less than pleased. Instead of rebuffing the claim without delay, Harald permits Athelstan to depart and return to England. Months later, King Athelstan is holding a festival in London when a messenger arrives from King Athelstan, accompanied by thirty of Harald's men and a small boy. When Athelstan demands to know the meaning of this, the messenger replies that the child is Harald's son by a serving wench and Harald bids him to foster the child. However, Athelstan bides his time and Harald's men were permitted to depart to Norway. Instead of detesting the boy, Hakon, he was raised as a king's son, but in the Christian faith. The ultimate revenge.<br />Little did Harald foresee that simple case of &quot;ranking&quot; between royals would set forth forces to change the history of Norway. Because Hakon was raised as a Christian, when he returns to a pagan homeland he is determined to stamp out the Old Gods. This results in the banishment of a powerful Viking chieftain condemned for a killing. Thorvald Asvaldsson, and his son Erik set forth on a perilous journey, accompanied by the seer Ragnar. Erik goes on to be known in history as Erik the Red.<br />Larson, obviously a fan of the Mitchner type saga, gives the reader history, ugliness and all. It's not a &quot;politically corrected&quot; version, but portrays murder, sackings, rape, slavery, beatings...well, history as it was, not how we would like it to be. It shows how Christianity conquered the world by going after the nobles, knowing if they converted them they would make their subjects follow suit.<br />The style is very strong, with a natural prose that pulls the reader along with the epic tale. Some telling the reader of the story, instead of the action speaking for itself might bother some, but frankly, that was how most historical fiction has been written.

Katie Macalister with her Noble Intentions gave us delights and out-right howls as she blithely waltzed her way through Regency England. In her second book, she taught us romance with Improper English, a brilliantly witty book with characters to live long in the imagination and heart. Her third book found her once again in Regency era, and she proved yet another time she has a way with the clumsy heroine. Her fourth full book finds Katie back in contemporaries, this time doing to the Scots what she did to the Brits in Improper English. Another of her `first person' adventures that will have you laughing till your sides are sore. Personally, I find writing in 1st person a pain, and I usually have a problem reading them. It makes me feel like I am crawling around inside someone's head. However, Katie Macalister is at home in first person, a master at it, so she soon makes one forget this `immediate' narrative is not how everyone should do it. Katie avoids all the 1st person pitfalls that make the structure slightly claustrophobic with all the I, me and my...she sparkles, intrigues and is just one of the freshest voices to hit romance (and young adult, too, as Katie Maxwell for Dorchester's Smooch Line).<br /><br />So buckle up, for Katie gives you romance, love and the whole damn thing - sheep included. She blows the lid of the time honoured secret of what DOES a Scotsman wear under the kilt? It is wildly comical and fast becoming Katie's trademark - she gives you the less than perfect heroine. I find it so comfy her females are so very human.<br /><br />Kathie Williams is a mystery writer in England for a writers' conference. She's a bit overwhelmed by jet lag and ends up sleeping through a big part of the first day - unfortunately it is in the hotel lobby! Not bad enough she naps in public, she drools on her new silk blouse! Embarrassed, Kathie is ready to crawl under the table and hide ...but for one thing: Iain MacLaren. The handsome Scotsman is also attending the mystery writers conference. Sparks fly between the two and suddenly, she believes in love at first sight. Kathie falls desperately for the Alpha Scot, so she is delighted when Iain insists she come visit him in Scotland after the conference ends.<br /><br />Wow what a storybook romance, right? You meet the man of your dreams, he is to-die-for sexy, has a kilt and does not mind you drooled on yourself in public! Wrong, as Kathie soon finds out. Iain is divorced with two grown sons. The first one hates her on site and thinks she is a floozy. Luckily, the second one is more welcoming. But then, waiting for them is Iain's neighbor, once upon a time lover, and she is determined to break up the romance in quick order.<br /><br />Despite a man less than forth coming about his true feelings, a neighbor who wants to bury the hatchet - in Kathie's head, a son-in-law to be from hell, and flocks of smelly sheep, love finds a way. Then Kathie has to face a Scottish wedding from Hell, with her domineering mother and Iain's first wife making it the wedding event of the year.<br /><br />Katie writes about Scotland with a true voice. Being a Scot, I often have to cringe at some of the mistakes of Yank writers when they use Scotland as a setting.

At the time, that was so painful, I did not notice I cracked open the sternum of my ribcage. I woke in great pain during the night and had to be rushed to hospital. The immediately solution was stuff me into a corset to where I could not breath - crushing my ribcage. Surprisingly, you get \\"sort of\\" used it as the weeks pass, but you really are amazed at the women that lived their whole lives in that fashion. It's small wonder they swooned!<br /><br />So, recalling how bad it hurt to laugh with a corset, I am eternally grateful that Katie Macalister waited until I was out of the bloody thing to release the Corset Diaries. Had I read this while trussed up like a turkey, I would have been in serious trouble! I would so hate to have my demise on Ms. Macalister conscience! And I fear that would have been the result. This book is just such a howl.<br /><br />Katie's is a brand of humour that makes one feel good. It's a special gift. Her books won't change the world, solve the rain forest problem or go down into the history of literature, but they are sheer fun. And this one is another special gem from a very talented writer.<br /><br />It's a funny, witty, sexy, Benny Hill - Monty Python bawdy romp. Some people don't get Brit humour, so they miss all the fun. Sorry for them. The rest of us shall delight in this tale of Tessa, a less than stunningly perfect, 39-year-old who takes on the chore of acting the role of Duchess for a week, corset and all. Frankly, I felt for Tessa when her heart goes pitter-patter over her leading man Max - her \\"Duke\\". Rapid breaths in steel stays is just dangerous! Its wickedly sly dialogue charms us as \\"Duchess\\" Tessa adjusts to life as it was over a century ago. Stocked full of charming characters, it's a delight from start to finish.<br /><br />Katie's brings her special touch to this amusing story. Still, I am so glad I read it now, instead of four months ago when my brush with a corset left deep impression on me - figuratively and literally!!<br /><br />Keep spinning the magic, and we shall keep laughing!<br /><br />2004 Reviewers International Organization's Award of Excellence Finalist and 3rd Place Winnersh with a corset left deep impression on me - figuratively and literally!!<br /><br />Keep spinning the magic, and we shall keep laughing!<br /><br />2004 Reviewers International Organization's Award of Excellence Finalist and 3rd Place Winner	2004-12-18

Etymology is often left off from even good dictionaries these days in effort to cut costs and online website dictionary totally ignore this part, so there is often no quick reference to check when words came into use.  This book fills that gap.<br /><br />I am not sure the set up is perfect, but then unsure if any form would be.  This one starts with 1150, listing words that came from that period, then jumps to 1350 to 1470, then 1500, 1550, 1600, 1650,1700, 1750, 1825, 1875, 1900 and 1920.  1950-1990 are done by decade.  It has an index at the end so you are able to look up a word if you are unaware of the time period and back track.<br /><br />This is a very useful resource for writers looking to rid their words of those pesky anachronisms.	2004-12-14

This is typical JAK at her very best, but at the same time just a wee bit different from her usual range, pushing over more into her Jayne Castle territory.  With Paranormal Romance hitting big numbers this one should do well for her.<br /><br />It's a very clever story, a bit more intricate than some JAK's of late.  Isabel Wright works at the Belvedere Center for Sleep Research at in \\"iffy\\" job of dream analyzer.  She is a Level Five dreams, and has a preternatural talent of being able to tell everyone what their dreams mean.  She is happy with her steady job and  finally has money to splurge on things to change her life.  She sees herself as a woman with so much inside, but fears the rest of the world dismisses her as humdrum.  She wants a man to notice her, think she is a vivacious woman with a lot of risk and daring to her character.  She has a new wardrobe, and a haircut Mr. Nicholas her hairdresser assures her makes her sexy.  But with an ex-boyfriend still calling her Izzy and says her haircut is \\"cute\\", she fears her dreams - real dreams may never come true.  Worse, her cushy job is on the line.  Her boss the elder Dr. Belvedere has just died, and the Dr. Belvedere the younger is determined to take the sleep clinic into commercial application.  Isabel sees this as a violation of the decades of solid research done by his father.  When she resists his plans, he fires her, little understanding that Isabel is the key to the whole company and it's survival.  Isabel sees this is a chance to go freelance, but Belvedere, once he realizes his stupidity, is determined to lure her back to the firm before it goes belly up.<br /><br />Ellis Cuttler is a freelance operative for a Black Ops firm called Frey-Salter - a highly classified government agency - that works in the shadows.  One of their workers Katherine Ralston has been murdered and Ellis blames himself.  Though working on his own, he still accepts work for Frey-Salter and blames himself for Katherine's death.  He felt he should've seen it coming, because he is not your usual operative.  He uses his dreams to \\"manhunt\\".  He goes to a scene of a crime, stores all the images and facts and later uses his Level Five dreaming to analyze the information - actually walking through the murders as if he were there.<br /><br />Ellis is a patient of Isabel's and she is concerned about the dreams of violence she analyzes for him, fearing they are real memories.  She knows him as patient #2.  He's met him in his dreams and calls her \\"tango dancer\\" in his mind.

The 2176 ladies have really taken us on a rollercoaster ride of adventures this summer. Susan Grant conceived the series of five books, and Dorchester publishing permitted her to take the \\"bit between her teeth\\" and run, selecting three very talented writers (Kathleen Nance, Day of Fire; Liz Maverick, The Shadow Runners; Patti O'Shea, The Power of Two) to following the path she blazed.<br /><br />It's not often writers have as much say or control that goes in a series such as this. It's a \\"bible concept' - meaning several writers are given a premise. They will have certain characters, certain points in the plots they need to hit, but then each writer takes their turn in the showcase. It's interesting to watch this unfold. Grant, you expect to knocks your socks off. A PR man's dream, Grant one of the first women in history to attend the US Air Force Academy, a former Air Force instructor pilot and now currently a 747 jumbo jet pilot for United Airlines, brings all that skill and knowledge into creating her two tales. The first was The Legend of Banzai Maguire. We meet Bree Maguire and her wingman, Lieutenant Cameron \\"Scarlet\\" Tucker. Scarlet was not only her wingman, but she was Bree's best friend. They are taken prisoner, put into suspended animation, and then awakened in the year 2176.<br /><br />Through the other three books you track Bree awakened by Prince Kyber, to the realities of this new world. She escapes with Seal Commander Tyler Armstrong, and she has since become a rallying cry to the world. People want to use her as a spur to provoke the fight for freedom; others want to kill her to prevent that. So she has been on the run, all the time believing her best friend Cam was dead.<br /><br />Only, resourceful Cam is far from out of the picture. Prince Kyber is still singed by what he views as Bree's betrayal, so he is not so willing to trust another lady from the past. However, Cam has learned Bree's been captures and is held prisoner, and Kyber is the only one Cam can turn to for help. Kyber soon finds out Cam gets what she wants, even when she wants him! I won't say any more, for you will want to experience this fast pace, pedal to the metal series for yourself.<br /><br />It's hard for writers to come through with their best writing when working within the \\"bible format\\". But these four writers have done just that! It's a powerful series, so \\"today\\", with strong heroines who can be all, do all. Each writer brought their own talent to their tales, but all five tales blend seamlessly into one great series. And Grant's powerful finale is just the way to end it!<br /><br />Kudos for Grants original concept, to Dorchester Publishing for allowing their very talented writers to boldly go where none have before, and to Susan Grant, Kathleen Nance, Patti O'Shea and Liz Maverick for delivering 110% in the dazzling series!<br /><br />2004 Reviewers International Organization's Award of Excellence Finalist and 2nd Place Winnerone Cam can turn to for help.

But one should go into the book \\"reading between the lines\\".  The forward from Joseph Sickert sounds the warning.  He endorsed this book.  Sickert had clear cut aims in seeing the view of this book slanted in one direction, precisely the same determination that saw the falling out between Stephen Knight (author of Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution) and Joseph Sickert in the 1980's.  Stephan Knight remained convinced of Walter Sickert's involvement in the case - what Joseph Sickert desperately wanted to counter.  That tells you up front Joseph Sickert had an agenda, and while he offered \\"facts\\" to support his claim, they are offered with the single intent of removing the blood of the Ripper, a stain on his family's heritage.  If you did not accept his take on this case, you did not get the information.<br /><br />Sorry, that taints the whole objective of his \\"repeated\\" tales and the removes \\"unbias\\" from the writer's effort.  Sickert had a \\"natural reluctance\\" to reveal all the information he held.  Why finally reveal it to Melvyn Fairclough?  Because he finally found the one person to tell the story how he wanted it.  Walter Sickert was supposedly possessed of an extraordinarily retentative memory, which Joseph, again supposedly inherited.  Quoting the author \\"Joseph has inherited this faculty and remembers everything his mother and father told him.\\"  Such a sweeping statement shows immediately the author accepts every word as total verbatim, as fact.  I possess a similar talent for memory, but I would NEVER say I remember everything.  No one can!  Time, attention and perception all play a role in what we can recall, how we recall.<br /><br />While I don't agree with Cornwell's \\"case closed\\" book sighting Sickert as the Ripper, I do hold the opinion that Sickert was involved deeply in the White Chapel murders.  Some of the tales he related were of things no one but someone there would be able to say in such details.  One only has to look at Walter's paintings to see his closeness to the case.  The very titles of his paintings are clues that should not be ignored.  Walter Sickert unloaded these facts to his family.  Do you seriously believe he would admit his own involvement?  Or would he rather do as he actually did, present the knowledge as \\"second hand\\"?<br /><br />This book is exciting, but should not be accepted as the \\"final solution\\".  It is evidence presented by a writer influenced by his source's own drive to see his family's reputation restored, who likely did not get the whole truth handed down from Walter Sickert to begin with.<br /><br />So read the book for the evidence, but leave the conclusions - when balanced with other works and evidence - to someone less admiring of their subject, a person determined to see this book written from one point of view.he related were of things no one but someone there would be able to say in such details.

Her first book demonstrated her talent, but there were a few nagging problems, as if she did not fully know her hero and heroine and how they would react, or she made them do things that seemed totally against their characters.  In this book, you see none of that.  Her craft is stronger, and a subtle deftness is in her prose that makes this book so strong, so perfect.<br /><br />The Spare is a touch more sedate, elegant, with a dram of Paranormal/Gothic saying Jewel really has found her meter.  This book is just so \\"assured\\" and it lets the reader settle into the spiraling story and enjoy it completely.  It really leads me to look forward to her third book.<br /><br />Sebastian Alexander is \\"a spare\\" - a younger son who never thought to rise to the earldom destined for his brother.  He has pursued a career in the Royal Navy and had his life mapped out.  He loved the life at sea.  But suddenly he is beached.  The \\"spare\\" is now an earl.  Through a series of mysterious events, his brother is dead.  Sebastian is wounded in battle and is recovering when news comes of his brother's murder.  He must come to grips with his fate and the trouble surrounding his brother's death.  There was a witness to the crime, one who could supply the answers to the dark riddles - Miss Olivia Willow.  She was there that night, and was almost killed as well.  She is the key to Sebastian learning why his brother died.<br /><br />Only opening that key is not as easy as he hoped.  Olivia, a vexingly beautiful redhead, cannot recall what happened that night.  Three days of her memory is missing.  Haunted by the ghost of his brother, Sebastian thinks this loss of memory is too convenient, too suspect and he will not rest until he unlocks the riddle of Olivia and knows everything she does about that fateful night.<br /><br />Olivia is very beautiful, but a \\"poor relation\\".  She is leery when the new earl invites her to his house party, invited to \\"even out the numbers\\".  This gives Sebastian the chance to probe her story.  Olivia is a strong character, one the readers will immediately identify and love.  She lives on the edge of the gentry, but her poor means has held her back, yet she carries herself with a grace, serenity and ability to see past the surface of others.  It's in Olivia where I see the most maturing in Jewel's writing.  Olivia is just such a strongly defined character, so believable that she quickly has the reader wrapped around her delicate little finger.  She is an outsider in this wealth and tries to remain on the edge, not attracting attention at the gathering.  However, Sebastian will not permit that.<br /><br />Their acquaintance begins as an adversarial one, though both sense an attraction.  As Sebastian's investigation moves forward, he shifts from doubt to grudging respect, then into love.  Again, Jewel demonstrates the growth in her talent by having such a strong relationship between these two wonderfully crafted characters.  Sebastian's growing love for Olivia even has him fearing what he might learn as he unlocks the truth hidden in her mind.<br /><br />Jewel just goes all out in this utterly radiant turn of the screw, where a ghost walks, romance sizzles and characters are so bloody brilliant!s house party, invited to \\"even out the numbers\\".

Five books in the 2176 series, four writers, and each bringing their own distinctive style!  Patti 0'Shea absolutely blew me away with her debut novel Ravyn's Flight.  I mean that book was so absolutely amazing!  I have been waiting to see her next work.  She did not disappoint me!  Added to the task of trying to measure up to the knockout first book, she had to work within a \\"bible\\", a series of books set up where they have to stay within certain perimeters.  So it was with anticipation - but a dram of trepidation - as I waited for this book.  O'Shea delivers.  Oh, does she deliver!  All four ladies make this series from start to finish top drawer, quality rarely seen in \\"bible\\" set ups.<br /><br />Cai Randolph is part of a Quandem Team.  To say this gal is \\"plugged-in\\" to the computer is an understatement!  She's been implanted with technology that lets her access and communicate with computers 24/7.  She then relays this information to her \\"recep\\", a leader of a Special Ops team.  Captain Jake Tucker is Cai's recap.  He's in charge of leading an elite force and is used to getting information from Cai - but thinks she's like Hal in 2001 - a computer.  Cai keeps the team up-to-date.  Jake is used to Cai feeding them data, sending them where they need to go.  But he has no idea Cai is a real woman.<br /><br />Several years ago, Cai's parents disappeared and were presumed dead.  Cai has persisted in the belief they were not killed but kidnapped.  When she has the information she is looking for, where they might be, she sets up Jake and his team to move into the area, determined to go along with them.  The operation is supposedly to track down and capture Bree Macguire and her lover Commander Armstrong, but Cai could care less.  She is after her parents and sees the insertion of the team as her chance.<br /><br />Jake has to adjust his mindset when he is confronted with the very much in the flesh Cai.  At first, he refuses to believe her, but she proves to him by sharing the intimate knowledge she possesses about him through the mind link.  Jake does not like the idea of Cai being human instead of machine nor does he like the idea of taking her on the mission, but Cai is determined.  As they work together, their connection on serves to increase their attraction to each other.<br /><br />O'Shea's characters leap off the pages, they sizzle.

The Chase takes up after those two books bringing back characters from them.<br /><br />Set in late 1300s, King Richard commands by royal decree that Blake Sherwell \\"Angel\\" must wed with is somewhat less than ladylike lady, Seonid Dunbar.  The betrothal made years earlier, neither side now wants the marriage to proceed, but Richard is determined so there is little Blake can do but go claim his Scottish lass.  Blake is none to happy to trek all the way to the Highlands to find `sweet' Seonid has slipped off and taken sanctuary with the nuns at St. Simmians.  Blake is not a happy camper, and heads to take back his bride.  He does this, but the infuriating female escapes again, and soon gives Blake a merry chase all over the Highlands.  As he chases his bride-to-be, he begins to admire her spirit, sharp mind and even her stubbornness, and is soon falling for his warrior-lady-betrothed.  Seonid also comes to a grudging admiration of the handsome knight.  As they'd gone trooping over hill and dale, she comes to believe \\"Angel\\" just might be man enough to have a strong bride.

They are forced to take shelter in an abandoned Coast Guard shelter and the enforced closeness allows them to learn more about each other.

She's gaining a strong fan base for her sizzling Romantica tales (Strange Attractions, Personal Best and her Black Lace books) to her Paranormals (Catching Midnight, Hunting Midnight and the novella in Hot Blooded) and Victorian Era (Beyond Innocence, Beyond Seduction).  Frankly, I think Emma Holly canÂ¯and doesÂ¯write anything she wants and does it unlike any writer around.  Her writing is frank, open and she loves to walk on the wild side.<br /><br />This time she ventures into another Paranormal tale that is both exciting and very original.  It has the feel of another series, and one I will be looking forward to when they tales come!  The range of Holly's writing is amazing, her deeply drawn characters and strong plot really set her above others Romantica writers.  She succeeds while others often don't make the bar, because her works are well researched, and she gives such heart to her heroine and hero.<br /><br />Set in the Victoria era, Inspector Adrian Philip of Securite Service, is more than a typical policeman, he is the keeper of peace between demons and humans.  He has accepted implants in his body that enable him to have incredible strength, and to assume the powers of a demon for short periods.  By accepting this role of protector of both, he belongs to neither.  Adrian is an outsider in both worlds.<br /><br />When Adrian seeks a missing boy, he is attacked by a local gang.  Using his demonic implanted powers, he escapes. After using the powers, he is weakened and collapses in a courtyard of Roxanne McCallister.  Roxanne is also an outcast, a half-breed, part demon, part human.  She takes Adrian in and treats him.  Adrian is very attracted to Roxanne, but knows no woman will want him.  Proof of this is his former wife had walked out on him because of his not quite human state.  Roxanne desires Adrian, but is unaware of his demon enhanced state.  Being a half breed, she fears no man or demon would want her either.  As Adrian recovers under Roxanne's tender care, he falls in love with her, yet tries to resist a relationship that could interfere with his police career, and ultimately will leave him hurt when she rejects him.<br /><br />In true Emma Holly fashion, the love scenes are beyond erotic, but she never loses a firm grasp on what makes Romance work.

Again, she impressed me!  Writing for Harlequin Intrigue, she is penning a story under the New Orleans Confidential - Ultimate Agents line.  For those unfamiliar with this concept, often a writer has a series of books she does; other times, the publisher has a certain \\"bible\\" line and gives certain books to different writers to do one story out of the series.  It's harder for a writer to really `strut their stuff' when they are slightly bound and gagged with the premise handed to them.  A publisher will have the \\"bible\\" for the concept, each book already set up, and the writer has to hit certain points.  Interesting, designed to make the readers seek out the other books in this arc.  However, sometimes you almost feel the writer chaffing, wanting to break free and do their own ideas.  Mallory Kane's talent feels these constrictions with this story, Bulletproof Billionaire, yet she comes through and delivers and engaging tale.  Harlequin hurts the wonderful effort by sticking her with this sappy title.  How they can believe it sells books is beyond me!  So ignore the title and you will find Kane gives you one super story.<br /><br />The Ultimate Agents work undercover, by day they lead lives of New Orleans professionals; by night they are government operatives designed to put a stop to the corruption undermining the city.  They are strong men, bound by honor, with a firm devotion to the law, and they have sworn an oath to keep their missions and their identities totally a secret.  In Kane's tale, Seth Lewis is sent into crack the Cajun Mob.  The New Orleans Confidential has sent Seth, a street-smart, rough-around-the-edges agent to assume the identity of a jet-setting businessman.  His mission is to gain information and possibly entry to the Cajun Mob, by romancing mob widow, Adrienne De Blanc.  Seth's target is to bring down Jerome Senegal, head of the Cajun Mob by seducing the beautiful widow, who is owner of the Cajun Perk coffeehouses, which serve as a front for Senegal's illegal drug activities.<br /><br />Seth makes the transition from wisecracking, tough guy to suave Continental charmer, and finds gaining the attention of the lonely socialite easier than he assumed.  Only, he is shocked to find himself caring for the fragile woman, who is desperate to escape the control of the New Orleans crime syndicate.  At first, he is puzzle, if she wants out from under Senegal's control, why does she just not walk, not stopping to comprehend she's held bound as Senegal is using her child as a pawn to insure her obedience.  Though attracted to Adrienne, and surprised by the strong desire to protect her, neither of them are being totally truthful with the other, and their lies could see them both go down in flames.  Their passion causes Seth's position to be a dangerous one, putting both of their lives at risk.<br /><br />Mallory delivers strong, sympathetic characters and a tense drama, making this a very enjoyable read.Cajun Mob by seducing the beautiful widow, who is owner of the Cajun Perk coffeehouses, which serve as a front for Senegal's illegal drug activities.<br /><br />Seth makes the transition from wisecracking, tough guy to suave Continental charmer, and finds gaining the attention of the lonely socialite easier than he assumed.

She is a writer that continually fascinates me.  I don't choose erotic fiction as a matter of routine, because honestly, most of it fails to deliver on the one level I want most - makes me care about the characters.  Recently in a debate about the levels of sexuality in Romance in general, some came down on the side of sizzling hot, some for chaste Regency Romances.  I said, \\"Frankly, I don't care which road you ask me to travel; tell a good story, and I will enjoy it.\\"  And for me, that is so true.  I enjoy Sandra Heath Regency tales as much as I enjoy Angela Knight or Emma Holly, two of the red-hot sizzling writers of today.  Why Holly continually leads me down roads I'd travel less is she starts with the most important ingredient: characters.  She creates very human, very alive people, reaches in and grabs your heart, and then proceeds to push emotional and physical boundaries like no other writer around.<br /><br />Once again, with her newest work, Strange Attractions, Holly delivers up a spicy, but emotional dish.  An O.T.T. scientist is obsessed with knowing the why of everything.  And the most elusive why to him is emotional response and feelings.  When he is not being this era's Albert Einstein, Grantham unwinds by playing games with people - his very own human Kens and Barbies, trying to figure out what makes them react as they do.  A one man Think Tank, B.G. Grantham very selectively chooses his candidates, looking for people that are strong willed, but flawed.  His right hand is Eric Berne - Grantham's Man Friday and Ken doll rolled into one.  It's time for Grantham to unwind from his more earth-saving pursuits, so he sends Eric out to find a new subject.<br /><br />Eric has chosen sexy, wisecracking Charity Willis.  Charity immediately wins the readers over.  She is a gal who loves being a woman, short skirt, tight tops.  Coming from a less than spotless background of a mother who moved about, and \\"uncles\\" who moved in and out of Charity's life with the regularity of the Navy, Charity has learn to protect herself.  She is wound, yet resilient; she won't take gruff from people who mistake her delight in being sexy as a come on to any Tom, Dick and Harry.  But life has not given Charity any breaks.  She means well, but she's been fire from more jobs than she had \\"uncles\\".  She's bright, but little applies herself, because what's the point?<br /><br />Charity has seen Eric around the offices where she works, Future-Tech, even had the strange sensation he was following her on several occasions.  She is attracted to the sexy man, but feels that a man like him would be interested in a girl like her for only one reason.  When she's called to the personnel office, she at first fears getting fired for perpetually being late.  She is ushered into the office by Eric who says he has a proposal for her.  Charity steels herself for the usual, and is ready to put him in his place.  Instead, Eric tells about his employer, how he likes to study people, their pleasure, what makes them tick and offers her the job of being Grantham's personal Barbie Doll for a period, after which they will pay for her college education, see she gets a good position with a job that has a future.  After hearing the terms of the contract, Charity agrees feeling life has never given her a chance to get ahead before.  Since the contract spells out that anytime she feels uncomfortable with Grantham's requests, she just has to say the word, they will bring her back to her home and the contract will end, Charity thinks she has nothing to lose.<br /><br />So begins the journey of education of this touching brave young woman, that leaves the reader spellbound, with Eric as her guide.  A modern twist, a cross between Svengali and My Fair Lady, done as only Holly can do.  She strongly, flawlessly uses Multi-POV (point of view) to keep the reader attuned to all her characters inner emotions.  Simply put, Emma Holly told me a good story and I enjoyed it.  Her brilliance, her open-mindedness, and her willingness to test the envelope mark her as the brightest star in fiction - par none!<br /><br />2004 Reviews International Organization Award of Excellence Finalist and 2nd Place Winnerr emotions.

It's so surprising to see just what as considered as \\"romance\\" in 1981.  What was acceptable.  The male comes off not just as Alpha - which I truly love - but overbearing, which hurts this effort.  If they plan on re-releasing this one, I hope they update it to where readers of today can enjoy this.  The premise is a little contrived, but a bit of judicious editing could turn it around.<br /><br />Hunter Manning was zeroing in on Stacey Ryland's beautiful \\"blonde\\" sister-in-law.  Her brother's marriage was new, and he was under pressure taking over the family business, so it left his new wife wide-open for Hunter to target.  He has come to Arizona, to extract revenge for his father's death.  Stacey's powerful and greedy father forced out Manning's father in a leveraged buyout, and within a year Manning's father was dead.  Manning blamed Ryland.  Now fourteen years later, the time has come to extract vengeance.  He has decided to seduce Stacey's sister-in-law, so distract her brother from business, thus can bring the Ryland empire down.<br /><br />Only, Hunter did not count on Stacey.  She derails Hunter's plan by offering herself as payment for his vengeance.  She convinces him, why bother with the sister-in-law when you can go after the daughter.  Her offer is to pretend they are having an affair, but Hunter makes a counter offer of marriage.  He wants a \\"Ryland woman he can make into a Manning woman\\".  What she does not tell him is there is no love loss between Stacey and her father, and Hunter marrying her will not hurt her father as Hunter imagines.<br /><br />Within days, Stacey finds herself married and on her wedding night, her father calls and tells Hunter he knows Hunter married Stacey for vengeance, but it won't work, because there is little affection between father and daughter.  Hunter is not pleased and now the marriage is off to rough start.<br /><br />The premise seems a bit forced.  It's hard for the reader to believe Stacey would marry a man who was nearly a total stranger, and make no effort to get to know him before the marriage, just to keep Hunter from going after her brother.  If you can get past that and ignore the \\"make a Ryland witch into a Manning witch\\", \\"...or I'll give you the beating you deserve\\" or \\"my woman\\" tossed in repetitively from the nearly Tarzan chest thumping hero, it's a good read; just know going in you have to put up with these problems.ed and now the marriage is off to rough start.<br /><br />The premise seems a bit forced.

Somebody To Love is Kate Rothwell's second novel in the second half of this year. Her debut book, Somebody Wonderful, showed she likes to walk a different path. Her historical novel was set in late 1800's in New York, far from your typical historical setting, and between a rich, adventuresome young lady and a beat patrol policeman. Again, she eschewed the glittering ballrooms of Regency era and lords and ladies, to go for the realistic romance. She does the same in her second novel, once again, giving historical romance a breath of fresh air.    In Somebody to Love, set again in the US during the gaslight era, when Tammany Hall politicians saw graft as a way of life, we meet Griffin Calverson and Araminta Woodhall. Griffin comes to the rescue of Araminta, who is employed by a ruthless social climber Linder Kane. Araminta has resigned herself that her heritage (won't spoil the plot by revealing what) makes it impossible for her to have the good marriage she yearns for, so she has turned her passion into being a great chef. Kane pays her well, but she is confined by the life at Kane's mansion, not to mention Kane's mistress is not happy to be under Kane's control either.    Araminta is forced to ask Griffin for help to free Olivia. While they work to free Olivia from Kane's control, Araminta and Griffin begin an affair. While Griffin is looking for more than an affair from Araminta, he finds it next to impossible to convince her of his love and that they have a future together. Convincing Araminta will be harder than freeing Olivia, but Griffin is determined.    Rothwell has a gentle, charming voice. She is strong on period details, her rich backdrops for her stories bring everything into a sharp vision, allowing the reader to see the richly textured world of the gaslight era of New York. She has strong, intelligent characters, with a good feel for dialog and she creates steamy, sensual heroes and heroines that steal the readers heart. If you read Somebody Wonderful,you will already know Griffin from that tale.     I highly recommend both Somebody To Love and her debut book Somebody Wonderful for a very fresh voice in historical romance. Here's hoping Rothwell will give us more \\"somebodies\\" from the gaslight era to charm us.    2004 Reviews International Organization Award of Excellence Finalist and 2nd Place Winner	2004-10-14

This might have worked better as a large book, but the time limit of the mini books really hurts this story. Too much happens too fast to be fully believable.<br /><br />Selena gets in the cross-hairs of York Sutherland's quest to bring down a business rival, because she is dating that rival. York comes after her like a steamroller, and her mind tells her it is only because she is dating the man he wants to destroy, but her heart won't listen.<br /><br />As the first blush of their affair wears off, and questions set in, she begins to fear destroying his rival and winning her go hand in hand. Selena naturally strives to make certain this is not the case, but the way she goes about it is just to unbelievable. They barely have begun their affair, when she is demanding he abandon all efforts to crush his rival - lose millions of dollars - just to probe he loves her more. Sheesh, I wanted to tell her GET REAL. You don't make those wild demanded in the first two days of a romance!!<br /><br />Still all in all a nice quickie read. Just wish it was paced better and there had been time to develop the story ( which is not JAK's fault but the limitation of the publisher!)	2004-10-13

Thank you thank you.<br /><br />But this one, to me, had problems with the female lead. She starts off interestingly. She is on a plane that crashes. A high powered business executive with a hotel chain, is used to giving orders and having every one follow.<br /><br />However, from the first, Lucas Kinkaid declares he is the leader. Quickly, he pulls her aside and explains in order for them and the others to survive, there has to be one leader and that is him. She grudgingly backs down and accepts his alpha male leader role, even to the point of surrendering herself to him the night before they are rescued.<br /><br />But she sees the surrender, the fact she gave up the power to snap her fingers and have people jump, as a deep wound, and when Lucan comes to find her again, she makes him PAY.<br /><br />When he follows her on board a cruise ship, she coldblooded sets about to have an affair with him, just so she can put a choke-chain about his neck and yank it every time she wants him to come to heel. She is arrogant, smug and condescending. She sneers at the fact he eats steak and potatoes, is not a polished dancer, owns a pet store and wear cheap polyester pants, while she dresses in designer clothes, loves lobster and Brie and its quite at home in the penthouse of the cruise liner. She spends nearly half of the book making this poor guy jump through hoops just to salvage her ego and frankly.  It made it so hard to connect with her, and I seriously wondered just what he saw in her.<br /><br />Jayne's talent as a writer is the only thing that makes this one readable. She is a joy with the written word, and one of the best in this male-female sparring. So it's hard to see how out of formula this was ended up being.	2004-10-13

A Game of Chance, is a continuation of that series, following Mackenzie's Mission.  Surprisingly, it's rather a \\"tame\\" read for Howard.  Chance Mackenzie, the adopted brother to Zane, is on a mission to capture a known terrorist and his unknown mole in the FBI.  The only way to get to him is through the daughter he has never seen, Sunny Miller.  Sunny is the one link and Chance intends to set her up to lure her father out.<br /><br />He arranges it so she is nearly robbed in an airport.  She is a courier and she missed her flight because of it, just as Chase intends.  When she says she has to get her case to San Francisco ASAP, Chase offers to fly her there.  Once they are out a ways, Chase fakes fuel pump trouble and sets down in a secluded canyon, with Zane on their trail keeping an eye on them.  The whole purpose of this is to get Sunny to depend upon Chase, get her to trust him.  They spend nearly ten days with Sunny thinking they are fighting to survive.  Only, once Chance learns there is another sister and that Sunny is not in league with her father, he let's them be \\"rescued\\", just to use Sunny as bait.  He leaks her whereabouts knowing the FBI mole will give the information away.<br /><br />Chase is just a wee bit non-caring about using Sunny in the beginning.  And the fact she has fallen in love with him does not make him blink at using her as bait.  The depth that is usually there in Howard's characters is just missing from this tale.  It's all very predictable, with the mole tossed in at the last minute, so there is no mystery.<br /><br />Rather disappointing, considering the powerhouse Howard always is.  It was nearly 40 pages into the book before we meet Sunny.  In a 250 page book that is a long time before you actually get into the story.  And sorry, Chance just really loses points at being such a user.<br /><br />You will want to continue the Mackenzie saga, but just not, it's not the brilliance of the first ones.lly loses points at being such a user.<br /><br />You will want to continue the Mackenzie saga, but just not, it's not the brilliance of the first ones.	2004-10-13

Due to his weakened state of being beaten, Tabby takes care of him and helps him back to the ship. He likes the softness and womanly tenderness he sees in her and encourages Tabby in this mistaken belief he is a mild, almost shy man.<br /><br />Needless to say, Tabby is not happy when she finds the man she 'understands so well' because they are so much alike, is nothing like he man she created in her mind. But Dev knows Tabby likes fanciful beasts like dragons and unicorns - so he is out to convince her a live 'beastie' is even more thrilling to trap.	2004-10-13

Sorry, her letting Court get her to the bedroom door, and then pulling the maidenly \\"I need time\\" comes across passionless and dated. Court grudgingly gives her time. He has convinced her C. Tremayne is trustworthy enough to help her brother, so she signs the contract and drops it into the mail in the middle of the night.<br /><br />Next morning she calls her brother to tell him the contract is on the way. He lets the cat out the bag that Gannon and Tremayne are one in the same. Then we're treated with high hysterics of \\"you betrayed me\\" from Leya, that is just a little OTT.<br /><br />Well, this is typical JAK formula. What is not typical was the hero's violence. When she won't listen to him, he causes her physical pain and cares less he does. Page 58 - ...putting out a hand to grasp her thick braid. With a quick tug he forced her closer, ignoring the sharp gasp of anger and pain from his victim. On Page 65 - Court caught hold of her braid, yanking her to a violent halt before Leya had gone more than a few steps. \\"Ouch.\\" she yelped, incensed at the small pain. \\"Let go of me you sadist!\\"<br /><br />Oooo...I love alpha males, I love gamma rogues, what I don't love it cavemen 'controlling the little woman' so he can force a kiss on her so she will 'come to her senses'<br /><br />Krentz is without question one of the brightest stars in romance today.

The characters were crisp, witty and it was JAK at her best.<br /><br />This does measure up to that book.  Not that it is bad. It's just this is in the pattern of her recent trilogies of books. One really good and then two weaker continuation of the same story. I really hoped since Light and Shadow was so strong that she would break that curse. I love JAK - she is one of my favourite writers, but I do feel a wee bit let down by these weaker part 2 and 3 books.  Only the Eclipse Bay books were as good all the way through, in fact got stronger as they went. In paperback, maybe you would grump less, but at hardback prices her fans might feel they deserve a little bit more.<br /><br />When we last saw the Whispering Hills gang, it was just a month early. Ethan Truax, PI, had married Zoe Luce to stop Zoe's brother-in-law from trying to pop her back in to the high-priced Candle Lake Manor Psychiatric Hospital. The bluff had worked and the mystery - who killed Zoe's husband - was solved. Zoe's fellow escapee from Crystal Lake - Arcadia was now living with Harry, Ethan's PI friend. Neither Zoe or Arcadia had mental problems, but Crystal Lake specialised in hiding rich people's \\"embarrassments\\" - for enough money they quietly keep the problemsome relative away from prying eyes. However, in Arcadia's case, she was actually hiding from a husband, and deliberately checked herself into Crystal Lake. Grant Loring tried to kill her. She figured her husband would never look for her at an institute for the mentally ill.<br /><br />Arcadia suddenly fears, Grant's still alive - not dead from a skiing accident as reported - and that he has now decided to come after his wife who has too much information on him. She fears her \\"new\\" identity has been compromised.<br /><br />The whole gang, for one reason or another is uneasy. It's November, the month Ethan's brother was murdered, leaving Ethan, Bonnie, his sister-in-law, and his two nephews dealing with the grief. Ethan also is concerned about his marriage. He jumped at the chance to use the excuse of protecting Zoe, when he really wanted to marry her. Now, he fears she may be having second thoughts. Zoe is having seconds thoughts, but not because of love. She loves Ethan, but he refuses to believe Zoe is psychic, just chalks up her \\"gift\\" to good intuition. She feels if he cannot accept WHAT she is how can he love her? This is a sticking point, especially when she starts running into \\"spider webs\\" of dark emotions somehow connected to Crystal Lake. But those worries, take a back seat when someone tries to kill Ethan. Is it connected to his brother's death? Connected to Zoe's stay at Crystal Lake? Or the con man that Ethan exposed?<br /><br />Frankly, this books is a enjoyable read, with some really fine JAK's humour.  On the whole, she once again has too many story lines going all at once - to hide there is not much of a mystery (Smoke and Mirrors problem). The romance between Zoe and Ethan is pushed aside as it become the \\"Gang's\\" Story. Maybe it's a transitional period for JAK.  That passion for writing romance seem to have lost that brilliant spark.  She covers with extra story threads, lots of chatter about food (yes, we know JAK doesn't like meat!!) food, food and more food (Quick's Don't Look Back's Problem).<br /><br />This is enjoyable, diverting, and will please fans, but they would do well to wait for paperback.<br /><br />The same complaints I see from other readers concerning her last half dozen books - thin mysteries, too many story threads shifting the focus from the leads - and the biggest zinger - not enough romance.  This book just seems to anti-climatic after the first brilliant Whispering Springs tale which I adored.r-in-law, and his two nephews dealing with the grief.

She creates such vividly complex characters. They are not perfect examples of what we would like to be - some shimmering chimera that does not exist. She picks out characters that are deeply wounded, often scarred, often they are content to turn a blind eye to the world around them just because it's easy than fighting. Sometimes people don't really get Stuart because she is not drawing pictures of pretty characters, she's studying people in all their aspects, good and bad. And she fascinates me like no other writer because of this willingness to dance on the knife's edge rather than play politically correct.<br /><br />Tanner and Ellie are two more of Stuart's intense dramas. Stuart loved the whole of a person - all aspects, even the ugly, and loves to toy with those, intense emotions when a man and woman are put into a situation that is explosive - between them, around them. Fifteen years ago, Tanners father took a rifle and killed over a dozen people. No one saw it coming; there was no major warning signs before it happened. Tanner and his mother were gone before it happened, though the horrifying act has followed him ever since. He has come back to the scene of the crime, the small Montana town where people died because of his father with the driving need to understand why.<br /><br />The first person he meets is Ellie Lundquist, the only survivor of his father's massacre. She was wounded in the knee, limps today because of it. After her first shock at who Tanner is, she befriends the troubled man. Ellie is a good person but for too long she was much more than a victim of his father's crime. She was only sixteen when it happened, and as the survivor, the town wrapped her in cotton and protected her like the town princess. Ellie has allowed this to happen because she cares about the people, but she knows this has gone on too long and she must leave the town or die inside.<br /><br />Tanner is determined to find out why his father suddenly cracked and killed people. His arrival has upset some, since nearly every family in town lost a member in the killing spree. It's a quiet, sleepy small town slowly dying, but beneath the surface is a troubling ripple. Suddenly, animals and pets are being shot in the head; people are reporting someone peeking in their windows.<br /><br />Ellie knows it's not Tanner, but these are the people she has lover her whole life; she cannot see who would be doing this. Worse, if someone is killing animals now hinting Tanner is behind it, could it be maybe Tanner's father was not the real killer? Or was he the killer and somehow escaped by faking his death?<br /><br />Tanner and Ellie are wonderfully drawn. They are so human, so mesmerizing. This is just another in the long line of Stuart masterpieces, where she unflinchingly holds up the mirror and forces us to look at emotions that are powerful, that are often disturbing.<br /><br />Sheer bloody brilliance!why his father suddenly cracked and killed people.

Howard does a tour de force bringing together this dysfunctional family with such strongly drawn characters.  With a seamless Mutli-POV (point of view) she brings them all into vivid life for the reader, making this a pleasure to read.<br />Roanna was a gawky ugly duckling when she came to live with her wealthy grandmother in the sprawling mansion in Alabama.  Left orphan at the early age, she feels so alone.  Her beautiful, older cousin Jessie does not welcome her.  Her grandmother makes it clear she is doing her family duty, and little else.  So while the mansion was straight out of Gone With The Wind, Roanna was so very alone in the big house.  Except for her distant cousin Webb.  He showed a gentleness that won Roanna's admiration and silent love.<br />Roanna is constantly criticized by her grandmother, never doing anything to earn her approval, a startling contracts to the loving parents who adored her unconditionally.  This mental abuse of her young spirit is only amplified by her grandmothers utter adoration of her perfect cousin Jessie.  Even when Jessie was less than perfect her grandmother excused or covered for her.  Roanna was forced to stand silently by as Webb and Jessie are paired into the \\"perfect couple\\", and there was little she could do, but watch as Webb married the wild, and greedy Jessie, always feeling at the back of her mind Webb deserved better.  They seemed the faerytale couple, destined to rule the Davenport fortune, until the night Jessie was found dead, and everyone blamed Webb.<br />With everyone, but Roanna believes he killed Jessie, Webb leaves for Arizona.  Now years later, a grown up Roanna has come to bring Webb home.  Ten years has passed.  Webb is no longer the caring gentle man Roanna loved.  He is bitter, hardened.  Despite his revulsion for his so-called families betrayal, Webb is convinced by Roanna it's time to come home, take up the reins of Davenport power and finally put Jessie's death to rest.<br />Webb comes back for two reasons - Roanna and to find out who really killed Jessie.  Only a killer does not want his secret revealed and is willing to kill again to protect himself from exposure.  It's a home with vividly drawn characters, all with their share of dark secrets.  Howard, gives you that sultry, itchy Southern charm, a cover for a multitude of sins and passions simmering just under the surface.  Roanna is a poignant character that strikes the cord in any woman who has felt less than perfect growing up.  And by the same token, Webb is the knight in shining armour, dreams for a young girl to worship.<br />Howard uses the Mutlio-POV(point of view) so let the reader really experience these vividly created people in a way enforced \\"Stepford Writing\\" (Single POV) just cannot flesh out.

As I read it, the familiarity continued because St. Giles evokes that sinister Gothic air.  It's glad to see Gothics making a slow comeback.  St. Giles pens a tale that keeps the reader spellbound, and to an older reader who cut her teeth on Gothics, it's so enjoyable.<br /><br />In a typical Gothic beginning, evocative of Daphne du Maurier, \\"Last night I dream of Manderlay...\\", when Ann Lovell walks through the gates of the old San Francisco mansion on Trevelyan Hill, she reflects how she was always mysteriously drawn to the house, almost a portent that her fate and the house was somehow intertwined.  Set in the 19th  century, foggy San Francisco, it's pure Gothic spooky, the big house full of sinister secrets, dark corners where evil resides.  Ann, whose real name is Tatiana, is a lowly laundry worker.  Her mother was a sweet lass lied to by a man of higher birth.  A tall woman, who has to look down on most men, she has come to apply for a position of governess (as I said, pure blissful Gothic!) for Justin age 7, and Robert, age 5.  No one seems to be able to keep the job, and now no one is applying, so Ann believes she stands a good chance of landing the position.<br /><br />Benedict Trevelyan was rumored to have killed his wife, but naturally, that does not daunt Ann.  Immediately, upon settling into her new role in the house, duckbumps<br /><br />prickle up her spine as she becomes certain someone is watching her.  With no surprise, Ann and Benedict's relationship spiral from first kiss into full blown affair - those cads never can resist the governess!  Being loyal to her new lover, Ann knows Benedict did not kill his wife, thus someone else in the sinister house is the evil-doer.  Occasionally, Giles lapses into deep purple prose, especially in love scenes, but she is able to maintain a sinister, passionate tension through out the story.<br /><br />There is a bitter rivalry between Benedict and his brother Stephan.  Toss in a secretive sister Katherine, and mother Roselind, secret passage ways you have a true Gothic in the best fashion.scenes, but she is able to maintain a sinister, passionate tension through out the story.<br /><br />There is a bitter rivalry between Benedict and his brother Stephan.

She just delivers time and again with tales that keep you mesmerized by her talent.  This is just another in the line of super reads penned since Howard rebounded from her back troubles in the mid 1990's.<br /><br />Karen Whitlaw is still having to adjust to losing her mother, when she finds an odd parcel in the mail.  A package from the father she has not seen in years.  Ever since his return from the Vietnam War, he has been out of her life.  Having trouble with accepting her mother's death, she does not want to deal with anything from her absent father.  She puts the notebook from the parcel away - and promptly forgets about it.  Until she receives another blow - a call from a New Orleans detective saying her father was murdered on their streets.  The kind sounding detective, Mac Chastain, just chalks the death up to another street crime, endless violence in the gritty life of a homeless man, so Karen is willing to accept his verdict.  Marc is unaware of the death of Karen's mother, and the numb state she is in, so he chalks her up to being cold, heartless when she does not show reaction over her father's death.<br /><br />Only, slowly Karen becomes aware the crime was made to look like nothing more than senseless violence.  Some one breaks into her home, and Karen is convinced they are after the notebook she put aside and dismissed from her mind.  Fearful, she examines the book and discovers her father was a sniper in Vietnam.  Through the worn pages, she is shocked to discover the book is a list of everyone of his kills.<br /><br />Karen now feels she is running for her life, because someone wants that book.  He has killed once, thus one hesitate to kill again.  There is only one person she can trust: Marc Chastain.  Together they must find the answers before they are the killer's next targets.<br /><br />I always enjoy New Orleans as a setting for Romance books.  The city has such a old world charm, the quirkiness of the people, that it's a brilliant locale for a story, giving both the glamour and seediness that exist comfortably hand in hand.  Howard mines that used the sensual backdrop, giving the reader a strongly detailed story with a strong hero and heroine that will keep you breathless to the end.<br /><br />With flawless Mutli-POV (point of view) that permits the reader to know both characters equally well, it just does not get any better than this!rld charm, the quirkiness of the people, that it's a brilliant locale for a story, giving both the glamour and seediness that exist comfortably hand in hand.

I utterly adore alpha males, and read this book when it came out 22 years ago.  My how attitudes change!  Strange, to think this was accepted male-female dynamics just two decades ago.  I am sure the readers in their mid-twenties who did not grown up in the 70's and 80s, and are use to women being independent will wonder where Howard is coming from with this book.  As a child who grew up with the \\"expected\\" house-mum, who stayed home to raise the kids and be a house maker, where a wife working was an INSULT to a man, I have seen women make great strides in being a strong figure that can take care of herself.  So go into this book knowing that attitudes of the 80's were different.  Remember this is a period where Coulter wrote about her heroine being whipped with a riding crop because she DARED follow him to his mistresses home and threw a shoe at him.<br /><br />Sallie Jerome is a hotshot reporter for a big NYC magazine.  She loved the travel, loved the danger she often finds herself in, but now she has a more immediate danger: her estranged husband Rydon Baines.  Rys married her almost 9 years ago - out of pity, we learn.  She was 18, he 28.  He was the nephew of the woman next door.  After her parents die, and then his aunt dies, too, Sarah (Sallie)is in a mental depression.  Rys quickly courts her, marries her.  Rys is a hotshot reporter, working for big news organization and he, too, was often sent into dangerous situations.  An insecure Sarah did not like this and demanded he change his job to where he was home every night.  Rys likes dropping in between assignments, having his laundry done, and having a hot time in the sack before he cuts out again.  When Sarah became pregnant, he accused her of trying to trap him into staying at home.  He was not there when she went into early labor, he was not there when she delivered a still birth, he was not there when she buried their son.  When he finally comes home, he offers her little support (though he now claims he wanted the son, too), and they get into a row over his leaving again, he departs with a final shot saying he was leaving permanently and when she decides she is \\"woman enough for him\\" look him up.  He sends monthly support checks.<br /><br />Sarah starts out using his money to educate herself.  She gets a college education, and comes out of the shell of the shy retiring woman.  She is now called Sallie, and she has taken that education and put it to good use.  Once she got her first job, she sent Rys checks back saying she no longer needed his support.  So it has been seven years since she has seen the man face to face, though she has kept up with his fame on the evening news.<br /><br />So Sallie is horrified to learn Rys is giving up investigative reporting and has bought the magazine where Sallie works.  Rys shows up with a gorgeous model in tow.  Sallie tries to hide out form Rys, but he finally forces a showdown.  She presumes he will want a divorce, but Rys says there will be no divorce.  He tells her she is trapped.  He will fix it she cannot work anywhere else, that he wants her as his wife again and get used to it.  Rys at times physically hurts Sallie - nothing major, just pulling the braid (saw this devise used in Jayne Ann's Stephanie James re-release of Stormy Challenge, so it's just not Howard's book but the TIMES that saw this caveman routine as ok), he left bruises on her wrists.  Sorry, today he would be considered a bully.  Worse, while claiming he wants his marriage, he still keeps is model around as a thorn to Sallie's side to make her jealous.<br /><br />Sigh, it just dated.

David is drop dead sexy, a really great Alpha hero and Alex is a charmer, too.<br /><br />So many of the writers who came up through series romance in the last twenty years seems to have forgotten their romance fans and their romance roots.  I often see fans bemoaning, \\"where's the romance\\" in their works.  Delightfully, that is NOT the case with Grahams strong sexy, sizzling suspense - the romance is there in spades!	2004-10-08

You find them in secondary bookstores used - maybe - and for very high prices.  Here you have all four tales (four complete Silhouette novels) in one volume - Night Shift, Night Shadow, Nightshade and Night Smoke.  They are some of the best of her early works and it's great to get them all under one cover.<br /><br />Night Shift has Detective Boyd Fletcher assigned to protect Cilla O'Roarke.  She is a nighttime talk Disc Jockey at a local Denver radio station whose life has been threatened.  Cilla is a tough cookie, but even she knows she needs Boyd's help.  While being her bodyguard, Boyd falls for her, which jeopardizes his objectivity he needs to catch the psycho.  But he cannot deny the attraction.<br /><br />Night Shadow is Cilla's sister's story.  Deborah O'Roarke.  Deborah is an assistant DA, and she gets into danger because of the case she's involved in.  Gage and his alter ego Nemisis (think Daredevil with sight) see it as their duty to protect the gusty DA.  The Fantasy element in this is outstanding and I love the strong leads.<br /><br />Nightshade is the story of Boyd's ex-partner, Althea Grayson (we met her as she helped Boyd protect Cilla in Night Shift).  She is an early Eve Dallas (...In Death Series - the \\"role\\" model for Eve?) a very independent lass, who is a by the book cop.  Sexy Colt Nightshade is a Private Investigator who disdains rules, unless he makes them up.  They are both strong willed detectives with their own methods, and naturally clash - on the streets and in bed - as they are forced to work together to stalk a killer.<br /><br />Night Smoke sees Natalie Fletcher, Boyd's sister clash with arson investigator, Ryan Piasecki.  When several of the buildings Natalie owns has fires, she and Ryan clash, soon they are proving where there is smoke, there is in deed fire!<br /><br />Four early Robert's tales guaranteed to delight her fans.	2004-10-07

Nothing To Love #1321, is part of a series for them called The Searchers, though this book can stand alone.  Taylor Bradshaw adores her older brother, so when he is accused of murdering his girlfriend, their unborn child and the girlfriend's mother, she is shocked.  Her brother was an outstanding cop.  This was unthinkable.  Yet, not only was he accused of this, he was convicted and sentence to death for the crimes.  Only Taylor refuses to accept he had anything to do with these crimes and continues to work to see the conviction reversed.  She was a pre-med student, who gave up her dreams and turned to law, hoping to use the knowledge she gains to help set her brother free.<br /><br />Taylor was not happy that bestseller crime writer Wyatt McKinnon is there covering the trial.  Later after the conviction, she is horrified to find her brother is meeting with McKinnon giving him insight into the case so he can write a tell all book about the murders.  Taylor's brother is hoping McKinnon, known for his careful examination of a case and the facts - all the facts - will write a book showing the cop was framed.  Only, Taylor knows, McKinnon's examination of cases are always slanted toward the impact the murders have on the victim's family.  She does not want her brother's name dragged through the public eye again, especially when it might hurt his chances for an appeal.  Taylor is working hard on the appeal, but is frustrated by the attorney that originally handled the case.  Martin James is the high-price attorney who handled the case, he is a close friend of the family, a good friend of Taylor's father.  So why is he practically ignoring the appeal, and why did he permit pertinent information that could have cleared her brother from being excluded in the case?<br /><br />In her frustration, she is forced to join league with McKinnon.  He convinces her he just wants to write a book to explain the case.  The fact of Taylor's complete faith in her brother's innocents intrigues him, making him see that maybe everything was not so cut and dried where the case was concerned. McKinnon's sister was kidnapped and killed when he was a child, the horrible act ripping his family apart.  Why he is driven to examine these cases, and the impact on the families left behind.<br /><br />The strong attraction between them is something neither of them originally wanted, but they cannot seem to avoid as they work desperately to free her brother.<br /><br />The book is fast paced, due to the Silhouette short format.  It leaves you wishing this book could have been written without regard to word count, and Thayne left to explore all the repercussion of this emotional book.  It would have been powerful.  As is, it's still a great read, just there was so much that could have been done making this a bestseller quality book.n the case.

In this story, American born Lauren Matiland leaves Boston to travel to London in order to claim her inheritance.  She is not happy about the trip, and is depressed because her fiance died in the war between the States and Britain.

Caught between the two brothers, with Isabel ready to pull her hair out by the roots, Lauren does not know which way to dodge as the house-guests of Glenvane pursue their shocking romantic intrigues.<br />Sandra Heath is a brilliant writer.  Skillfully using Multi-POV (point of view), she enables the reader to fully know all her wonderfully drawn characters and gives you the full fun of this delightful tale.	2004-10-05

It's harder to conjure emotions without \\"playing\\" on them.  Kids that are too cute, babies galore, provoke emotions.  A man presenting a woman with a white rose evokes, calling to the heart, to the soul.  The difference between evoking and provoking emotions is a tight rope for a writer.  You want to portray real people with real emotions so the readers feel a natural empathy - that is evoking.  You provoke a reader into facing things, sometimes they'd rather not, a mental \\"pitchfork\\", or you toss in that too cute kid to get that awww[...] it's a device best used sparingly.  Too often, I see an author provoking instead of evoking, because the latter is harder to write, it takes a more deft touch to use that voice.  Carol Stephenson is one of the best authors I have seen that evokes emotions.  She paints in gentle, understated imagery that reaches into a reader and makes them feel.<br /><br />Nora's Pride, Silhouette Special Edition #1470 is sheer perfection.  The well drawn characters, conjured with the deft touch that pulls the reader into caring instead of pushes them.  Stephenson has a soothing voice, and I hope there would be more in the series about Nora's family.  There are her two sisters and her budding daughter that are just crying for their own stories.<br /><br />Twelve-years-ago, Nora was in love with Connor Devlin.  But one night he left town and never came back, leaving Nora alone, without knowing she was pregnant.  Now, one autumn afternoon, she looks up to see him boldly coming into the new pottery shop she and her sisters have opened.  She is panicked, fearful he knows about their daughter Abby, nearly twelve now.  But it's soon apparent the town's rebel has no idea he has a daughter.  Immediately, Stephenson gives you two very loving, poignant characters in Connor and Nora.  Young lovers driven apart by his vengeful, controlling mother.  Quickly, it becomes apparent that Abby will have to be told, but she is unsure if Connor is ready to be a father.  As they are finding their way back together again, Connor's mother is moving to, once more, drive them apart.<br /><br />The characters are strong, painfully real, the story touching, showing what an amazing writer Stephenson is.

Angela Knight shows her brilliance by combining the very hot vampire genre with Grail lore, and creates a very original concept.  A concept that will put her on the bestsellers list!  The first in the series, Master of the Night, we get a wonderful, fast pace tale that will have you hooked from the start.  In September, smart people &lt;winks> had a taste of the hot premise in Hot Blooded, an anthology (Knight, Christine Feehan, Emma Holly and Maggie Shayne), where Knight premiered her storyline with her tale \\"Seduction's Gift\\".  In that novella, we learnt the \\"rules\\" of Knight's new magical realm.<br /><br />Eschewing the Ann Rice's sexless bloodsucker and the promiscuous predator male who equates blood with good sex, Knight has struck out on her own - and conjured gold!  Rice's writing while amazing, left me cold where romance was concerned.  Her vamps were often Androgynous, if not gay or bisexual, so this limited the range of emotions provoked by her prose.  On the other end of the pendulum - the Vampire as a strictly romance hero always presented me with troubles.  Problems of disease aside, how could a woman love a man who must go around \\"necking\\" with hundreds of dames to stay alive?  This seems more a male oriented fantasy - the  accepting of a hero \\"sleeping around\\" on the heroine.  Knight deftly handles both of these extremes, by promptly dismissing them, and travelling her own path.  Vampires are not as we know them from Hollywood created lore.  First off, they are male, never female.  They can drink the blood of humans, but it's not the focus of their existence, not how they survive.  Most would rather not.  Where they get their true life giving essence is they must drink the blood of a Maja - a witch, and the Maja must have the vampire take the blood in order for her to survive.  A true symbiotic relationship, which dismisses the disease question, bars the vampires \\"forcing\\" his will on another, and removes the sexuality of the act out of the question - unless the vampire and witch just enjoy that, too.<br /><br />You see, Camelot was a myth.  But not the myth as we know it.  Merlin and Nimue were from a race of beings outside of Earth.  They came as protectors to the fledging human race, and still exist in their own magical realm.  There are actually three realms on earth, the realm of the Mageverse, the Sidhe and the mortal world.  Mortals know nothing of the other two realms, though both often play roles in shaping the normal world.  In the Mageverse, the vampires and witches are the ladies and knights of Camelot.  They're sworn to be protectors of mortal man.  From the children of moral man and woman, come the potential vampires and witches of future generations.  They are called Latents.  Not all mortals who are Latents can be turned.  Many cannot handle being changed into an immortal, and all the powers that come with the change, and often can drive them mad.  And change can only be accomplish by having a male vampire turn a female Latent, or the female Maja witch changes the male mortal, through the sexual act.<br /><br />Knight creates these original and imaginative perimeters for her series, and then sets back and has a great time.  She is a bold, sexy writer that has a strong Southern (US) wit, and is THE writer to watch today.  She is going places, and Master of the Night is the first sounding shot that this talent is here to stay.<br /><br />In Master of the Night, Vampire Knight Reece Champion, Knight defender of the USA, and also agent of the US government, senses the Latent Erin Grayson.  Erin is on a mission to romance international businessman Reece Champion.  She believes seducing the sexy Champion will put her closer to the revenge she is seeking against a murderous organisation.  Only, what Erin does not comprehend, she is a pawn being used against Reece by the very people she is trying to stop.  Sex with Erin is dangerous.  She is a Latent.  Three times of the \\"big whammy\\" and he would turn her into a Maja.  It's forbidden for any immortal to change a Latent, without the Council's permission.  The Council will only pass permission for the changing of Latents they know can handle the transformation.  If you change a Latent without Council approval, it's a death sentence for the immortal and mortal both.  So, Reece is fighting this unseen evil out to destroy both Erin and him, but must walk that fine line of deep attraction he feels for the Latent.<br /><br />Knight is sizzling hot, she is frank, she is cutting-edge.  She is the writer all other writers will be following, saying, \\"gee, wish I had thought of that.\\"  It's not a book for Auntie Em or for Gran - unless they are bold ladies who likes their romance strong with adventure and sizzling red-hot!r into a Maja.

A non-fiction history book that is well written excites me as much as good fiction.  It's the power behind the writer's vision, their voice that sees the prose come alive.  When you get into the Romance genre, it's voice and vision, but it's also a headier mix - romance, anticipation, and an understanding of human nature.  The best romances are written by someone who appreciates men and women, their indocincrosies, and relishes that indefinable magic, which makes a person individual, special.  Often, I see writers writing men as they want them to be, rather than appreciating the male animal as he really is.  No matter how beautifully written a tale is, if the writer does not have a good understanding of men, it shows.  One thing you can say of Emma Holly she has the knack.  She knows men, warts and all, yet adores their intricacy, understands them, and is able to put that into crafting savvy tales with characters so strong they come alive.  Personal Assets is Holly at her very best.  It shows Holly's understanding of women and men.  She breathes life into her characters so when you finish reading this book, you just did not enjoy these two men and two women, you feel you know them.  They are your friends!  It's hard to think of Bea, Phillip, Leta and Simon as just fictional characters.<br /><br />I especially I heap high praise on her Multi-POV (Point of View).  I have long maintained this writing style is so much freer, fuller, you get to know the characters, their immediate reactions, then and there, instead of having to wait for the confining \\"stay within a single character's POV for a whole chapter\\".  Comparing Mutli-POV to enforced Single-POV is the difference between staring at the Mona Lisa and then looking at a painting done with paint-by-numbers!  I hear people call Multi-POV \\"head-hopping\\" and say it takes them out of the story.  Sorry, if you are worrying about \\"whose head\\" you are \\"in\\" - you were never in the story in the first place!  Holly has a strong mastery of Multi-POV, and she uses this so well to bring her characters to life.  You are able to become acquainted with her four leads so well.  I knew each of them, their quirks, their fears, their vulnerabilities.  This style of writing is vital, it's immediate.  And Holly shows how it should be done!<br /><br />This tale is red hot, so know that going in.  But it's more than the sizzling sex - it's the people.  Holly is simply a master at human understanding, a master of taking that comprehension and being able to put it into words.  She is a powerful writer.  She evokes, provokes, teases and opens your heart to loving the people she conjures.<br /><br />Bea Clouet lived in the shadowed of her beautiful, dazzling and powerful mother, and a similar grandmother.  Her grandmother founded Milleirs Amis, a small, but exclusive boutique in Paris.  Her mother pushed it to the limit, expanding it worldwide.  When Bea was 12, her mother married Phillip Carmichael, a beautiful Englishman twenty years her mother's junior.  Phillip tried to be a friend to the lonely Bea who never lived up to her mothers expectations.  Bea's father was Irish, and Bea favored him.  She is a big lass that carries a few too many pounds in a town of half-starved models.  Bea generally rebuffed the friendship with Phillip because, as she grew she knew she loved him, and not as a stepfather.  Now 23-years-old, she is coming into her own, and since her mother was killed six month before by her latest lover, she decides to push the limit and see if she can push Phillips buttons or at least try to get over him.<br /><br />Leta her college friend is in town.  Leta was orphaned when she was young, and never adopted so she has learned never to trust anyone and to depend only on herself.  Bea is one of the few people she has ever been close to, so she treasures her friendship.  When trouble arises in the New York store, Leta immediately begs Phillip to give her a chance to run the store.  He refuses, but does say she can go learn the store, give him a report of what she thinks could improve it, and if she does a good job, he will consider hiring her as manager.  Leta's former boyfriend Andrew pushes his boss Simon Graves and Leta together knowing they will click.  And they do!  Only, Leta is unaware Simon is starting the ground work to take over Meilleurs Amis, and that it could cost Leta her friendship with Bea.

Even books that are flawed have something that redeems them in my eyes.  Not too many lands in the trashcan.  However, every once in a while, there comes along a book that is so contrived, with the characters so unwilling to be honest with each other that they twist themselves into ridiculous \\"pretzels\\" to hide from dealing with their feelings, that it causes me to grit my teeth.  I have a level of capacity for standing this mental torture, remembering I PAID for this - when my jaw aches, it hits the trashcan.  Eye Candy hit that level by the first chapter and maintained the near teeth-gnashing level through the whole book - BUT WAIT!!!  Instead of hitting the trashcan, I stayed glued to the book to the very end.  WHY?  Because of some first-class terrific writing from a very talented writer - Dorie Graham.<br /><br />Harlequin's Blaze series has some really hot, really talented writers in their ranks, Julie Elizabeth Leto and Tori Carrington being up there at the top.  Graham has two other books, which I am off to order, #30 The Last Virgin and #58 Tempting Adam.  Graham keeps up this style of writing and she will be listed in the top Blaze ranks, too.<br /><br />Off the bat, #130 Eye Candy gives you a shaky premise.  Crystal Peterson has eyes for Ron, a freelance photographer.  She doesn't claim to want a real romance with him, just to get to know him, but she is \\"hell bent for leather\\" to attract his attention.  And will do anything to gain it - including using her best friend Sam.  That really did not make me warm to Crystal too well.  Sam Schaffer has loved Crystal since they were fifteen - when he told her he loved her and she laughed in his face.  Loves her just as she is.  As I said, Crystal does not capture my heart!  Since then, Sam has hidden his heart and played best friend.  Better best friend than no Crystal at all.<br /><br />Sam runs a magazine, similar to a high-class playboy, but wants to bring the magazine into the real singles world by adding a woman's point of view column.  He keeps begging Crystal to write it, knowing she would be so good.  She turns him down, coward - she'd rather write homemaker articles for Redbook than take the chance she could do something better.<br /><br />Cami and Crystal play football with the boy on the weekend; they dress in jeans, cutoffs and T-shirts.  Cami's boyfriend gives her a gift certificate to be made over in to a \\"sex bomb\\".  Cami is thrilled.  It sets Crystal to thinking maybe why Rob ignores her is he thinks she's \\"one of the boys\\".  She goes shopping for Victoria Secrets underwear, but cannot figure out how to put on a bustier.  So she runs to Sam for help.  She says, since he deals with all these \\"bunny\\" type girls, he can help her be sexy for Ron.  Sam, poor dear, is not happy with the idea, but finally hits on this as a way to get her to write for his magazine.  Yeppers, even when he is being used, he is thinking of her!  He will play a cross between Henry Higgins and Hugh Heffner, and transform beautifully wholesome Crystal into \\"Bunny Crystal\\" - if she will do the articles for his magazine.<br /><br />Poor Sam finds himself in sexual quicksand, so desperate for Crystal, he lets her push it into sexual tutoring.  Not enough she has to look sexy for Ron, she has to act sexy, too.  GROAN.  I really liked Sam's character, you feel for him, being in love with Crystal who is so blind (blonde) she cannot see it.  Worse, you feel sorry for him being used in this manner.  You really want to reach through the pages and grab Crystal and shake her until her teeth rattle.  She goes on to have sex with Sam for over a week, yet still uses him to attract the date-from-Hell Ron?  ARGH!<br /><br />It's at that point I stopped gritting teeth and had to look at MY response.  WHY was so I furious with Crystal?  Because the writer is that bloody GOOD.  She made me CARE - despite the flaws of the characters.  If Sam and Crystal just dealt honestly with each other, had bothered to connect mentally as they did physically, instead of going through emotional contortions that would put CIRQUE DU SOLEIL to shame; despite Cami, her friend going power-happy with her new make over and kissing a man she has no interest in just because she is suddenly \\"sexy\\"; despite the reader seriously wanting to kick Crystal in the caboose - Graham is such a strong writer, with such a powerful voice that you're glued to the story unable to put it down.<br /><br />Don't think too many authors could have taken this premise, and pulled such a tour de force.  Her dialog is snappy.  She is able to tap into the sexual fantasies of her characters, even though they cannot tap into logic at times.  Her writing sizzles and dazzles.

And again, I am impressed.  Halloween Magic is another strong tale of dark magick and things that go bump in the night.  Once again, the lore surrounding May Day and Halloween are presented in a non-hysterical fashion, steep in lore and myths surrounding these pagan festivals.<br />On Halloween, there was a terrible thunderstorm that plagued the small hamlet of Wychavon.

He had the servants bring her into his home, and word quickly spreads through the village that she's a victim of amnesia and cannot recall who she is or where she came from.  He calls her Judith after his mother, and gossip runs rampant, as a short time later, the village learns he is to marry the woman 1/3 his age.  The shock is fed fuel, when scarcely two months later, the man is found drowned under very mysterious circumstances.  Since he had no heir, Judith inherits his estate.  Only Judith, knew precisely who she is - or rather was.  She was Meg Ashton, a powerful witch, burnt at the stake two hundred years ago.

First on that list was Admiral Villiers.  Next is Nicholas Montacute, the lord of Wychavon.<br />On Beltaine - May Day Eve - she goes to cast a spell to bring Nicholas back from London, so she can plot his death.  Only she dropped the seal she had stolen from his house.  She had charged it with bringing Nicholas back and making him fall for her charms.  Only when she dropped it, the seal ends up in Verity Windsor hands.  Verity has slipped out to wash her face in the dew on Beltaine, and found the seal.  By her possessing the seal, Judith's spell works - but instead of Judith being the object of Nicholas' affection - he returns and is suddenly obsessed with Verity.<br />Verity has long worship Nicholas from afar, but felt it was a hopeless love.  But suddenly, the handsome Nicholas declare himself taken with her.

The powerful writing of Jen Black reaches through the centuries and makes the history of the Dark Ages of Scotland come alive.  A talented writer, with a true vision, she quickly draws the reader into her absorbing tale of power, greed, betrayal and one man's vision of the future for his troubled kingdom.<br /><br />Malcolm, King of Alba had no heir, and in keeping with ancient Pictish traditions, the rule could past to any male on the distaff side.  An heir would be chose by the Council from the four contenders for the kingship - Thorfinn of Orkney, and his half brother Daveth mac Finlay; Duncan mac Crinan, the grandson of the King; and Doman mac Boedhe, grandson of King Kenneth.<br /><br />Finlay had been promised Boedhe's sister Kilda in marriage.  With the combining of Finlay's line and Kilda's line, everyone believes he will be made Tanist, heir to the throne of Alba (old Scotland).  After Finlay is sent to Canute, King of England and Denmark, he is told Boedhe has been killed in a brawl.  The King carries these bad tides to Finlay, both of them believing this accidental death is a little too convenient, but worse, Canute announces the sister Kilda has been married to another.<br /><br />Malcolm has taken advantage of Finlay being away from Scotland, and at English court, to marry Kilda to Gille mac Malbride, Finlay's cousin.  With Finlay away, and Boedhe conveniently dead, Kilda is without a protector, so she is unable to resist<br />the forced marriage.  Malcolm, now seventy, wants his grandson, Duncan mac Crinan to be Tanist.  By blocking Finlay's marriage to Kilda, he hopes to insure this.  Thus, Malcolm has sets forces into play that shall shape the future of Alba (old Scotland).<br /><br />When Finlay returns north, he makes a half-hearted effort to get Kilda to run away with him to England.  However, he is caught and tossed into the dungeon for a week.  When his half-brother Thorfinn of Orkney, claims lands in Alba, Malcolm sees a way to claim the Orkneys:  send Finlay north to kill Thorfinn, marry Thorfinn's half-sister, Ratagan, and install Finlay in Thorfinn's place.  Finlay goes along with the plan asking only that Gille be sent along in his party.  Everyone believes this is so Finlay can kill his cousin and claim Kilda, but Finlay is wiser.  Duncan's wife just died in childbirth, and marriage to Kilda would ensure the crown for Duncan.  By taking Gille northward with him, Finlay keeps him from the reach of Malcolm and Duncan.  When his half-brother lays out the realities of the situation - Duncan has Malcolm and Finlay and he have each other - the lines are drawn.<br /><br />It's marvelous story telling at its best.

When the first children of this colony grew up, it was discovered they were gifted with one of two talents: psychic ability or what they call a prism. The psychics were powerful, but they cannot control this ability, focus it for long periods of time.  For that they need a prism. A prism channels their power and amplifies it.  However, a psychic and a prism must be of the same level of strength or the psychic can overload and burn out the prism.<br />Orchid Adams is a strong prism, and she is just what Rafe Stonebreaker needs: a wife!  He is trying to take over control of his grandfathers shipping cooperation, and to do that he needs a wife to make him appear settled.  Only problem: is he is an off the chart psychic talent that has made placing him with in the Harmony romance matching agencies a bit of a problem.  He has contracted Orchid to help him with some private investigations, but he soon decides to do some matchmaking of his own, and encourages her to enter in a Harmony temporary marriage, a cover to aid him in taking power of the shipping business.<br />When Orchid's friend steals an ancient artifact, Rafe and she are tangled into a deep mystery of a mad killer desperate to cover his mistakes.<br />Once again, Jayne Anne Krentz, writing under the Castle name, gives us the dazzling shine of her talent!  This is some of her best writing over the last decade, JAK at her very best.<br />Early this year, they released the first two tales Amaryllis and Zinnia under the title HARMONY.  So if you enjoyed them, you will most definitely wish to have Orchid as well.  After Dark and After Glow are set on this same world, too.<br />People that love Nora Robert's JD Robb series should snap these up.  These are in the same style.  The romance sizzles, the banter is dazzling - it just does not get any better than this.	2004-09-30

There are some hot names in Futuristic/Sci-Romance today, but to those who embraced the sub genre years ago, you will know one name was there leading the way: Catherine Spangler. She just gets better and better with each book in her Shielder series - Shielder, Shamara, Shadower, Shadow Crossing and Shadow Fires (Dorchester Publishing). Shadow Crossing, I think is my favorite of all her talented works. I just love the premise!<br /><br />Celie Cameron was raised in a rough part of the Universe, saw horrors done to her family that have left their scars, deep scars. Now, after escaping through a worm whole with other Shielders, she is a smuggler, skirting on the edge of the law in Quadrant 9. In the past two years, she has been more legit - okay, boring. Her deliveries are almost always legit, there is no need for laser blasting, fights with The Controller ships. So when she lands, delivering her next shipment on time, she is caught off guard by the condition of the planet where she lands. The place are slums, and it smells of trouble. In fact, the whole place smells.<br /><br />She has little time to consider this appalling condition, because she discover Raven, has stolen away and plans on having an adventure with Calie. Nineteen, Raven is a Shielder, an orphan, who had been sold into slavery by the Anteks. Nessa and Chase rescued her (Shielder; Lovespell 1999) and raised her as their daughter. With the apprehension over the planet's condition, and now the burden of worrying over Raven, Celie just wants to make contact with Max, her client, get her money and \\"get the hell out of Dodge\\" before something bad happens.<br /><br />She meets Rurick, who she thinks is Max. The sexy man, with the golden eyes, turns out to be Max's android. One made to look just like Max. Max, Rurick, Calie and Raven and making the transfer of merchandise, when they are attacked. Max saves Raven, and Calie and Rurick escape into Max's ship. Calie is upset, leaving her ship behind means she has nothing, but Rurick and Max refuse to return Raven and her. Calie soon learns that Max and Rurick are on an important mission to fight an ever-growing evil.<br /><br />I cannot reveal more without ruining the delightful tale. It's Spangler at her very best. Max and Rurick are both sexy, hunks, but with a great sense of humor that keeps you smiling at their antics, especially as Raven falls for the stoic Max, and Calie lets down her walls of fear to let Rurick near.<br /><br />So if you love high-flying Sci-Romance, then don't hesitate.

A RITA Award winner with some six-dozen and growing books for Silhouette Intimate Moments and Silhouette Special Edition.  As if that is not enough laurels to rest upon, she also writes under the name Marie Nicole.  She has 14 series-within-a-series, the latest is the Cavanaugh Justice.  Others in the series Callie (Racing Against Time, SIM #1249) Clay (Crime and Passion, SIM#1256) Patrick (Internal Affairs, Silhouette Books) and Rayne (Dangerous Games, SIM #1274).  This, the fifth in the series (Silhouette Special Edition #1613), is Teri's story.  Ferrarella has a good feel for romance, but also a good feel for families, and this shows in her writing.  I also compliment her Multiple POV (Point of View) writing, letter the readers know what both characters are thinking as the story progresses, instead of the rigid single POV per chapter writing we are now seeing as a fad in Yank writers.  She handles Multiple POV with ease, they way a good writer should, giving the full textures and reactions of BOTH her lead characters.  It's a sheer pleasure to read this style!<br /><br />Teri Cavanaugh was raised with four brothers and sisters - and assorted cousins -knows noise is her element.  She loves the large family chaos and confusion.  However, she is saddled with a partner for the last nine months that is about to drive her up the wall with his silence.  Nine months and he had barely spoken one word not necessary to see the job done.  That doesn't stop Teri from using her mental crowbar, trying to pry information out of the silent but sexy black-haired, blue eyed Jack Hawkins.  Her uncle paired the two together after both their partners moved to different jobs.<br /><br />Jack's former partner was as silent as he, so Teri is jarring on his nerves.  Worse, he is cognizant that he is working with his boss' niece.  Jack is one of the best detectives going.  \\"Male detectives wanted to be Hawk.  Women flat-out wanted him.\\"  Naturally, opposites - an enforced closeness - sees their attraction flare.  Both knew being lovers crossed the lines, but they could resist the passion.<br /><br />There is a second story within the tale, about Andrew Cavanaugh.  Fifteen years ago his wife Rose disappeared and he has never given up home of finding the only women he ever loved.  Rose - now calling herself Claire - went out one day, fifteen years ago.  Claire has a new life and no recollection of Rose, her husband or her children.  Suddenly, she is confronted with a handsome man claiming to be her husband, and wanting her to come back home to those who love and miss her.<br /><br />Ferreralla in her strong style, with great insight, using the Multi-POV, gives a rich book strong on emotions, caring and a family's love.  But then, every book she creates reaches this high quality.  Ferreralla, PLEASE, retain the Multi-POV of style - you are grace in prose with it!be Hawk.

This is the final tale in the series (Perfect Target #1212 and Crossfire #1287 for reading the tales about Ethan's sisters). But this tale really stands out. Mills is always great, but this one was just a little extra special.<br /><br />Ethan Carrington long ago made friends with a man in the US, during his college days, and brought him home, only to have his girlfriend fall in love with the man they called Demetri. Later they discover he was the son of a small European dictator with a very bloody history. Ethan arranged the man's take-down, but he escaped, and ever since then he has been coming at Ethan using his family as targets to get even.<br /><br />Brenna Scott is a woman haunted by dreams...nightmares that come true. Many times, she \\"sees\\" people being killed and was not be able to prevent it, thus making her walk a solitary path, live her life in the shadows. However, when the dreams begin showing Ethan dying, she comes out of the shadows to warn him. Being a hardheaded man of logic, he does not believe her, and actually thinks she is the bait Demetri is dangling before him as a lure for his vengeance. Because Ethan refuses to listen and doubts her motives, he puts both their lives in danger.<br /><br />It's a taught tale with vivid characters that gets its hook in you and won't let go. Mills handles the clairvoyance dead bang on, that will send shivers up your spine.<br /><br />Mills is a force to watch.

They define that series and push the envelop, but all this red-hot sexy scenes are crafted into strong stories, well-developed characters and delivered with a sense of humor.  However, Silhouette Special Editions are know for their more \\"homey\\" romances.  So can the dynamic duo create a book that is off their normal blistering pace?  The answer is yes - without a doubt.  I have a feeling this wonderfully talented team can write anything they make up the minds to tackle.<br /><br />It's a delightful tale with great, quirky characters.  Aidan Kendal has been running longer than he cared to recall.  And he was oh so tired of running.  Tired of being alone.  So when he came to Old Orchard, he decided to draw the line in the sand and stay put.  He has been there for a year now, is teaching at the local school, and just beginning to relax enough to enjoy himself.  He especially delights in his casually friendship with Penelope Moon.<br /><br />Penelope Moon, 24-years-old and unmarried, runs the local New-Age bookstore started by her grandmother.  Of course, back then Gran ran it as a general herb shop for Spells and Potions.  Through they still sold the herbs, Penelope felt the bookstore label lent the little shop an air of respectability and acceptance.  Still, everyone came for the special teas and tonics.  She lived in the same house she had grown up in, shared it with her grandmother.  But there was an itchiness accepting her, and it had nothing to do with the hot summer.<br /><br />Aidan relishes his quite rapport with the shy woman, and keeps trying to drawn Penelope out more.  His been the one always keeping people at bay, he is dawn to a like soul.  But just as he begins to feel Old Orchard is home, trouble comes to town.  A local merchant is robbed, and he tells the sheriff the robber looked just like Aidan.  On the surface, Aidan tries to laugh it off, but deep down he knows who the criminal was - his twin brother Davin.  As the hot summer heat builds insufferably, Aidan knows his running has come to an end.<br /><br />The Silhouette Special Edition format gives the Carrington team a chance to shine in another style of novel.

That said, her book, Proud to Be, still manages to hold your interest and elicit your sympathy. Flinn, the first female bomber pilot in the United States Air Force, achieved a different sort of notoriety when she was forced to leave the service in the wake of an affair with a married enlisted man. In the civilian world, stories like Flinn's are a dime a dozen and, though painful for the parties involved, hardly the stuff of national controversy. In the military, however, sex is a hot-button issue. Already racked by the Tailhook scandal a few years ago (for which not a single male participant was punished), the Air Force whipped up a storm of controversy when it threatened Flinn with a court-martial for her adulterous behavior.<br /><br />Certainly Flinn is not blameless in all this; she admits to her involvement with an enlisted man who was married to an enlisted woman, though Flinn is rather disingenuous when it comes to accepting responsibility for her actions. Nevertheless, the real story behind Kelly Flinn's run-in with the Air Force is less about sex than double standards in the military. Think what you will about Flinn, but her book raises some important and troubling questions about America's military establishment.<br /><br />Amazon's review at the top is totally wrong.<br /><br />Anyone who watched the news KNEW it was the NAVY who held Tailhook.	2004-09-26

Kiss & Tell	Books	4	2	3	N	Y	good writing despite bad logic and plot holes	I'm giving Blaze 113, Kiss & Tell: Just Between Us, the third in a series by the brilliantly sassy husband and wife writing team of \\"Tori Carrington\\" four stars.  The Carringtons generally get five stars from me; they are just that strong of writers.  Only, strong writing is not the problem with this book.  It's the third and last in the series - and maybe thankfully - because it shows the series being stretched to make that third book and really \\"thin\\" on plot because of it.  To the Carrington's writing credit that pushes the limit of hot, once again, the sassy prose grabs the readers and keeps them reading despite the really shaking premise.<br />In the first two books, Night Fever: Kiss & Tell, Harlequin Blaze, 105 and Flavor Of The Month: Kiss & Tell Harlequin Blaze, 109) we've met four very close friends, Leyla, Reilly, Mallory and Jack.  Since all three women had wanted to jump sexy Jackson Daniel's bones, they make a pact none of them shall.  Fine.  But for that to be the crux of a conflict, they needed to make it the FIRST story in the series - not the last!  In Night Fever, Leyla the doctor gets engaged and Reilly coffee shop/ice cream shop owner and Ben, owner of an up and coming restaurant do their story in Flavor of the Month.  This leaves Mallory, the budding documentary producer, and Jack - we have little idea what he does other than writes a column for a paper - to do their turn.  However, by doing this story last - they pull props right out from under the whole premise.  WHY should Leyla who now has Sam, and Reilly who now has Ben, care if Mallory and Jack are doing the \\"wild thing\\"?  Jack wants to tell them they have been involved from the very start, Mallory prefers to keep hiding it from her \\"good\\" friends.<br />These are friends to whom you tell everything.  These very friends pitch in and give Mallory a small fortune to finish her documentary, yet she has been lying to them for years and prefers to KEEP lying to them?  To compound errors in plotting, The \\"great friends\\" have been so close, sharing every woe, every success, yet Mallory (while jumping Jack at every chance she gets) know absolutely nothing about Jack and is content with that.  It's only after Jack demands they tell their other two friends, and threatens to cut off the sex, that Mallory stops and wonders how Jack spends his time when he is not in her bed (we are talking over three years here).<br />The issue of Mallory \\"dating\\" Jack would've only been a bone of contention amongst the three women, when they were ALL single and all had yearnings for Jack.  Now the other two are paired off, why should it be a problem Jack and Malloy should have to hide their romance?  How can four friends be their little bastion against the world and not care more about each other to notice Jack and Mallory were \\"doing it\\"?  Sorry, a man and woman involved sexually cannot hide it!  Small responses toward each other send off signals.  If they had made this the lead book, when all three women were lusting after Jack, then the premise would have worked.  It would have also made the fact these so-called devoted friends knew so damn little about each other.  Of course, I don't put the whole blame on them.  Where was the editor?  Their editor should have seen this problem coming front point one.<br />The Carrington's strength in their books is their sizzling writing.  The dynamic duo is right on target there.  They are daring, sassy, saucy - everything you expect from this writing team.  I enjoyed the first two books very much, so I was able to continue reading the last in the series despite it has such a week, shaky and out-of-order plot.  Lori and Tony seemed to define the Blaze line, for their story blazes...<br />It just would've been so much more believable had they put this book at the front of the trio of tales where it would've made more sense.  So, just go with the flow, suspend questions and enjoy the talented writing teams magic antics.  People reading the other two will enjoy this book more and be willing to ignore the gaping holes in logic.

She is simply one of the best writers around in either Contemporary or Historical romances.  In To Love a Dark Lord, as usual, she delivers - this time one of her best Historicals ever!<br />She is the queen of creating bad boys with blackhearts and souls.  This time the scoundrel is James Killoran, who has a heart and soul so black he himself knows there is only one reason to lives, and that is revenge.  He once loved a redheaded woman, only to have her destroyed.  James could not save the woman he loved, so his only reason for living is vengeance, but he is no where closer to achieving that aim.  The road to revenge can be a bloody dull, long and boring reason to live, since he cannot find the right weapon to extract it, so he uses people to relieve the tedium of his ennui.  Mostly, he's just drunk and in a fowl mood with his self-loathing.<br />The book opens with Emma Lagolet escaping a ravishing.  Between her graceless attempts at saving herself, and the drunken James tarnished knight in shining armour rescue, Emma escapes.  He deposits her where she can find a possession as help, only to discover she must again fight off the advances of her employer's amorous son.  James at first thinks it a hallucination as Emma flops over his wooden fence.  But the Irish Lord, again, goes to great pains to save Emma - just for the entertainment.  Then James is struck that Emma is the perfect instrument to complete his long awaited vengeance.  Emma who now loves James will go to any length to win James' love.  James, too, is falling for Emma, but he will let nothing stand in his way from his revenge.<br />It is so funny, with strong characters, proving once again, Stuart is the tops in her field.  One of the Best!  Why this is not in reprint is ONE BIG MYSTERY!	2004-09-25

It just does not get any better than that. Stuart came near that perfection with Nightfall, Ritual Sins and Shadows at Sunset, but it was always close, but not close enough. Well, Moonrise now shares that title of favourite book with Into The Fire. This is Stuarts best work since Moonrise, so Stuart fans queue up!! It is a masterpiece. Dark, moody, steamy and so sexy it will knock your socks off.<br />Nate Kincaid was beloved his whole life. Doted on by his uncle and aunt, they treated him more like a son, after his parents died in a fire. Treated him more special than the daughter they adopted. That hurt Jamie Kincaid, but since she adored Nate, too, she almost viewed everyone worshipping Nate as his due. So why would someone kill Nate Kincaid? Someone had, in a most brutal fashion: beaten him to death in a dirty garage on the edge of a dying town in Wisconsin.<br />Jamie's mother wants answers. Jamie wants answers, too. And since the police take an apathetic view that is was just another drug deal gone sour, she has come to Wisconsin to find them, come to the one person who can supply them...if only he will. Dillon Gaynor.<br />Stuart is the resident genius of creating bad boys we cannot resist. Dillon Gaynor is Stuart at her best. A vividly drawn, dark, complex Alpha-Male hero, which means he is not a hero at all. Dillon is likely responsible for Nate's death, in the real sense, if not, then for leading Nate into drug culture. For most of her life, Jamie had watched Dillon at a safe distance. A pretty girl, more smart than she should be, according to Nate, she valued that distance from Dillon. Being smart, Jamie clung to that safety, because deep inside she knew Dillon fascinated her. As with big beautiful panthers, we hunger to get close and touch them, stroke them, but the innate sense of survival warns us they are apt to take off our hand if we do. So smart girls keep their distance, though we harbor that secret seed these bad boys could make us forget everything mama taught us.<br />But one night 12 years ago, Dillon did not keep his distance. A night that forever ruined his life and Jamie's. Echoes still haunt and shape them both. After a lousy Thanksgiving and watching her mother decline as the need for answers grows, Jamie sucks up her courage and travels days to get to Wisconsin. Within miles of her destination, her rickety car breaks down in the middle of the night, so she is forced to walk the final leg of her journey to confront Dillon. She fears him, is convinced Dillon kept Nate supplied with the drugs that lead to his death. But she fears that we tiny spot inside her more, knowing that despite refusing to admit it, Dillon is her obsession and can lure her to walk on the wild side.<br />Now she faces him for the first time in over a decade, Dillion who had been her secret teenage fantasy, only to find the man is so much more. Ghosts haunt Jamie and Dillion, ghost of their troubled past, maybe even the ghost of Nate. As she tries to unriddle the mystery of Nate's ugly death, she comes to understand someone is trying to kill her. Could that someone be Dillion? Could Nate's death have something to do with the horrible night 12 years ago? Could Dillion want revenge for spending a year and a half in prison because of Nate and Jamie?<br />No one creates this sort of bad to the bone, arrogant, dark and blooding male as Stuart does. We have seen this time and again in Moonrise, Nightfall, Ritual Sins and Shadows at Sunset (all highly recommend and with a BIG question why they are NOT in reprint.) Without doubt she is the best and none can touch her in this special Alpha-Male magic.<br />Jamie and Dillion are unforgettable and will be for long time to come.ed these bad boys could make us forget everything mama taught us.<br />But one night 12 years ago, Dillon did not keep his distance.

Her series works for Harlequin and Silhouette are as a wonderful treat as her longer works.<br /><br />In Glass House, Billionaire corporate raider Michael Dubrovnik has bought all the old properties in the area in New York City to create a huge glass building with modern design. The only thing standing in his way is another building of glass, this one owned by Laura de Kelsey Winston. Unless her \\"house\\" comes down, his multi-million dollar project can fall to ruin, and Michael will never permit that to happen.<br /><br />Laura loves her glass building, built with style and class of a period gone by. It needs a lot of work, and it will likely cost more money than she can swing, but she intends Glass House will survive - in spite of Michael's high powered pressure. When she refuses every offer he makes, and states she will never leave Glass House to be destroyed my Michael, he begins making her life a living hell.  First, he moves into the building so he is there to constantly plague her.  When seducing her doesn't work, he tries taking down the old buildings surrounding her, literally rattling the walls of the small glass building.<br /><br />As their stormy battle of wills rage over the small building in the way of his project, they find their passion almost as strong as their determination. Michael discovers he is falling in love with Laura, but is not will to let love rule him, and nearly kills her in a bad construction accident. He must chose between his high money project and her love, and Laura must decide which is more important -  hanging on to the past and its traditions, or losing the man she loves.<br /><br />There is a nifty little mystery about Laura and everyone receiving blackmail attempts, which only serves to keep the lively story moving with a fast pace.  Glass House is another in the long line of Stuart's backlist just waiting to be discovered.	2004-09-25
510931:US	46983871	R1JZN7GBSI72SY	0425196844	300331712	Jane's Warlord (Berkley Sensation)	Books	5	28	33	N	Y	one great book from a very talented writer	I first read Angela Knight in Red Sage's Secrets Vol. #2. The novella was entitled \\"Roarke's Prisoner\\" and she literally blew me away! I immediately was desperate for anything written by the talented writer, who gives you a raw, red-hot story, yet still remembers the passion in romance, not just the sex. She always has a strong plot foundation that is often missing in other Erotic Romance writers. Basically, she is am author who gives you her all. I was very disappointed to find out this amazing writer did not have dozens of books on her backlist. How could print publishers let this talent slip through their fingers? If I was an editor I would have snapped her up two years ago! I devoured the other Red Sage books (Secrets #3 \\"Blood and Kisses\\" and Secrets #7 \\"Kissing the Hunter\\" were vampire tales) and they were just as strong. She has a new book out this month - besides Jane's Warlord - from Ellora's Cave - Ellora's Cavemen: Tale of the Temple II and her second big-book is out in October called Master of the Night - a sexy vampire saga, her 2nd for Berkley - so to say Knight is on fire is putting it mildly! Frankly, it will be the readers who are on fire! This writer is one to watch! It is interesting to see the impact Ellora's Cave is having on mainstream print publishers, because Knight turns up the romance with intensely, erotic love scenes, which might have some faint-hearted readers blushing! EC making big waves and you are seeing more writers from EC being snapped up by the publishing houses. They are stretching the general genre Romance, pushing the envelope. It's rather exciting to witness the \\"new kids on the block\\" making the old guard take notice. Writers who are coming out of Red Sage and EC are bringing a large following with them, so they enter the trade paperback market with big sales and instant bestsellers.<br /><br />However, Knight is one of the best by any standard. She creates strong characters you care about, gives reasonable (Time-Travel is always iffy logic to me! lol) explanations to her Time-Travel line, and takes something old and makes it new again. There will be instant references from readers of The Terminator giving Knight her seed for this story, (the writer even makes a couple herself!). So? They say there are only 7 basic storylines; it is what the writer does with them that showcases the talent. Knight took sexy John De Salvo, grafted him onto a genetically engineered body ala Arnie from T1, and gives you were sizzling kick a*** tale. Toss in a Time-Traveling Jack the Ripper and you have the makings of a very compelling story.<br /><br />Jane Colby finds herself the target of old period-jumping Jack and the only thing standing between her and the killer are a generically altered, wisecracking timber wolf and one sexy warrior from the future. Knight blends all her elements so deftly. The scorching love scenes are nearly devastating, yet she manages to keep them from overpowering the whole book, by adding flawed, well-drawn characters with a rich history, a chilling stalk for a killer who is in turn stalking Jane, and the quirky humor of having a talking wolfhound that makes me think of the mouthy dog from the Men in Black Movies. The scenes with the wolf an absolute how, punch up the intensity level of the sexy love scenes and the brutal slayings, but giving the reader that much needed (pant pant) time to catch their breath!<br /><br />This may be Knight's first trade paperback big book, but she sounds the trumpet - she is a force to be reckoned with sexy, futuristic/paranormal tales that take the reader to the limit and beyond! If you want your romances on par with \\"a kiss on the cheek Regency level\\" then give this book a pass for it will curl your toes. Knight's book is a \\"if you cannot stand the heat then get out of the kitchen\\" sort of tale. For those wanting a novel that delivers on all levels, then take the walk into the fire! Just be sure to have a tall picture of iced-lemonade handy!<br /><br />I am also very impressed with her research about Jack the Ripper.  As Jack as been one of my fields of study, I appreciate her taking time to learn all the details of the case.  It's reflected in her writing.<br /><br />I cannot wait for her October release of Master of the Knight.  Camelot was vampires!

Since my great great great...well you get the idea...grandda was said to be a Selkie, I am rather touchy when writers create stories on the lore. Most of the time, I sort of cringe fearing the writers will not show the Selkies proper justice they deserve. When Melanie Jackson said she was doing a book about one, the reaction was different - joy, for I knew Melanie - and her heritage (I have it on good insider info from the Wee People and some odd charater named Malek that she is one of the Fae!!) and her love for All Things Scottish would do right by the Selkies.<br />Melanie has written a utterly charming tale of a Selkie accidentally called from the Sea...and OH DOES IT STEAL THE HEART!! I applaud Melanie's setting the book in 1929 - seems the romance market considered anything after the Turn of the Century too modern day and not worthy of writing about. So in 1929, Hexy Garrow is maid/companion to widowed, blonde bimbo, who pulls a blonde moment and leaves and her expensive sable coat on the beach of the Scottish Coast. Hexy is sent to fetch it because her mistress is leaving for Italy and cannot leave without her coat.<br />Hexy's take a few moments for herself at the beach, two shed a few tears - 7 to be exact - for the loss of her brother who drowned, for her failed romance, for the loose morals of today's (1929) young women -- and because her nose is red from allergies. She has no notion the 7 tears shed into the sea summons the Selkie -- in this case one Ruairidh O'Uruisg -- or that the seal coat she mistakes for her mistress' is really Ruairidh's Selkie skin!<br />For those not familiar with Scottish Lore, the Selkies were/are magickal seals that came ashore, shed the skin and take human mates. They were so beautiful that no one could resist them, but they were only permitted to live on shore for a year and a day before they had to return to the sea. So you can imagine Hexy, a very practical modern-day girl has a wee bit of difficulty dealing with Ruairidh, when he comes to reclaim his seal skin coat. He asserts he has no time to be her lover, maybe later-- when the time is right for such things.  He is horrified to to learn HIS coat is on way to Italy via Wales. It is vital he gets it back.<br />It is a charming romance, whimsical, light, and so true to the ancient lore of Scotland. Melanie's Hexy and Ruairidh are so wonderful, bright and will absolutely steal your heart.<br />So if you love Scotland, and wish to have a wee grand adventure, I cannot help but recommend Melanie's best book to date. She is simply magickal with a k...but then what else would one of the Fae be???<br />I have truly loved many of Melanie's works - those pesky Goblins included, but this is by far her best!!when he comes to reclaim his seal skin coat.

Lynsay Sands and Hannah Howell pen the two tales in The Eternal Highlander.  This is a real treat for Sands' fan, who know her for her Hysterical Historicals and the wacky Angeneau Vamps.  This is a serious story, showing another side of her talent.  Hannah Howell has long been known for her strong Scottish Historical.  These two talented ladies combine their muses and come up with these interlocking stories.<br /><br />Set in Medieval Times, Cathal and NacNachton and Connal MacAdie are Highlanders, they are cousins, but they are bound in a way deeper than blood or Clan alliances.  They have a dark secret that ties them to their Clan, their lands, an ancient curse that has fallen upon all of their ancestry.  This curse has seen them stalk the night, and shun neighboring Clans, burning with an unquenchable thirst that drives them and those like them.  However, time of their remoteness is fast changing, and the fear their kindred might be hunted down and destroyed, push these two strong men, to lead the way to the future...and light.  They can breed out their curse by marriage with Outsiders - women who blood will weaken the taint and forever break the pall of the curse that has made them a Clan apart.<br /><br />In Nightriders by Hannah Howell, Cathal had decided to marry Bridget Callan.  Dire circumstances pressed her to accept the offer of marriage to Cathal NacNachton.  In The Highland Bridge Lynsay Sand's pens the gentle tale of Connal MacAdie and Eva Claxton.  She, too, must marry because of desperate circumstances.  The marriages of both of these women draw them into danger as the nature of the men they married slowly comes to light, pulling them into intrigue, danger and desire.<br /><br />Both women are strong and refused to be turned into pawns in a deadly game, with the lives of their husbands and their new Clan - the ultimate prize.  Both women have decided to stand by their new spouses and fight for eternal love and the very survival of the Clan.  For those who love Scottish Sagas and dark vamps this is a super read.<br /><br />2004 Reviews International Organization Award of Excellence Finalist (Lynsay Sands) for best short story and 1st Place Winnertand by their new spouses and fight for eternal love and the very survival of the Clan.

In McGillivray's Bed Harlequin Presents # 2406 is my first Anne McAllister book, and I must say it won't be my last. The misspelling of MacGillivray (LOL) aside, I found McAllister's writing sassy, lively. Harlequin Presents is a short series book only 185 page (!) so it does not give a writer a lot of room to flesh out characters, but McAllister seems very deft at working within this confinement. Her characters are vivid, full of wit and humor making this a very enjoyable quickie read.<br />The beginning is a wee bit contrived (but due to the 185-page length I sort of dismiss that - the length just does not give a lot of time to develop a stronger plot. In this tale, Sydney St. John jumped overboard to avoid being married against her will. (I warned it was a bit forced. Ignore it!). She is in the middle of the ocean when her father's business partner announced before all they are going to be married that night. Instead of telling the jerk to take a hike, she jumps overboard to avoid making a scene and avoid the marriage. Fortunately, for her Hugh McGillivray is out relaxing with a day of fishing. Instead of a big fish, he catches Sydney.<br />Hugh has sworn off women. He was in love with Carin, but Carin married someone else. Since then, he has contented himself with loving Carin from a far (idiot) and cutting a wide swatch through the female population of Pelican Bay, a love-em-and-leave-em sort of jerk all women want to kick (big idiot). His life of late has been a living bachelors hell, because Lisa, a 19-year-old, has announced to one and all she and Hugh are going to be married. Does not matter than Hugh has told her no way Jose, she believe she can wear him down. In order to keep Lisa at bay, and Sydney's hot-in-pursuit jilted business partner, they agree to pretend she is Hugh's wife. Solves both of their problems, but of course opens another can of worms - their attraction for each other.<br />If you like to nitpick a story apart, you might give this one a pass, because the situations are rather forced. But if you are looking for a light read, to relax before bedtime, a delightful fresh voice that is able to weave humor into the tale, then Macallister is your cup of tea. I eagerly look forward to the rest in the series.- their attraction for each other.<br />If you like to nitpick a story apart, you might give this one a pass, because the situations are rather forced.

After Dark is the prequel to After Glow - just out recently under the Castle name.  It was a super paranormal/off-world tale that I really adored and thought it a great, vibrant tale, much in the old Krentz mold.  Strangely, it was not received well by her fans at the time - before the big Paranormal Romance boom.  Its reception was so cold that her publisher put off putting out anymore in this series for nearly four years.  I guess the Paranormals burning up the charts caused them to rethink that line, and they brought out the sequel to After Dark - After Glow - which received great reviews.  My, my what a time frame can mean to the readers mind?  Soft Focus was a very enjoyable Single Title Romantic Suspense (meaning before Krentz and her publishers started doing the Trilogy releases - 1 good strong tale followed by two weaker ones).  It was a very enjoyable read, but not Krentz at her best.  So why the putting of the Krentz tale and the Castle Tale together, where there is nothing to connect them, especially since both are still in print?  My guess to get your money.  How many people buy this without looking closely to see they are reprints?  I could see putting After Dark and After Glow into one double book, they belong together.  This marketing smacks of just wanting more bucks.<br /><br />After Dark was a great Off-World tale of Harmony, where earth travellers colonised and then were cut off from Earth connections when the \\"curtain\\" closed.

She applies the same cost and profit in her business life to her romance life.  So after a one night stand with Jack Fairfax, and Elizabeth discovers Jack deceived her, she wants to cut her losses.

This is JAK writing as the Jayne Castle she saves for her paranormal tales, and it's her best writing of late.  I have been a wee tad disappointed in her last several hardbacks, especially in her Amanda Quicks (her historical romance name).  She seems to have polished her diamond too much and lost some of the spontaneity that was her trademark.  But in Amaryllis, Zinnia and Orchid (and later with After Dark and After Glow) the off-world of Harmony antics show JAK at her top form.  These books original received mixed reviews from fans, not completely used to JAK's paranormals.  I often see the complaint JAK is a great writer, but the books are too patterned.  It's in her Jayne Castle works where is her most original, yet her fans were initially resistant to the paranormal theme.  Now the paranormal market has caught up with her, and is so hot, these are getting better reviews.  So if you missed the Harmony tales, don't hesitate to seek them out.<br />In this off world tale, Amaryllis Lark is a private detective, but she is also a prism. In the Earth Colony of Harmony, people evolved with two supernatural talents: either they were a prism or a psychic.  The prisms serve to increase the power of the psychics by channeling their powers through them, amplifying it and keeping it stable.  Even the strongest of psychics needs a prism, for without them they cannot control and maintain their powers for long periods.<br />Lucas Trent, the founder of Lodestar, hires Amaryllis for her prism talents.  He is an off the chart psychic who need the talent of a prism of his level.  A psychic and a prism have to be matched.  They are rated 1-10 levels and if a psychic is stronger than a prism, the prism can experience burn-out.  There are few prisms who can handle Lucas Trent's strong psychic abilities, so he is delighted to discover Amaryllis can handle whatever power he channels through her.<br />Lucas is concerned one of his Lodestone employees is selling corporate information to his competition.  He, originally, hired Amaryllis to help catch the industrial spy, and to use her talents as a prism to help his focus his psychic talent to trap the  spy.  But soon they are involved in a murder mystery.  In this case, opposites do attract, and Lucas and Amaryllis sizzle, their attraction amplified by the psy-power between them.  However, Amaryllis is undergoing the rigors of a matchmaking<br />service.  All solid marriages on Harmony are founded on this service.  While she is falling in love with Lucas, she fears it will only be an affair.  Lucas has other plans and is not about to let his true match slip through his fingers.<br />In order to foil nasty corporate to-dos, they are forced to join talents...and more!  A super, brilliant work from the fine craft of JAK, without the narrow POV (point of view) being voiced on writers today.  Simply magic!hted to discover Amaryllis can handle whatever power he channels through her.<br />Lucas is concerned one of his Lodestone employees is selling corporate information to his competition.

It was a very enjoyable read, but not Krentz at her best.<br /><br />In Soft Focus, Elizabeth is an all business heroine (typical JAK!).  She applies the same cost and profit in her business life to her romance life.  So after a one night stand with Jack Fairfax, and Elizabeth discovers Jack deceived her, she wants to<br />cut her losses.  Jack is not willing to let her do it, and uses their business contract to keep a leash on the spunky lady.<br /><br />Jack owns Excalibur, a cutting edge technology firm.  When he discovers there is sabotage going on that could put them both in the red financially, Elizabeth has to let Jack back into her life.  If she helps Jack save Excalibur, she stands to make millions of dollars.  Together they search for a missing scientist who made off with a new special crystal.  Elizabeth and Jack follow the clues to a film festival and the fun begins, with Jack keeping an eye on winning Elizabeth back as well as saving his firm.<br /><br />A very deft tale from a talented writer.

Kate Rothwell's first novel hints at a gentle talent, a talent to warm the heart.  She does not create a hero that is a prince - legitimate or otherwise - a duke, a viscount, an earl, a baron.  She does not add another to the flood of Scottish Historicals, she chooses New York City, 1882, and her hero is a caring, hard-working policeman.  So refreshing!  Often, in Historical Romances you get the impression love was for a feisty heroine and some titled nobleman, that no one else fell in love and lived happily ever after.  So it's delightful Rothwell gives us a romance between a beleaguer New York Copy, Michael McCann, and an adventuresome young woman, Timona Calverson.<br /><br />Mick rescues Timona, who is dressed like a boy.  She had been kidnapped off the street and deposited in a brothel, but the resourceful lass has made good her escape.  Only, she is run to ground and attacked by the thugs.  Fortunately for her, Mick is there to save her.  He takes her home, stitches her up and she in turn proceeds to upset the man's life.<br /><br />Mick is an Irisher barely off the boat.  He saves his money and sends it back to the homeland to the family left behind.  He is mistrustful of the rich English, so off the bat, Timona with her British accent sets him off.  When he finds she is not a street<br />urchin, but a rich, world-traveler - the famous Timona Calverson - he is not happy.  Mick is seeing the delightful, \\"valley girl\\" Daisy.  Daisy likes Mick, but her family has higher hopes for their beautiful daughter.  Mick believes they have a bit of an understanding, but quickly learns this is not the case.  Timona has already decided you don't let a good man slip through your fingers, so Daisy's open flirtation with another man gives her the chance to claim the wonderful and caring Mick.<br /><br />It's a gentle sweet romance, with a lot of strong research into the period, into the Gaelic and Mick's Irish background.  All around, Rothwell gives a delightful tales that touches the heart and puts a smile on your face.  Somebody to Love is the sequel to this delicate gem, so I am looking forward to Rothwell's second effort.  Her voice marks her as a unique talent, one to watch.<br /><br />I especially appreciated Kate's use of multi-POV(Point of View).  The rapid anti-headhoppers are beginning to wear thin with me.  I appreciate a talented writer who can blend both male and female characters in the same scene instead of the current fad of remaining in single POV.  It's give such a richer, more well-rounded story and such stronger characters.<br /><br />2004 Reviews International Organization Award of Excellence Finalist for Best Short History and Best Debut Catagories - and Second Place Winner for Best Debutnd, Rothwell gives a delightful tales that touches the heart and puts a smile on your face.

Peterson, shows great imagery in her writing, and a talent to evoke emotions.  I did have a small problem from the start.  With the very limited size of Harlequin Intrigues, they generally keep their prologues to just a couple pages.  Peterson has a 15-page prologue that really detracted just a bit from the book.  It's a set upÂ¯why Cora is basically going to Midnight Island to hide out.  However, she could have jumped straight into page one of the story and used the prologue as back-story with in the chapter.  It's just jarring.  It's starts out with a killer attacking Cora, and it's plays more like a slasher suspense.  Then the book moves into a really great gothic.  The two just really did not gel together.  Also, it seemed a little gratuitous in this sort of novel.  The book would have played much better to start with the reader go to the island with Cora and learn about her as the story unfolded.  The 15-pages of the killer attacking Cora, was too long, and really not needed, since any details could have been folded into the story.  You can jump into Chapter One and enjoy the book without it, so it said it was not needed.  The 15-pages could have been used in the story itself, since Intriques are only 250 pages long.<br /><br />Cora Shelly's friend was killed and she attacked, and she is waiting to testify Eric Dubane.  The man swears he will come for Cora in court. (That is a bit of stereotypical overkill.  How many times do people really declare this in court for real?)  Cora decides to accept employment as a cook on a remote island in the St. Lawrence Seaway, at a castle owned by the Mackenzies.  (I give Peterson an extra star for getting the small k in the name correct!)  The island is own by William Mackenzie, an ailing man who rarely leaves his room.  He is married to the well-preserved second wife, Amanda.  She was the one who hired Cora as cook for the large household.  Jake Mackenzie is the sole heir to his father's shipping firm, and now runs it.  In typical Gothic fashion, Jake's wife vanished two years before, and the police have given up looking for her.  Maggie Mackenzie is the emotionally fragile stepsister to Jake.  She is hiding dark secrets she's itching to tell.  Dr. Sheffield and his wife are frequent visitors to the castle, and it's under his care that Cora begins to have strange nightmares.  Naturally, Jake at first is gruff with Cora, but attraction flairs.<br /><br />It's a dark and stormy night tale, done with a strong flair.  Despite the small flaws, Peterson gives the reader an enjoyable story that is reminiscent of old Dark House movies of the 40s and 50s.  I look forward to more stories from this writer.ge household.

Hot Blood is an anthology by for of the hottest paranormal writers around today - Christine Feehan, Maggie Shayne, Emma Holly and Angela Knight.  This book rocks, no two ways about it!  If you love Vamps and Lycans, love cutting edge, shock-your-socks-off, sizzling writers with original tales, then this book is for you.  Don't pass it off to Gran or Auntie Mae unless you know this is their cup of tea.  It can, in places, make little old ladies swoon and reach for the smelling salts.  However, if you are tired of tame anthologies and looking for a walk on the wild side, don't hesitate.  It's rare to find so much talent under one anthology banner.<br /><br />The first tale is Christine Feehan's Dark Hunger, a continuation of her very successful \\"DARK\\" Carpathian series.  I noted one mainstream critic said she struggled with the short story form.  Baloney!  Christine's style is sharp, fluid and beautifully written - and I might compliment her on her multiple-POV (Point of View) style I so enjoy.  The lyrical writing was so refreshing compared to the single POV rabidness going around of late that is making books stale.  It's quality writing at it's best.  The tale is about a Carpathian who has been captured, and left to die, in a remote jungle lab.  He cannot warn his kindred without being \\"bait\\" in the trap.  However, he is saved by Juliette.  Unable to control his need, he must take Juliette's blood to survive.  All the DARK fans will not want to miss this one.  And again, big round of applause for Feehan's multi POV style!<br /><br />Awaiting Moonlight is Maggie Shayne's tale.  I have been a fan of her work since the old Silhouette Shadow's heyday, and her talent just grows.  This is a wonderful tale about a science professor who enters the steamy bayou to find a new species of animal, convinced it is responsible for the wild tales of Lycanthropes running about the town.  Only, she  runs smack into the real thing, fangs and all, and find he is quite tempting.  He is not her worst nightmare, but her darkest fantasy come to life.  Shayne's writing is strong, the tale magic.<br /><br />The Night Owl is the entry from Emma Holly.  It's a very charming tale of Marriann O'Faolian who lives in a small Vermont town, and just loves to bake her grandfather's recipes.  The sexy Bastien, who is her landlord, has a lot of secrets to hide, but the townsfolk little care since he and his rich companion are tossing around a lot of money.  Bastien has fallen in love with the homey Marriann, but is nearly tongue-tied when he tries to court her.  When she is nearly killed in a deliberate hit and run accident, she is saved by Bastien, but at what cost?<br /><br />Angela Knight is the \\"new kid\\" on the block, and yet she comes in with the most original and engaging tale.  She says to the other three pros, move over, and they had better listen!  She takes vamps and mixes in Camelot lore, and conjures a, winning, imaginative tale \\"Seduction's Gift\\".  John Lance aka Lancelot is one sexy modernize hero.  He has come back to claim Grace, a Southern policeman.  Only one problem Grace does not want to be claimed.  I will not say more, because Master of the Night (October 1, 2004, Berkley) comes out next month, so this is a kick off for what promises to be one great series.  Proving once again, Knight is a writer to watch.

Caridad Pineiro penned Darkness Calls, a modern day vampire tale, that is so enjoyable!  She has a refreshing natural voice that lends well to her tale of a female agent on the track of a serial killer.  Believe it, I<br /><br />will be watching for more from this talent writer.<br /><br />FBI Agent Diana Reyes, had always been trouble with night terrors, but hidden it well from her family growing, hid it from her partner.

Knowing he might be a suspect, she tries to keep her instant attraction hidden.  But Ryder won't let her back away from it.  For too long, Ryder<br /><br />has seen her in his dreams.  He yearns to grow closer to Diana, the woman who has haunted him for years, but fears an FBI agent will not quite be so accepting of his \\"little secret\\".  He is a vampire.  However, as Diana begins to share his dreams, there may be no hiding his secret from her.  Together Ryder and Diana must stop the killer close to Ryder, and must learn to trust each other, come what may.<br /><br />Pineiro delivers up a good tale with a touch of humor, strong characters and a well developed plot guaranteed to please all readers, but especially vamp fans.	2004-09-09

The vivid extremes of colours and landscapes just boggles the mind.  Frankly, I did not think a slim book could really portray the soul inspiring beautiful so well, but Francis Thompson's Lewis &amp; Harris does just that.<br />From the white sands, to the turquoise waters, the green rolling lands, to the jagged rocks, this island is mesmerising with this constantly changing beauty.  If that is not enough you have Calanais (Callanish, the Stonehenge of the North).  Sorry, Calanais is much older, and stirs the mind and soul in a way Stonehenge never did.  When you toss in the other stone circles, Duncarloway broch, here history collides, Bronze Age, Iron age and good golfing!! lol<br />This is simply a beautiful work, loaded with dozens of brilliant colour photographs covering every aspect of life on Lewis and Harris.

The woman they both loved, steps between then to keep St. James from killing Fouquet.  Instead, she is wounded and dies.  Fouquet fights with St. James, even though he tries to convince his friend it was an accident Elizabeth stepped in front of the bullet.  Fouquet does not listen but attempts to kill St. James.  He tries to avoid his friends murderous intent, but in the end, he is forced to defend himself.  As Fouquet lies dying, he curses St. James to walk the earth for two hundred years - or until he finds a love so strong the lady is willing to die in his place, as Elizabeth did for Fouquet.<br /><br />We jump into the first one week short of that two hundred years, and St. James awakens in a woman's bedroom, well actually it's his cottage and his bedroom - or was - two hundred years ago.

Owens demonstrates she has a strong voice and is endowed with magical imagery.  I finished a similar Offworld tale by another writer, one with potential, but the lack of imagery crippled the book.  The writer failed to 'see' the world she created, failed to root in sound logic the things that happened.  She 'decided' things would happen, not because it was a natural extension of the special world and the characters.  That is NOT the case with HEARTMATE.  Owens paints a special world, grounded solidly because of her logic and imagery.<br />In her tale of the world of Celta, a settlement by Earth space explorers, it's ruled by the thirteen royal houses of the<br />Twenty-five first families that settled this new planet.  They had left Earth, because they were different, they were gifted with &quot;Flair&quot; meaning they were witches and warlocks.  They have various powers and these have developed over the centuries, amplified by Celta.<br />This tales centers on Rand Ash, now called T'Ash.  At six years old, his family was destroyed in a fire set by a rival house, planning on ending the whole house of Ash.  He escaped, after watching his two older brothers, father and mother die, as his world went up in flames.  Downwind - the slums of Celta - offered him shelter.  As a grown man, he left behind the harsh life there, and hunts down those who killed his family.  Then he rebuilt the GreatHouse of Ash.<br />His vibrant flair centers on gems, so he is a master jeweler.  He and his Fam, familiar Zanth - a large tomcat that has magical powers and can talk telepathically to T'Ash - are respected among the GreatHouses.  Only life is hollow for T'ash.  He needs his HeartMate.  People can marry on Celta as they please, but the ultimate in marriages is one with your HeartMate, a match to you in every way.<br />Using a scrying bowl and special divining dice, T'ash learns his HeartMate is a woman named Danith Mallow.  She often comes to his jewellery store and makes small purchases.  He is very pleased by what he can scry about this woman.  However, Zanth has to pass his own inspection before he concurs.  He begins turning up on Danith's doorstep to see if this woman is worthy of his FamMan.  Zanth tells T'ash Danith is special, her Flair aura is pink, unheard of in the Ruling Houses of Celta, and that she is destined to be a great animal healer.<br />T'ash immediately tries to woo her in his inept fashion, showering her and her cat Pansy, who prefers to be called Princess, with jewels and flowers.  Instead of winning his HeartMate, he frightens her.  She feels she is a nobody.  Raised in an orphanage and deemed to have no Flair, she is content, secure in her common world.  Only T'ash is relentless, and changes her whole life.  These changes are not welcomed but fought against as she fears him and his powers overwhelming her.

It should have been historical fiction, a wee fine distinct, but a significant one. Yes, there is romance, but only as a small part of the true tapestry of human emotions. It did not fair well in the US mostly because of the romance banner. So for sometime the book has gone unnoticed and was only available in used bookstores. Thus, I was delighted to see the wonderful work given a reprint treatment more deserving of his subject matter and hopefully people will discover this marvellous story of Scotland.<br />Many of you I am sure know of the Great potato famine that hit Ireland, how nearly a million died. But were you aware, the same blight that hit Ireland, moved to Scotland? Worse, this horrible loss of life sustaining crops came at one of the ugliest periods in Scottish History: the beginning of the Clearances. More and more of Scotland's Gentry were city folk, generally living in the big cities of Scotland and England, and paid a Factor to run their country estates, caring little how he ran them as long as he produced profits to sustain their rich lifestyles. Crofters were not really a money making situation for these people wanting the highest return for the least investment. Sheep were low maintenance, high cash return. People cost more and what the gave as payment for living on the land was small. So began the Clearances, literally running people off land their families had farmed and lived for centuries to make way for sheep.<br />Island Harp details this terrible slice of Scottish History through eyes of Mairi and is based on fact. Set on the Isle of Lewis during the Clearances of the 1840's, when the English landowner (the Countess of Seaforth) drove crofters from their homes to use the land for grazing or hunting. Young Mairi loves her life, simple though it is. She loves her family, her beloved grandfather Fearchar, Gran, brother Tam, and other relatives of the Clan. But one Summer, her life is shattered as the laird's factor as set fire to their homes, the start of the evictions. Fearchar runs into the burning house to rescue the harp he treasures and dies for his effort, but before dying he bads Mairi to protect the harp a symbol of their heritage.<br />A dash Captain Iain MacDonald ride in to the rescue. Scot by birth, he soldiers for the English Queen and is a son of one of the Local Gentry. Iain does what he can to help Mairi and her family and naturally she falls in love with him. She gives herself to him in the Ring of Stones (Calanais) knowing she will always loves this man. Later, as she learns she is with child, she finds out Iain is engaged to wed another - one of his class. Mairi leads her clan to the Auld Broch (an ancient circular tower) and reclaims it for her people, rallying them into farming on land considered unfarmable, weaving, fishing - anything to survive. Not only does Mairi and her child survive, they thrive along with her Clan.<br />Mairi is the embodiment of the Clan mentality, how the Scots survived and endured, their spirits unbroken through one of the worst periods in history. It is a story of personal triumph, of dreams and determination.<br />WISE Writers and Readers Book of the Month for February 2000r relatives of the Clan.

(Heart Duel is next in the series and i hope to see a long line of Heart books ahead!!) It stands alone, but one has the purest thrill reading them in order. Owens took Ancient Celt-pagan lore & projected it on her imaginary planet of Celta. Centuries ago, Earth-travellers left on 3 ships and stumbled onto a world they called Celta. People of the original families arrived with \\"Flair\\", witchcraft or magick, and over the centuries these powers have been refined, amplified. Each person is born with power, which 'specialness' their talents that set them on their course in careers, and if lucky, reveals their HeartMate. Born of 13 royal houses, people of with Flair rule Celta.<br />In HeartMate, Ruis Elder was the thief who first stole, and then returned, the HeartGift T'Ash had made for his HeartMate. Ruis Elder is arrested for this and other thefts, but he was only using the gems he stole to repair machines the original settlers brought with them from Earth. Ruis finds solace and sanity in repairing these long neglected devices. He tries to pretend he does not care; he is a Null and knows his arrest could end with his death.<br />Ruis has been hunted by his Uncle Baucus T'Elder. Ruis was the Heir to the House of Elder, but after the death of his father and mother, it is discovered he is a Null. Baucus uses this to rob Ruis of his birthright. Baucus is a villain of the first class. He tortured Ruis as a child, and has murdered to secure his rise to Captain of the FirstFamilies. And he wants Ruis dead, for only then will he rest secure in his hold on the House of Elder.<br />Ailim D' SilverFir is a Judge of Celta. She assumed the head of her house upon her mother's death. She is a Telempath, who uses her ability to read others thoughts to judge those brought before her. But she has to go before the FirstFamily Council, to beg for a loan because her house is in peril. She is so tired for it's hard to always hear the thoughts of others, to know their inner most feelings. Especially when her family is so selfish, greedy and fights her in everything.<br />While she waits to be called concerning the status on her loan request to save her House, she is surprised by the man waiting sentencing. Ruis Elder brings her peace. She recognises he is a Null, but instead of being fearful or repulsed, she finds his Nullness gives her tranquillity. With him, she does not have to expend the vast Flair energy just to protect herself from the constant intrusion of everyone's thoughts. Since his Null void stops the powers of everyone around him, she finds a haven of peace when she is with Ruis.<br />With FamKitty flying around on a mini saucer, a spaceship to make HAL jealous, characters from the first novel, and a potent, sexy forbidden romance between Ruis and Ailim, Owen scores BIG with another Winner! HeartMate was just so original, so special it was hard to envision a writer pulling off a second tour de force and make it as marvellous.

Kiss & Tell is a series of three novels for Harlequin Blaze by the sizzling, talented writing team of Lori and Tony a.k.a. Tori Carrington.  Jack, Reilly, Mallory and Layla were good friends.  Since all three women found Jake attractive, to keep the friendship from getting nasty with sharp objects, the women make a pact that Jack if off-limits to all of them.  In Night Fever (Blaze #105) we have Layla's story.  And in typical \\"Tori\\" fashion, this one burns.  What for finger-singeing!<br /><br />Dr. Layla Hollister is not looking forward to meeting her new boss Dr. Sam Lovejoy.  Lovejoy is the bodyworks man for Hollywood celebs, giving, adding what they don't have, and taking away what they have too much of!  Since Layla is a dedicated GP, she sees this sort of medicine as an insult to her profession.  Only, Dr. Lovejoy has been put in charge of Trident Medical Center where Layla works.  When she meets the sexy, blond man in a trendy dinner club, she does not expect the man with the bedroom eyes is none other than her boss.  He gathers from the short conversation they have, that she will immediately stop the flirting if she learned he was none other than the very boss she is making snide comments about.  So, he holds his silence, hoping to get to know her.<br /><br />The next morning, Layla learns that the sexy stranger is her new boss.  She does not want to have an \\"in-house romance\\", having been burned by another doctor representing himself as single when he was not.  Despite that and her anger over him being a plastic surgeon, she cannot stop the attraction she feels for the unusual man.  He has a good sense of humor, and he is oh so sexy!<br /><br />Sam's sister Heather gets on his case for loving them and leaving them, and says he should try to actually have a real relationship with a woman for a change.  Sam tries.  As he tries, he becomes aware that Layla is not.  She likes the hot times in the sheets, but she is not expecting it to last.  Frankly, since the poor lass is working 40 hours a week at her job and another 40 at a clinic for low income, one can forgive her for not having her thinking cap on!<br /><br />The characters are dead on real.

There was over three years between the releases, but when read together, you will see they flow flawlessly as one story. A sequel that is as good as the original! A rarity, indeed. With Anne Stuart's brilliance dazzling Romance readers for over twenty years, the two novels demonstrate her amazing talent from the very start. They are Stuart at her very best. It's a shame Harlequin does not release both of these tales together under one cover. They had a tiny touch of dating in a few places, but to us who were readers back then, it's more like a hint of memory lane! But frankly, you will be so wrapped up in Ferris Byrd and John Patrick Blackheart you won't notice or care about anything else. These two characters are simply amazing.<br />Ferris Byrd is a self-made woman, but she tends to find herself more casual these days because her reformed cat burglar fiance likes her that way. Only, Blackheart is making Ferris wonder about their engagement. Oh, she loves him, but she is having doubt problems - same problems she faced in the first novel - she fears the lure of excitement is just too much for Blackheart to resist. So when he starts vanishing, without saying goodbye, and is gone for weeks at a time, she suddenly fears the worst, especially since there are big burglaries in the news all over Europe that sound like Blackheart it on the prowl again.<br /><br />When the book takes up, it's exactly six months after Catspaw left off. They are engaged. Ferris is still living in her old apartment, though with new locks Blackheart installed. She is packing to move to his apartment, but on the rainy day, she is beginning to question if she has made a good choice. Her car had die and had to be towed to the garage, and worse, her house keys are in her purse. Going back to the garage is useless; they have already closed. So Ferris is left with breaking into her own apartment. After she goes their her cat burglar routine, coming from training from her husband-to-be, she is horrified and angry to find Blackheart has been sitting his in car watching her. She was not amused he enjoyed her bit of B&E. Neither were the police, when they nearly site her for tossing garbage around the area, since she used the trash cans to stand on to get to her balcony. She has to go out into the rain and pick up the mess. To say the least, that only lets her temper with Blackheart grow.<br /><br />When she comes back, and finds he offers no excuses for his absence and says only he had been to England on business, she is far from pleased. When he is making coffee, she goes through his kit, finds burglar's tools - which he said he did not have need of anymore - and a passport, showing he had been to every country where there had been a big jewel robbery. She is not a happy camper. When he refuses to explain why he lied to her, she tells him the engagement is off.<br /><br />Blackheart is furious Ferris refuses to trust him, but he is not going to involve her in the nasty things happening to him. Someone is trying to frame him for all those burglaries. Worse, now he is back in San Francisco, he discovers he is being set up to take the fall for two different robberies. Blackheart has to save his long-lost little sister from the clutches of jail, foil the robbers intent of making him their fall guy, and convince Ferris what she really doesn't trust is not him, but herself.<br /><br />Ferris ex-fiance and his mother, characters in the first tale, are back. There is also a secondary romance between Blackheart sister, Dany, and the policemen doggedly determined to see Blackheart in jail.<br /><br />All in all, it's Stuart Magic! Craft, imagination, insight, sexy characters that steal your heart, all stirred into one potent brew. It just does not get any better than Ferris and Blackheart.she goes their her cat burglar routine, coming from training from her husband-to-be, she is horrified and angry to find Blackheart has been sitting his in car watching her.

You go back and revisit some of their earlier works and you see flaws, but you smile at the talent so shiny and new.  I don't think Anne Stuart, resident genius of romance, ever went through that period.  She seems to have stepped into Romance writing with a clear purpose, and had never deviated from the brilliance.  This is very clear when you go back and reread her early work for Harlequin Intrigue or Harlequin American Romance, from 15-years or more.  Most works that old, already show dating badly, yet Stuart's works not only hold up remarkably well, they simply shine with her clear purpose.  Stuart loves writing romance, that sizzle and pop chemistry created by the special woman and man meeting.  Few writers really have the grasp of male characters the way she does.  And more importantly, few can really give you the baddest of bad boy - the Gamma rogues that make Alpha males step aside when they see them coming, the hero totally outside of laws, and yet makes them utterly compelling.  She takes unrepentant killers, madmen, assassins, gunslingers, a court jester, a cult leader, even a cop unable to be a manhunter anymore and a lawyer willing to break the laws to keep his lady safe, and she makes these men outside the norm so breathtakingly mesmerizing all the readers can do it sit back wonder at her magic and enjoy!<br /><br />Catspaw - Harlequin Intrigue #9 published in 1985 - is one of these dusty gems sitting on my Keeper Shelf.  And it's there for a reason.  It's also included in Thieves, Spies And Other Lovers (By Request) Anthology.  Quite a shame this, along with it's sequel Catspaw 2 Harlequin Intrigue #103 are not reprinted in the same volume.  My old HIs are showing yellow pages, so I would appreciate new copies, and fans of Stuart who missed these would scoop them up.  Because it's Stuart at her very best.<br /><br />Ferris Byrd is a self-made woman.  Ferris is really Francesca Berdahofski, from a large family outside of Chicago.  Her mother was Italian, her father polish, and while there  was a lot of love with her nine brothers and sisters, she saw woman having babies too young and having a lifetime of regrets.  She did not want to live with the same regrets.  So Francesca, now the cool Ferris, is semi-engage to a lawyer running for the Senate.  She is the well turned out, perfectly coifed woman of snobby elegance, even though underneath lurks the jeans wearer, binge-cleaning mild slob that enjoy old movies and ice cream.  She should have known when she named her grey tomcat, Blackie that it was an omen.  She named him after one John Patrick Blackheart, one of the most eligible bachelors in San Francisco.  Blackheart - the name fitting the man in her mind - is a reformed cat burglar.  Now, he runs a security firm that takes on special cases to provide complete security.  Ferris is charged with the display of priceless emerald and a charity ball, and she has been instructed to hire Blackheart to see the emeralds are returned to their owner at the end of the night in mint condition.<br /><br />Ferris is immediately ruffled by Blackheart, who immediately decides Ferris is a finely create veneer he is interesting in cracking.  He finds Francesca must more attractive and sets out to provoke her at every turn.  Just as she admits she is<br />falling in love with him, the emeralds are stolen and evidence points to Blackheart being unable to resist his old trade.<br /><br />Ferris/Francesca is a delightful creation.  You could easily have disliked her stuffy persona, but not when you get to see Francesca underneath.  Blackheart, is pure Stuart Bad Boy, so sexy it will knock your socks off.  Their falling in love is just so utterly heart stealing.  Seriously, this is Stuart flying high, her talent dazzling, her prose evocative.  If you are a Stuart Fan and have missed this diamond, then don't hesitate to lurk around until you find a copy.  If you have never read this talented writer, then you cannot have a better introduction.  Stuart proves it takes a thief to steal your heart!

Few authors have written as many books, and yet, maintain the same quality, while never repeating a storyline. Each book is so original, so special. I have been going through some of my Keepers, doing reviews for them. Stuart delights in giving us a hero we ordinarily would not like to see as a hero - a defrocked monk, a madman, a killer, an assassin, the King's fool, a cult leader, a cat burglar. If you made up a list of the top 10 men you could never like for a hero, she has done every one, and invented a couple dozen others, just to prove she CAN make you fall for this anti-hero hero when your knee-jerk reaction is no way. This time she does the hardest hat trick - a lawyer!<br />Alexander &quot;Sandy&quot; Caldicott was a brilliant, highly paid lawyer. Only, it was boring him. He was tired of getting less than innocent people off. Tired of seeing the underdog lose. Facing a tropical vacation, the notion equally bored him. So when Jane Dexter came into his life, he was delighted. He was no longer bored. It did not matter Jane believed him to be Jimmy the Weasel, an arsonist. Jimmy was his last client, he just gotten off. As they were coming out of the courthouse, the press snapped their pictures, and credited their names in the wrong order under the picture. So Jane now thinks Sandy is Jimmy. And she wants him to torch her uncle's, Stephens business.<br />Her brother, Richard, was a brilliant scientist and he discovered a formula for coating metals with titanium. It could already be done, but Richard created a very cheap process for it. Just before he was to announce it, Richard died in a car accident, and suddenly her uncle is trying to sell the process to the highest bidder. And Jane is determined to stop him. Sandy decides the best way to protect Jane is go along with her and be her partner in crime. They break into her uncle's business using Richard's key, but discover someone has gone to great lengths to erase that Richard ever worked there. The next day Sandy and Jane hire on as temps, and discover Stephan is trying to sell the formula, but cannot. Richard hid a key step in the process and now Stephan is desperate to find it, willing to kill Jane to get the formula.<br />It's all great fun, with some wonderful Stuart throwaway lines. But there is one point in the plot that had my teeth grinding. Stephan as tried to kill Jane and Sandy by cutting the breaks on the car. Jane is still nervous, but sneaks out to go jogging by herself in the predawn hours - even knowing there is a professional hitman lurking about. Sorry, that trite &quot;Oh, I have to get out and have air by myself and put myself in danger&quot; is very shoddy. It's a cop out just to put the heroine in danger, and the first time I have seen Stuart sink to this old ploy. The rest of the book is five star Stuart writing. But this &quot;mind charlie-horse&quot;, just makes you groan.<br />Sandy is funny, Jane endearing. The remainer it well drawn and with such great wit, showing Stuart's lighter side. All in all, a satisfying read.ut discover someone has gone to great lengths to erase that Richard ever worked there.

Angela Knight has to be one of the brightest stars hitting the Romance market today.  Her Jane's Warlord was in the top 100 sales for Amazon and Barnes &amp; Nobles, and top 10 in Romance sales.  A pretty nifty hat trick for a writer's first time novel.  She has been collecting a devoted following for her Red Sage Secret's novellas (Secrets #2 \\"Roarke's Prisoner; Secrets #3 \\"Blood and Kisses\\"; Secrets #6 \\"A Candidate for a Kiss\\"; Secrets #7 \\"Kissing the Hunter\\").

For those with a more daring soul, Knight is what the doctor ordered.  She is a savvy writer that can weave a tale that keeps her reader hooked the whole way.  Small wonder this full novel is the first Red Sage non-anthology.  Knight came up through Red Sage; they gave her the break, now it's her turn to shine.  Since several of her Red Sage Novella's were vampire themes, it's not surprising she leads us into the vampire realm once again.<br />Edward Ridgemont, a sadistic vampire who loves the hunt and the kill, turned Cade McKinnon.  For years, Cade has served as a shadowy protector for Valerie Chase.  Vampires killed her family and would have killed her, too, but &quot;The Cowboy&quot; came to her rescue.<br />At seventeen, she begins to experience flashback nightmares.  Anytime her dreams were too troubled &quot;The Cowboy&quot; was there to reassure her.  Now, twenty-nine, a full-grown woman, &quot;The Cowboy&quot; still haunts her adult dreams, but as a seductive lover, giving her nights of erotic pleasure.  Only, Cade is forced to move to protect her.  Edward Ridgemont has decided to take Valerie for his own.  and has hired her to ghost his biography, as a means to lure her to him.  Cade tries to warn Valerie through her dreams.  When that does not work, he tries to call her sister, but since Valerie believes Cade only exists in her nightmares and fantasy, she will not believe it.  In order to save her, Cade abducts her.  At first, Valerie is not too alarmed by this, until she learns Cade is a vampire, too.  Now Valerie is caught between her passion for Cade, the real man, and her revulsion for vampires.  She must learn to trust Cade and make the ultimate choice to save both their lives.<br />I especially enjoy Knights' \\"remaking\\" of the vampire.  I have always had problems with the evil killers who slurp blood nightly, always found it strange a woman would love a man who went out and \\"necked\\" with other women constantly!  But Knight wisely addresses these and makes the vamp a much more enjoyable character.<br />This book bites - sorry for the pun - but it's right on target.

I have long seen this in her writing from the first book I read of her, and this skill has lonely grown with each book.  A good writer makes me \\"see\\" their story, not just read it, and few have such power to paint pictures as Jackson.  She has done Historicals and paranormals, but she has really hit her stride with her Goblin series (Traveler, Outsiders, The Courier).  They are original, fresh and I cannot wait to see what the Goblins destroy next!  There tales are lush with ancient Celtic lore and myths, and Still Life - the fourth in the series - is another winner.  I am hoping to see her Goblins one day destroy the Kentucky Derby or play havoc with the Highland Games.  Surely, they are going to attack Venice...row, row, row your boats Goblin style!<br />In the fourth tale, Nyssal Laszlo, suffers from amnesia, yet in her dreams, snippets of the forgotten past are coming to her.  In these dreams, she discovers she had the power to project her mind.  While researching ancient myths and lore, she discovers an ancient relic.  Medieval monks presumed it was the skeleton of an angel, but Nyssal recognizes it for what it really it - the skeleton of one of them pesky smelly goblins.  This triggers vivid dreams in Nyssal.  She has an important role in the never-ending battle between man and goblin, but is unaware of this.  With each projection of her mind, she grows more concerned she carries important information locked within her.  She repetitively walks in her dreams into a portrait, a still life, rich in color and detail.  And each time she returns to the still life, she discovers dark things, learns who she really is - whether she wants to or not.<br />The Unseelie Court - bad faeries - had a long ago pack with the Goblins, and they fear Nyssal's dream projections.  Abrial, is a dreamwalker and he is sent by Jack Frost to pursue Nyssal in her dream state.  As Abrial follows her in this dream realm, he comes to love her, but in his heart, he fears their love is doomed.  Inside Nyssal is a dark secret making her a target.  Even her father would rather see Nyssal dead than reveal what is hidden deep with in her.<br />Abrial is a strong hero, the dark tormented Alpha male.  The executioner for the Seelie Court, Abrial has so long lived without emotions, blocking them in ordered to live with the guilt of those deaths he caused.  Nyssal's mind projection is able to break down his barriers, reach him.<br />Jackson once again takes myths, legends and lore and skillfully weaves them into the struggle to save mankind from the Goblin menace.

Few writers are at home in both medieval sagas or dark, deadly erotic suspense as this writer is. But it has been a few years since we were treated to a Historical Romance from Stuart. Hope it won't be so long until another one comes along! Hidden Honor is simply wonderful.<br />Elizabeth of Bredon has grown up in a house full of men. Her father is an arrogant lout, given to using his ham size fists. Her mother died in childbirth, and since Elizabeth has been little more than a glorified servant to the fifty or so males in<br />her fathers castle. Never time for the things she wishes to learn, she spends her time hiding her intelligence from her less than fatherly father. So she views entering the convent of St. Anne as a suitable choice for her life. No more violent, brutish men, no more endless work for little appreciation. She tells herself she is blest being overly tall and with bright red hair, for no man has ever offered for her. Thus, she will not die in birthing endless children as her mother did.<br />However, her peaceful future is suddenly thrown in turmoil. She is to travel to St. Anne's in the company of knights escorting Prince William to do penance. The illegitimate son of King John, the Princeling is a worthless debauched excuse of<br />a man - inheriting all the King's bad traits. He killed a daughter of a Baron, and has been forced to do penance to atone.<br />Only, when Elizabeth meets Prince William, she's totally puzzled. He is nothing like she expected. For one, he is tall, but not as tall as most of the Plantagenets. He is dark, where they are known for their golden beauty. William is a strong man, a lean, calloused-hands warrior, yet there is a gentleness in him that disarms her. All rather at odds with the soft man who spends his time in drink and debauching maidens. She also notices the Prince is going prematurely bald. Or is he? Elizabeth knows she should hate the Prince, but finds she cannot resist his seriousness, the troubled look in the dark eyes, eyes that seem to look into her soul. He is so kind to her, on their journey, again, contrary to the tales of William being utterly cruel. Very sharp, Elizabeth becomes convinced this man may not be all he says he is.<br />Elizabeth discovers there is more than one man in the party wearing masks as their two-day journey takes a treacherous turn.

She just does Brit droll humor to a T. I was even more shocked when later I learned that Grimes was actually dropped by Knopf Publishing, saying she was not making her advance back on the Jury series. Well, she has gone on to make them eat those words as every one is now a bestseller. I absolutely love to read, but in this instance, I actually prefer to enjoy the audio tapes simply because they are done by the great Tim Curry. As Grimes does Brit humor to perfection, Tim brings Richard Plant, Melrose Plant and his indomitable Aunt Agatha so perfectly. Curry slips into one character after another with such panache - right down to children. The combination of Grimes and Curry is just not to be missed.<br />In the Anodyne Necklace, a violin, an ancent emerald necklace and a severed finger are clue to solving the ghastly murder in the wood of Littlebourne. The town is filled with dotty birdwatchers, a pretentious Peer, and more suspects than Jury can handle. Naturally, the ever-so-helpful, Melrose Plant, a Peer who has shun his titles, tags along to aid his friend - actually, to escape his Aunt Agatha who refuses to let Melrose give up his titles. The key unriddling the Littlebourne mystery is hidden in coded treasure map.<br />It's great full all they way, and an absolutely must for Curry fans!

The family is rich and eccentric, but four murders in one family is just a wee bit beyond the pale. The Holdsworth family is loaded with delightful, charming, if oddball characters, such as Alex, who is quite adapt at cheating at poker. Curry shines when doing 11-year-old Millie Thale (Melrose always has a soft spot for dotty children). Millie has a bond with Alex, since her mother died unexpected five years before.<br />Grimes once again brings such quirky characters to life with her witty prose and Curry takes those words and makes magic!

More than just the fact, it's the lore - the oral lore that is woven through it.  To me history always surrounded me, the curiosity of what a place was, what had happened there, who had owned it was like a big mystery waiting to be unraveled.  It surprised me so many people dislike history, or see it as a dry list of dates and events.  Britain was loaded with castles, duns, brochs, and stone rings.  Layers of the people who inhabited the lands, not just The Picts, Scots, Gaels, Brits, Angles, but the Roman invaders.  I found the South of the US was loaded with intriguing history.  So many homes were touched by the War Between the States.  Beautiful antebellum giants that survived the era, all carrying colorful tales.  That is why I really enjoyed this book by Cheri Revai.  Obviously, Revai loves history around her and sees it as a living thing reaching out to those curious enough to want to know the secrets.<br /><br />She has an easy writing style and does a good job of portraying events, researching this history and the lore of places believed to be haunted.  Every time I pass some structure I always wanted to know what happened there.  If someone says a place is haunted, it drives me to want the facts behind the tales.  Revai does this.  She gives you the roots of the tale, but then very thoroughly checks with the various owners to see the experiences - or not - of the different owners.  She also tells<br /><br />you when a site is \\"by invitation only\\" so you know beforehand if you can actually visit the place.<br /><br />The book is a fascinating, spine-tingling collection of about 30 tales covering northern New York - Jefferson County, St. Lawrence County, Franklin County and Clinton County.  So those of you planning a leisurely tour of the area to see the fall colors might wish to have this little guide to give your trip even more excitement.  For writers, there is a wealth of tales to spur your imagination, so I highly recommend this wonderful book.<br /><br />P.S.

Many top writers of today such as Linda Howard, Nora Robert and Jayne Anne Krentz started in series romance years ago, and we have watched them grow into the talent they are now.  However, you notice with Anne Stuart she was always great - right from the very start.  Go back to her earliest works of Gothic and Regency Romances, and you'll see the same magic voice weaving solid tales in the same brilliance.  Lord Satan's Bride is a prime example of this talented writer's works.  Written in 1981 for Candlelight Regency Special (Dell) it originally sold for $1.50, and now you find it for nearly $10.00 used.  Frankly, it's worth every penny!<br /><br />Sylvie Wetherall is off for a season in London.  Not that she's thrilled with the idea of the Ton, but at nineteen she's decided it's time she finds a nice comfortable husband, settle down and give her Father the Vicar grandchildren.  She goes to London to live with her Aunt Tibelda and her cousin Amanda.  Her Aunt Tibelda, in her 70s, is a Duchess.  But once that Duchess was an actress.  While she's more sedate these days, she still dresses like an ingenue, and in very vivid colors.  She hopes having her two niece will liven up her life, but she gets a bit more than she wished.<br /><br />On the trip to London, Sophie stopped at certain graveyards along the route to report to her father upon the age and historical details of each.  However, a late night trip to one catches her up in a bizarre situation.  She hears chanting and sees men dressed as Monks, then a woman screaming.  As she rushes to see if she can help, she's caught by a tall man, who tells her to flee the place, and forget what she saw.  He says the men are called the Heavenly Host and he s he is Satan.<br /><br />Days later when someone begins to warn Sylvie to stay away from Nicholas Wyndham and that he is called Satan, Sylvie but cannot help but wonder if Wyndham is the same man she met in the graveyard.  Odd things begin to happen to Sylvie.  One the way to a ball, a highwayman stops her carriage.  In the nick of time, (no pun intended!)  Nicholas Wyndham arrives to save her life.  Later, he dances with her at the ball shocking the whole ton.<br /><br />Sylvie is in a dither.  She knows Nicholas is the man calling himself Satan, knows he has a reputation that would rival Satan himself.  But she sees a deep sadness within the handsome man.  He keeps warning Sylvie to stay away from him, but then he repeatedly turns up in her life.<br /><br />If her falling in love with the dangerous man is not distracting enough, she learns her cousin Amanda is in love with Aunt Tibelda's handsome Irish coachman.  Sylvie is determined to play cupid.  The secondary romance between Amanda and Tynan is just as enchanting as the growing love between Sylvie and Nicholas.<br /><br />It's a super Regency with a strong Gothic touch, and done with Stuart's typical Bad Boy you cannot resist.  What more can you want from such a classic story?  It's a shame someone is not reprinting these older Stuarts.  They are well worth it.n she met in the graveyard.

It came out during the period when Gothics ruled the woman's book market, before Historical Romance came along and took command.  And it's one of the best Gothics ever written.  Since Gothics are making a wee bit of a comeback, it's a shame this book is not reprinted!<br />Lorna MacDougall, a big redheaded lass, must enter service because her father fell and breaking his back.  With 9 brothers and sisters, she has to secure the post on Cameron's Landing - a small island.  In the 1880s women had few choices how they could earn a living, so she knows even though the island is foreboding, she must impress Lady Margaret, the matriarch of the Landing.  She at first is accepted as Lady Margaret's companion, but slowly finds herself being the woman's &quot;ears and eyes&quot; in solving the mystery of Cameron's Landing.  Margaret believes someone - someone in her family - is a murderer.  Her husband was recently stabbed to death and the killer never revealed.  Josiah Cameron's enemies were legion, so anyone about Lorna might be the killer.  It a classic Gothic with the dark mysterious hero tossed in.<br />The writing is pure Stuart, though done in the traditional first person Gothic voice.  Since nearly all Stuart's books are third person (which I prefer permitting a wider range of emotions and actions from the hero and secondary characters) Stuart handles this with panache.  It's very interesting to her fans to see her so effortlessly moving through this different voice.<br />Well, worth it to any Stuart fan or fan of Gothics or if you are looking for a super read that is a wee bit different from today's market.	2004-07-24

But this book is THREE VERY STRONG WRITERS with excellent novella.  Julie Elizabeth Leto, Julie Kenner and Susan Kearney.  All three stories are interlinked with the presences of an antique perfume bottle.

Luke is curse, half-man, half-panther and he is now stalking the sexy cop.  It is one SUPER read.<br /><br />The Second tale is from Susan Kearney ?Touch Me?.  John Cameron was a man in secret ops.  He was captured and put through extreme torture.  During the torture, his mind buried so deeply the information he would later need to stop a terrorist attack.  Dr. Bonnie Anders is the head shrink put in charge with opening John?s locked mind with any tools she can.  Armed with the antique perfume bottle, she is will to do what is necessary to make John whole again.  But first, she has to get him to touch her.  She is a empathy, who works by touch.

The book is so fast-paced, due to the Desire low word count.  This makes it hard to develop any sort of \\"real\\" story or character development.  It hardly takes an hour to read this.  You don't get a chance to really get to know the characters or why they act or react as they do.  You're just told they do, accept it, and move on - quickly!<br />Randi McCaffery's tale (fourth in the series following stories with her three older brothers) picks up with someone still trying to kill her.  Presumably, someone wants her dead because she bore a child out of wedlock, even though she refuses to name the daddy.  There have been two attempts on her life, nearly killing her and causing to give birth to her baby prematurely.  Now, she is determined to leave the family ranch for fear of putting her brothers in danger.  Frankly, this pigheaded determination to \\"do it on her own\\" is contrived.  When a person has someone trying to kill her, she does not run away from the very people that can help you.  But that is what Randi does.  She claims she is trying to lure the killer away from her brothers, but it's hard to accept as logical.  She is also fleeing away from Kurt Striker.

Finally, she is driven to flee the city with Striker in hopes of hiding from the killer.<br />Of course, their romance picks up once again.  Randi spends the whole book running!<br />The killer is transparent.  Sorry, with these tiny books there is just no time to develop secondary characters or make their motivations believable.

And this early novel shows just what a talent she was from the start.  It's a wickedly funny read (PSSSSSSSST!!!!!!  I have heard it will be rewritten and release in the near future!  So you might want to snatch a copy if you can just to compare her growth as a writer.)<br />At the turn of the century, when the women's demands for rights and the vote was just gathering steam, you meet Cassandra Whitney, beautiful, intelligent and with a mind of her own, to be sure.  She is a sign-carrying rebel who is determined to carry the day.  When she meets up with Helena St. Johns, she sees in her a friend and prot&eacute;g&eacute;.  However, Cassandra soon finds out Helena's handsome and arrogant brother, Griffin, does not care for his sister being a militant woman's righter.  Despite their being at loggerheads on this issue, attraction sizzles.<br />Katie, um...Marte brings alive this period with amazing detail, giving you the Ton, the tight strictures on the women, customs, fashions and the fermenting political crisis on the horizon.  The intrigue that eventually pulls Griffin and Cassandra together, finding the two stubborn people at odds and in love, is just so brilliantly done!<br />It's not a period often addressed in Historical Romance, so I am very eagerly awaiting the brushed up presentation of the new and improved version!	2004-07-20

Every year on her birthday she receives a package, post marked from various places around the world.  So, when word comes from her uncle that Emmett is back in Hawaii at the family home, even her fear of flying will not stop her from being reunited with the brother she hadn't seen for fifteen years.<br />Only Emmett is not quite how she remembers him.  She feared Emmett might be given to gaining weight, but this man is hard, lean.  He carries scars from varies fights, attesting to his being in foreign places where life is cheap.  Emmett is not happy when Rachel shows up on his doorstep.  Neither is her uncle.

Katie Macalister is one of the most delightful (and prolific) writers in Romance today.  She is not Shakespeare, but then I, for one, thank goodness for that!  We already have old Will.  When I want the Scottish Play, I blow the dust of my very ancient copies and read it.  When I want sheer fun, I look to Lynsay Sands and Katie Macalister.  I love British humour (works out nice since I am Scot!), but that dry wit is often missing in the works of a lot of American writers.  I am not talking about highbrow humour, but that you-can't-help-but-howl-aloud Benny Hill wacko laughs!  The kind that has your erupting with buffos, has people looking at you as if you have gone around the bend one too many times, the kind that has your husband exiling you from the living room while he is trying to watch CASI because you are making too much noise.  Many writers can provoke a giggle.  Few make me laugh so hard I hurt.  There is nothing more special a writer can do for you.  They leave you feeling good all over.<br />And Trouble With Harry is a sheer delight from page one!  One of my favourite Hitchcock movies carries this name.  It was deadpan humour that was just so on target, so it's not surprising to find this book is the same.  It's a delightful Regency - and from the opening scene where beleaguered Harry is trying to explain the facts of \\"womanhood\\" to his eldest daughter - you are already laughing out loud!<br />The Trouble with Harry, 45-years-old- is a father, coming to parenthood late in life.

Beautiful, blonde Amazon woman of overachievers  - except for Sybil. One older sister is a lawyer, another a professor and her youngest is a diplomat. Nearly what you would call short, with caramel coloured hair, Saralee never felt she fit in with her \\"super\\" family. So she changed her name to Sybil, moved to Vermont, collected a small pack of dogs, and became the secretary to SOWW - Society of Water Witches. Life is good, not exciting, but content. She does not have to deal with her perfect family, does not have to deal with her ex-husband - who was perfect and only amplified her feels of inferiority.  <br /> <br />So when Nicholas Fitzsimmons a - divinely perfect - professor who goes around debunking new age witchcraft fads, comes to the small snowy Vermont town, Sybil is not happy. Worse, when it quickly comes to light that Nicholas and Sybil are old souls from a past life things, which make things very sticky for Sybil. Nicholas is darkly beautiful, very tall, smart, and accomplished. Just like Sybil's family. Once more, she feels those few extra pounds and sense she is a \\"brown elf\\" rises. But try as she might, she cannot run from Nicholas, or chase him away with her rudeness. <br /> <br />Add in a subplot of someone swindling little old ladies of the town out of their life savings, you have a wonderful time. Stuart's tale is full of gentle humour, sizzling sparks between Nick and Sybil. Not typical Stuart, but typically crafted with her solid talent. A wintry tale to warm the heart.	2004-07-18

It's a witty dance on the high wire, with spirited Lizzie Traherne leading Michael and everyone else on a wild chase.<br />Sumner, her brother, informs Elizabeth that they are retiring to the country for the long weekend for a houseparty at Adolphus Wingert.  Lizzie is not amused.  She is especially peeved when Sumner encourages her to permit Adolphus to court her.  There are many reasons why she wants nothing to do with Adolphus.  He favors pink.  He dresses in pink, he is fat like a pink pig and he has fat pink lips, which he smacks every time he is trying to cop a feel off Lizzie.  Sumner is the local vicar, and Adolphus is his patron, so Sumner sees a match between his sister and his patron as good for his position.  While Lizzie admits she is out of the schoolroom at 23-year-old, she's hardly ready to stick a spoon in the wall, nor is she about to accept a suit from Adolphus.  Another reason against the match is Adolphus' battle-ax of a mother hates Lizzie and will go to various extremes to keep her darling baby boy (40-years-old baby boy) away from the &quot;unsuitable&quot; Lizzie.<br />Elizabeth finds, however, the weekend is far from the dull houseparty she anticipated.  Oh, Adolphus is true to form in his pink get up, so is mummy dearest.  There the various house guests keep things lively.  There is Brenna, a beautiful young lady wanting to snare Sumner, but she has competition from the Contessa, a luscious young widow, who is up to something.  One needs a dance card to keep score of whose bedroom she is going in or coming out of next!  <br />Michael Fraser intrigues Lizzie.  He is handsome, but with an air of mystery around him, with rumors swirling about he is a spy for the French.  Since Lizzie's older brother is doing undercover work for the English in France, she sees the possibility of Fraser's activities as a peril to her brother, so sets about to foil Fraser.  She accidentally learns there is a list of English spies in France hidden somewhere in Adolphus' home, she knows she must be the one to find it.  Her brother's name will appear on that list and it would mean is arrest and execution.  However, she starts hoping Michael is not a French spy, and thinks maybe her intervention will prevent his arrest by the English.<br />As Lizzie slips around in the middle of the night to find the list, believing everyone to be asleep, she discovers the hallways to the bedrooms resembles the opening of A Shot In The Dark!  There is Brenna spying on Sumner.  Sumner slipping into the Contessa's room.  But the Contessa just came from Sir Maurice's room and disappeared into Michael's.  As Lizzie dashes to hide, the game of musical rooms continues leaving her exhausted and dizzy!<br />It a brilliantly funny, lighter Stuart, that will leave you smiling!	2004-07-17

Often, I've seen books and movies criticised as portraying Ireland as we think it is not as it really is.  This is a gentle, loving look at the apartments in Dublin and the ebb and flow of people during a kinder, gentler time.  Dubliners have their own Dublinesque patter, Dublin roots in the sons and daughters, and supposedly they never lose their accent not matter where they have been transplanted.  The<br />Irish have ways that centre heavily upon the family, neighbours, traditions and beliefs that are ages old.<br />Leo Byrne was born in Dublin in 1937, at Hollis Street Hospital, just a short walk from \\"the Flats\\" - the Perse House Flats.  In 1959, he moved across the Pond to New York, eventually finding his way to California.  He served in the American army.  After retirement, he spent time at women's shelters, dressing as a leprechaun, to bring cheer and a wee taste of Eire to the Yanks.  Even though he was transplanted, his heart fondly recalls his days in the Flats and it's reflected in his writing.  His joy of life, his love for his native land comes through in each tale of this collection.<br />It's a perfect gift for that transplanted child of Eire or that person who feel Ireland calls to their soul.  His thoughts cover holidays, personal hygiene, swimming in the Liffey, courting, trash handling and even a ghostly tale.  An absolute must for anyone interested in Ireland.	2004-07-16

The Guardians each have special talents, and were sworn to protect the Mundanes.  Years ago, Gywnne's father, a powerful Guardian too a Mundane to wife.  This was not forbidden, but was discouraged because a Guardian man needed an equally strong woman to balance and enhance his powers.  As Gwynne grew up in her father's home, she inherited his love for history and lore.  When her father died, she was seventeen.  Alone in the world, she passively accepts marriage to a man over 50 years older than she.  Over fifteen years pass, with Gwynne still working in the library of her childhood home, keeping companionship with her late husband's sister.  She's content to pass through life like some hothouse flower.<br /><br />When Duncan McCrae, the Lord of the Storms, sees Gwynne he knows she is his destiny.  Gwynne is a pain to Duncan (and the readers) by her willingness to avoid life.  When Duncan makes it clear to her he wants her for his wife, she is shocked and rebuffs him.  Gwynne believes she does not have any power and hesitates to welcome a union with such a powerful Guardian.<br /><br />Duncan accepts Gwynne's mandate to leave her alone and is preparing to depart for his home in Scotland.  Gwynne is been summoned by the Guardian Council and told she must marry Duncan.  Gwynne hesitates, but finally accepts as a member of the Guardian society she must married Duncan.  She is warned that war between Scotland and England is looming, and that Duncan will need her.  He is a Scot, but his loyalties lay with Hanoverian rules in England.  This will make his power as a Guardian very pivotal for both countries.<br /><br />Duncan and Gwynne marry within days and start their journey toward Scotland, just as Bonnie Prince Charlie has landed in Scotland to raise the Clans.  Gwynne and Duncan soon discover she is an Enchantress mage, a woman who can control men through her sexual aura.  She did not know this, because Enchantresses only unlock their power after they have slept with a man they truly love.<br /><br />Within short order, Duncan and Gwynne are tossed into the Jacobite rebellion and Gwynne soon sees her husband is using his power to help the Scottish cause, and only she can stop him.<br /><br />While the premise holds so much promise, this novel is missing the usual Putney \\"Fallen Angel\\" fire.  The two leads just don't capture the emotions or the heart in true Putney Style.  Thunder of Roses and all the Fallen Angels are just so much more than this book.  Since it dealt with Scotland, and the lore angle, I REALLY wanted to love this book.  It an enjoyable read, just pale,  The whole plot had so much potential she totally left untapped.

Is there no genre Anne Stuart cannot write?  I have been finding some hidden gems on Amazon.com's used books.  I thought I had everything Stuart had written, but I've been lucky to find a few that I missed.  Stuart writes Contemporary Romance, Erotic Thrillers, Historicals, Comedies and this precious jewel a simply regency.  But oh, it's anything but simple!  It's masterpiece, but time and again, I feel compelled to heap that sort of praise on Stuart's wonderful body of works.  This book was written over 20 years ago, showing precisely what a talent this writer is.  Each story is so perfectly crafted you'd quickly try to say - this is her best work.  She is just such a consistent writer that I am sure at Romantic Times conventions other writers likely stick \\"kick me\\" signs on her back!<br />I am not much of a Regency fan.  They are smaller, and I enjoy the full, fleshed out story.  But Stuart can do more in small books that most writers do in 400 pages!  And The Spinster and the Rake is just that sort of magical book.  The title be damned, it's a heartwarming tale, and it just kept me from three hours of sleep!  I could not stop reading.<br />Gillian Redfern is facing her thirtieth birthday.  She's firmly on the shelf, though society refuses to grant a woman the right to control her own destiny.  Gillian is not some poor relations.  She is fabulously wealthy, but still her life is controlled by her family, because unmarried women just do not go about alone.  Her two sisters and brother shuttle her back and forth, more of a glorified servant that a true family member.<br />Obviously, unless you have an understanding of history, you cannot comprehend why a woman with money just could not do as she pleased.  Sorry, read a little history before to at too quick to condemn.  Women could not and that was how it was!<br />She is being sent to her brother's home in London, when her carriage breaks an axel, rolls over, and traps Gillian inside.  She is quickly rescued by Ronan Patrick Blakely.  Blakely is English, but has lived abroad these past twenty years, due to a scandal.  Actually, in his mad youth, Ronan had tried to get a young woman named Letty to run away with him.  Letty, however, was married at the time to none other than Gillian's brother Derwent!  Letty is now a pleasing plump matron who won't bestir herself to care for her children.  Why should she when she had Gillian to do it.  Only, Gillian is facing her birthday with just a bit of resentment - and exhaustion.<br />This makes her a ripe target for the practiced charms of a rogue - and there is no doubt, Ronan is a dark and dangerous rogue determined to flaunt the rules of the society that shunned him twenty years ago, but now sees him as one of the most eligible bachelors.  Ronan is bored to tears by the debutants of the Ton, so Gillian, ten years his younger, more than draws his eye.  She is intelligent, lively and with the added plus of being of being to tweak Derwent's as Ronan dared pay address to Derwent's sister.<br />Being a little foxed, and pushed by a friend, he makes a bet he can compromise Gillian before the end of the Season.  Aid - or hindered - in this is Gillian's niece Felicity.  Felicity has been deep in love with Liam Blackwood, but the son of an Earl had given himself to the works of God, thus deeming him beneath Derwent and Letty's precious daughter!  Only the daughter is more like her Aunt Gillian and is determined to get her man, even if she has to pretend interest in Ronan to do it.<br />However, just as Gillian admits she's in love with Ronan, she learns of the bet.  And too late, Ronan comprehends he has been caught in his own trap.  It's another brilliantly served up dish of Stuart Surprise.  If you are a fan, you will NOT want to miss this one.  It's Stuart at her very best - but when isn't she?<br />This is a Keeper you will read more than once!	2004-07-11

Sophie Haversham is lady of quality, even though she lives in genteel poverty with her aunt Violet.  Since her uncle's death, Aunt Violet has turned her Mayfair home into a boarding house.  Sophie helps with the borders, spends her time in the gardens and in the observatory growing orchids.  She is happy with her life, though it is not the life her mother hoped for.  Only, Sophie is plagued with visions.

When she awakens from one of her dreams, where she saw a man dead and bleeding in the park, she knows she just cannot ignore it, so she goes to Scotland Yard with hopes of preventing it.<br />It's Mick Dunbar's birthday.  One of the best roving inspectors of the Yard, he is not facing his birthday with much joy.  First, looking in to the mirror he decides to shave his mustache, hoping to hide he is not getting old - after all, thirty-six is NOT old, or so he kept telling himself and everyone at the yard.  He arrived to find his office and been moved, while it's being painted, leaving him in the middle of the traffic of the yard.  So, he hears the pretty but slightly disheveled young woman trying to report a murder.<br />When Sophia spies Mick sitting there, she knows he's the man she sees dead in her vision.  She describes the park that it is at night, below the statue of Robbie Burns.  But she cannot convince Mick the threat is real; he believes it's another birthday joke being played upon him.

Being alerted, he catches shadows moving in time to fall to the ground to keep from being shot.<br />Now Mick is convinced Sophia is a nut shooting at him, or she knew someone was going to shoot at him and is trying to protect this person, so Mick is coming after her.  He investigates Sophia and those connected to her, and eventually takes a room in Violets Mayfair home.  Nothing Sophia tells him changes his mind, so he sets about to find out what she is hiding.<br />Sophie is telling the truth about her vision, but there are other secrets she is hiding.

Back twenty-years ago when Jayne Ann Kentz - Jayne Castle in this instance - wrote with a fresh, originality that is often lacking in many of her works the past five years.  It's typical JAK formula, the feisty, know-it-all woman wanting to control the situation, the immoveable man - the old Mars vs. Venus-on-roller-skates routine that JAK did to perfection.  So, if you are forgetting why JAK has always been one of your favs, take a trip down memory lane, back when Sonny drove the black Ferrari, and enjoy the smiles.<br />Samantha Gabriel needed a business partner, actually she needed that and more.  What she truly wanted was an avenging angel and Gabriel Sinclair fitted that bill completely.  He had the money to back her financial scheme and what better name for an angel than Gabriel?  Only, she had to play her cards right to interest the reclusive investor.  She baited her trap with just the perfectly worded message, then checked into a nearby spa to await results.  Only, the results were forthcoming much quicker than anticipated.  As Sam is undergoing the torture of a vigorous massage in a woman's spa, in strides Gabriel Sinclair.  He didn't have a flaming sword, but something told Samantha this angel was more of a deliberate devil, and one that did not like a woman trying to lead him around by a ring in his nose.<br />The fur flies as Samantha's well-plotted scheme gets complicated by her falling in love with Gabriel.  Toss in a half-brother who gets Sam and Gabriel pulled into shady deals and you have JAK fun at her best.	2004-07-08

Anne Stuart has one of the most amazing understandings of the dynamics of male-female relationships, better than any Romance writer I know.  Many Romance writers are exceptional storytellers, but often I come away feeling the male is written as we would like men to be, rather than they are.  Stuart understands males, the good and the bad parts, and knows the path of love, sex and romance isn't always strewn with rose petals.  True passionate romances are complex and often riddled with strong, not always clear, motivations.  Stuart starts with this premise and adds a pinch of this and a dram of that and always comes up, book after book, with stories that are emotional rollercoasters.  I cannot recall any book she has written that she hasn't give 110% to the characters.  From her earliest series works to the present day psychological thrillers, she's never lost the passion for writing Romance.  Her clear love of the genre shines in every work, each one written as if this was the \\"novel of her heart\\".  I see writers at the top suffering from losing that magic.  They have their eye on commercial success.  Stuart never walks that path; both her eyes are solely on the story she was currently writing.  It's quite clear, the story, the characters are what matter to Stuart, anything else just follows in the wake.<br />Museum Piece is another solid Stuart gem that taps into the strong personalities of male and female characters.  Written 20 years ago, it has a slight touch of dating, but only slight.  Anne Stuart's books hold out against \\"dating\\", superior to any writer I know.  More over, Stuart's quality of writing is so consistent.

She has given supposed killers, a hit man, a mercenary, even a cult leader.  It's as if she likes to tweak our noses and say I can make you love the devil when you tell me you won't.  And she does it like none other.  This time the challenge was to make you love a fool.  Not an idiot, but a real fool for the King Henry of England.

Nicholas has long used the mask of the fool to his advantage, and sees the task as the end of the road.  A son of a baron, he saw the family lands take and his father killed when he chose to fight on the wrong side of the struggle with Henry and his sons.  He was forced to survive on his wits, and what better way to curry favor than by playing the buffoon?  The Challis in the keeping of Lord Hugh. Hugh is to marry Isabeau, so Henry sends Nicholas to the couple to entertain at their wedding feast, giving him the opportunity of stealing the cup.<br />Nicholas travels in the company of Juilanna, the estranged daughter of Isabeau, and the young widow soon intrigues him.  Julianna was wed when she was eleven years old to a sixty-year-old man.  For ten years, she has hated her mother for allowing her father to marry her off, so returning for her mother's marriage is not something she is looking forward to.

She cannot help but be attracted to the sharp-witted fool, and Nicholas sees something in Julianna he has not seen in the countless other women he has bedded.<br />Nicholas Strangefellow is a very complex man, not your typical hard as nails Stuart Bad Boy, but he still is a delight.

Teresa Medeiros has written books about every period in Hstorical Romance from Westerns to Regency to Faerytales.  But one of my favorites is Shadows and Lace.  Sorry, a well-written Medieval tale always captures my imagination.  I read this book when it first came out, and just re-read it again, and found I was as thrilled the second time around.  Maybe more so since you see so few TRUE Historical Romance currently being done.  If you are hungry for a strong Medieval tale don't hesitate to snatch this one up.  It will make a Medeiros fan out of you if you aren't already.<br />Nearly twenty years ago, a teenage Gareth of Caerleon held his two-year-old stepsister and felt protective of the child.  But that same night, he learned his father had been killed in Wales fighting for Longshanks, his stepmother was murdered and that blue-eyed babe went missing.  Since then, Gareth has been tainted with tales of murdering his step-mother in a jealous rage after catching her with her lover and disposed of that child.<br />Rowanne has lived in poverty as her father wasted money are little provided for her all her brothers.  Baron Lindsay Fordyce returns home and explains he had lost one of his children to Gareth for the term of one year.  The whole family, including Rowanne, are shocked with Gareth chooses her.  Gareth takes her home to Caerleon, and it's soon evident the dark knight is using Rowanne to provoke her father into action, but little does Rowanne understand the full extent of Gareth's designs upon her.<br />Revealing any more of the plot would spoil the wonderful tale.  Medeiros has a good sense of historical detail, the dynamics of characters tortured by their past, and blends all her magical touches to give you a novel that will linger long after that last page it turned.

I am seeing many Romance writers moving to mainstream, and that is fine, but at the same time, I am seeing many of same those writers forgetting what pushed them to the top - their ability to create characters that make you care, the ability to use words on a paper to evoke romance.<br />This is JAK at her freshest, sparkling style.  The battle between the Man from Venus and the Woman from Mars.  JAK is a master in this formula, giving you love between opposites.  Any JAK knows the routine - feisty woman, dark and slightly dangerous man put in a situation that forces emotions to rise quickly.  So enjoy the brightness of JAK when she still had a true love for romance!<br />Honor Knight was on the run.  She'd been hiding in Mexico for a month now, fearing for her life, but the minute he walked into the small cantina, he was there for her.  The man was dressed all in black, had black hair.  Judd Raven fit his name very well.  He was hired to bring Honor back and he intended to do just that.<br />He turned a deaf ear to Honor's pleas the men who hired him to bring her back were not her father and brother.  Eventually, he says he will make sure before he turns her over that they can provide proof of their claim.  When it proves out Honor was telling the truth, it was too late in her eyes.  He hadn't  believed her.  Honor thinks their relationship can never survive this.  Only, Judd is not willing to let Honor go.<br />The male-female dynamics are outmoded, but the thrill of JAK really enjoying what she was writing overcomes this.  Lets all hope, she takes six month off and goes back and re-reads her first 10 years of work, when she was so sharp, so sparkling.  There is no one who can touch her in the feisty heroine and the confused alpha male formula, so I sincerely hope she finds diamonds in the rough have their own beauty, instead of overly polishing them., but the thrill of JAK really enjoying what she was writing overcomes this.

This is a delightful tale in the Silhouette Desire \\"quickie\\" style.  Rani is a librarian, who is, not surprisingly, quiet and cautious by nature.  She has rented a cabin for a month in the fall.  When Flint Cottrell shows up on her doorstep late one night, wet and looking lost, she reluctantly lets him in.  He has a letter from the owners of the property saying he has taken the cabin behind her.<br />Rani is mildly alarmed by his battle-scarred, tomcat appearance, and his wild tale that the ring she is wearing has drawn her to him does not ease the situation.  She believes her uncle a jewel forger had made an interesting, but worth shame ring.  Flint tells her that he is a freelance writing who tracks down legends and writes about them.  He says the legend of the ring gives her certain powers - the power to attract cats, but more importantly, the power to attract a certain man.<br />Rani sniffs at the legends.  Flint does not.  He knows he has been driven to wander the word searching for something and yet he did not know what.  He now knows it was Rani he has been hunting for.  Only, she is not so easy to convince of that.<br />A delightful read, of JAK back when she wrote for the thrill of writing not so she could get three bestsellers stretched out of one book.  Back when she was not ashamed of being a romance writer.	2004-07-03

He is no madman, a killer, insane, or a dabbler in the Black Arts, this Stuart hero is an alpha-male, not one of her dark gamma-rogues who live outside the laws of man.  In fact, he is a man of the law, a policeman from Chicago.  After a long two-year manhunt for a serial killer, Matthew Connelly wants only to heal from the death of his partner and the terrible gunshot wound to his hip.  Even more, he wants solitude to heal his troubled soul.  He comes to an isolated island off the coast of Maine, figuring this to be the perfect place to be alone with himself and face his inner demons.<br /><br />The last thing Matthew wants is a romance, especially with a sassy little redhead who lives just down the beach.  The minute he caught sight of Jeannie MacPherson standing in his kitchen, he knew she was going to be trouble.  She is not his type.<br />He likes big, buxom blondes, not a pert little redhead that won't take the hint he does not want her TLC.  In the following weeks on the island, she keeps invading his solitude, with baked bread, muffins and the mothering that he really resents,<br />though at times he really needs.<br /><br />Jeannie is on retreat as well, but it has stretched to a two-year long sojourn, but at thirty-one, her biological clock is ticking.  She wants kids to mother, a man to love her, and she figures after one look, Matthew is not the man for those dreams.  Only, something keeps pulling her back.  Unable to resist him, she has a torrid affair with him, hoping that it will turn into something more.<br /><br />Very wealthy, she is co-partners of a national ice cream franchise, and when she is called away for a week on business, she tells Matthew she will be back on the island on the following Thursday.  Instead, she rushes home on Monday to find Matthew sneaking off the island.  Jeannie is devastated that he was not even going to tell her he was leaving.  In a fit, she tossed a lobster trap at him breaking a couple ribs and his wrist.<br /><br />Matthew accepts a temporary position as a Police Chief of a growing resort town in Colorado.  He figures it will give him time to finish healing, and sort out what he wants to do with his life.  Also, give him time to heal from his brush with Jeannie.  He plans on giving it five months, to see if he can put the nightmare of being a cop behind him, before seeking out Jeannie again, and seeing if he can build a relationship with her.  Only, Jeannie is not about to give him time.  She comes to town under the guise of putting in an ice cream factory and proceeds to show Matt there is no escaping her.  Jeannie does everything to get Matthews attention, even to stealing his police car, daring him to arrest her.<br /><br />The story is a bit lighter than some Stuart's typical dark and deadly tales, with some charming humor tossed in the mix.

I thought I had read every book Anne Stuart had written, but somehow, I missed this wonderful one.  Fortunately, I discovered one listed on amazon.com used, because for some stupid reason, Avon doesn't have the good sense to keep this one in reprint.  It another of Stuart's display of genius, that mesmerizes the reader to where you cannot put it down.  She catches you up from page one and won't let you go, until she puts you through an emotional ringer.  She gives you another of those Gamma-Rogue Males that has a black heart and a blacker soul.<br />Ghislaine de Lorgny is out to kill Nicholas Blackthorne - along with numerous cuckolded husbands - and she has plenty of reasons.  Gilly blames the death of her family on the guillotine and the loss of her virtue at Blackthone's door.  When Gilly was fifteen, Nicholas visited his Godparents (Gilly's parents) just as The Terror was sweeping through France.  Gilly fell in love with the beautiful Nicholas, and Nicholas demonstrated affection for Gilly.  But when her father begs Nicholas to take her to England, away from Napoleon's nightmare reign, Nicholas coldly dismisses him, unknowingly consigning Gilly's family to death.  She escaped with her 12-year-old brother onto the streets of Paris, where she watched her parents killed.  Left to see to her brother's and her survival, the nightmare continued.  An evil man sold Gilly into prostitution and had her brother carried away, likely killed.  Gilly has carried that hatred for ten years, but finally her time for revenge has come.<br />Nicholas Blackthorne, the last of the mad Blackthornes, has lived his life knowing his mother and father hated that his brother had died instead of him.  So, he did everything he could to live up to the mad Blackthorne's reputation.  He lives with so many regrets, one being he feels responsible for the de Lorgny family going under the blade.  When Gilly's father asked Nicholas to take her to England, Nicholas had just received a letter telling of his father's dead so he'd carelessly brushed off the man.  For the last ten years, Nicholas believe Gilly was killed with her parents; her face has haunted his mind.<br />He does not recognize Gilly as the chef his cousin Ellen hired a year ago, but he soon finds out after Gilly tries to poison him.  Instead of turning her over to the local magistrate, he takes Gilly prisoner and spirits her off to Scotland, then later drags her across Europe.<br />Hot on their heels is his cousin Ellen and Tony.  Ellen has always loved Tony, but he has been more of a big brother to her.  Tony has been trying for the last two years to shift their relationship, but fears he has left it too late.  He sees this rescue of Gilly as a means to be close to Ellen and change her thinking towards him.  Their secondary romance makes this into two loves stories, not just one.<br />Nicholas Blackthorne is one of Stuart's total bad boys she delights making you love.  Gilly is unforgettable, her pain and betrayal stings, showing her indomitable spirit.  The reader is exhausted after their emotional battles.  It's one of those books you won't ever be able to forget.<br />Now someone explain why Avon does not reprint such high quality writing?	2004-07-01

She is a writer extraordinaire; she never fails to mesmerize me with her heart pounding prose.  Does not matter if it is Stuart's most recent psychological thriller or going back to some of her earliest works.  Candlelight Ecstasy Supreme was a Dell series Romance line back twenty years ago.  They were not around long, but some top writers of today got their wings under this line Jayne Ann Krentz (under one of her various names), Heather Graham, Lori Copeland and Anne Stuart are some of the names that jump out when you look up CES backlist.<br />This is another in the long line of Stuart's novels that grabs the reader and holds them nearly breathless from start to finish.  Maddy Lambert was an unloved child.  Raised by indifferent parents too wrapped up in their world grabbing for power, she was little more than a glorified prop in photo opportunities to her parents.  Her father was an idealist in a world of dirty politics, her mother wanted to be first lady at all costs.<br />Seventeen-year-old Maddy fell in love with her father's Secret Service bodyguard Jake Thomas Murphy.  Everyone knew it, but no one took it seriously.  When her father's presidential bid ended in his withdrawal, he left his wife, son and daughter behind going to a small country in Central America to work for Freedom Fighters.  Murphy followed him.<br />Now fourteen years later, her father is dying of cancer, and Maddy's mother insists she go to Central America to bring him home.  Maddy is unprepared for the war torn situation, for her father's new wife who is two years younger than her, but most of all, Maddy is unprepared to face Jake.  She is shocked by his appearance; gone is the clean, uptight bodyguard, in his place is a harden rebel leader.  She is more shocked when Jake claims she is a spy and refuses to believe she is Maddy.<br />It's double-crossing, triple-crossing to where you are so confused which side is good and which side as bad, and you need a score card to keep up with Jake's loyalties.  And in the end, you might stop and realize a lot of questions were never answered.<br />But it's a compelling read.  A must for all Stuart fans or those just discovering her.  Jake is another soul-stained devil Stuart loves to conjure and Maddy is the strong woman willing to give all for the man she loves.a score card to keep up with Jake's loyalties.

For intense, dark and deadly males, I go to Anne Stuart.  If I want giggles till I hurt, I choose Lynsay Sands and Katie Macalister.  If I hunger for Off-World adventures, I got Robin D. Owens and C.J. Barry, hot sexy vampires or futuristic drama look to a new voice Angela Knight.  But if I want a near poetic faerytale that evokes the style of Victoria Holt, you can do no better than Teresa Medeiros.  Ever since I read her Whisper of Roses, I have been a big fan.<br />One Night of Scandal is not really a Romance in today's mold.  It's more of the old style gothic.  The isolated manor in Cornwall, the brooding, too contained hero, the full of life wife he was forced to marry, hovering over them all is the ghost of the previous wife and the tile the hero now carries - the Murderous Marquee.<br /><br />31-year-old Hayden St. Clair is content in his dark hell of memories, content to live away from the Ton and this narrow minds and vicious gossip, but he needs a governess for his 10-year-old daughter, so he is forced to go to London to seek one.  Finding one is proving impossible, since the Ton feeds on the facts he was forced to kill his best friend in a duel, and later his wife took her own life by jumping off a cliff.  Naturally, it's wondered if the Murderous Marquee did not lend his wife a helping hand.<br />Lotte Fairleigh, 21-year-old ward of a Duke, is facing her coming out party, but she cannot resist one last adventure until she is firmly planted on the marriage mart.  The adventure is sneaking out a second-story window to dash across the lawn to the house next door.  The Murderous Marquee is in residence there and it's said he will be leaving in the morning.  This is her last chance for a peek of the man who has captured her imagination.<br />Hayden has just seen a good friend off, the friend hinting he was going to send a woman to him to break his boredom.  When Lotte turns up peeking in his window, he mistakenly believes she is the woman.  Their embrace is broken up by her guardian.  The Duke is enraged and demands Hayden marry Lotte to save her reputation.  Hayden assures him nothing happened between them but a kiss, and says he will never marry again, leaving the Duke to challenge him to a duel.<br />Lotte cannot permit her brother-in-law to risk his life, so she goes to Hayden and begs him to marry her.  Hayden does, but not for the reasons Lotte believes.  She is startled when she arrives at her new home to find Hayden has a 10-year-old daughter, a wild hellion who enjoys vexing her father.  Lotte is hurt to learn Hayden married her only to have a suitable governess for his daughter, crushing the young woman's hope of making a good marriage.<br />The situation goes from bad to worse, as the child sets out to drive Lotte nuts.  Only, Lotte, a hellion in her own right, knows all the tricks of the trade and pushes the girl to finally call a truce.  Lotte makes strides with her stepdaughter, but her marriage only grows more distant.<br />No one can cover the fact there are screams in the night or that someone plays music in the music room when the door is locked.  Lotte must unriddle the ghost stalking Hayden's hall and find happiness in the life she has made.<br />Medeiros beautiful proses are writing as you don't often see it these days.

I like \\"faerytales\\" so I'm able to put aside credibility and enjoy a book - not all readers will be able to do this - but there were other problems with this novel that really hurt the super effort.  However, hang in there, you won't be sorry, it's still a very enjoyable read.<br />Rory Kenilworth, California surfer girl, finds on her 23rd birthday her whole life has been a lie.  Her mother died before she could break the news to her that she's a princess born.  So, on her birthday a lawyer announces she has a half brother, the King of a tiny unheard of country, she must soon accept her place as princess and she's betrothed to Prince Laurent.<br />Laurent, playboy, prince of another tiny unheard of country that borders her brother's kingdom, is the intended groom.  He shows up to protect Rory and help her make the transition to princess, but does so pretending to be his secretary.  Using his middle name Sebastian, he finds himself protecting her as one attempt after another is made on her life.  And not just from one area, there are several factions wanting to stop the royal marriage.<br />Joyce Sullivan's talented writing is what kept me reading.  The premise was not credible, and there are so many wholes in the believability factor that she really asks a lot of a reader.  At one point, she stresses Rory's given a bracelet with a panic button (a la West Wing).  Yet, when Rory gets in life threatening situations she NEVER uses it.  It's as if the bracelet and its button vanish after its first mention.  Bad editing there.  That should've been addressed.  Why bother giving her the bracelet if the device is totally dismissed?  Also, in this day and age, when the Internet is full of everything, Laurent a playboy prince hounded by the press (a la Lady Di) that Rory could not find even ONE picture of him anywhere just is so silly.  At one point, he instructs his assistant to give her a picture of his brother when Rory keeps asking to see one, but that is - like the bracelet - forgotten as soon as the page is turned.  It only makes the reader like Laurent less.  There was no viable reason for him to continue the charade.  And like the bracelet, it's forgotten as soon as it was mentioned.  Did Rory get the picture or not?  Rory does go to the royal site, where his picture was disconnected, but that is the ONLY place she bothers to look?  What about newspapers, magazines etc.  Sorry.  That, again, asked the reader not to think.  A woman engaged to a man she has never seen would be looking EVERYWHERE!  Also, the one man trying to kill Rory - why kill her when he is trying to avenge his sister's murder?  The motivation and reasoning behind the character is just too sketchy.  That she does not  address these issues shows the writer failed to step back and really look at her characters, see how they would TRULY act in that situation.<br />The problems that needed addressing aside, I found Sullivan able to pull me along with the strength of her writing.  She shows GREAT promise as a writer, a strong voice that flows smoothly.  Her characters are very engaging; they leap off the pages and make you care about them.  She is adept at tossing red herrings around, so she is good in developing plot.  If she can stop dropping threads - important ones - and sticks to a more believable story, then you're going to see a rising star in Romance.<br />I really enjoyed this book, despite the plot problems, and look forward to future books from this engaging writer.  This book gets 5 stars for the writing- 3 stars for problem riddled storyline - I split the difference and gave it 4.

Gelach may be Nora Robert's cousin, but her talent is her own.  She is just not a writer, but a storyteller.  This was clearly shown with her first two books, A Rebel's Pledge and the prequel to this book, Thorns in Eden.  She is a weaver of tales in the old tradition of Scot's Seanchaidh.<br />She left us hanging at the end of Thorns with Rebecah having to decide between staying in England and marrying the man she is engaged to, or going after John Nash the first generation American patriot, who had returned to the Colonies with war between the two countries impending.<br />Rebecah had undertaken the long voyage to America in search of John.  John has longed for Rebecah, but has no idea she has come after him.  Instead of reuniting with her love, she is forced to undertake a hard journey with only fellow women, running from the Indians and Jean LaRoux, who is hot on Rebecah's Trail and out for vengeance.<br />I will not spoil any more of the plot.  It's simply a MUST READ.  True Historical Fiction from someone who loves history.  You cannot ask for more.	2004-06-27

She creates such vividly complex characters.  They are not perfect examples of what we would like to be - some shimmering chimera that does not exist.  She picks out characters that are deeply wounded, often scarred, often they are content to turn a blind eye to the world around them just because it's easy than fighting.  Sometimes people don't really get Stuart because she is not drawing pictures of pretty characters, she's studying people in all their aspects, good and bad.  And she fascinates me like no other writer because of this willingness to dance on the knife's edge rather than play politically correct.<br />Tanner and Ellie are two more of Stuart's intense dramas.  Stuart loved the whole of a person - all aspects, even the ugly, and loves to toy with those, intense emotions when a man and woman are put into a situation that is explosive - between them, around them.  Fifteen years ago, Tanners father took a rifle and killed over a dozen people.  No one saw it coming; there was no major warning signs before it happened.  Tanner and his mother were gone before it happened, though the horrifying act has followed him ever since.  He has come back to the scene of the crime, the small Montana town where people died because of his<br />father with the driving need to understand why.<br />The first person he meets is Ellie Lundquist, the only survivor of his father's massacre.  She was wounded in the knee, limps today because of it.  After her first shock at who Tanner is, she befriends the troubled man.  Ellie is a good person but for too long she was much more than a victim of his father's crime.  She was only sixteen when it happened, and as the survivor, the town wrapped her in cotton and protected her like the town princess.  Ellie has allowed this to happen because she cares about the people, but she knows this has gone on too long and she must leave the town or die inside.<br />Tanner is determined to find out why his father suddenly cracked and killed people.  His arrival has upset some, since nearly every family in town lost a member in the killing spree.  It's a quiet, sleepy small town slowly dying, but beneath the surface is a troubling ripple.  Suddenly, animals and pets are being shot in the head; people are reporting someone peeking in their windows.<br />Ellie knows it's not Tanner, but these are the people she has lover her whole life; she cannot see who would be doing this.  Worse, if someone is killing animals now hinting Tanner is behind it, could it be maybe Tanner's father was not the real killer?  Or was he the killer and somehow escaped by faking his death?<br />Tanner and Ellie are wonderfully drawn.  They are so human, so mesmerizing.  This is just another in the long line of Stuart masterpieces, where she unflinchingly holds up the mirror and forces us to look at emotions that are powerful, that are often disturbing.<br />Sheer bloody brilliance!out why his father suddenly cracked and killed people.

I come from a long line of storytellers, a near dying craft.  I don't mean writers, but ones who draw on the living history around them to weave tales.  Seanchaidh - in Gaelic means recorder of tales.  They were more that just an entertainer around fireside, they were the keepers of history.  Rita Gerlach is the cousin of Nora Roberts - without doubt one of the most successful writers around these days.  But Gerlach is a true storyteller who writes from the heart, the soul, from her heritage - she is a Seanchaidh.<br />As a person who spent my life wrapped up in history, I have repeatedly bemoaned the shabby treatment true historical fiction is getting from mainstream publishers these days.  They swear no one is buying it so they don't publish it.  Well, how can you buy it if it's not there?  Thank goodness for some people not listening to this nonsense.  Publish America is giving good writers, true storytellers the chance to write and do it there way.  Gerlach is likely a prime example of NYC missing the boat where historical fiction, storytelling is concerned.  This is her second book (The Rebel's Pledge and Everlasting Mountains are her other titles) and it's so thrilling to read quality work such as this.<br />Gerlach has taken true factual history and woven it into a fictional tale in the best tradition of the Seanchaidh.  Colonial-born, first generation Englishman, John Nash sought to create a life in the frontiers of Maryland.  But as he sees his dream taking shape, the threat of war with England is heavy in the air, propelling him to return to England and his family.<br />There, he meets Rebecah - the daughter of an Englishman he had encountered in the wilds of Maryland one night - and learns the man since has died.  Rebecah has dreams of her own, dreams of adventure, freedom, of love.  She's known little outside the isolated English manor where she was raised.  After her father's death, she was forced to go live with her Uncle.  He is a mean spirited man, who wants Rebecah gone, though she little understands why her presence angers him so.  She's been promised in marriage to Sir Cecil Lanley, even so she's drawn to Nash.  Emotions are complicated when she learns her father died in a pre-war conflict in the Colonies.  Soon she is a pawn in her uncle schemes to slander Nash, hinting he was involved, if not responsible, in her father's death.<br />As the tensions between Nash and Rebecah's uncle rise, so do the tensions between the two countries, sending Nash back to the Colonies and pending war.  Rebecah must chose between the patriot she loves and the man she is promised to marry.<br />Heads up on this...buy Everlasting Mountains at the same time you buy this.  You will thank me for this, because the story continues in Gerlach's third book and you won't want to miss it.<br />She has a gentle soothing voice that pulls the reader into \\"seeing\\" her vivid imagery in the tradition of the ancient storytellers.

Too lovey-dovey wrapped up with themselves, small details of the upcoming ceremony are slipping by them.  Like the arrival of Kate's cousin, Terri.<br />Bastien has been living in the penthouse over the Argeneau offices, quite happily alone since Lucern had moved in with Kate.  But that solitude is about to come crashing down around him as the wedding approaches.  First Kate pressed Bastien into picking up Terri at the airport, since the loving couple had other business.  Bastien has no problem with that request.  It's the second favor Kate asks of her brother-in-law to be that puts the crimp into his quiet lifestyle Â¯ she needs him to put Terri up while she is in town for the wedding.  Seeing no real problem putting her up for a day or two, Bastien agrees.  Only after he commits to the arrangement, Kate informs him that Terri is coming earlier than the rest of her family - two weeks earlier!  But it's too late to make other arrangements, because Terri is due at the airport within minutes!<br />Bastien has viewed the pending nuptials with mixed emotions:  happiness for Lucern, disgust at their frequent public displays of being besotted and a wee dram of envy.  Bastien is not about to voice this aloud fearing mommy dearest Marguerite will sharpen her matchmaking efforts.  She has always insisted her children need to be mated with someone who brings the zest for living back and the Lissianne and Etienne married and Lucern well onto his way, her crosshairs has come upon Bastien and he is feeling her breath down his neck.<br />Bastien fears logistical problems in having Terri around for two weeks.  How do you hide that you are a vampire from a woman living under the same roof for that long?  It gets worse when his nephew Thomas shows up.  A wannabe actor, he is preparing for a roll on Broadway playing Â¯ what else Â¯ a vampire!  Terri is instantly charmed by Thomas who tries to lure her in helping him \\"rehearse\\".  Bastien is distracted by the physical attraction to Terri, but his befuddlement is compounded by having to keep an eye on Thomas - a vamp of the old style who likes to keep his fangs sharp!<br />Matters grows worse as Kate's boss, Chris, has one accident after another and Kate ends up installing the editor in Bastien's apartment while his is being repaired.  (Note for those loving an inside jest Chris is loosely based on Chris Keeslar, editor at Dorchester Publishing Â¯ Lynsay's editor for the vamp series!).

I have a shelf with nothing but Anne Stuart novels.  Small wonder since each and every book she gives a haunting powerful read, that slams into you like a tidal wave.  The force of her prose awes you.  She leaves you breathless.  She's an addiction.  Stuart does more with 100 pages than most writers could do with 300.  She's a brilliant writer that dances with the devil in the fire, and demands her readers follow along on the dangerous waltz.  Heat Lightning is Stuart at her very very best.  If you are a Stuart fan and missed this one, snap up any copy you can.  Quick!  If you've never read Stuart - you poor thing - you can do no better than starting with this one.<br />In the sticky, humid tradition of the Long Hot Summer - Jassy Turner is a Southern Belle in the old tradition.  Used to loud mouthed, pushy men who pat their women on the head and expect them to say fiddlie-dee, Jassy has long ago learnt to get her way by flanking maneuvers.  She is a pampered rich girl, whose whole life has been tea parties, gentle manners and observing the proprieties.  Oh, she faces the harsher realities of running a shelter for abused women, but that sort of ugliness has never personally touched her life.  Until he came striding across the lawn.  Six foot of hunk, a come-hither gleam in his pale eyes that had all the ladies of Turner's Landing ready to swoon, Jassy knew he was going to be trouble, but she had no idea just how much.<br />Caleb Spenser came across the Turner lawn - a wolf amongst pigeons - and he was heading straight at Jassy.  At the last second, he confronts her brother.  Caleb has bought the old bordello, the property next to the Turner's Belle Reve and claims he is going to fix it up.  Only, Jassy sees there's bad blood between her brother and this stranger.  Determined to find out what, and head off any problems, she finds herself in Caleb's company, desperate for answers, which neither man seems willing to give.  And she does not like the ones she is getting.  Caleb's come for vengeance, his plans including taking Jassy, but neither of them is prepared for the flames they create together.<br />Stuart paints a claustrophobic sense of the old South, that slow, stifling, itchy Falkneresque sense of people on the edge, waiting for the rain to break the drought, waiting for someone to make the wrong move setting everyone on a course of destruction.  Caleb is another of Stuart's dangerous bad boys with the devil's soul and a black heart.  Once again, Caleb and Jassy will draw you with their complex characters, their flaws, leave breathless by the range of emotions and passion.  It just does not get any better than this.

Stuart tries her hand at Much Ado and comes away with a winner! I had this book when it originally came out, but somehow lost it. Very odd for me, because everything Stuart writes goes on my Keeper Shelf. So I was very thrilled to find a used copy on Amazon. Frankly, I DO NOT understand the STUPID marketing of Stuart's Backlist. There are many powerhouse titles that are not kept in print (and fans are griping!). I really find this bizarre for a writer of her calibre. Maybe she needs to get a new agent!<br />This book is a delightful mix of emotions! Valerian Romney is accused of killing his father. Now would our hero do that? Well, it's an Anne Stuart book so remember there is always that intriguing possibility! LOL. Romney must flee with his brother Phelan - but in the disguise of Phelan's WIFE! Only the masquerade it off to a very rocky start as Valerian instantly feels attraction to lovely Sophie - and Sophie is getting confused flushes from the \\"Lady\\" Valerian! If that is not bad enough, his brother Phelan is getting a case for Lady Juliette. Trouble enough - not by far! Juliette is attracted to the \\"married\\" Phelan, but she is in masquerade as a boy, trying to escape a heartless abuser.<br />Only Stuart could have the mask, mask who's wearing the mask farce with such delight, wit, charm and sexy steaming situations!

Some writers come by this instinctively, other work at it, some never find it.  Kane is a strong in this area so she makes this tense tale very enjoyable.  She is also very strong in creating character that leap of the pages, so I see more enjoyable tales from this fresh writer.  I will be ordering her other works due to the strength of this book.<br />Holly Frasier's life is clouded in troubles.  Her husband died mysteriously, and then years later, a fianc&eacute;e vanishes.  Warning bells really sounds when the detective investigating the situation dies too.  It's enough to bring in the FBI to protect Holly.<br />Making a target of himself Jack O'Hara goes through a fake marriage with Holly.  The detective who died was Jack's good friend.

Molly Ferrell comes to the small New England fishing village to end an obsession.  Since she was fifteen, she's been possessed by the power of a young writer/poet Michael O'Flannery.  His word spoke to her, reached her as no one ever had.  Half loving the shadowy man who could create such passion, such beauty, she is embarking on writing a book at O'Flannery, about his life and his death, to find out what happened to the brilliant writer/poet Michael O'Flannery.  Mystery surrounds his death.  Supposedly, twenty years ago he took a gun into the forest and killed himself, leaving behind a set of near genius works that have obsessed Molly for decades.  Only his body was never found.  What happened to drive this genius to end his life when he was only twenty?  Michael's writings touched Molly, reached her in a way men never did.  So she is determined to exorcise the ghost of O'Flannery once and for all by writing this book about him, her final tribute of love.<br />Visiting his hometown, she is determined find out why a man of such talent would destroy himself - and maybe break her obsession once and fall.  There she finds hard resistance in the town folk.  An empty grave with a headstone, people that lock their doors or stop talking when she entered a room, and heavy, dogged resistance from Jake Marley, a carpenter, who hints there were other deaths in the town and maybe Michael did not kill himself, but was murdered.  Instead of driving Molly away, Jake fascinates her nearly as much as the enigma of Michael.  His<br />chilling warnings only makes Molly more determined to solve the riddles surrounding the writer's death.<br />Stuart owns the talent of dark, moody alpha/gamma heroes and she is flying high with this tale.  She never lets you down.	2004-06-23

This book is very similar in style as Moonrise, and since that is my favourite Anne Stuart book that is high praise.  One of her best \\"small\\" books.  Now You See Him (Silhouette Intimate Moments, No 7429, May 1987).  This is serious Stuart at her best!<br />Francey Neeley's life is turned into a nightmare because she thought she loved the wrong man.

This is my first Pamela Britton book.  I understand there were some problems in the productions of the novel.  It was written as a paranormal, but then Ms. Britton was forced to change it into a straight historical.  I cannot imagine the upset that caused a relatively new writer, so that it came out this charming is quite amazing!  And it is charming!  Oh, there is a sign here or there saying new author - but then, every author is a new author at one point, are they not?  I found myself pulled by the characters.  They are well drawn and follow logical, motivations.  They captivated this reader.<br />Ariel, especially, made me feel for her.  A very naive young woman, unloved by her father, growing up with no brothers or sisters, she didn't have the raising to know how to act with people, what deceivers they can be.  Her mother was a gypsy who died in childbirth, her father an Earl - a cold, distant man - and that gypsy taint already marks Ariel in the Ton's eyes.  This sets poor Ariel up to be an easy mark to be seduced by a scoundrel who promises her something she has never known Â¯ love.  When they're caught in a compromising position, she's ruined, teaching a young Ariel men are not to be trusted.  Two years later, she returns to London - pushed by her cousin, Phoebe.  Now married, Phoebe hopes the years have made London forget Ariel's scandal.  But they have not.  It's heartbreaking for the reader to see Ariel's sense of always being on the outside.  It makes her easy prey when Nathan Trevain, the future Duke of Davenport tries to befriend her.  He proposes they pretend they're engaged.  However, the reader knows Trevain is setting out to use Ariel.  His reasons for using Ariel are with good purpose.  He is not a cad, but is out to save someone close to him.  Don't you just love it when the dark deadly alpha male is caught in his own trap?<br />Trevain's plans to use Ariel gets out of hand when he's forced tokidnap her.  Ariel, a wee bit fed up with people using her, is not about to make it easy on the handsome man.  The kidnapping quickly blows up in his face, with spunky Ariel handling her situation with a determination that has to win your heart.<br />What strikes me most about Britton is her gentle humor.  In one instance, when Ariel escapes Nathan, falls into a pond, and nearly drowns, instead of total panic one might expect it's written with a deft handling.  I won't spoil it Â¯ but it's surprisingly original.  Overall, it shows Britton has a style that should improve, as she grows surer of her craft, promising more novels that are delightful for readers.	2004-06-19

She proves this time and again.  Why she is not THE top writer in Romance today is hard to fathom.  Frankly, I attribute it to shortsightedness of her publisher, since some of her powerhouse backlist titles like Moonrise, Nightfall, Ritual Sins, To Love a Dark Lord and about a dozen others are not kept in constant reprint.  That hurts a writer and it's just plain bad judgment from the publisher.  She is the Resident Genius of dark and deadly bad boys you cannot resist.  And she does it again in the anthology, with a lighter more romantic touch in her short story Blind Date From Hell.  Don't we all think blind dates are from there?  Well, Stuart takes the premise and has fun with it.  Gideon Hyde has existed in Hell for so long he cannot recall why he was sent there in the first place.  He is relatively sure it was likely a jealous husband who removed him from his earthly existence, but he cannot recall who, what or where and frankly, he doesn't care.  He is tired and bored with the endless existence, but Ralph - one of Satan's devils - is determined to shake Gideon out of his boredom.  He is sent back to earth to seduce one Sam - Samantha actually - a gorgeous, legged professional model that stubborn has held on to her virginity.  It's a fun tale that reaches into your heart and won't let you go.  Gideon is another of Stuart's male who will haunt you long after you put the book down.<br />Proving she is now powder puff girl, Cherry Adair gives you a red-hot sexy tale with \\"Dance With the Devil.  This time, its spy vs. spy romance.  Mia Rossi loved her spy partner Jack Ryan, but the International Playboy was not willing to commit.  So, she quits her job, leaves Jack and says she is going to be married by Summer.  Her mother has been setting her up with blind dates in the effort.  All have proved dates from Hell - Mia believe her mother is trying to make her see Jack is the only man for her.  So when her mother arranges one with a man named Davis Sloan, she is determined to use Sloan to wipe Jack from her mind.  But who should turn out to be her blind date?  Jack's back!  It's a sassy, sizzling tale that is true Adair.  It has Mia giving Jack what for and they have to steal a disk with information vital to their country.  This is a tale you won't want to miss.<br />Muriel Jensen holds her own with these two heavy hitters in \\"Hal and Damnation\\".  Kat is frustrated in her efforts to get her father to turn over the family restaurant to her, even though she has proved she is a super manager.  She is more frustrated with the super new waiter Hal, who refuses to snap to when she barks and order.  This one stretches the premise just a bit, because Hal is not from Hell and he is not really a date.  He is assigned to lure her away from the restaurant for two days while the cops handled a bank robbery attempt.  The bad guys plan on coming through the restaurant's wall to the bank.  Things go array when the plane Hal is flying has to make an emergency landing.  It's not as strong as the other two stories - but sheesh, few writers are at the peak form of Stuart and Adair.

Break the Night was the first book I ever read by Anne Stuart.  The second was To Love A Dark Lord.  By the time, I finished both of these books, I promptly went out and bought everything she had ever written and have been buying her new works on preorder ever since.  Seriously.  If her name is on it, it's a brush with brilliance.  The Resident Genius of Bad Boys, Stuart dances in the fire while other writers drag their toes in the shallows.  Sometimes, this has earned her a tongue-lashing from the politically correct reader.  Stuart is not afraid to dance with the devil.  With a good understanding of men as men are, not as a reader might wish them to be, a la Prince Charming, she paints characters that are flawed, often disturbing, and so darkly compelling she leaves you breathless.  That power was what struck me in Break the Night, it is what Stuart does, time and again, with such originality, why she's one of the top writers of today.  She could pull her punches and go to the middle of the road.  She would see less flack, likely run rings around Nora in sales.  Instead, she embraces the magic and pulls the more daring reader into a turbulent storm of emotions, maybe even some we would rather not face.  I can only say, don't ever stop, don't even pull that punch!<br />Break the Night is just such a tale.  As a fan of history, I have studied the case history of Jack the Ripper.  Stuart obviously has as well, and uses that as a base for this dark and dangerous tale of reincarnation, murder and revenge.  I am hoping to see this one reprinted because it was used to help launch the short lived Silhouette Shadows line (sorry to see they dropped this line because some very great books came from here - especially since Paranormal Romance is so very strong these days), so likely many of her fans missed this gem.<br />In the Fall of 1888, a serial killer stalked the street of Whitechapel, England.

Five prostitutes were killed with an ever-increasing madness; two were Liz Stride and Mary Kelly.<br />Jump a head over a hundred years, and Jack walks once again and in another country.  To mark his victims, he is leaving their face covered with a handcrafted mask made by Liz Stride.  Yes, Liz Stride is alive again and crafts the masks, but she isn't just the reincarnation of Liz, but is also part Mary.  Liz was the victim where Jack seemed almost as if interrupted and he sees Liz as his fitting swan song to this lifetime.  Only, her not being merely Liz is upsetting the proverbial applecart.<br />The tall, dark and haunted John Damien is a reporter covering the killings, and he is tortured by seeing the killings as they happen.  Nearing madness, he deliberately shines the spotlight on Liz Stride knowing Jackie Boy will come to claim her and he intends to be there to stop him, once and for all.<br />As Liz is drawn into the nightmare of the Venice Ripper's murders, she fears the man who says he will stop the Ripper, might actually BE the Ripper.

Only, her not being merely Liz is upsetting the proverbial applecart.<br />The tall, dark and haunted John Damien is a reporter covering the killings, and he is tortured by seeing the killings as they happen.  Nearing madness, he deliberately shines the spotlight on Liz Stride knowing Jackie Boy will come to claim her and he intends to be there to stop him, once and for all.<br />As Liz is drawn into the nightmare of the Venice Ripper's murders, she fears the man who says he will stop the Ripper, might actually BE the Ripper.  Worse, she cannot stop herself from wanting him, even though it might cost her life.	2004-06-07

Liz Maverick had the Third book in the series of Five 2176 for Dorchester Publishing.  And she has a hard row to hoe, as they say.  Being the middle child is always considered being a pain.  In Yank baseball, batting third is, I believed, called hitting clean-up, meaning not only are you expected to hit as well as the two batters before you, but are expected to drive them home.  That is Maverick tough task.<br />As I looked at the other writers of the series, you see them shining.  Grant, the creator of the concept, had the task of selecting the other books in the series - and she chose well!  She is a strong Sci-Fi Romance writer and she kicked 2176 off in hi-flying fashion in April with The Legend of Banzai Maguire, giving her fellow writers a standard to hit.  And boy did Kathleen Nance rise to the occasion with Day of Fire in May.  Nance, always a beautiful writer, kicked a*** with this Canadian saga in the cycle.  Book Four, The Power of Two is coming up in August under the skilled hand of a new voice in Romance, Patti O'Shea.  I am looking forward to it her because her debut novel Ravyn's Flight was such a strong book I have no doubt she will score a hit.  So, Maverick was not only in the hard spot of book Three, having to follow in the path of the two super books, she is more of an unknown factor.  I interviewed all the ladies for a feature article about the series and found Maverick's enthusiasm very refreshing, but this book was coming from a writer that had never written a full Romance novel!  Could she do it?  She had written short stories for the saucy, spicy Red Sage's Secrets and she had a Sex in the City style Chit Lit novel What A Girl Wants (March 2004, New American Library), but could she really do a full Sc-Fi Romance?  Could she step up to the plate and hit a home run, reaching the quality of Grant and Nance, seasoned writers?<br />Well, stand back, Liz Maverick proves she can do anything thing she wants!  This book rises to Grant's and Nance's challenge and proves she has a power to write whatever strikes her talented fancy!  The same energy that came through to me in our interview, imbues her character Jenny Red with life.  Jenny vibrates with savvy, with a highly charged sense to stay alive.  She had to because she faced the cesspit of Newgate and lived.  Once in history Australia was a penile colony.  So it is again, but just not for England,  this time it serves as the dumping ground of every criminal, every miscreant that does not fit into the well order world in 2176.  Jenny was an innocent, but that did not stop Prince Kyber (the bad guy, who is just an arrogant, misunderstood good guy from Grant's lead novel) from sending a young woman who had done nothing to Newgate.  Her father was accused of killing Kyber's father in an attempted taking over of the royal ruling house of new Asia.  The fuss saw Jenny condemned for her father's actions, as well as Kyber's half brother D'ekkar Han Valoren.  Jenny never knew what D'ekkar went through in the days after her exile to Newgate, and she had little time to worry over his fate, because she was scrambling to stay alive.<br />She crawled out of Newgate, but D'ekkar tracks her down and needs her help.  He is part of an organization called The Shadow Runners - a group using Banzai Maguire to spearhead a worldwide revolution.  D'ekkar, once part of that ruling world, now hates it and hates his brother for his vile treatment, for being branded illegitimate.  He is part of the Shadow Runners and will do anything to see freedom for all.  Even sacrificing Jenny.<br />Jenny and D'ekkar strike a strong cord.  Survivors, yet underneath are very caring people.  They are hard because they were forced to be.  Jenny especially touches the heart with her in your face woman, who hides the tended bruises heart who loved D'ekkar, yet blames him for her exile for a crime in which she had no role.  She is hard, but D'ekkar reaches her as no other and she will walk through fire for him, even worse, she will return to Newgate where her life is worth nothing.<br />Maverick toots her horn - look out she is a writer to watch.  It's a stand-alone book, you don't have to read the first two - but I strongly recommend you not missing some of the hottest edge fiction written today and advice you to keep on with the two coming.  Sci-Fi Romance is blazing hot and Grant, Nance, Maverick and O'Shea are making their mark at the top.<br />Kudos for Dorchester doing this gutsy series, giving writers so much control over their own works, Kudos for Grant for seeing the talent in her fellow writers and giving new talent the chance to strut their stuff!or him, even worse, she will return to Newgate where her life is worth nothing.<br />Maverick toots her horn - look out she is a writer to watch.

Jenna Mills has to be one of the best writers rising in the Romance Genre today.  She has a way of creating characters that come alive, she uses plots and emotions with razor edge precision, luring the reader to a breathless involvement without ever being manipulative.  Good writers craft prose to push buttons in their readers.  The truly talented ones do something more.  They \\"See\\" their books like a movie in their head and use the prose, the magic of words, to gift the readers with the same experience.  You don't read Mills' books you SEE the book inside your head.  Jenna Mills dances in fire and invites the reader to join her.  I won't give away a lot of the plot in this, since there are other books in the series, and you should discover the strong and unusual plotline yourself.<br />Danielle Caldwell, a working-mother raising her five-year-old son, hears words no mother wants to hear \\"your son has been kidnapped.\\"  After she receives the shattering news, she recalls the darkly handsome man in the lobby of the inn where she works, remembers one of the employees saying he was asking about her.  Putting two and two together, she assumes the man has something to do with her missing son.  Gutsy Danielle pulls a derringer on him and demands information, when he cannot deliver that and says he is FBI, she demands he leave her alone.  The warning the kidnappers gave her was to keep the police out of it - or else.<br />Leaving her alone is the one thing he cannot do.  Liam Brooks is a hunter, he has long been tracking a killer called Titan.  It has cost him nearly everything, it cost him the life of his wife, because when Liam got too close to trapping Titan, the killer punished Liam.  Now Liam is a man obsessed with vengeance.  Only Titan's trail has grown cold, years cold.  So when he received a tip about Danielle Caldwell, he defies his superiors and rushes after the trail of the ghostly Titan.<br />Danielle knows she should not trust FBI agent, a man with a too close relationship with the bottle, but she has no one else to turn to when the horror hits.  Why would someone kidnap the son of a working woman, a woman of little importance?  Titan wants something from her, but what?  Reluctantly, she has little choice to trust Liam.  Only, she is unprepared for the instant emotional bond, she sees this man has been deeply hurt.  Worse, the sexual attraction is a complication she could well do without.<br />There is a \\"structured feel\\", because this is a series where the various writers must work with in a theme, however Mills takes the line and creates her own feel.  That she can write within a preformed outline, only shows what strong a writer she is.  It's easy to write a story that comes to your with the inspiration of a Muse. It is harder to take you talent and summer the magic to fit within another dictates.  Mills crafts a dark, sinister  tale, with strongly drawn characters that, once again, pull the reader along, make you care.  It just does not get any better than this.relationship with the bottle, but she has no one else to turn to when the horror hits.

But sigh, her last few half dozen books have been dull, only the Castle \\"After Glow\\" showing Jayne Ann can still razzle-dazzle with the best.  This book is not JAK at her best - far from it - but it is a big improvement from the last two Quicks and two JAKs, that you tend to want to rate it higher than it deserves.<br />I liked the characters - and REALLY wanted to love the book - and after the fire works on \\"After Glow\\",  I really hoped she would keep that power.  It starts out well, but sort of loses steam quickly (no pun intended!).  This book is JAK formula all the way.  I love the formula, so I don't mind that.  But I do mind a rather boring mystery slowing the book down.  Since JAK moved from &quot;Romance Writer&quot; to &quot;Mainstream Writer\\", she has lost &quot;THE ROMANCE&quot; and it's killing her books.  She almost  rises to the level, but not quite.  She needs to rediscover the power of emotional bonds.  Her toning down the emotional tension between her leads and making it more a comedy of manners with a week mystery tossed in for diversion is watering down the JAK Magic.  The mystery is hardly a mystery, and almost falls into the old trite Who Dun It style of introducing the evil villain at nearly at the last minute.<br />I thought Eleanor and Arthur quite charming, they engaged my attention to the end, but they just did not sizzle with JAK's witchcraft.<br />It's a good solid read, just not a great one.  Nice book for the beach.	2004-05-22

There is, undoubtedly, no writer who has quite her special magic.  I buy her books on her name alone, because I know simply she will provide me with a very special story - every time.  I recall with Ritual Sins came out, I thought opps, the storyline won't work for me.  Stuart likely smiled, knowing that is the reaction she would get from her loyal fans.  She also knew she'd take them down those dark, claustrophobic corridors, rife with emotions, that she would mesmerize us against our will.  Ritual Sins proved Stuart could take a subject off-putting and dancing in the fire - and demand of her readers that they do the same.  She is not \\"safe\\" writer.  She does not take the easy way or go with the flow of politically correct.  She designs, crafts and uses her magic wand to weave tales that are brilliant.  She is without doubt the resident genius of Romance!<br />So when Angel Wings came in, I thought, opps....the story is set in 1937 and about flying.  Not my cup of tea.  And again Stuart likely smiled, because she has gone bifity-bofity and once again pulled her hat-trick.  Angel Wings is pure Stuart witchcraft and grabs the reader and does not let them go.  Be prepared for another Stuart bad boy that good girls cannot resist!<br />Angela Hogan was engaged to a highflying ace who died trying to set an aviation record in the style of Lucky Lindy.  Now running her air freight cargo business, she is beset with all sorts of problems.  A restless, younger sister who wants to be a movie star, an underhanded competitor who wants to run her out of business, three airplanes needing repairs, and she just fired her pilot and mechanic.  So, when Jack Clancy swaggers into her office, he is both an answer to a prayer and her worst nightmare.  Jack is international playboy, a love `em and leave `em guy who is splashes across the tabloids as often as he makes the news for his daring flying exploits.  A man too bloody handsome for Angela's peace of mind.<br />He and Angela instantly rub each other the wrong way, getting under each other's skins.  Angela needs Jack to see her business does not go under, but the price of keeping him around is going to cost high!  These characters leap off the pages, spellbinder you in the best Stuart magic.  I just could not put it down.<br />Stuart has a fine feel for the period, an eye to historical details.  How things WERE, not as people think they were.  She portrays the male - female roles of the late 30's so well, not updating them the please the audience of today - but giving the readers a time machine ride into the past.<br />It's just does not get any better than this.

With sharp characters, a savvy understanding of their motivations and a strong dose of deep emotions, you have a heady mix, and that is what the Carrington duo delivers.<br />Leah Dubois came from a family of lawyers, but she never found her niche, opting instead to marry and have a child.  Now, life is a day-to-day of just going through the motions, of living to serve the whims of others.  She has fixed her mind, with a grim determination, to reconcile with her ex-husband, basically because he is pushing for it and her 11-year-old daughter wants.<br />But all determination goes out the window, when JT comes back.  JT, the first man she ever loved, actually the only man she ever loved, back when she was in her teens and again a year ago.  Their affair was the straw that broke the camel's back of her loveless marriage.  But then he vanished.<br />JT has always loved Leah, but he's been carrying a dark secret that could make him have to walk away from that love once more.<br />Leah is a very down-to-earth, every day person, facing every day questions and problems, and through it all, she cannot kill the love that has always been there, and JT is making her face that.<br />A quick read, but very well done.	2004-05-09

At the time, that was so painful, I did not notice I cracked open the sternum of my ribcage.  I woke in great pain during the night and had to be rushed to hospital.  The immediately solution was stuff me into a corset to where I could not breath - crushing my ribcage.  Surprisingly, you get \\"sort of\\" used it as the weeks pass, but you really are amazed at the women that lived their whole lives in that fashion.  It's small wonder they swooned!<br />So, recalling how bad it hurt to laugh with a corset, I am eternally grateful that Katie Macalister waited until I was out of the bloody thing to release the Corset Diaries.  Had I read this while trussed up like a turkey, I would have been in serious trouble!  I would so hate to have my demise on Ms. Macalister conscience!  And I fear that would have been the result.  This book is just such a howl.<br />Katie's is a brand of humour that makes one feel good.  It's a special gift.  Her books won't change the world, solve the rain forest problem or go down into the history of literature, but they are sheer fun.  And this one is another special gem from a very talented writer.<br />It's a funny, witty, sexy, Benny Hill - Monty Python bawdy romp.  Some people don't get Brit humour, so they miss all the fun.  Sorry for them.  The rest of us shall delight in this tale of Tessa, a less than stunningly perfect, 39-year-old who takes on the chore of acting the role of Duchess for a week, corset and all.  Frankly, I felt for Tessa when her heart goes pitter-patter over her leading man Max - her \\"Duke\\".  Rapid breaths in steel stays is just dangerous!  Its wickedly sly dialogue charms us as \\"Duchess\\" Tessa adjusts to life as it was over a century ago.  Stocked full of charming characters, it's a delight from start to finish.<br />Katie's brings her special touch to this amusing story.  Still, I am so glad I read it now, instead of four months ago when my brush with a corset left deep impression on me - figuratively and literally!!<br />Keep spinning the magic, and we shall keep laughing!ith a corset left deep impression on me - figuratively and literally!!<br />Keep spinning the magic, and we shall keep laughing!	2004-05-07

Le Chevalier is out to avenge the murder of his wife,<br />and the necklace and Marguerite are pieces in a chess game of revenge.<br />This is Fleming's second book, and her writing style show strong growth, spinning a true book of historical fiction.  It's fast faced, the mystery keeps you involved, her prose showing a polished, assured style of a writer who has arrived.  I hear constantly, from American readers, you cannot find old-style historical fiction any more.  Thanks to gutsy writers like Fleming and the new age of technology with fresh publishers like Publish America offering books that readers WANT, not what they are told they should want, you could find some super reads.

I love droll British humour. If you do not, then skip this book.  If you are looking for some way to brush up your writing, look for something better since this is not for Americans.  Also, please understand, despite her self \\"rant\\" of doing it \\"write\\", she has errors in her books (even on the cover)!  Also, a book on punctuation for Britain is NOT good punctuation book for America.  There are many differences  So, if you snatch up this book and use it to brush up - you might be doing a lot of things very wrong in punctuation.<br />Britain has a \\"Tight Little Island\\" feel, they often do not bother to look at the rest of the world and see their way is not the only way.  This book is a prime example of that.<br />Also, I was dismayed by the writer's obsessing with a comma, to the point of displaying VERY BAD MANNERS.  One should never make fun of shortcomings in other; one should never do it publicly as she claims she does.  It shows a distinct lack of breeding.  Manner should never go out of style.<br />So, if you want a wee giggle and love dry Brit humour, you might enjoy this.  If you want a real book for American usages buy \\"New York Public Library Writer's Guide to Style and Usage\\".	2004-05-02

Poor Julia's way of life is threatened and she sees no hope.  Her husband died nearly two years ago in a drunken motorcycle accident, and since he was at fault, it fell to Julia to see the claim was paid.  She had, but it has put her in a bad situation, falling behind with payment to the bank.  To make matters even more desperate, she loses her job.  So two days before Christmas, she was busy baking a special, family-recipe cake to sell to raise money for her kids' Christmas presents.<br />When handsome, Gregory Harding pulled up in the drive the snowy day before Christmas, it was to serve an eviction notice.  Julia was ready to cry.  After arrogantly serving her with the notice, he turns his car around and proceeds to leave.  Not being careful in the snow, he ends up crashing it.  Julia's forced to take him in to care for him, just as the worst blizzard in 25 years hits.<br />When Greg wakes up, he finds two kids staring at him.  From the minute, three-year-old Emily Rose declares him &quot;Daddy&quot;, his life is never going to be the same.<br />It's a tender tale of the power of belief, in clinging to the traditions of generations of a family, of preserving the past while bravely facing the future.<br />It was turned into a movie with Olivia Newton-John, but I don't think anything can compare to the beautiful prose of Davis.ut I don't think anything can compare to the beautiful prose of Davis.	2004-05-01

So big thumbs up for Creighton on this point.  Her writing is sharp in this mystery.  Joy Lynn Star is convinced something happened to her roommate.

Her brother is out of town when he gets her message, so he gets his friend, Scott, to see Joy gets settled in.  When Joy finds out Scott is a deputy sheriff, she believes fate has stepped in, and pushes Scott to aid her in finding out what happened to the missing woman.<br />Creighton's characters are human, with problems, families and everyday touches that lift them past being two-dimensional paper dolls.	2004-05-01

However, war, its weaponry, is such a core of that the evolutions of warfare and its impact have to be of interest to those really concerned in military actions and their lingering results.  Back when \\"scorched earth policy\\" was carried out by Kings such as Edward Longshanks and Robert the Bruce, they knew the destructive impact on the land could change the face of battle...and life after.  You saw the same application of this, when Sherman made his infamous march to the sea during the American Civil War.<br />The application of these simple principals is only magnified in today's world.  Though this book was written in the early 90s, it's as relevant today as the war in the Middle East lumbers on.  The pollution, the destruction of the environment, is more terrible, as the weapons are continually spiralling in capabilities.  The impact on human life in warfare - soldier and civilian alike - is always horrible, but this book goes beyond, looking at the land, the air, the sea.  The statistic range from offering examples ranging from the devastation of live coral reef to build Pacific runways in WW II to the creation of some 30 million bomb craters in the Vietnam War (!!) are scars left that do not heal in centuries.<br />As a child, I visited the Kentucky River area, listening to the old farmers talking about problems with plowing certain fields.  They discussed how the land had been scared during the American Civil War, because of the troops digging so many trenches in the area.  The Yankees would march so many miles a day, stop, dig trenches for protection to sleep in or fight in, with the Confederates doing the same, day after day for years.  Over a hundred years later, these &quot;scars&quot; from that war still pitted the land.  That was impact of just simple soldiers digging with a simple shoves.  Think of the impact on this earth left by all the wars since.<br />It's well written, thought provoking.hought provoking.	2004-04-29

When Kimberly, discovered she was expecting, Robert suggestion an abortion.  When she refused, Robert came to accept the idea of being a father, until the baby turned out to be a girl.

Why this one is strange sort of a let down. The romance is flat, the story so-so, often too complicated to be \\"real\\". It's a decent read, but just far below JD's usual razzle-dazzle.<br /><br />BEFORE THE BOOK TAKES UP, Jessica Chambers has taken in a \\"drifter\\" with no memory. She called him Joe, let him work on her ranch in Colorado, they fell in love and conceived a baby - though Joe does not know this. He discovers he his identity by seeing his picture on television. It is a Prince of a small country. No longer Joe, he is Prince Lucas Sebastani. And the Prince is no prince. He just walks off leaving Jessica without a farewell or a \\"see you later, Alligator\\".<br /><br />Since he walked off without a care about Jessica, he has no idea she is carrying his child. Sorry, this sets the reader against him with this sour note to this character. This \\"love them and leave them\\" does not win points or hearts. Lucas justifies this in his mind, that he left her to keep the press from descending upon her. Sorry, he cannot call later?

He is very sad about this - gee, what happens when you turn your back on your responsibilities! Months later the baby is found and proven to be his.<br /><br />As the book takes up, now three months later, Jessica is found alive, worse for the wear, and Lucas is flying in to bring her the baby she has never seen and believed dead.

This one was first printed in 1986, and it shows dating, but still holds up rather well. She had a strong pattern in SSE, the woman who had been done wrong and left behind. THE man returns some time later and they have to come to terms with the past. I have all her works, and think she is one of the best writers to rise through SSE ranks. Jackson is a strong, emotional writer and always delivers on that level, but there are a few flaws in this particular one. Still, if you are a Jackson fan, as I am, you will want to read this one.<br />I just found Jackson title a little off her perfect tempo, due to the heroine just accepting the treatment she received 8 years before.  She just accepts he married another, leaving her hanging without word (she could have been pregnant, but he never bothered to find out), then let him right back into her life.  It seemed forced.<br /><br />Savannah Beaumont, rich daughter of a horse breeder, grew up with Travis McCord, loving him first as a child would a brother, later as a woman would a man. Travis declares his love to her - in his mind - (while playing around with lover Melissa). One night when drunk, he gives into his passion for 17-year-old Savannah, promising to come to her later. Instead, she is greeted the next morning with the news that Travis is marrying Melissa. During the next 8 years, she barely sees Travis. He wanted to explain why he was forced to marry Melissa (she tricked him, but then he declares he loved her - sorry that came over a little fickle.  Just like his desertion of Savannah, leaving her a situation that could have become bad without thought). It really causes you like Travis a lot less.  Also, that Savannah's brother-in-law strikes her 9-year-old nephew and everyone just warns him \\"not to do it again\\" shows a dated attitude toward what is and is not acceptable in child abuse.<br /><br />Now Travis is back, demanding Savannah accept his excuses, saying he is going to change everything at the horse farm. Savannah is distressed by the situation. Someone is stealing from the farm, someone is stealing from Travis and he is going to put a stop to it.  It's all clear, no mystery here except to Savannah.<br /><br />You like Savannah, feel for her. But her too easy acceptance of the striking of her nephew (she is angry and fusses a bit, but that is all) and her too easy accepts of the betrayal Travis did to her, undermines Jackson's strong writing.<br /><br />Despite the flaws, Jackson makes you see feel for people that are less than perfect, paints vivid characters (though dated). Considering this work is nearly 20 years old, we can forgive a few bumps in an otherwise good read./><br />Now Travis is back, demanding Savannah accept his excuses, saying he is going to change everything at the horse farm.

Having read Day of Fire by Kathleen Nance and The Legend of Banzai Maguire by Susan Grant, I immediately pre-ordered Shadow Chasers by Liz Maverick, Grant's finale to Dorchester's 2176 series, The Scarlet Empress, and the fifth in the series,The Power of Two by Patti O'Shea.  While I ordered, I noticed I had somehow missed O'Shea's debut book Ravyn's Flight, so I had to have it.  If this is a preview of her style of writing, I cannot wait to get to her book in the 2176 series.  This novel is amazing.  There is such great talent in the Futuristic Romance genre, Robin D. Owen, C.J. Barry, Grant, but these new voices such as Robin T. Popp and Patti O'Shea are sounding they are a force that is here to stay.  I just finished Popp's Too Close To The Sun and she blew me away.  After reading such a great book as that, it's harder to come on the heels and impress me as much.  Yet from page one that is precisely what O'Shea's book did!  It's a strong story with such great female characters, but the males are just as vividly created, formed with such insight and emotion.<br /><br />The main story centers on Ravyn Vedier. She is the communication expert on a team of 20 CAT specials - they go in and investigate if a planet is uninhabitable - or so they believe. They were sent to Jarved Nine, which is strangely like Earth in terrain, air etc. The only thing keeping this planet from being labeled a prime target for human habitation is the Old City. A town built for about 20,000 to 50,000 people, perfect in every way, but no people. When Ravyn visited the Old City, she found it in pristine condition, just as if the people walked off. The intriguing riddle soon takes second place in her mind as she faces mind-bending horror. She is down in the subbasement of the CAT facility, no more than 45 minutes, and returns to find her 19 CAT mates slaughter in a gruesome fashion and grotesquely arrange in the pattern of a flower.<br /><br />Damon Brody and his team of six Special Ops force are on the other side of the Jarved Nine when the distress call comes from the CAT team. They arrive, discovers the slaughter, and fear all are dead. Damon finds a terrified Ravyn covered in blood and hiding in under her bed. He sets his men to secure to building while he tries to get answers out of Ravyn. Damon makes her a cup of tea and finally gets a few shaky replies from her, immediately going on alert when Ravyn insists she did not set off the emergency distress beacon. They rush to find his men, and come upon what Damon fears. His team is slaughtered in the same fashion as the other 19, this time arranged like a lightning bolt. Grabbing what they can carry to survive, they are left on their for three weeks until a military rescue mission is launched to find them. The only place left for protection is the Old City. They have to get there before the killer stalking them runs them to ground. It's their growing to trust of the other, which makes the grueling pace bearable.<br /><br />Colonel Alex Sullivan is Ravyn's stepbrother. He raised her after their parents were killed. He knows something is bad wrong on Jarved Nine and he is determined to lead a team into rescue his sister...if she is still alive. He is satisfied with the members of his team, except the communications expert. Stacey is a CAT member, like his sister; in fact, she is Ravyn's best friend. Alex sees Stacey as a liability to his team. She is non-military. His gut tells him something terrible has occurred on this distant planet and Stacey's not trained to follow orders, not trained to defend herself, so he is going to push her during the weeks long voyage to Jarved Nine, trying to see she stays alive. Stacey has been in love with Alex since she met him at Ravyn's and her graduation years before, so working under the harsh taskmaster is disturbing in more ways that one.<br /><br />The secondary story of Alex and Stacey could make a novel on its own, but under the skillful talent of O'Shea, she weavesboth tales into a breathtaking pace. The world of Jarved Nine is vividly created, the characters achingly real. You will care for Damon and Ravyn, and the secondary Alex and Stacey. She starts with the first couple running for their lives and the second desperately rushing to their rescue, in a breakneck pace for the reader that never lags, never fails to mesmerize.<br /><br />Be warned, this is a book once you pick you won't be able to put down.

Several clich&eacute;s come to mind when I read this book  \\"Oh, what a tangled web we weave....\\" and \\"the Sins of the Father...\\"- though there is nothing clich&eacute;d about the storyline or writing.  However, in this case it's the sins of the mother that has been visited upon the daughter with devastating results. Bethany watched her mother run through a half a dozen marriages and countless affairs, the shallow, desperate woman seeing passion as love. Bethany saw the devastation in the wake, when passion burns out and passing love dies. As a child, it left Bethany deeply scared. While her mother, a frustrated actress, jumps at sham love to fill the emptiness in herself, her daughter learned to believe passion only caused pain. It never lasted.<br /><br />Dylan St. Croix, the black sheep of the powerful St. Croix family, gave her passion, and a child that died. Through that pain, Bethany never saw she loved Dylan, only he gave her that same fiery passion that she so mistrusted. Bethany has spent her whole life wanting to be \\"June Cleaver\\", just wanting peace and security, believing that is the road to happiness. Dylan did not offer her peace and security, but blazing passion, so she turned away from him and married his very proper cousin, Lance. But something went very wrong.<br /><br />Now, Lance is dead and Bethany accused of killing him. She is found dazed, with Lance's blood on her hands, and her very proper, contained world she fought to build is no more. Dylan stands by Bethany, the woman he has always loved, even though he feels her capable of killing Lance. Dylan knows he will be fighting to save Bethany, but most of all he will be fighting Bethany herself to teach her to trust, that there can be passion with love and it can be lasting.<br /><br />Jenna Mills name on the cover guarantees a genuine super read, with intensely power emotions, vivid characters that make you care, and proves this time and again.	2004-04-21

Robin Owen's \\"Heart\\" tales about the distant planet of Celta are some of the best books I have ever read.  Susan Grant seems to have charted this field with her \\"Star\\" series and now pilots the bold \\"2176 series\\" - Grant's conception - (The Legend of Banzai Maguire by Grant; Day of Fire by Kathleen Nance; The Shadow Runners by Liz Maverick; Patti O'Shea's The Power of Two; ending with Grant's The Scarlet Empress).  Catherine Spangler and her great Shielder series keep us coming back for more.  And nipping at their heels is C.J. Barry's amazing fulfilled UN\\"adventures.  So there are some great books burning up the bookracks!<br />But add a new voice to those \\"Stellar\\" Starblazers...Robin T. Popp.  I bought her book sometime back, but in a hurried packing to dash to the other side of the Pond, it was left behind, so I am just now getting to it.  The book is breathtaking!  Seriously!  At times, the tension was just so intense I had to remind myself to breathe!  Okay, maybe a slight exaggeration, but not by much.  \\"Too Close to the Sun\\" is one great book.  Had I known what a powerhouse tale this novel was, I would've bought a second copy and not waiting so long.<br />This book starts off with a frantic pace as galactic smuggler Angel Torrence, finally sees freedom in her grasp.  She has just made the last payment on her nifty space shuttle and now she is her own boss.  The last eight years she's been on the<br />run from the ruler of planet Coronado - her tyrant grandfather, so she is looking forward to this.  But no sooner has she taken that first breath as owner, she watches in horror as raiders blow her ship.  In the carnage of the attack, she \\"borrows\\" a spaceship Icarus to escape.  Only this is no ordinary craft, in the computer system is the life-essence of Commander Nicoli Romanof.  He has separated it from his body, allowed that body to be captured by the dread Harvesters.  His intent is to retake his body and put an end their operation of stealing and black-marketing bodies and body parts.  Only he needs a top ace pilot to make sure he gets there, so he can bring the two parts of himself together and end the Harvesters operations.  While Angel is one of the best pilots, she has a problem with taking orders and Nicoli refuses to put a female in harms way.<br />That much of an adventure would be enough for a single book alone and would dazzle us, but it's just the start of this amazing adventure.  Nicoli and Angel are vividly conjured; they just steal your heart.  The futuristic world is brilliantly realised under the gifted talent of Popp.  If you delight in Futuristic Romances, you MUST read this one.  You will kick yourself if you don't!

I used to read Harlequin/Silhouette romances regularly.  There were some powerhouse authors coming from these series line, then they moved on to full size books. I like to read before I fall asleep and they are the perfect size and distraction. However, I stopped for a period because of the pedestrian merchandising of the Publishers - there are only so many babies and cowboys you can take each month! I drew the line when they had seven titles bearing baby or cowboy in eight of the releases for one series that month (one line had both!). The writers were uninspired, so the readers were being shortchanged.<br /><br />Then a few fresh voices started to turn that around, Julie Leto and Tori Carrington for Blaze are two names that shine in these lines, and without doubt, Jenna Mills is for Silhouette Intimate Moments.  Her talent blew me away with her first book I grabbed on a dash through the airport. It was so polished, so full of strong emotions. She does more in 100 pages than most writers do in 300! Each time I start a new novel by her, I tell myself not to expect too much, that surely one of these days they will not live up to her previous works. And EVERY TIME, I find not only does she match the quality, she pushes the limit.  So provokes, conjures and mesmerizes me as few writers do.<br /><br />\\"Smoke and Mirrors\\" is another of her amazing tales - amazing to believe this is her first book.  It's hard to rank her books because each one is top drawer, but I think this one is likely a favourite along with her \\"Shock Waves\\".<br /><br />This is a dark, sexy, steamy tale of people living behind masks. Cassidy Blake is a top Chicago cop working undercover trying to bring down Derek Mansfield. Suspicions are that Derek uses his ultra-rich hotel to distribute drugs to Chicago's elite. She has been on the case for six months and so far turned up nothing.  Time is running out.<br /><br />Everything changes when Derek returns from Scotland. Cass is not prepared for the man, not prepared how he quickly pulls her into a situation over her head. Derek is playing games, too, but not with Cass. He knows it's dangerous to let her near, but he cannot seem to stay away from the sexy, sassy lass.  Each faces the other from behind a mask, but neither are able to hide the real person that feels more than they should. They are playing with fire and both are bound to get burned.<br /><br />It's a cat and mouse games that builds to a pulse-pounding climax showing Jenna Mills is a talent above the rest.  The romance between these two sizzles and pops with the crackle of lightning before a summer storm.  It's just as good as it gets.not prepared how he quickly pulls her into a situation over her head.

Dorchester is trying a wee bit different line and applause is due for giving some of their best writers a new path to blaze.<br />I truly enjoyed this book, it's exciting, it's original, but have concerns many Romance Readers will be puzzled a bit, until they catch the meter.  The Hero in the book shows up only sporadically until the last third, but if you know that going in, you can sit back and enjoy this roller-coaster ride.<br />Bree \\"Bonzai\\" Maguire is a pilot on UN Peacekeeping force in the year 2006.

But money does not buy you love, and Aaron learns this the hard way when he finds out he is dying.  He does not want to face that alone, so he reached out to his ex-wife and daughters.  Only, he is not too happy with how his daughters turned out, so he is planning to make radical changes for his remaining life and theirs.<br />First daughter, Robin has been working in middle management of the shipping firm for years, but was more concerned with her rich girl social life.  Suddenly, daddy wants her to take over the firm and she has ex-boyfriend, Evan, reporting to daddy-dearest on her.  Evan would like her back in his life, and Daddy has given him the pat on his back.  However, Robin has a few ideas of her own.  Daddy may push and shove, but he cannot control her completely.  Especially, since Aaron has hired the house to be redone by Jake Manning, who is a 10!<br />Jake is delighted with well paying job from Aaron, but not too happy with the interest of Robin.  He is poor lad struggling to make a better life for himself and his teen-age nephew and fears party-girl Robin spells bad news for him.<br />However, Robin prevails in the end and shows the material girl has a lot of &quot;material&quot; inside.  This was a super start to the series, and book two &quot;Beauty Queen&quot; is as delightful.  They are &quot;real&quot; people, with good and bad in them, and yet manage to triumph.  Looking forward to book three!	2004-04-14

But this one was even better.<br />The sisters are trying to hold their family out of poverty by running a matchmaking service in 19th London, while producing a strongly suffragist scandal sheet called &quot;The Mayfair Lady&quot;.  Sister Prudence must retain Sir Gideon Malvern when the paper is sued for libel.  Of course Gideon and Prudence immediately set sparks off each other, but he feels his romantic suit will come to cropper because the civil suit is hopeless.  Prudence cannot pay his solicitor's fees, so she talked Gideon in to accept the matchmaking services instead.  Of course, romance will ensue!<br />It's amusing, witty and utterly delightful.  Refreshing period for hitorical romance going against the long (and ridiculous) thought that this more &quot;modern&quot; historical turns off readers.	2004-04-10

I know the series books often does not allow room for true fleshing out of plots and characters, but you only have to look to Jenna Mills to see it can be done and done well.<br />The premise seems \\"shaky\\" and really becomes unbelievable at points, undermining the whole effort.  Set in New Zealand, I was glad to see a Non-US story line.  However, the write just asks the reader to suspend credibility and asks you to accept things because she says they are.<br />It opens with Maria going to a big party to make some sort of denouement against the creep she \\"feels\\" is stalking her.  Off the bat, it does a disservice to the real crime of stalking.  When Maria talks about being stalked, it's the guy is always looking at her, half the time she \\"FEELS\\" him around.  Makes one begin to wonder if Maria is tightly wrapped or not.  Stalking is a serious problem and to see it handing in this fashion is not points in the writer's favour.<br />At the party, she meets Franc.  He is a son of a crooked cop who killed himself.  He immediately comes on to Maria, whom he rates as a \\"goddess\\".  We are told this so many times over in several pages you really want to scream - YES, WE KNOW!  We also learn when Maria was 17 she was kidnapped and she fortunately remembers nothing of her past because of it.<br />This makes Maria seems like a perpetually victim, if not very unreliable mentally.  The whole premise just does not work, and leaves the reader unable to believe these characters are real.	2004-04-10

That is the question Julie Kenner asks and answers in Harlequin Temptation #969.  It's a very sweet, engaging read.  Too quick as most Temptations are, so character development just does not have the chance to really flesh out the characters and true conflict.<br />In a long length, it could have really been a powerful book.  But that is Temptations.  Quickie reads.  I can read them in an hour, so no matter how good they are, I feel like I have \\"eaten Chinese\\"; they are satisfying, but leave you hungry for more.  Kenner makes the best of the format with engaging characters.<br />Melissa Tanner was raised by her grandfather.  The elder Tanner is a dashing may even in his twilight years.  Once a bit-actor in many Hollywood films, he was in love with the starlet from the period, Emily Radley.  However, the studio pressured Emily not to drag her career down by marrying him.  Both married, both are now widowed, both have grandchildren they want to see settled.  So Emily plots a meeting between her grandson, Kyle and Gregory's granddaughter, Melissa.  During his younger years, Gregory was a small time cat burglar, and he passed on<br />his skill to Melissa.  However, she has turned over a new leaf, wanting to go straight.  She is stuck finding a job, it's her birthday and life is looking rather bleak with the tax man practically knocking on the door.<br />Kyle has retired 10 years ago, and now runs a high tech security agency, which is under siege.  Getting involved with any woman is not high on his list of priorities, and when that woman is a thief it's double double toil and trouble.  Only, this thief was putting something BACK!  Sparks fly and they are soon following the route character by them.<br />The characters are charming, so are Gregory and Emily.  The plot is developed as well as the very limited length permits, but it causes the secondary plot of the mystery to see so obvious that is undermines this.  Still, Kenner's writing is sharp, she has good control of her \\"voice\\", just wish Harlequin would give their writers about 25 more pages.  I think both writers and readers would appreciate a strong foundation to this line.

I believe I heard rumours of a crippling writers-block. Well, the dam must have broken, but because she is back and better than ever! This is one of THE MUST-READS of this Spring. The book is a marvellous tour de force for the returning author and sure will quickly win back old fans and make new!<br /><br />I love heroes that are alpha (strong, dominant personalities), but the more complex, dark ones are the Gamma rogues - the males that are outside of society, that chew up the Alpha males and spit them out as a pastime, men in the genius Anne Stuart's Bad Bad Boys vein. Stuart is the Queen of the dark and deadly male, but Kinsale is shaking the leg of throne with Allegreto. He is a brilliant creation that leaps off the pages. A trained assassin, he is determined to regain his rightful place in the Italian Principality of Monteverde - and he does not care what he has to do to achieve his aim or whom he uses. And in reaching his goal, he sees Lady Elena, the lost Monteverde Princess as the perfect pawn, thus sealing her fate.<br /><br />Elena is returning to Monteverde, betrothed to the man now running Monteverde. Her ship is overtaken and captured by pirates - lead by none other than Allegreto. She is first his prison, then later forced to wed him. Captive, lover, wife, Elena is naturally furious, as he is a hard man, nearly cruel, but flashes of moments when he displays a tenderness toward her begins to cause her to look part the killer veneer and see the man - the real man there - a man driven.<br /><br />Take a killer and making him a hero is, as they say, \\"a hard row to hoe\\". Anne Stuart did it in her brilliant \\"Moonrise\\", a book that haunts me years after putting it down. Kinsale now does it with \\"Shadow Heart\\". It is amazing the craft and magic both writers breathe into these hardened men, yet make the women love them for what they are - just as the readers will.<br /><br />Kinsale's love for this story shines, and like a master storyteller of old around the fireside, she weaves a tale that mesmerises, compels and leaves you breathless.<br /><br />You may want to buy three copies of this book - 1) to read more than once 2) to give to your best friend - she will love you for it and 3) to put on your keeper shelf and treasure!!ke a master storyteller of old around the fireside, she weaves a tale that mesmerises, compels and leaves you breathless.<br /><br />You may want to buy three copies of this book - 1) to read more than once 2) to give to your best friend - she will love you for it and 3) to put on your keeper shelf and treasure!!	2004-04-06

I really enjoyed Sebastian's story, but Morgan is a much more complex character, much more the Gamma rogue.  Morgan's mother took him from his father and returned to Geneva and it was not until he was 13 that his father's people found him again.  Even then, since Sebastian was the heir to a Barony, it was thought best Morgan stay away from his brother.  So from being a thief just to stay alive in Geneva, to later educated and given a Midshipman entry into the Royal Navy, Morgan remains apart.  This is further amplified when he falls into the hands of The Pirate Lord, though he later is absolved of the charges.  Back in England, Lord Ravenswood has set him to trying to expose The Specter, a mastermind behind crime in London's slums.  He is set up in a building, his pirate rep put about, and he claims he is a fence for stolen goods all as part of a trap.<br />Only, problems immediately arrive in the lovely form of Lady Clara Stanbourne.  Poor Lass is a Stanbourne, know reformers, so she runs a Reform school for children pickpockets, trying to teach them a profession so they can better themselves.  However, her mother was a Doggett, and while they are great reformers as well, they were also a wee bit wicked.  Thus far, Clara has managed to avoid the curse of her Doggett blood, but when faced with Morgan Pryce, she is in for a bumpy road.  She at first provokes him, then tries to bribe him to move locations, but slowly but surely is drawn to him with all the riddles he presents.<br />It's a charming tale, with Morgan and Clara vivid fun, sexy characters.  This writer just gets better with every book.	2004-04-04

Since Harlequin Historical slashed the length of their books, their stories really suffer.  It's hard to develop strong characters and exciting plotlines with the really mini-book length.  Shame on Harlequin since they are charging big book prices, too!<br />However, I must say Cree gave a very gentle, old fashion style romantic suspense.  Lady Julia Carrington's husband worked as a spy for the Brits.  When he was killed three years before, she was told it had nothing to do with his work, but was a simple robbery.  She never truly accepted the verdict, because they only thing they took was a special ring she had given him.  Therefore, she is upset when a former comrade of her husband's sends word the ring has finally turned up on the hand of Nicholas Chandler, Viscount Thayne.  She is so disturbed she arranges to play cards with him trying to win information.  Only, she finds him in a lousy mood, so she falls to play B - kidnaps him.  Her abduction is foiled when men paid to act as Highwaymen tried to steal the ring.  Julia pulls a pistol and Thayne jumps before her to save her from being shot.<br />She takes him home and nurses him, but soon wishes Thayne gone because she feels an attraction to him.  To cover for her tending Thayne, she is sent to London, but there she is determined to press the issue of the ring.  Someone is resolute in getting the ring back.  Julia is pushed in the path of carriages; Thayne is knocked out when trying to find out information about the ring.  Thayne is asking questions about Julia's husband's murder and someone wants it stopped.<br />Julia's neighbour Lord George is determined to put the cat in the pigeons by starting enough gossip about Thayne and Julia to force an engagement.  But is this merely wanting to win a wager or was he somehow involved with Carrington's murder?  Could it be his older brother behind the man's death?  As the riddle of who wants the ring and why gets deeper and deeper, you are pulled along wondering how the &quot;mysterious Mary&quot; from Thayne's past got hold of a ring belonging to a dead man and gave it to Thayne as a gift before her own death.<br />Enough riddles to keep you off balance and wondering.

This is the second in the series, and we met Christian in Girls Guide and drooled over him and, so we were delighted to hear Katie was penning his tale (along with dozens of other works - the lady is prolific!).<br />The good news, not only Christian is back and sexier than ever, the book, amazingly even more compelling that Girls Guide.  I really enjoyed the first one, but this book hooks you from the start and keeps you flipping pages and ignoring Aragorn on telly! Katie gives us another of her totally ditzy characters in the \\"Queen of the First Person rants\\" with Allie.  She is a woman that once was in an abusive relationship, but now is determined to be her own woman, and that includes her new profession as a Summoner - a person who summons ghosts.  Problem is once she summons them she cannot sends them away.  She is gathering material for the United Psychical Research Association, and she is out to prove to her boss, Anton Melrose, III, she is neither a crackpot nor a never-beens.  So when she summons a ghost cat, she is thrilled.  Just afters, she has an odd dream of seeing a man on a table in a dark basement.  In the dream, there are cuts all over him, he is bleeding, and he says only she can heal him.<br />Dreams intrude on reality when the very next day she goes into a basement of a building she is investigating and finds just that - a man on the table bleeding.  After exchanging a few words with him, she runs for the police.  When they return, the room is empty and there is no trace of the handsome man.  Odd-eyed Allie (think David Bowie blue eye-brown eye), goes to a bookstore the next day to get a copy of a vampire book autographed for a friend, and find out the author of the book is Christian Dante, and he is the man in the basement.<br />It's wildly kooky, sexy, Christian is to die for and Allie is a sweet endearing nut.

In &#8220;Traveler&#8221;, the Goblins were in rule of Detroit, but then, no one really missed Detroit, so the Lutine threat was not taken seriously.  But then they moved in on Las Vegas in &#8220;The Outsider&#8221;, and people started to get grumpy.  Only now, they have taken hold of the Big Easy.  Oh, my!  What will happen to Mardi; are the Crewes loaded with Goblins in drag?  And what about a &#8220;Poor Boy&#8221;...are the ingredients still oysters?  Will Preservation Hall still play Dixieland?  Are Al Hirt and Pete Fountain really goblins?<br />Well, Melanie is not content with have King Quede a Goblin king rule New Orleans...this Goblin is also a vampire!  Where is Peter Cushing when you need him!  Worse, Half-Sylph Lyris has been given evidence to prove Quede and the Goblins were behind the Kennedy Assassination and the Lyndon Johnson was replaced with a goblin replicant, which means the Goblins had been in the White House for ages!  Lyris cannot let this go, and must travel to New Orleans to beard the orchid-crazy Vampire-Goblin on his home turf.<br />Romeo Hart has been sent to New Orleans to suss out how bad the Goblin infestation is, and works as a stripper at a French Quarter bar, to keep an eye on the situation.  Lyris team up with Romeo to lure Quede out into open and it's a sultry goblin chase all the way!<br />Romeo and Lyris are another pair of Melanie's vivid creations, and will keep you turning page after page, unable to put the book down.<br />Look for the fourth in the Goblin series come September called \\"STILL LIFE\\".  Keep them coming!!  They are a breath of fresh air and a loving tribute to ancient lore!in series come September called \\"STILL LIFE\\".  Keep them coming!!

After Jayne Ann's last three efforts under her Krentz name and Quick penname, I was in despair.  She is one of my favourite writers, but she had lost of heart, I feared.  The books spent more time talking about food than romance, and her leads were tediously boring.  In her aim to sell mainstream, she is killing her decades-long, devout romance fans with books that lack ROMANCE.  Jayne needs to take time go back and read her own books such as \\"Wildest Hearts\\", \\"Family Man\\", and \\"Absolutely Positively\\", to get &quot;the mind scent back&quot;, find her roots.<br />That said, this was - to me - was a &quot;make or break&quot; book.  If she did not come up with the old magic, I would likely move on to spend my monies on writers that are delivering.  Well, I am SO DELIGHTED to say this book has the old Jayne Ann magic.  And I hope this book is received better than the other &quot;Harmony Books&quot;.  I adored them all and see the JAK dazzle in there.  It is in her off-world books \\"Amaryllis\\", \\"Orchard\\", \\"Zinnia\\" and \\"After Dark\\", where you can still find the old JAK magic that pulls at the heart, that makes you smile.  These books were not well-accepted, because she was AHEAD of the pack.  Futuristic books with J. D. Robb, Robin D. Owens, C. J. Barry - and the new Dorchester line coming with Susan Grant and Kathleen Nance's books kicking it off - are selling like hotcakes, showing off-world books are the cutting edge.  Meaning everyone else is JUST NOW catching up with JAK.<br />In this long awaited sequel to \\"After Dark\\" (2000), where we first met Emmett London and Lydia Smith, we pick up their lives a month after the pair had their last adventure.  They have moved in together, with Emmett hoping to work Lydia into a Covenant Marriage, but fears Lydia's experience in the Alien Underground has permanently set her against &quot;ghost-hunters&quot; - people with the talent to channel and control the residual energy left behind by the race that once lived on New Harmony.  And since Emmett is one of the best ghost-hunters, he fears this could tip their relationship into shattering.  Worse, the head of the Guild - (union/government) for the ghost-hunters - has been wounded and Emmett has to step into his place to keep things running smooth.<br />Lydia is not happy with the limelight that is hitting Emmett as the new guild boss.  especially not thrilled the press is dragging out the fact Emmett was engaged to marry the Guild's Boss wife.  This prompts her to push Emmett into a MC - Marriage of Convenience - to protect him.  Emmett is thrilled for he sees this as a chance to convince Lydia into making it a Covenant Marriage.<br />It has all the JAK special characters, the romance, the adventure that marks her best works.  After being so disappointed by her last three books - and I am hoping this is a new streak starting for JAK that show she can &quot;rez&quot; them ghosts and fascinate us as she has for so long.  It can be read alone, but you really should read \\"After Dark\\" to fully appreciate the fun.  In fact, I suggest reading \\"Amarylliss\\", \\"Zinnia\\" and `Orchid\\", too!  See JAK at her best!<br />Great Return to Harmony - just don't make it so long before the next visit, Jayne Ann, because this is where you are shining!And since Emmett is one of the best ghost-hunters, he fears this could tip their relationship into shattering.

In ordered to save Risa's mother, her father has made a pack with an evil sorcerer named Euberacon. As her father turns after suitor away suitor for Risa's hand, she grows suspicious of this and demands to know why. Her father finally confesses in order to prevent her mother's death, Risa was promised to Euberacon.<br />Trying to escape this horrid fate, by Euberacon pursues her killing her escort. Just as Risa fears all is lost, Sir Gawain rides to her rescued driven the evil sorcerer away - temporarily. Sir Gawain was returning to Camelot to warn Arthur of treachery afoot, and learns the source of evil threatening his king, is the same that is threatening Risa. So he carries her to Camelot to safety - or so he thought. Euberacon finds Risa and carries her away.<br />Just as Sir Gawain set off to find his lady, the Green Knight Challenges him, and he must put off saving Risa, while it accepts the gauntlet tossed by the Green Knight.<br />Obviously, this is based on the poem &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight written an anonymous contemporary of Geoffrey Chaucer during the 14th Century. However, Zettel weaves a marvelous blend of fantasy, romance and Grail adventure that will please fans of Grail fiction.	2004-02-23

This book shows some promise, the fantasy elements of magical tale are very imaginative, the storyline well through out.  However, it was jarring to have this very near \\"faerytale story\\" slip into graphic sexual encounters between Ronin and Kalial.  It put me in mind of two different writers penning this, so \\"different\\" the two parts of the books were, and how they undermined the other.  This tends to take the reader of \\"out the flow\\" of the prose, as if Snow White wanders into Ellora's Cave.  This book will please some; others will likely be very upset by this dual nature of the tale and the bit too graphic sex.  One needs to recall in writing \\"Romance\\" to leave the romance in.<br />Ronin is the only survivor of an attack on his family by evil Serpent, and flees into the forest with a tapestry that is a key to a legendary treasure.  Kalial is the princess of the forest, so when she and her men see Ronin enter their realm they attack him.  However, it is Ronin who ends up taking Kalial hostage.  They soon feel attraction, despite Robin thinking Kalial is a boy.  The Serpent pursues them through a serious of adventures and misadventures, even and ocean voyage.<br />Since this is a debut novel for the author, I see great potential in her skill, and the strong faerytale quality of her writing.  Just hope she learns to tone down the portions of this book that works against it, and learn that sex is NOT romance.	2004-02-23

Some days it just does not pay to be a God!<br />At least, so it seems to Darius, son of Zeus, God of the Gemstones.  Darius, a bit of a lover, was known for all his dalliances with married ladies and it is that, which trips the old boy up.  Darius' &quot;gift&quot; was his ability to turn himself into a statue... which comes in handy when he is playing footsie with Queen Aara in her bedroom.  When King baby pops in startling them, Darius goes into his statue routine to protect the Queen from her jealous husband.  Only, the King thinks there is something rotten in Denmark...oops wrong local... something wrong with his wife's statue...so he chops off a part of Darius of which he is rather &quot;fond&quot; and then pushes Darius the stoneman out the window, smashing him to pieces.  Patsy Cline's song kept popping into my mind as I read this!  Daddy Dearest, Zeus, is not happy with the fate of his son, so curses him to remain bodiless, until he can find the perfect statue to possess and once more grant him the ability to return to mortal form.  Well, artistic talent must have been sadly lacking, for it was three millenniums before Darius gets a second chance at breathing.  Fortunately, for Darius, fate brings Alexandra de Marco his way.<br />Alexandra is a brilliant sculptor.  She and her sister were orphaned when they were very young, and now she is facing the task of saving the orphanage where they grew up from being closed because of a lack of money.  She comes across the history of our boy Darius, God of the Gemstone, and the tale of his marble statue, which had been shattered to pieces.  She is so taken with the myth that she turns her talents into creating a statue of the most beautiful man she can, lovingly bringing the marble into the perfect form under her talent.  She plans to auction off the brilliant work at the Ladies' Annual Charity Auction and donate the money to the orphanage.  It would save the place that sheltered her as a child, while at the same time, be a great PR showcase for her talent.<br />Only, Darius finally has the means to return to mortal form, little knowing about charities or Ladies Clubs, and he does so right before the stunned audience.  While Alexandra is impressed with her creation, she can hardly auction HIM off - though a few might have other ideas...lol.  She is furious because she needs that statue to save the orphanage.  Darius doesn't give a fig...mainly, because the statue was in the old Greek style - au natural.  But the fun begins as Darius finds life in the modern world is a long way from Mt. Olympus.<br />The writing is witty, quirky and the author shows a deft pen in crafting this wickedly funny tale.  So original!!

There is something amazing about finding an artifact, touching the distance past - well there is nothing like it.  But you need basics. History needs handling with respect.<br />Most archaeology books are geared to those familiar with all the techniques and terms, they are too complex or boring to the layman, but this book is exactly the opposite.  A thorough work (if they sold it by weight alone, it would be a steal!!).  There is little this book does not cover, such as different type of surveys, excavating, how to analyse these steps, making sense of the data.  They cover threats to historical sites today, how to use the space and set up of on a dig, the art, the dwellings, what the people lived on...well, I could go on and on; if you need to know it, it's here.<br />It's presented in a crisp, logical fashion with oodles of diagrams and photographs, and in easy to follow language. I just cannot recommend this highly enough for true history buffs that want to leave that armchair and get involved in our heritage.

A worm of a Colonel makes some really weak decisions with far-reaching repercussions for the Indians.<br />Maggie Bankhead came to the reservation to teach the Indians English.  She has a deep respect for the Comanche, which soon earns the approval of Shanaco.  Joining together, they fight for the rights of his people.  But there is all sorts of lover of the Comanche - and different types of love - as Maggie soon discovers when the Colonel's daughter tries to make time with Shanaco.  But he rejects her, making a bitter and spiteful enemy of her.<br />Ryan crafts a strong story that keeps the reader turning pages - even when that reader was originally expecting a braw Scots lad in the Highlands.  Ah, a change of pace is always welcome.	2004-01-30

In this sequel to &quot;Kiss Me Quick&quot; (March 2003), we see many of the same characters back. Set in early 1800's London - Lady Francessa Epping had been in love with the Honourable Brixton Smythe-Medway since they were children. He's remained resistant, not wanting to lose his freedom - and not in a polite way. He has wagered he would never marry before age 50, and he would never ever consider marrying Fanny because she is too quiet and sweet - BORING and BLAND. Fanny cannot help but hear of his wager; the scandal is circulating through the Ton. But instead of being hurt, she kisses him before everyone, and declares she can break his heart within six week. Fanny keeps telling herself that she is only doing this for revenge.<br />Both their families are NOT happy by this public battle of wills. Fanny is forced to leave her brother's home because of it. Brix must face his face over the disgrace, and later, he is challenged to a duel by Fanny's brother for the insult to her honour.<br />It is humorous, with sparkling dialogue. Another of Moore's deft works.	2004-01-28

Very refreshing tale in her Ganymede series.<br />Bythe was born in the year 2310, where nearly everything - including life - is indestructible.  The people live on and on and on, so they grow bored and bored lead to extreme depression - except in Casper, Wyoming where Blythe was been \\"exiled\\" to do her job.  A job that included reading her client's feelings and doing what she needs to make him happy - just sex it outside the limits.  She crossed that limit in her previous assignment - hence the banishing to Casper.<br />In order to prove she is worthy to get out of Happyville, USA, she has taken on a new assignment - A working vacation (immediately superior tagging along to report on her).  She and her boss book a vacation back in history - 1785 Scotland to be precise to Castle MacKenzie (HUM - Miss Bangs please note ;-) that is SMALL k not large K!! when the person is a Scot ) through Ganymede tours.  We learn Ganymede and his companion - an oversexed spirit Sparkle Stardust there to make trouble.  He commands to Sparkle appear in cat form to help with his plans.  Ganymede has booked the tour into the castle thinking it's empty.  Everyone soon learns there is one Darach MacKenzie, owner - for several centuries - of the castle.  He wants the tour gone, so Ganymede plans to kill the vampire for control of the Castle.<br />Bythe is attracted to Darach, though she is not sure about liking a vampire.

I read Nina Bangs books out of order of their release, but does not matter, she is one of the freshest voice with TT to come along in Romance in a Decade.  I just finished her newest release devilishly wicked vampire romance &quot;Master of Ecstasy&quot;, which shows her voice and style has developed more - to be expected - this her first book showed the diamond in the rough.<br />In this book she had time-travelling lovers - but both from different times (a theme she echoed in the vampire book with many of the same characters like Ganymede and Sugar Sparkle at the core of them.).  He is from the 1700's and she is from the year 2300.  The come together in the year 2000, sort of neutral ground so to speak.<br />Ganymede, is a mischief-maker, actually a misery maker.  He loves to bring people together just to make them fall in love, then he sets about to destroy their lives.  Sigh, such is the life of a mischief-maker!  The two lovers come together under mistaken impressions:  he thinks he's been sent to atone for his sins by teaching the ultimate virgin the joys of lovemaking, while she believes she has been sent to take him back as a love slave to save mankind in the future.  Talk about culture clash!<br />It's wickedly funny, bright and a breath of fresh air.  So if you are snatching up &quot;Master of Ecstasy&quot; and have not read this, you might want to grab it as well, since it's in the same series.	2004-01-21

Books	5	3	3	N	N	Dreams do come true...if you only believe enough	Dreams and Heroes - they are very important things in the development and growth of young girls.  Sometimes we out grow dreams, such as marrying a Prince from a faerytale kingdom.  Yet, they are what drives us to try harder, to work, to doing something special...of making that visions become a reality.<br />Writing to me was a key to magic, so when I see someone else discover that same gift, it's special.  Even more special, when a whole family is so behind a child, seeing she has the opportunity to realize her cherished goals.  Soccer Dreams: My True Adventure Following the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team, as a Fan and 12-Year Old Junior Reporter for the St. Petersburg Times During the History-Making 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup!  by Leah Lauber, is just that - a girl's dream, her discovering of her budding talents and the love surrounding her, helping her to achieve her wishes.<br />Leah Lauber's true adventure began with her love of Soccer.  Naturally, when you are involved seriously in a sport, you follow it in other venues, such as fan of a pro team or maybe have dreams of becoming an Olympic contender one day.  Leah was not content to sit back and dream of maybe \\"one day\\"; she wanted to experience the thrill now.  Obviously, with 12-year-old age limiting what she could achieve in the immediately future, she looked for another avenue to be involved.  Discovering that magic key - Words - she began a wonderful journey following the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team, as a fan, but more importantly as a Junior Reporter for the St. Petersburg (FL) Times, while the Team prepared for, and ultimately wins, the history-making 1999 Women's World Cup!<br />Leah did a great portion of the photos, with addition help from an unsuspecting father.  I am sure when he caught on to where she was heading he was one proud daddy!<br />It's a book that works on many levels.  A great showcase for what a determined kid can do; a family experience, one of love, support and sharing; of the self-discovery Leah made finding out just what she can do when dreams; and the thrill of sharing the excitement of the U.S. Team making that historic win of the World Cup!  Great for Soccer fans, obviously, but more importantly, great for dreamers and those with the power to make the dreams come true....if they only believe.<br />Way to go Leah!the self-discovery Leah made finding out just what she can do when dreams; and the thrill of sharing the excitement of the U.S. Team making that historic win of the World Cup!

Krentz/Quick is one writer I keep and generally buy in hardback, and will even reread them.  But I am, once again, sadly disappointed in her #2 and #3 in her trilogies.  I know the publishers of today are pushing for trilogies and series, trying to keep readers hooked for more sales.  But frankly, they are causing people to grumble, and with good reason, maybe even driving the very fans away with this trend.  Jayne Ann - I love you work, but you REALLY NEED to listen to your fans.  Your Trilogies are NOT holding up.  You give us a SUPER first books, the paler, weaker second and third in the series.  You see the same complaint, so-so mysteries with the leads and their romance taking a backseat to too busy story lines.  And I see a lot of fans saying NO more.  I really hate to see this happening to such a talented writer.<br />I REALLY wanted to love this book.  It's a nice read.  But I recommend it for Quick/Krentz devoted fans only, and then, I would suggest waiting for paperback or picking it up at the library.  Disappoint hurts less when you don't pay as much!<br />Lavinia and Tobias from &quot;Slightly Shady&quot; and &quot;Don't Look Back&quot; put in their third - and hopefully last - appearance in a so-so mystery, along with her niece, Emeline, and his brother-in-law, Anthony.  Lavinia has finally given up on seeing her niece married &quot;properly&quot;, though Tobias has not given up on marriage to Lavinia.  Tobias accompanies Lavinia to the county to Beaumont Castle, home of Lord Beaumont.  Seems they never have any time alone for lovemaking.  (Hum, poor Lavinia and Tobias cannot have time alone?  TRY getting MARRIED, then they could see each other every night!!).  Sorry, it's just an example of really THIN plot line.  Tobias' promise of romance, maybe leading to marriage proposal, nearly comes to cropper by the entrance of Aspasia Gray, back into Tobias' life.  She hires him to investigate threats against her, but she wants more than just his investigative skills.  Any chance of a romantic weekend is ruined when Lavinia catches him in the arms of Aspasia.  Tobias chases after Lavinia to explain, but while they are arguing their host, Lord Beaumont, goes sailing past Lavinia's window.  No one believes it is was murder, so it is up to Lavinia and Tobias to get to the bottom the mystery.<br />Anthony and Emeline's flirtatious romance is rattle by the arrival of Anthony's half-brother, Dominic Hood (hinting there may be more in the series).

This is one of her best.  I really loved the \\"The Wolf of Haskell Hall\\" \\"The Gentle Beast\\" and \\"Heaven's Rogue\\".  She is deft at creating very vivid characters and giving you a well-paced story that keeps you turning page after page, unable to put the book down.<br />Loosely tied to the wonderful \\"The Wolf of Haskell Hall\\", she paints her tale with the same atmospheric elements in the true Gothic style.  Set in the period that spawn Jack the Ripper, Angelina Blythe Corbett travels to England for answer to questions that have haunted her since childhood, questions concerning her mother's death.  She is a research scientist, hoping to convince her Uncle to permit her to assist in his work with blood chemistry.  But she is forced to come to terms with things outside the laws of science, things related to her heritage.  She finds herself swept up in bizarre events, trapping her between an evil killer of ancient origins - a vampire - and the last in the line of vampire killers.<br />A serial killer is terrorizing the country, murdering young beautiful women of lower class, and rumours are spreading the victims were left drained of all blood.  After meeting Shelly Holmes (the character from \\"The Wolf of Haskell Hall\\" and clearly a loving tribute to Sherlock Holmes), they both begin to wonder if there might be a real vampire is a loose in Merry Ole England.<br />She also meets The Earl of Tremayne, neighbor to her uncle, when she visits her mother's grave.  He is a wickedly handsome rogue, the type to make the ladies sigh.  Angel is attracted to him, feels instantly they are fated to be together.  However, is he merely bewitchingly attractive or does he have a bit more \\"bite\\" to him than the usual bloke?  Her love for the Earl soon casts Angel as the pawn in the battle of titan vampires - one good and one evil.<br />The writing and the characters are so fresh, so original, making this her best book so far and one that should thrill vampire fans!<br />Hope this is the first in a series for the Legacy!and one that should thrill vampire fans!<br />Hope this is the first in a series for the Legacy!	2004-01-11

Recently, Mark Blackburn, the son of this author, contacted me concerning three books his father wrote.  My main focus of interest in history was medieval Scotland and England, with a secondary interest in the War Between the States of the US.  Hand me a book on either topic and I am in history maven's haven.  Mention WWII - I know the period - but it held a lesser interest to me, so purchases books on the era generally takes second seat.  However, Mark interested me in his father's books; they sounded so rich with detail, being a first person account.  I was lucky to locate copies of all three books.  I truly thank Mark for pointing me in their directions.<br />I always loved the works of Bruce Catton on the US Civil War, because they were not dates and stale history; he was the master conductor for a time machine.  When you read his works, you were there!  Few historical writers really reach that depth, and yet still make the history so vital and alive.<br />I must say George Blackburn is in that league.  I am just sorry he stopped writing at these three works; he is a great talent.  They came in, and frankly, I was backlogged with review requests so I figured it would be weeks before I could get to them.  I picked up this one, just to read a bit to get a feel for his style of writing.  FOUR HOURS later, I returned to present day and was shocked so much time had passed.  Never have I seen anyone make WWII so alive and accessible...you are there.  But it's not just in that time travel feel, where you forget you are reading and experience it - it's his observations that are so incisive that go way beyond other historians of the period.  It's it so easy to stand back and be an \\"armchair general\\", point fingers and blame this unit or that unit with failing to do what was commanded.  He makes you see the men, the shoddy uniforms, the hardship of chronic dysentery from bad food and terrible living conditions, yet they were still expected to march miles!  He makes you see the ridiculous odds the Yanks, Brits and Canadians faced with having tanks that were so inferior to the Germany Tigers.  More than that, he shows where command KNEW this and yet no one voiced objections except the poor man depending on that tank to save his life!<br />I loved how he pointed out men could vividly recall the horrors, the loss of life, of friends dying - the emotions - rather than actual details of the battle, the logic of a man scared to his very bones doing what he had to do to protect his country.<br />This is a work without peer for WWII.  If you are interested in this era, I cannot recommend them highly enough.ood and terrible living conditions, yet they were still expected to march miles!

Sandra Hill continually trods where no tepid writer dares and gives some wonderfully original books.  I loved many of her Time-Travelling Vikings who refused to stay put in their own time, and her last - Very Virile Viking was one gem!  It's hard to do humour and get consistent good reviews, because what strikes our funnybones is free-ranging and vastly different from person to person.  Having been raised on both sides of the Pond, I see Yanks not get Brit humour and Brits sniff at what passes for American jokes.<br /><br />I was raised in Scotland and Britain and I delight in the humour and their quirkiness.  Same for the places I have lived in the US, mostly Kentucky - truly full of  characters.  But I have a great aunt down near the Big Easy, so New Orleans and the area holds a soft spot in my heart as well.  Another place that truly appreciate humour and the offbeat.

The characters were crisp, witty and it was JAK at her best.<br />This is not.<br />Not that it is bad.  It's just this is in the pattern of her recent trilogies of books.  One really good and then two weaker continuation of the same story.  I really hoped since Light and Shadow was so strong that she would break that curse.  I love JAK - she is one of my favourite writers, but I do feel let down by these weaker part 2 and 3 of her JAK and Quick efforts of late.  Only the Eclipse Bay books were as good all the way through.  In paperback, maybe you would grump less, but at hardback prices her fans deserver a little bit more.<br />When we last saw the Whispering Hills gang, it was just a month early.  Ethan Truax, PI, had married Zoe Luce to stop Zoe's brother-in-law from trying to pop her back in to the high-priced Candle Lake Manor Psychiatric Hospital.  The bluff had worked and the mystery - who killed Zoe's husband - was solved.  Zoe's fellow escapee from Crystal Lake - Arcadia was now living with Harry, Ethan's PI friend.  Neither Zoe or Arcadia had mental problems, but Crystal Lake specialised in hiding rich people's &quot;embarrassments&quot; -  for enough money they quietly keep the problemsome relative away from prying eyes.  However, in Arcadia's case, she was actually hiding from a husband, and deliberately checked herself into Crystal Lake.  Grant Loring tried to kill her.  She figured her husband would never look for her at an institute for the mentally ill.<br />Arcadia suddenly fears, Grant's still alive - not dead from a skiing accident as reported - and that he has now decided to come after his wife who has too much information on him.  She fears her &quot;new&quot; identity has been compromised.<br />But the whole gang, for one reason or another is uneasy.  It's November, the month Ethan's brother was murdered, leaving Ethan, Bonnie, his sister-in-law, and his two nephews dealing with the grief.  Ethan also is concerned about his marriage.  He jumped at the chance to use the excuse of protecting Zoe, when he really wanted to marry her.  Now, he fears she may be having second thoughts.  Zoe is having seconds thoughts, but not because of love.  She loves Ethan, but he refuses to believe Zoe is psychic, just chalks up her &quot;gift&quot; to good intuition.  She feels if he cannot accept WHAT she is how can he love her?  This is a sticking point, especially when she starts running into &quot;spider webs&quot; of dark emotions somehow connected to Crystal Lake.  But those worries, take a back seat when someone tries to kill Ethan.  Is it connected to his brother's death?  Connected to Zoe's stay at Crystal Lake? Or the con man that Ethan exposed?<br />Frankly, this books is a pleasant read, with some really fine JAK's humour, but on the whole, she once again has too many story lines going all at once - to hide there is not much of a mystery (Smoke and Mirrors problem). The romance between Zoe and Ethan gets pushed aside as it become the &quot;Gang's&quot; Story.  It's like JAK has lost the heart to write romance, so she covers it with food, food and more food (Quick's Don't Look Back's Problem).<br />This is enjoyable, diverting, and will please fans, but they would do well to wait for paperback.

This gentle, sweet Homespun tale will win readers hearts!Margaret shows herself a promising talent and is able to touch the heart.  She has a wonderful eye for historical detail and is able to bring that to her work.<br />Tessa O'Donnell, an Irish lass, fines times hard.  Her husband blames her for her several miscarriage and it hardens him toward.  Rapidly approaching her last chance at bearing a child, she fears what the future holds.  But a drunken Sean dies in an accident, leaving her the way to make a new life, one where she hopes to find happiness in faraway America.<br />She boldly takes a ship to US.  When she boards, she meets a mysterious woman, who strangely bears a great resemblance to her, so much so she even comments upon it.  The woman is ailing and quickly seizes the friendship Tessa offers on the long lonely voyage.  She learns the woman is going to live with her ageing uncle - likely the old uncle envisions his niece carrying for him, but to Tessa, she fears it may be the other way around.  As they arrive in America, her friend sickens worse and dies.<br />Since no one in the US has ever seen her, Tessa assumes the identity of the woman, after all they could pass for twins in looks.  Upon arriving in the small town, she finds the Uncle has recently died and leaving everything to Tessa.  The town welcomes her and she finds a true happiness - for a time.  The local bully wanted the property Tessa inherited, and is out to prove in any way he can she is a liar.<br />Fate steps in with the riddle the Uncle leaves behind to a hidden fortune, and if Tessa is smart enough to solve them she may find she has a true place where she belongs and the chance at a fulfilling life and love.<br />I look forward to seeing more from this writer in the true Homespun fashion.	2003-12-31

The face of romance writing keeps shifting, as writers push the boundaries all the time.  Today you see new great voices such as Robin D. Owens, C. J. Barry and Susan Grant writing &quot;Off World&quot; romances, but hey, Jayne Anne, with her Lost Colony series, was doing it a long time ago.  They did not get the right reception because they were so new, so fresh.  Reeaders had Jayne Anne/Amanda Quick pigeon-holed and were resistant to letting her stretch.  Funny, so many times I see reviews quoting if you have read 3 or more JAKs you have read them all.  They are great reads, but a bit of the same.  Yet, she when tried the Flower series and the Lost Colony series, readers were grumpy because it was not like JAK usually was!!<br />So maybe a few of you have missed these tales or should give them a new look.  I believe had they been released in today's market they would have done much better.<br />In this one, Kalena is the last survivor of a proud heritage, and is on a secret mission to destroy the enemy of her family - at any cost, even her life.  Kalena is determined to avenge the deaths of her father and brother at the hands of Quintel, head of a rival house.<br />One man can stop her, a soldier they call &quot; Fire Whip &quot;. Despite, knowing he is bound to the enemy, Kalena falls in love with Ridge.  He owes his loyalty to Quintel, so will he fight for honour or love.  She is the coolest of females, so trained in keeping her emotions at bay, and he is the hottest lover, the one who can melt her heart of ice.<br />Jayne Ann crafted a wonderful &quot;Off World&quot; Tale, so if you have missed it and enjoy Robin Owens, CJ Barry or Susan Grant, don't give this one a miss.	2003-12-12

Was not my first King book, read The Black Thorn's Rose before, this book is what really made me a King fan (though I have been disappointed a bit with her Maiden series, like she is losing the &quot;heart&quot;).  Mhairi is the lass in a male dominated family.  She knows the men are doing wrong when they reive sheep from below the boarders, but also know it's a way of life for the Scots.

I am very picky about history and about Scotland, my two loves, and I nearly cringe when I read some romance writers' tales about Scotland.  It's clear they have never set foot on the soil and have to real idea of what Scotland is.  I am glad to say this is NOT the case with King.  Her Scottish historicals are rich in detail, well researched and so true to the heart of a Scot.<br />I loved her Angel Knight and Raven's Moon and this one is nearly as perfect as those two.  In this tale, Tamsin Armstrong was the daughter of William Armstrong and a gypsy.  She is raised with a taint against her because of her gypsy blood, so she has felt unloved.  Tamsin is captured with her father while raiding the lands of their hated English enemy, Jasper Musgrave, and thrown into prison.<br />William Scott's father was friends with Archie, reived with him, so when Tamsin comes to the aid of the ailing King James V, William agrees for old times sakes to marry Tamsin, thus saving her from an unwanted marriage.  But it's a fleeting promise, giving by a man with no intentions of carrying through on it.  Tasmin craves the notion of a husband to love her, so she accepts William's proposal, not seeing it as false.<br />As their attraction grows, so does the danger not only to Tamsin, but the Queen as Musgrave has evil intentions.<br />Another first rate tale from a true storyteller!!	2003-12-11

James Lindsay was a Scottish Noble, but has been outlawed, accused of betraying his leader.  James is determined to win his good name back, and he sees Isobel as a weapon to get his justice.  James intends on using Isobel to gain the freedom of his cousin.  Only plans go awry and they must take to the forrest to escape their enemies.<br />Ah, I wonder if a wee bit of James Douglas is not the basis for this James, for all the dashing and legend of the Black Douglas rests easily on the mantle of King's character.<br />King is unsurpassed in her skill to weave a true Scottish tale.	2003-12-11

This one has so much going for it, and yet...<br />A great locale, done well, New Orleans gives an eerie backdrop without too much of the &quot;party-on-down, Cher&quot;.  She has a gritty story (maybe a wee bit too gritty for romance) and unfortunately not enough romance to balance it.  Everything felt forced, abrupt, not with her usual finesse. Some of the characters were a little trite, overdone.  But where the book hurts mosts is the play between the leads. It's just a little too contrived, like forcing that square peg into a round hole.  Something are never fully explained...<br />So this one leaves you with mixed feelings.  Just a shame a few of these nagging problems could not have been ironed out for it is still a powerful read despite them.	2003-12-09

Harlequin Intrigues were the &quot;home&quot; of York for a long time and she never failed to deliver a good read.  But she really shines as she moves to &quot;big books&quot; for Berkley.  This is third in the tense Moon series, and though maybe slightly weaker than the first two, it's only because of there is less surprise after the first two.  The writing is compelling, the characters leap off the pages.  This is paranormal romance at its best.<br />In this tale, Sara Weston is a botanist (a witch but denies her powers).  She has come to the swamp to do research and this puts her into the territory of  Adam Marshall.  He is a ranger who patrols the Nature Refuge, but he is a very &quot;special ranger&quot;.

This is a stunning portrait of history gone of the graceful architecture that was to epitomise the South in the US - the antebellum ladies.  The oversize black and white photos so the decay nipping at the great ladies (some now sadly lost) with the haunting skill of a painter.  Not just the houses themselves, but the smaller touches like the decorations, the outer buildings, the grave-markers.  And not, pictures of perfection, so showing with time's ravage has done to them.  He effectively catches the by-gone slice of history with a little camera magic, so at the superimposed image of a ghostly woman in the a mirror on the wall pf Parlange Plantation or the pencil portrait of the child of Voisin Plantation.<br />There are other plantation books that go into more detail of the history of these dying giants of America.

I have been reading Jordan's books for over a decade, and I keep coming back despite troubling problems with each book.  WHY?  Because she creates such strong, intriguing characters.  Often, they are infuriating, but I figure she is pushing the right buttons in me to provoke such a response.  Even when they are infuriating, I long remember them after I put them down.<br />This book - the third installment in Jordan's Regency era Notorious series -  has another of the arrogant alpha males, Lucian Tremayne, Earl of Wycliff.  He is a spy for the English government.  He comes upon comes across Brynn Caldwell as she is gets out of the water after swimming.  He immediately proposes (o-kay) but Brynn says no, that she - and all the women of her family are curse.  The curse is a they lure men to love them to their death - sort of like the Leannan Si of Ireland.<br />Well, a wee curse is nothing to a master spy, so Lucian does not let this stop his pursuit.  He finally convinces Brynn to marry him. This creates troubles as Brynn and her family have been smuggling to make ends meet,and Lucian has been sent their to stop the flow of gold going to France.  Despite a rocky start to their marriage bed, Lucian and Brynn share desire, though both keep their emotions locked away.<br />Where I got a wee ticked was his wanting the child and she saying she would give him a son for her freedom.  Women just don't carry a child for 9 months and then turn their back, and this is a little trite to boot.  Then he says if she wants a child she will have to pursue the conception?  Shakes head?  I felt like Jordan changed characters on me.<br />She is a strong writer that keeps me coming back time and again.<br />Just one of these days she is going to get it perfect and WOW!	2003-12-03

Rutherford sets out to create an epic masterpiece, but in rush (lol at 1000 pages!) to achieve that aim, he loses \\"heart\\".  I did not care about these people, but was kept at a distance.  The Wilsons, the Godfreys, the Masons, the Porteuses and Schockleys never really come to life for me.  The five families fates and fortunate interweave from primitive man to medieval Knights and ladies, through England's blood civil war to modern man.

In order to save her life, she leaves her aunts home and goes to the seedy side of London to hide out.  Auntie fears for her niece's life and calls on &quot;Nightshade&quot; to find her.  Sir Lucas Hawthorne is a former cat burglar, who is trying to arrange a good marriage, but as a favour to a friend he goes back to his roots to rescue Miss Dane.  He captures her and spirits her off to his castle for safe keeping.  Victoria feels she must pay him back so she agrees to polish the rough edges off Nightshade, so Sir Lucas can be more of the gentleman.  But then it is Victoria's turn to rescue Lucas when he is capture by the murder.<br />It's light reading.  I loved banter between Lucan and Victoria.  But it was missing fire, passion to keep the reader really involved.  So it is a good read, but not long memorable.  Robinson get this formula perfected and adds that strong emotional involvement between character and thus readers, watch out!	2003-12-01

Wonderful Tribute to the Master of Menace	Vincent Price came into horror films by way of the studio system.  His body of work is amazing, and he showed a fine sense of comedic timing in His Kind of Woman, with Robert Mitchum and Jane Russell, playing an OTT hammy actor. Later this tough for droll comedy would show in two gems - The Raven and The Comedy of Terrors.  However, he really gathered attention in 1952 with House of Wax.  After that wonderful performance, it was non stop fun all the way.<br />Many of his films were for William Castle or Roger Corman, and often considered Drive-In fodder - such as The Fly, The Bat, House on Haunted Hill.  It was the series of Poe movies that firmly linked the word horror to Price - and I think it was a term he enjoyed completely.  At the time the Corman-Price-Poe series of movies - The Pit and The Pendulum (with Scream Queen Barbara Steele), House of Usher, Tomb of Ligeia, Masque of the Red Death, Haunted Palace (which was really Lovecraft not Poe, but what the hey...) were often dismissed.  But looking back, you will see finely crafted horror films that are still a pleasure to what now, with many of Price's wonderful performances.<br />Even later, he continued to seek out this same spotlight with the campy Theatre of Blood and the Dr. Phibes duo of films or the more serious Cry of the Banshee and Conqueror Worm (one of his most underrated performances).<br />He scared us with a gentle boo, mesmerising with that voice, thrilled us with the wondrous menacing laugh, enchanted us with his devilish twinkle in his eye...he entertained us cooking fish in his dishwasher on Johnny Carson.<br />His legacy lives and this is wonderful tribute to the master!  Loaded with pictures, it is a must for Price fans.	2003-11-29

I might be wrong, but not by much! His works are wonderfully researched and developed, making them a pleasure to read. While he has written biographies on many different people, he has a vast list of books on Arthur and Grail Lore.<br />I really like this one, because he looks past the valiant legend and searches out Arthur the man. Arthur - as far back as Longshanks - has been molded and used to their purposes - so it's hard to peel back all the layers and get back to original Arthur.<br />Barber takes on that chore of removing the many embellishments, in a work that is enjoyable for the average reader as well as the Grail Addicts. Loaded with medieval paintings and woodcuttings this book is a wealth of information.<br />A must for any Grail Lore Library.	2003-11-24

Unfortunately, a bit of garbage is the second Malleus Maleficarum.  However, I wonder if this book comes in third.  One wonders if Thomas Malory had any idea how this book would still be a steady seller today?  Ah, to the days of writing what you WANTED, in the manner you wanted without an editor coming in and telling you need to remove 20,000 words!<br />This book has been reprinted endless and one can see why it will continue to be so.  And considering all this was writing by hand, not in WORD, it must have taken years to finish.  Of course, these days more of his works are translated, but that does not dim the power of his imagery or the wonder of the tales he created.  Face it, if Arthur were around he would call Malory his PR man!<br />Le Morte D' Arthur is likely the best known and most influential work of the Fifteenth Century.  The whole Camelot mania began with this book and continues to this day.  Why, because it raising values we all would like to achieve, at time when chivalry, honour and justice were valued.<br />This one volume, complete and unabridged edition is superbly illustrated.  A Grail Lore Library is incomplete without a copy.  I am sure, even the avid lore addict would love a new copy as a gift for likely is old one is well used.	2003-11-24

When I glance at my Grail Lore books, his name jumps out at me again and again.  Not only is he a wonderful storyteller, he does some of the most amazing illustrations for each tale.<br />Born before the US Civil War in Wilmington Delaware, he was enchanted by storybooks and the drawings such as Grimm's Faerytales and that influence is clear in his books.  So Pyle set about in his twenties to pen stories of Pirates, Robin Hood and Arthur and his knight.  His love of these tales was brought to bear as he created \\"grown-up\\" storybooks.<br />This is one of my favourite of his works.  The illustrations of Arthur, Merline and the Knights of the Table are brilliant.  It covers the early tales of Arthur, as his identity was discovered by performing the Miracle of the Sword, then moves on to Arthur's winning of his Queen.  He gives stories of Merlin, Sir Pellias, Sir Gawain and others in this amazing storybook for lovers of Grail Lore.<br />No Grail Library Collection should be without it.	2003-11-23

He was one of the most ruthless kings ever to sit on the throne of England.  He was vicious, almost careless in the lives he spent in his various wars, but he was also a brilliant legal mind that forged the foundations of the legal system England and US has today.  Most of all he was determined to do what his grandfather, King John failed to do, win back all the lands lost of France and all powers to the barons when John signed the Magna Carta.  As well, he was determined to end the abuses tolerated by his weak father concerning the Marcher Barons of Wales.<br />Edward fought long wars with the Scotland, his own nobles, Ireland, France and the Welsh.  And though, I am sure many believe Scotland was him prime focus, it was really secondary to his controlling Wales. When Edward came to the throne in 1272, he was a warrior-prince tested, and he carried that into being a warrior-king.<br />The borders of Wales - the Marches - were always a trouble, so Norman barons had been set to garrisoning it, control it.  Instead, of bringing peace to England, so far from England, they began to challenge the crown's authority, carrying on their private wars and fermenting rebellion to the very authority they were set to protect.<br />When Edward determined to once and for all break the spine of Wales, he was facing fighting his own barons as much as the determined Welsh.  The great castles that Edward ringed Wales with, to strangle it into control, still stand today as a reminder of the vast power this King wielded.<br />Morris really gives a super work, detailed, fascinating, a dynamic portrait of England, Scotland and Wales during the 13th Century.  He draws heavily on medieval documents of the period, a wealth of information on raids, the castles and Edward's &quot;scorched earth&quot; policy.  He lists the nobles, social rankings and down to the weapons used in war, such as Edward's great siege engines.  He compares tactics of Edward struggle to control Wales, but also the impact these events had on Scotland, Ireland and Gascony.<br />A very thorough work, presented in an readable interesting manner.  Highly recommended - especially to writers of the period.tactics of Edward struggle to control Wales, but also the impact these events had on Scotland, Ireland and Gascony.<br />A very thorough work, presented in an readable interesting manner.

I also love riddles and mysteries.  So, when someone combines both into a tale, as Charles Nicholl did, it's bound to please me.  This book is the Winner of the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for biography and the Crime Writers' Gold Dagger Awards for non-fiction thriller - both well earned!!<br />Marlowe was a very controversial poet and playwright.  In 1593,  he was stabbed to death in a lodging house in Deptford.  To say the least, the manner and circumstances of death was up to question.  There was a violent quarrel concerning Marlowe's bill and the official finding has been called dubious at best.<br />Nicholl brings to life this historical riddle with style and ingenuity weaving facts, supposition and fiction into one wonderful mix.  He presents a very complex study of Marlowe's death, but it is also a marvellous study of the seedier side of Elizabethan society.<br />Nicholl walks the masterful tightrope between historical study on Marlowe's murder, a well-written 'who dun it' and portrays with rich detail the period that leaves one wondering if he is not reincarnated!!<br />So buy it for the history, writers need to read it if they write about the period for it is also a scholarly work, but most of all sit back and enjoy a real British Who do it.	2003-11-23

After all they were not like the Romans, coming with legions to keep Britain under their first.  A small number of Normans usurped the power from the Saxon Earls and held it.  If the Saxons could organise some united resistance, they might yet push the Normans off England.<br />And a centre of such resistance arose in the always politically hot fens East Angelia.n  On the refuge of the Isle of Ely, a determined leader plotted.  Much in the manner, William Wallace rose to stand for Scotland, Hereward is a character now of myth and legends, though unlike Wallace does not enjoy the spotlight in the public mind.  A relative obscure thane, he became the main thorn in the side of the Norman invaders.<br />Victor Head works to bring Hereward out of that misty realm of myth and into a flesh and blood man, filling in the gaps by presenting clear and concise evidence from all sides about incidents in history.  He plays advocate and devil's advocate, logically giving the pros and cons about 'facts' of Hereward's rising.<br />Hereward is, indeed, woven into the fabric of England's struggles in history, and as I said, one cannot but help draw parallels between him and Scotland's William Wallace.  Rather sad, this real warrior who fought for Saxon freedom is relegated in dusty volumes of history while the Robin Hood is perceived as THE hero of Norman Resistance.  One wonders just how much of the Robin Hood legend &quot;borrowed and modified&quot; from Hereward's exploits.<br />Cheers to Victor Head, for giving Hereward his spotlight he so richly deserves.	2003-11-20

Part I starts with a brief discussion of the royals of England in the Middle ages, and the conditions that affected them, such as laws governing marriage and divorce.  Part II covers the Kings from Henry I's to King John.  Part III covers the late medieval England of the Plantagenets.  The Postscript work touches on the Tudors.<br />Many of the children born on the wrong side of the blanket, went on to play large roles in the forming of England's royal families.  It is rich in details, more than just a thumbnails of these royal embarrassments, that is a wealth for writers to mine.<br />One slim spot, I had wished for more information on John Botetourt, a mere falconer who rose be to a powerful Baron under Edward the Longshanks.  For centuries debate has battled over whether Longshanks was his sire.  Given-Wilson and Curteis give him two pages, but for such an interesting character in Longshanks life, it given but two sketchy pages.<br />A must quick reference to writers of this period.	2003-11-20

This books is not easy reading, not lightly touched upon history. More of a masquerading study presented as a historical work, with a dash of detective work tossed in.  Gottfried sets the stage of the emergence of the plague, traces its thorough and relentless progress across Europe, drawing on a wealth of documents, such as church and tax records, records written in six different languages from poets, historians and physicians of the period.<br />He shows how the cycles of outbreak of plague beginning in 1347 and lasting over hundreds of year, nearly singlehandedly broke the spine of feudalism, even to challenged the papal authority of the church, and shook up medicine completely.  He draws comparisons so you have a focal point to which you can wrap your mind around such as during the first major outbreak lasting four years, he estimate between 17 and 28 million souls died a horrible death, contrasting that to the causalities of World War I where 8 1/2 million died.  His study shows the areas of cities and over population, where the sanitary conditions were nonexistent, the mortality rate ran to 40-50%, pointing out London suffered nearly 300 death daily in the Summer of 1349.<br />Civil authority nearly broke down as fear and panic seized the masses, bizarre cults appeared like the Flagellistic ones, that went from town to town whipping themselves as punishment for the sins of mankind.  Many saw it as the end of the world, Dooms Day, the time for the second coming of Christ.<br />Gottfried recreates this nightmare world that serves as a warning for all generations in vivid detail.<br />  I do wish he had gone more into the witch-craze beginning to sweep the lands, and how the Church's ordering of the killing of all cats, fearing they were witches or witches familiars strongly contributed to the spread of the plague.<br />sigh...maybe in another book...<br />Still a must for writers of this historical period.rs of this historical period.	2003-11-20

The violent murder of Edward the Second, the death of the Black Prince, the Hundred Years War and the War of the Roses.  A lot of men and women who were movers and shakers and played pivotal roles in Britain's history to keep straight.<br />For lovers of history, who need a &quot;road map&quot; from time to time, to fictional writers need to quick refresh on the many faces of the period, this is wonderful resource.  Over 200 different biographies, daring on modern scholars works, it conveys more than the bare bone facts.  Hicks gives a richer detailed understanding of the figure and places them in the proper political context.<br />It's easy to use, arranged in chronological order rather than the general A-Z that places the person in the proper grouping to understand their interaction with other people of the period, the book is readable as a BOOK from cover to cover, or perfect for the quick need reference.<br />The 3rd volume in the Who's Who in British History series - all are highly recommended for both the armchair historian and the fictional writers of the period.	2003-11-20

Chuck that.  Oh, the essence portrayed Edward II correctly.  He was NOT his father by any standard. Edward the first was vicious in warfare, ordering the Sack of Berwick, where between 4000 to 20,000 Scot were slaughter in three days of killing.  But he was also the father of our legal system, a brilliant mind.  Must have been a sad disappointment to Longshanks, to love the son that was growing into his image, watch him die, and know the Throne of England would pass to his other son, one tainted with the Lionheart's gene.  Yes, his sexual bent saw the son often rule for the wishes of his \\"favourites\\" and it set his Princess and late Queen Isabella against him, as well as England's Barons, which eventually lead to his murder.<br />But who was this foppish young man, who stood in the shadows of the most ruthless King England has ever known?  He inherited Longshanks mess with Scotland, and tried to be rid of it.  At one time, went to the Bruce for help in sheltering his continual companion that often overstepped his place at court.<br />Without whitewashing Edward's homosexuality, Hutchinson tried to bring forth a portrait  of this somewhat tragic figure in England's and Scotland's history.  Edward's coronation saw not only the hostilities with Scotland continuing, but he had to contend with Barons determined to expand their power at the expense of the crown, seeing Edward II's weak rule as the perfect time to strike.  He had to contend with a government running in the red, due to his warrior father's expensive wars.  He did not chose his inner circle well, and had a wife that was called the She Wolf.  Edward's death - murder - was one of the most horrible deaths of any monarch in all of history.<br />This book is a good insight into a man that history barely gives a footnote to as the son of Edward the Longshanks.	2003-11-19

I especially recommend this as a foundation for anyone wanting to know more about forges in the Middles Ages and a prep for understanding how swords and armour were made.  This is a starting point, but also a wealth of information I have not found elsewhere.<br />Beaton's book starts with a discussion about the Blacksmith.  Quickly moves on to the black metal.  He discusses the set up of the Blacksmith shop, then into a more details coverage of his tools, tricks and techniques.  Once he has that established he go into rich writing how how the metals are formed.  Especially helpful, is the home utensils chapter, a back to basics that will be invaluable to writer.  Also handled are iron decorations and winds up with weaponry.<br />This is a must for period writers.  You cannot get a better study of this subject.  It will add so much to your writings to fully understand the role of this very vital master of the trade who kept people safe and provided them with the means of defence, right down to the care of horses that were so valuable to a man's very life.	2003-11-19

First published in 1905, Pyle wrote and illustrated his own tales, such as Lancelot, Tristam & Isoult, and Percival.  The pen in and ink drawing are simply amazing and so bring alive his stories.<br />Highly recommended for those interested in tales of the Round Table.

This was the Age of Chivalry - a time of knights and ladies, where bravery, valour and larger-than-life heroes came into flower.  Above all, Loyalty was treasured, and none rivals the tale of loyalty between two men, who faced some of the hardest times in Scottish History and paid the price:  Robert the Bruce, Earl of Carrick, and James Douglas.  Even today James \\"Black\\" Douglas still thrills the imagination and heart of ladies fair!<br />Their tales is epic, and frankly, would make a better movie than Braveheart.  I love Wallace, and never would discount his part in Scotland's history and struggle to remain a country separate from England.  However, he was a shooting star that lit the fires of rebellion; the hard role of forging Wallace's dream into a reality fell upon the shoulders of twenty-something Bruce and his right hand Jamie Douglas.  Their struggle was longer and harder, for not only did Bruce have to fight Longshanks - and later his son Edward II, to see Scotland free - he had to fight the mighty clan Comyn who control nearly 2/3s of Scotland.<br />The language of Barbour's epic, translations edited by A.A.M. Duncan, is easy to read, and lends such wealth into seeing Robert the Bruce and James Douglas as men, not just heroes.  It gives such strong imagery and insight into the medieval period of Scotland.  This first accessible modern edition of Barbour's work and must for any lover of Scottish History's bookshelf.	2003-11-18

Nick Evangelista writes the best books on fencing, from the historical perspective, the origins of the weaponry, to the theory, practise and mindset.  They are a wealth of reference for fencers and for historical writers alike.  Frankly, there is a dearth of good fencing books out there and Evangelista has done a marvellous job of bringing the subject into the modern age.<br />Fencing is a one of the few sports, like shooting and equestrian challenges, where women and men compete on an equal footing.  In fencing, more especially, a trained female fencer may have the advantage of smaller size and quicker movements.  However, there is very little written to address the females in the sport.  The Evangelistas, with three decades of teaching behind them finally deliver a book for the female fencer to help hone that advantage (Hey, Fellas, you might want to pick up a copy to know what to expect the next time you face a lady behind the mask!!).<br />Tired of exercise classes, ladies, fencing tones you, give you grace and elan...it's one great workout with &quot;teeth&quot; to it.  It's NEVER boring.  So check out this book.  It will give you the basics and MORE.<br />As with all books from Evangelista, it's well written, informative and will give you a clearer understanding of the sport and how, though women are &quot;newbies&quot; to the centuries male dominated sport, they are clearly here to stay!<br />Writers, again, this is a super reference to make sure your fencing aspects as as sharp as your foil!!	2003-11-18

Melanie's Goblins were not content with seeing Detroit City in ruins...they have moved on to bigger fish to fry ... so to speak.  They want to blow up a nuclear power plant in the mountains outside Sin City a.k.a. Las Vegas, with the intent of not just controlling the town that never closes, but ALL of California.  They figure the radiation will make the sunshine state off limits for humans ... but hey, Goblins never minded a little toxic waste to breathe or eat.<br />Cyra Delphin is of Selkie Blood, but poor lass, has long denied this, because her parents felt the need to hide her true nature.  Not only is she part Selkie, she is part Kloka - very<br />powerful Moon Fey - only she has no idea of the magick that resides in her.  What she does know her life is out of control.  Well, not OUT of control, but not under Her control.  For so long, others aware of her true heritage have manipulated her, and she is terrified to learn the Goblins are behind it.  Her fianc&eacute; steals her work, claims it as his own, but is shocked she dares complain.  Nor does her \\"Goblin-loving\\" fianc&eacute; see why she should be so upset they are backing his...um, her work...as cause for concern.<br />As she stands up for truth and tries to alert people to the Goblin involvement, her life spirals into chaos.  People wish to buck the Goblins control try to use her as a figurehead to spur rebellion, but the Goblins counter by pushing her precariously toward a nervous breakdown.  When her ex-fianc&eacute; gets married, she ruins the receptions by pushing him into the ice sculpture  -  all in a bit of payback!  Outside, a strange person hands her a calling card.  It is from a member of H.U.G.  They warn her to leave her home in the middle of the night, without packing, without telling anyone and go deep into the desert.<br />So, Cyra finds herself driving 100 miles from everywhere, in a car that barely should be trusted around the block, let along on this trek where there are no roads and even Jean Luc Piccard would not boldly go.  Already having second thoughts about H.U.G. - Humans Under Ground - their purposes and what they want with her, she is totally unprepared for the man she nearly runs down.  He appears from nowhere, nearly half-dead ... more to the point, she is very unprepared to discover that Thomas Marrowbone is part dragon!  Thomas quickly discovered Cyra is the very special combination of fey - and the Goblins will be after her soon, so he takes her to Jack Frost and his wife Io.  After the destruction of Detroit and Io leaving HUGS, they are leading the fey into banning together to fight their own battles.<br />Cyra quickly falls for Thomas ... and the dragon ... and that love will cause her to follow Thomas after he leaves her with Jack and Io.  Thomas lost his wife to the Goblins, watched her tortured and killed before his eyes.  As such, he has no intention of taking Cyra with him into Sin City, where you must face down the Goblin menace and put an end to their plans.  Cyra knows she is stronger than Thomas' wife was, knows she can come to terms with the magick residing inside her.  She comprehends unless she follows Thomas into the dangerous city and becomes the warrior mate he needs Thomas will die.<br />Melanie once again destroys another Yank town in fine fun and great imagination.  A great follow up to Traveler, and leaves us hungry from the coming The Courier.

It is gently written. You get to know Simon as he goes into the service, and your knowledge of him and what he faces in warfare gives you an insight to what many of our young men must be going through today. It is easy for a country to send our young men off to foreign places, and then when the need for them to be a soldier is over, we detachedly presume, they walk away and it's all behind them. Having had members of the various wars in my family, I know that was not the case, but few reveal what is locked up inside them.<br />Simon's book gives us a very personal account of what he went through and how he could not walk away from it like flipping a switch. His writing is easy to read as proses, it is harder to take as a human being knowing this is not fiction but quite real. He makes you feel, understand and end result is you are so sad - not only for him but the thousands and thousand of young men now facing the same path.<br />Wonderful job, something everyone should read.	2003-11-09

At points, he took it out and worried with it, redid it, polishing it.  I think as his other tales came to life the saw the need for adjustments in the roots of his tales.  Still when he died it remained unpublished.  His son, Christopher, picked up the threads and edited the book tells a tale of the Elder Days, when Elves and Men became estranged by the Dark Lord  and it was finally published, but to the thrill of Tolkien fans, four years after his death.<br />Many new fans of his thrilling works have come to know his tales through the Ring Movies, but will have questions, want to know more. So I recommend this for all Tolkien fans, old and new wanting to have more depth to the Beginning.<br />A super gift for your Tolkien friend!	2003-10-29

Katie Macalister, who does nothing but write 24/7 so that I have lost track of HOW MANY books she has out this year, gives us BIRD OF PARADISE story in this trilogy. It is a gem of a comedy that says big is beautiful and a man and his cat should not be parted!

It concerned with the military tactics. Bayne does give your a &quot;grounding&quot; point starting with Agricola to General Wade - early background of Scotland's roots, and hopefully one day he might turn his attention to this area.<br />He does cover battles on Scottish Soil, discussing the Castle, Garrisons and road conditions.  One chapter is dedicated to Weapons of the Scots and their unique guerrilla style of fighting, but also their organised formations.  Next he covered life in a a Scottish Regiment, the dress and uniforms.<br />Quite naturally no book discussing Scottish Military would be worth it's salt without spotlighting the role the Scottish Bagpipers players, so I am glad to saw this is not missed.<br />Bayne also thumbnails interesting Scots Military figures - even some of the fictional ones, and touches on Scottish Cavalry and special units of Scots.<br />A very interesting book for someone looking for military details rather than political discussions.  A very worthy book to your Scottish history self and especially useful for historical fiction writers of the period.	2003-10-20

A wonderfully researched book covering stone circles and henges, but looks past to less covered questions, giving equal time to many other perplexities confronted when we look into Britain past.<br />Full of B+W photos, the book starts with Tombs and cairns -  small and large, with a section devoted to Salisbury Hill and it's amazing construction.  At the end - as with all chapters - it gives you prime examples of what the chapter covered with Places of Interest, listing specific directions and a  brief description of why that spot is worth visiting.<br />The Next Section is the Vanished Wildwood, and written so well, that it was completely fascinating, discussing the trees that no longer could be found on British soil.  It shows the influences of the changes in clime and the medieval need for wood nearly saw their destruction.  A nice section of ancient woodcutting shows many trees.  It goes on to Stone circles, and while there a many books more thorough on the subject, this is still a wonderful introduction to them.  After stone circles, it moves to the ancient hillfortresses, then in natural progression - the homes of ancient man.<br />Also covered are the Chalk engravings such as the Westbury White Horse.  Scotland's riddles are given several sections with Pictish Stones, followed by the fascinating brochs and even the more mysterious - the vitrified fortress.  It touches boundaries and barriers, such as Hadrian's Wall and Devil's Dyke, finally to the end of the dark period as Christians came unto the pagan land, discussing the oldest churches surviving in the Isles.<br />A wonderful book for people wanting more than just a picture book.  Especially recommended to travellers looking to know a bit more about Britain before a visit.	2003-10-19

Lynsay Sands&#8217; hit SINGLE WHITE VAMPIRE was the first in her series of books about a modern day dysfunctional vampire family the Argeneaus.  Love Bites is the second and takes up the story of Etienne, Lucern&#8217;s younger brother.  (These are the books<br />that Lucern has been writing that everyone thinks are just vampire romances!)<br />Rachel Garrett has been bouncing between chill and fever and it had nothing to do with the dead man on the table before her.  She works in a hospital morgue, after all, so seeing dead bodies were a just part of a work.  It was the flu.  She needed to be in bed resting, but the caseload was stacking up so there was no time to pamper herself.  Only to find a dead body handsome, well that MIGHT be attributed to the flu.  But after, when she jokingly apologizes for having to cut away the expensive slacks and the corpse replies, she feels entirely justified in fainting.<br />After a week&#8217;s recovery, she is back on the job when they bring in another body, this one totally burned from a car explosion.  As Rachel begins to remove his possessions and tag the body, she is puzzled when the body seems less charred, and then the blackened flesh begins to desquamate, sort of like a snake shedding its skin.  Worse, she detects a heartbeat.  Just as her mind is trying to adjust to this bizarre situation, an ax-wielding madman rushing into the room screaming for her to get away from the body that is was a vampire.  She&#8217;s horrified when she sees this nutcase is going to cut off the head of the man - who may not be dead.  Not giving a thought, she jumps in front of him as he brings the ax down.  Too late Rachel understands her stupid mistake.  Etienne awakes to find Rachel dying.<br />Though they are governed by rules about turning people into vampires, you may turn a mate into a life partner, so Etienne<br />repays her heroic saving of his life by saving hers by making Rachel a  vampire.  His mother and brother arrive on the scene and take Etienne and Rachel home.<br />When Rachel awakens, she is in a lot of pain, nude, and strapped to a bed, with an IV giving her blood.  She is surprised to find the horrid ax wound is healing, leaving only a tiny scar and even nearly fades before her eyes.  Trying to find some answers to the zillions questions flooding her mind, she wraps the sheet around her and ventures forth only to find a coffin in a darkened room.  For the second time in her life she nearly faints, as the occupant of the coffin sits up and begins talking to her.<br />Thus begins the rocky romance of Etienne Argeneau and Rachel Garrett.  Etienne figures once Rachel understands it was the only way to save her life, she will quickly adjust to her new state, after all her body is in a better state that it ever was<br />- and hey no split ends!!

The question, naturally, with such a strong first book: Can they do it again? And I am delighted, in the case of C.J. Barry, the answer is a resounding, YES!!<br />Her second book Unraveled is just as solid Sci-Fi, just as sizzling, sexy romance, with another set of heartwarming characters. So Barry boldly makes the statement she is here to stay. CJ Barry zipped into the romance field earlier this year, a brilliant meteor shower across the SCI-FI Romance genre, with her first book Unearthed, joining Robin D. Owens as the wonderful new voices in this category. Unearthed was perfection on many levels. The characters were sharply drawn so they leaped off the pages. Her writing was very polished - way beyond a first time author - knowing the small techniques that bring a story together and keep the pace moving briskly. The sexy romance sizzled, but it is in her characters' repartee she sparkles brightest. Unearthed was one of the best books Sci-Fi or Romance - I read this year. Barry is able to visualise her outer space worlds, so she pulls the reader along on the grand adventure.<br />Rayce Coburn we met briefly in Unearthed, a sexy hunk that was another space Indiana Jones. But he is tired of the struggle, adventure and danger, and wants to build something solid. His dream is a new spaceport, nothing like it in the area, and he has gone to the limit to see the vision a reality. But he needs a lot of credits to bring it to completion on time. And that is where Tru Van Dye comes in. She is a Majj scientist, and she is on a quest to find a lost fortune in alien relics, but to do this she must have Rayce's help. While he welcomes her credits at a point when he really needs them, that it should come from one of the Majj sours his soul. Rayce hates the Majj, blames them for the needless death of his sister, Miranda. And since Rayce hates them, blames the insular planet for all the woes brought on poor people of the universe, and specifically, the loss of his sister, he vents these emotions on the immediate target: Tru. The Majj sell their inventions and medical breakthroughs to the highest bidders, no matter if innocent people die. Only the desperate need for credits drives Rayce to make a bargain with the female devil.<br />However, Rayce finds the beautiful Tru a contradiction. She has a near crippling lack of her own worth as a person and displays a very tender compassion that is polar opposites of the Majj. Convinced she is frigid, by her only attempt at physical closeness, she is walking on needles around the sexy Rayce with his blue-green eyes. He rattles her in ways she never new a man could reach a woman. So she uses a virtual program built around Rayce - a preparation in teaching her how to approach him and win his aid in the quest. Not willing to put herself at risk in the real world, Tru uses the safe secure holo-program to try and find her own sense-of-self sexually. Only, Rayce catches her using the virtual set up, and scared the holo-Rayce might hurt her somehow, he enters the program. Tru never knew the Rayce she found so gentle and caring in the holo-program was the REAL Rayce not her projected image. As they race around the universe, even paying a visit to earth, trying to find the X marks the spot, they both learn about each other, who they are and who they should be.<br />Barry delivers, once again, a book that is thoughtful, moving, with winning characters, humour and those little special touches that guarantee you will be hearing a lot more for her in the near future....thankfully!

It pays ode to the romanticising of Scottish fighters such as Rob Roy, Wallace, The Bruce and Bonnie Prince Charlie, but goes past these legendary images to show you the reasons for certain practices.  It covers the basics of offence and defence,especially in the fencing techniques of the 17th through 19th centuries.  I do wish I would have covered the medieval aspects of Highland swordsmanship:  The Claymore.  The movements for using the longest two handed sword is wonderful to see in action, so I had hoped this book would cover that.<br />Lots of diagrams and photos so the non fencer can follow precisely what they are demonstrating.<br />Very detailed in who did what in duels, the protocol and history.<br />All in all a very good work.	2003-10-13

This book obviously is written by someone full of passion for the techniques of Medieval Swordsmanship. However, the passion does not cover for some of the flaws. With a little more research worked into this and a correct of some of the faulty information, it would have been the bible for writers, reenactors and people interested in the historical technique of medieval sword fighting. Still when used with other historical works, it is an excellent resource.<br />He covers medieval swords, their making, swords use with shields and against shields. He discusses sparing methods, how to stage reenactments, then historical decline of the swords, and then how the sword has evolved in martial arts of today.<br />It's a good work, but due to glaring problems it just misses as being a great work. I would still think writers and reenactors - using it conjunction with other works - would find it a useful book and would not want to miss it.	2003-10-13

Marisol another of those one name personalities like Cher, Prince and Madonna.  She has been a model, a banker, a belly dancer and various other professions in her life.  A native of Venezuela, she has penned a wonderful tribute to her female heritage.<br />According to the Latin American proverb, for a woman to succeed in life and please her man, she needs to be a lady in the living room, a chef in the kitchen and the courtesan in the bedroom.  This philosophy is played out in the tale of Pilar.  She goes home for her grandmother's funeral, and finds she is left a legacy she did not expect: bound in black silk are her nana's journals.  The writings carry the secrets of her grandmother's life she carried to the grave.  The journals detail the beauty rituals women of South America for centuries have learned to master, stressing the social etiquette, delicious recipes to seduce men, including the most important recipe of all: how to blend a strong-willed woman into lady, wife and lover.<br />This is very sensual, compelling novel that contrast the glory of being feminine through the eyes of a modern woman against discovering the time honoured traditions of her grandmother.<br />A truly wonderful book that empowers being a woman on all levels.	2003-10-13

Owens in a writers chat.  It was just after she had gained recognition for her first book HEARTMATE.  Word of mouth was so good, my curiosity was tweaked.  So, naturally, I dashed off to order a copy and read it.  Rarely is a first book so full of heart, so brilliantly conceived.  Generally, if it is, it falls into the Harper Lee Syndrome of being so perfect the writer cannot achieve that level ever again.  So when I was asked to review Robin&#8217;s second book, I frankly feared being let down.  Instead, I was blown away.  She did not achieve that same wonderful magick of HEARTMATE&#8230;she surpassed it!  HEART THIEF was just that, a complex tale of an outcast, a thief and the Judge whom falls in love with him.  The KittyFams were such a draw.  I love cats, and Robin gives the KittyFams such life and personalities to her telepathic kitties, not cutesy, but oh so heartwarming.  Having so enjoyed her first two works, I was eagerly, but once more cautiously looking forward to the next in the Hearts of Celta series.<br />HEART DUEL, just does not measure up to the first two, it shines with such amazing emotion.<br />This time we are treated to two KittyFams, Meserv and Phyll, tom brothers, gifts from T&#8217;ash to his friend, Holm Holly (prominent character in the first two books as the heir to House of Holly) and Lark Collinson, a healer from the Houses of Heather and Hawthrone.  A wee touch of Romeo and Juliet is the undercurrent to HEART DUEL as the Houses of Holly and Hawthorne are ancient enemies.  Lark heals the arrogant, but gorgeous Holm Holly, a man she grew up with, and watched from a far.  He was the handsome, brash warrior, she quiet women with a Flair for healing.  Both have undergone the three passages and neither saw their Heartmate that set their Flairs free, so both assumed there would not be one for them.  Lark married a commoner, also a healer, but he died three years before the tale opens.  So it is shocking to Holm to recognize as she heals his wound, that Lark is his Heartmate.  Winning her will not be easy.  Neither family will welcome their bonding, especially as the long animosity is edging toward open war between the two families.  But Holm will let nothing stop him from forming the Heartbond, not even Lark herself.<br />However, his resolve is tested when his mother is stabbed by a Hawthorne youth, the blade carrying a poison that nearly kills her.  As the feud escalates, so does Holm&#8217;s determination to win his Heartmate.  Only Lark sees the situation as hopeless.  Thus, Holm must fashion his Heartgift to win her love.<br />People who love HEARTMATE and HEART THIEF&#8230;will be thrilled with this next entry in the Celta series.  Long may Robin D.

Katie Macalister with her Noble Intentions gave us delights and out-right howls as she blithely waltzed her way through Regency England. In her second book, she taught us romance with Improper English, a brilliantly witty book with characters to live long in the imagination and heart. Her third book found her once again in Regency era, and she proved yet another time she has a way with the clumsy heroine. Her fourth full book finds Katie back in contemporaries, this time doing to the Scots what she did to the Brits in Improper English. Another of her `first person' adventures that will have you laughing till your sides are sore. Personally, I find writing in 1st person a pain, and I usually have a problem reading them. It makes me feel like I am crawling around inside someone's head. However, Katie Macalister is at home in first person, a master at it, so she soon makes one forget this `immediate' narrative is not how everyone should do it. Katie avoids all the 1st person pitfalls that make the structure slightly claustrophobic with all the I, me and my...she sparkles, intrigues and is just one of the freshest voices to hit romance (and young adult, too, as Katie Maxwell for Dorchester's Smooch Line).<br />So buckle up, for Katie gives you romance, love and the whole damn thing - sheep included. She blows the lid of the time honoured secret of what DOES a Scotsman wear under the kilt? It is wildly comical, and fast becoming Katie's trademark - she gives you the less than perfect heroine.

The handsome Scotsman is also attending the mystery writers conference. Sparks fly between the two and suddenly, she believes in love at first sight. Kathie falls desperately for the Alpha Scot, so she is delighted when Iain insists she come visit him in Scotland after the conference ends.<br />Wow what a storybook romance, right? You meet the man of your dreams, he is to-die-for sexy, has a kilt and does not mind you drooled on yourself in public! Wrong, as Kathie soon finds out. Iain is divorced with two grown sons. The first one hates her on site and thinks she is a floozy. Luckily, the second one is more welcoming. But then, waiting for them is Iain's neighbor, once upon a time lover, and she is determined to break up the romance in quick order.<br />Despite a man less than forth coming about his true feelings, a neighbor who wants to bury the hatchet - in Kathie's head, a son-in-law to be from hell, and flocks of smelly sheep, love finds a way. Then Kathie has to face a Scottish wedding from Hell, with her domineering mother and Iain's first wife making it the wedding event of the year.<br />Katie writes about Scotland with a true voice.

Holly fears her father is pushing into areas that are not only outside of what is legal, but way beyond what is ethical, and has warned him not to announce she has anything to do with his work.  Despite two warnings, Leyland Banks does just this because he needs Holly's reputation ...and more.  When the stalker breaks into the conferences and attacks Leyland, Holly's grip on reality slips even further, for she hears what the stalker is thinking.<br />The man is admitted to her hospital as a patient, and Holly is strangely drawn to the reporter who seems to have gone mad.  She is rattled by his blethering about people who thought they were aliens...very similar to Holly's own dream.  As she begins to work with the reporter, she starts to fear something dark and sinister is spreading it tentacles throughout the city.  There are strange deaths, people disappearing, and a sniper on the loose racking up nearly two dozen kills ...and at the bottom it Holly's fears her father's work is the cause of it all.<br />Squires continually pushes the edge in her writing.  Keeping the reading off balance and pulling them along on the dark ride.  It's a first class nail bitter that you won't be able to put down.urther, for she hears what the stalker is thinking.<br />The man is admitted to her hospital as a patient, and Holly is strangely drawn to the reporter who seems to have gone mad.

But if you are looking for troubled souls and woman that will risk all to be with the man they love, then you will find all these tales very heartwarming.<br />These are not dark and deadly vamps, but romantic ones. All the tales were very well written and special.<br />I especially loved Lynsay Sands' tale. I have been a long time reader of her works so I come to expect things about her writing that are very familiar. Lynsay's fans, who expect her typical brand of hysterical historicals will be in for a treat as she shows yet another new side along with her recent contemporary The Loving Daylights and followed by the Smash Hit Single White Vampire.  She offers a much more tender and intensely romance Lynsay. Though I love her magic humour, this tale surprised me and touched my heart. In her &quot;Bitten&quot; we have a tale of a Emily Collins lass who is rescued from drowning when her ship sinks in a storm. Keeran MacKay, a Scots Laird, is her rescuer and offers her shelter and so much more.  But it she who offers the ultimate gift.<br />Hannah Howell's &quot;The Yearning&quot; is an interesting tale.  For four centuries of the male of Clan MacCordy must walk by night.<br />Alpin MacCordy lives with the curse, but he also must marry for money.  Lady Sophie Hay is the &quot;bank&quot; but she is more than just a blood bank or a money bank for her love might just be the cure for the curse.<br />Sara Blayne offer us &quot;Strangers in the Night.&quot; Georgina Thornbury loves things ancient; digging for treasures in ruins is her cup of tea.  Then she meets the mysterious Julius Lathron.  What a find for a gal who digs old things?!<br />In &quot;The Awakening&quot; by Kate Huntington.

Jennifer Ashley really impressed me with her debut novel Perils of the Heart last November, and continues to do so with her second novel The Pirate Next Door.  I am sure the eye-catching novel cover will cause many to pick it up, but the story inside is what is the prize.  It is a slightly whimsical romance that finds windowed Lady Alexandra Alastair pondering the list of candidates for hubby number two.  She is rather bored with the stodgy ton's offerings, when in pops Grayson Finley and his twelve year old daughter, the new Viscount oh so conveniently next door!<br />12 years ago, he caused quite a stir by vanishing, and ever since spent that time with the scurvy crew of cutthroats and buccaneers.  Now he has returned, with an adorable daughter in tow, to claim his inheritance.  But the pirate life has not quite ended, as it follows him to the fancy Mayfair section of Britain threating his very life.<br />Alexandra is not a wimp, a proper lady yes, but not lacking in spine.  She falls for Grayson and his daughter, and is determined to fight for her Viscount.<br />It's stylish, fun and with just enough dash and mystery to keep the readers more than intrigued.	2003-10-01

In a simple, straightforward narrative style, Chernenko sets his tale in the kingdom of Avornis and chronicle the rise of two extraordinary men - Lanius, the bastard son of King Mergus, and Grus, a royal navy captain of born of humble origin.<br />Lanius was the son of Certhia, King Mergus concubine.  A beautiful woman, she held the heart of the King.  In Avornis commoners were allowed three wives, nobles four and kings six.  Since Mergus already has his six wives, Certhia must remain his leman.  However, with the news she is to bear his child, Mergus grows determined to make her his seventh wife so his son will follow him onto the thrown.  Mergus knows his younger brother Prince Scolopax is hungry to take over the throne, and will not welcome the news Mergus is to have a son.  Since Lanius is the illegitimate son of a seventh wife, in the eyes of the people and church he cannot inherit rules.  But a council of regents rally behind the child as a figurehead, while they control the real power.  The child Lanius finds his life ruled by a series of regents so has little control over the fates.  At one point, his mother, Certhia holds the power, and later Grus - a more powerful influence, who serves as jointly as king with Lanius.  Grus has rising far from a humble naval captain to a great general and intends to make the most of his position.  Grus, who is constantly tormented by dreams of things to come, must continually must battle the Thervings and the Menteshe, warlike tribes under the control of a banished Auld God, now called the Evil Banished Ones.<br />A very strong entry into the fantasy realm.	2003-09-19

Leto gives us the second tale of two about twins: women with the same face, but inside they are opposites.  In June 2003, # 92 Blaze's - LOOKING FOR TROUBLE, we met the first side of the mirror in Rory Carmichael.  She was the \\"nice girl\\" who wanted to shake loose from that image and find all the thrills of being just a wee bit wicked.  She also wanted to find her long lost twin sister, Micki, who ran away when she was fifteen.  In UP TO NO GOOD, August 2003 Blaze's #100, we take that turn of the screw and meet the \\"bad girl\\" sister who would like to be oh so good!  Now the proud possessor of the Sexcapades book - a gift from Rory - Micki holds the key to make her fantasies come true.  The book worked to help Rory find Mr. Right, so she hopes it will carry on and bring her sister the same magic.  It's a special book, sort of a Aladdin's Lamp of 1001 adventures guarantee to spice up any romance.  Each adventure is on a perforated page so you can tear them out and present them to your lover.  You won't know precisely what the sexual fantasy is, because each one is sealed and you are not to open it until you are ready to use them, this way maintaining the spontaneity.  I think Leto needs to write Sexcapdes for real and sell it, certain to be a bestseller and make her a tidy fortune!<br />Micki is a brassy, very down to earth woman who has faced the world and its harsh realities on her own.  Unable to endure the oppressive restrictions of being raised by her strict grandmother, she fled small town life and the overbearing guardian, leaving her twin, Rory, behind at the age of fifteen.  Now 10 years later they reunite.  Rory gives her a place to crash and a chance at a good job.  Micki wants to face a bright future for a change instead of just struggling to survive, but first, she must put her past in order.  Soon after running away, Micki hooked up with a teen on the street, Danielle, and this young woman filled that hole in her life, taking the place of Rory.  Danielle kept Micki grounded; Micki kept Danielle alive through fighting the girls addictions.  Micki is delivering Danielle to Sebastian Stone in Paris.  The multimillionaire is more than willing to accept care of his sister, Danielle, see she gets good doctors in hopes of kicking her drug habits.<br />Danielle's much older brother also ran away from home, but instead of living a harsh existence as Micki did, he went to College at 16 and by his 21st birthday was a millionaire in his own right!  Danielle's very rich parents had time and again washed their hands on the druggie daughter.  When Micki found Danielle overdosed again, she rushes her to hospital.  The doctor advises that unless Danielle get intensive care, she would be dead before reaching her 21st birthday.  In desperation, Micki contacted Sebastian, who agrees to step in to help his younger sister.<br />Though Micki loves Danielle's, she is tired of playing guardian angel, and just wishes to \\"play\\", and sexy Sebastian suits her fantasies completely.  Only, Sebastian is a control freak, right down to simple nervous gestures - he does not make them because they were a waste of time.  Micki's secret dreams is about a lord of the castle and the lady who finds her own strengths and captures him, but could she cast the uptight Bastian in that role and ever hope to hold him?  She is deeply attracted to him, but she knows he was \\"out of her league\\", a rich man's son who had faced the world and grown ever richer.  But with a couple of pages from Sexcapades anything is possible!<br />Leto once again skates on that red-hot edge, delivering up a tale of very realistic people with strong emotions that sets her far ahead of the pack of other series romance writers and proves she is a force!

Lynsay absolutely rocks with her new series about a dysfunctional vampire family! I won't go into the plot line too heavy because you need to experience all the surprises and delights yourself.<br />A mother, two sons and a daughter (and more relatives to come hopefully) face the every day struggles of vampire existence in the 21st Century. In this tale, originally called Lucern, we meet Lucern Argeneau, the first son.<br />He is a four hundred year old vampire, getting by in the dreary world by writing contemporary romances about...well, vampires...only no one catches on he is merely writing about his family. To his surprise, they are a big success, so much so his editor, Kate C. Leever of Roundhouse Publishing is determined to drag the reclusive writer to the Romantic Times Convention.<br />Lucern is a grumpy - albeit sexy - curmudgeon, and he is determined NOT to go to a book convention. However, Kate is a whirlwind, an editor - who has little life outside her work - so she is firmly determined to drag him kicking and screaming into the limelight. She gets aid from his family, who think Kate is not only a super editor, but also the perfect mate for Lucern. And while Lucern loves her as an editor - at a distance - he hates to admit he feels an attraction for the pushy lady.<br />Only, romance for the vampire - as well as attending a book convention - has a lot of modern day drawbacks. Kate fits in well with his family, though she finds them a bit odd. Lynsay is known for her side-aching humour, but she is at top form as Lucern is forced into the world of sunshine and supermarkets. Being your totally civilised vamp, Lucian does not go around biting necks - let's face it, in today's situation of aids, drugs and diseases only a foolish vampire runs around taking blood without knowing the donor's lifestyle! Being a smart vampire family, they have invested in a series of blood banks, and have a steady supply delivered to them. Only Kate's presence causes Lucern to miss din-din more than once, making him so famished he considers attacking a steak in the local market.<br />By the time Kate installs Lucern in the convention hotel, she is becoming concerned there is something very wrong with Lucern's health. From the mad escapade at the Ball for the Romance Times (with an appearance of Lady of RT herself!!) to Kate coming to terms with her popular vampire writer might just be writing biographies instead of fiction, it is typical Lynsay wit and brilliance.<br />Lucern is sexy, deliciously grumpy and is the new wave of vampires for the 21st Century. I have always enjoyed every book Lynsay was written, but I must say she takes the gold ring with this wonderful funny book!

Do you know why you don't want Jack Frost nipping at your nose? Or why Goblins won't drive American made cars?<br />Well, these and other pressing questions are answered at [...] or by Melanie Jackson with the style and panache of a tightrope walker in her first of the Goblin series called Traveler. It is a highly imaginative work and draws the reader into the world of Goblins, The Fey and rock singers with more than one set of mammary glands, and keeps you turning the pages, wondering what dark corridor Ms. Jackson will lead you next. Jackson, always a strong writer of historical fiction with near poetic prose, demonstrated in Belle and The Selkie, that she has a deft hand with comical romance that is delivered with a twinkle in the eye and a dimple in a cheek. She brings this talent to bear in the story of Jack Frost and Io Cyper.<br />Detroit under the Lutine Empire, plays similar to the Detroit of Rob Cop or John Carpenter's Escape from New York. The rest of the US has sort of taken a hands off of the city and turned it over to the Lutine Empire, Goblin escapees from France. They peddle Goblin Fruit, which is addictive, but they also are quietly waging warfare with biochems in Lutine Air a perfume they are preparing to market. Io Cyber feels there is potential threat to mankind, and for personal reasons, wants to see their plan stopped. Io is a member of H.U.G.S (Humans Under Ground) and is sent in to find Horroban, the head of the Lutine Empire before they find a magick crystal that could strengthen the Goblin's rule. Jack Frost a \\"death fey\\" is on the trail of the crystal, too, and links up with Io. Both quickly come to the conclusion that Io was sent in more to distract Jack from finding the crystal than helping to end the Goblin threat. However, this dynamic duo soon comes to the conclusion the perfume the goblins are making is a bigger danger to mankind.<br />So they team up to stem the rising Goblin threat, while fighting sparks that fly between them.<br />It's wonderful, refreshing bit of fun!!

Julie sets up the good girl/bad girl flip of the coin in a brilliant study of twins - women who are the same outside, but are polar opposites in life styles.  A genius turn of the screw examination of women's inner desires.  She is not afraid to rollerblade along that envelope and does so with the grace and deftness of a magician.<br />When I picture Julie Elizabeth Leto in my mind (having seen her picture and been a big fan for a couple years of her steamy, sizzling books for Harlequin's Blaze series), I see her in a t-shirt with the words \\"Good Girl's Do\\" emblazoned across her chest and Steppenwolf's \\"Born to Be Wild\\" blaring in the background!!  I don't think there is a writer anywhere that touches the cord of women long told that good girls don't, but knows secretly in their hearts and fantasy THEY DO!!  She gives the reader an empowering okay to indulge in being the aggressor - not that the males she creates are wimps, quite the contrary - but Julie's newly liberated females push the envelope.  Maureen O'Hara said in THE QUITE MAN she was not a woman to be honked at and to come a running.  Well, Julie picks up that banner and lets her characters wave it proudly!  As you might've experienced, often the envelope gives paper-cuts, but what the heck...they heal quickly!  It's the challenge and the risk, that skating on the razor's edge, which makes her books so sexy and distances her from the pack of other Harlequin writers.  She creates very down-to-earth females, flesh & blood women that jump off the pages and introduce themselves.  Whether the bad girl who is sooooo GOOD or the nice girl cutting loose, Julie believes in GIRL POWER TO THE MAX!<br />In her current book, LOOKING FOR TROUBLE, June 2003 Blaze #92 (and its sequel UP TO NO GOOD, August 2003 #100), Julie has the chance to use both the Bad Girl and Good Girl as the focus of both stories.  Twins, they are raised by their grandmother, an overly repressive woman determined to see Rory and Micki not follow in their mother's footsteps.  Mama was the \\"bad girl\\" of the small Southern town; hurt by this shame, strong-willed Nanna is determined to make sure her granddaughters remain \\"nice\\" girls.  As often happens, the harder you try to prevent something, the more you drive that person to rebel, and that is what happens to Rory Carmichael's twin sister, Micki.  She ran away from home when they were fifteen, leaving Rory to be the \\"good girl\\".  Rory loves her grandmother, and willingly stepped into the \\"good girl\\" mold to please her, but she is twenty-five now and she wants to have so fun in life.  Rory knows cutting-loose from the nice girl image in the small town would be impossible, so she takes a stand and moves to the big city where she can be a little wild without poor Nanna having a heart attack.  Rory might be out of sight, but not out of mind as Nanna is still trying to control her life.  She arranges for Rory to get a new apartment with the son of her doctor, thinking this will keep her in a safe spot.  Only, Nanna had not locked eyes with Dr. Alec Manning!<br />Never been one to stand back from the invitation in a woman's eye, Alec is a to-die-for hunk.  However, having lost his job because of an indiscretion with his Dean's wife, he has taken a vow of celibacy to prove to himself there is more to life than one woman after another.  However, he did not count on Rory turning up to live under his roof.  To kick off her new life, Rory tore two pages from a book called Sexcapades: Secret Games for Wild Adventures for Uninhibited Lovers.  The book is housed where she gets her new job and it is 1001 exciting ideas to jazz up a steamy romance.  Created so you cannot tell what the fantasies are beforehand, they are sealed in plastic and you're instructed to open them only when you are ready to put them to use.  Rory's were called STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT and SLIPPERY WHEN WET.  Determined to kick loose from that nice girl image, she cannot imagine a better target on which to hone her feminine wiles than her new sexy landlord.

During this central Middle Ages, the struggle for control of the area was complex, but little focus has been done in trying to sort out the problems of the area or how they played a roll in Scottish History.<br />Sometimes it takes an outlander to eye the period with a less prejudiced eye.  And McDonald, an instructor at the School of Continuing Studies at the University of Toronto and has taught at several Canadian Universities, turns that eye to the area where no study has been published for the last 50 years.  The end result, is a truly rounded view of the history of the Isles from 1100-1340s.  McDonald's style is very readable, presenting the Rising of the mighty Somerled, to his descendant, John MacDonald, the first Lord of the Isles.  He shows the changing political mix of the MacDougalls, MacDonalds and MacRuairis, how their internal Clan struggles affected or were affected by Scotland's struggle for freedom, how Norway was a big player the affairs.  He also addresses the Churches, the Castles that are a constant reminder of these people.<br />A wonderful book for people wishing to know about the Medieval Period of Scotland's Isles.	2003-07-03

Hairballs and Sticky Things is the charming follow-up tale to WHAT THE CAT KNOWS.  Thomas, the secondary character in the first book, helped his feline friend learn to overcome her fears and fight the germ creatures.  Thomas was last seen in the first book 'riding off into the sunset' with plans to return home.  This book picks up with Thomas' adventures as he returns to his home to be reunited with his family. (I think I had a Thomas once.  She would go off and be gone for a month or more, and then suddenly show up out of the blue again!!)  In Thomas' case, it's been years since he saw his family, and he is questioning if they missed him...hoping they missed him.  However, along the way, he makes the discovery that the evil germ creatures are hatching a plot to destroy mankind.  Thomas and his pestersome girlfriend must stop the Germ Monsters before time runs out.<br />This is another wonderful, warm, humorous tale for the whole family.  Brent does not write down to readers, as often writers tend to do in children's tales, but makes this an all family 'gift' to share.<br />If you read WHAT THE CAT KNOWS, you must read these one as well. If you have not discovered the talent of Brent Schofield, then order both tales! Perfect presents for children 9 and up.

He is tall - very tall - dark and handsome.  Oh, boy is he handsome!  He is everything a woman could dream about - only one draw back: he is alien and he just kidnapped her!  Tess knew with her luck there HAD to be something wrong with him!<br />Now hurtling through space, Tess awakens to a new sense of reality.  Aliens DO exist - great they are Hunks in Space instead of ET or the Worm Men from Men in Black.  Still, Tess is not too thrilled with the adventure.  She has a cat to feed and a career on the edge of taking off, and while sexy space aliens bring to mind all sorts of questions, she would just as soon be returned to terra asap!<br />Cohl Travers, the sexy alien in question, has no intention of doing as Tess asks.  He explains he abducted her for a reason - to save his father's life.  He is a seeker, a finder of lost treasures (sort an Indiana Jones in space!).  On a planet near to his, two brothers rule and war for control.  One faction asked Cohl to find an amulet famed to bring peace and power to a ruler.  He refused, so they kidnapped his father and are holding him hostage until Cohl delivers the lost treasure.  Only, finding the amulet is just half the problem.  He must have a singer with a precise pitch and quality of voice to sing a song to release the amulet from where it is magically held.  And Tess is that singer, the only one in the whole universe with the perfect voice.<br />Grudgingly, Tess finally agrees to help with fetching the amulet, but without Cohl telling her how dangerous the trek could be or that if she fails to sing the song precisely it will result in her death.  Oh, well, leave it to a male to neglect 'small details' such as your life hanging by the thread.  Nice to know some things do not change even though you are flying through space.  However, Tess soon comes to realize the biggest threat is to her heart!<br />Tess is so charming, so 'down to earth'.  She does not want much, just to get back to her cat and her singing career, but she cannot stop herself from being drawn to Cohl.  Budding hopes of a romance are nearly dashed when she learns Cohl is a runaway prince from the planet near the warring one.  But the heart does not listen.  Cohl regrets he is forcing Tess to help, but has little choice with his father's life in the balance.  But kidnapping Tess brings a lot of complications.  The opposition has found out he is going for the amulet and will do anything to stop him, including kidnapping and killing Tess.  Worse, he is feeling really guilty for taking Tess from her life.  And despite growing attraction, an attraction he fears is love, he will not stop until his father is freed, risking his life and Tess' in the quest.<br />Tess' and Cohl's adventure is so charming, so steamy, one of those that linger in the mind and heart long after the book has been put down.  Ms. Barry shows a brilliance for humour and timing, an uncanny ability to add that touch to a tense situation without it slipping over into farce.  She creates strong characters that leap off the page and takes your hand, pulling you into a super adventure, fraught with space aliens, personal robots with an attitude, tense battles, and a quest that rivals the search for the Holy Grail.<br />Barry, a first time author, shows control, a strong voice and the magical ability to conjure marvelous characters.  She 'sees' her alien worlds so she is able to make the readers see them, experience them as well.

Kathleen Nance has two very popular romance lines running for Dorchester Publishing, the Immortals about the children of the Ancient Greek Gods and the Djinn. And if you have not read any of Nance's Djinn, do not pick one up with The American Television show \\"I Dream of Jeannie\\" in mind. Her wonderful books are smart, savvy, and oh so sexy.  With Nance's djinn, they do not pop out of a bottle, they never call anyone master and they do not grant wishes though they have the ability - unless bound against their will.<br />The Djinn live in a desert land called Kaf. But events in the Djinns' lives keep drawing them to Terra - earth. In an intricate tale, Zayne is the Minstrel of Kaf. But not merely a musician, he is the Keeper of the very essence of Kaf. Through his music he conjures rain, protects the land to live in harmony, or could destroy it. So naturally, it is vital he maintains balance and imbues Kaf with those powers or the Djinns' very world could be destroyed. There used to be more than one Minstrel to Kaf, but deaths claimed the other two, so it falls on Zayne's shoulders to bear the weight of Kaf's very existence. However, he is very worried. Time has come for him to take his mate, a female who gives his male nature gentleness and keeps him in balance. A woman with a voice that matches his own, so they may sing together for the security of Kaf. Since he needs this mate, his music has become unstable. He does not know why, but there is suddenly magick in him - Terra magick - not ma-at - the magick of the djinn, and the two cannot exist together. He uses a conjuring spell to locate the woman who is to be his zaniya, and the face that appears is Madeline Fairbanks, a woman from Terra.<br />Madeline has her share of problems in her life. She is about to lose her job to a odd ball writer, because she cannot appear in public. What good is a PR person when they cannot make announcements about a writers work? Worse, he says she is dull looking, needs to get stylish. She has till the Summer Festival of St. John's Eve to become fashionable, get over her stage fright and obtain him an interview with her stepfather, Cyrus Cromwell.  Madeline is torn by his demands. She needs this job to keep her mother, a brilliant singer, in a nursing home after her breakdown a year ago. Madeline has no proof, but she know Cyrus is responsible, that he used black magick to make her mother such a popular star. But something went wrong, and it ended with her mother's mental collapse and Cyrus vanishing. Worse, she is low on money and just cannot afford to live in the apartment she is staying.<br />Just as she thinks things cannot get worse, Tildy, an old friend, comes to the rescue and says she is going away for the Summer and asked Madeline to come house-sit. Madeline is delighted, for it means no rent for the Summer. Only, trouble is she has to share the house with Tildy's friend, Zayne.<br />In a short time, Madeline begins to find out Zayne is a djinn. This at first sets her against him, because she equates djinn magick with the same manipulation that Cyrus used on Irene to make her reach the top. But she soon comes to see Zayne is nothing like Cyrus. Zayne is tender, beautiful and oh so sexy!<br />Zayne is horrified to discover the woman who is to be his<br />zaniya has stage fright, and when Madeline figures out it stems from a spell Cyrus used on her, he vows to help her find Cyrus. Further confusion comes when he hears her singing in the shower and she cannot carry a tune in a bucket. How can his zaniya not sing? He soon discovers Madeline's inner magick stems from her ability to dance. The dance works to balance him, but she still needs the ability to perform in public so they set a trap to lure Cyrus from hiding. They did not count on Cyrus being more powerful than they ever imagine, he knows about djinns and he is determined to bind Zayne's power to answer to him.<br />Nance gives a steamy, sexy, complex tale, that takes you to the magickal world of Kaf and the lush world of New Orleans, and a wonderful romance that will touch your heart. Her writing style is as lyrical as the subject matter and she just gets better with each book.<br />I highly recommend all the other books in the Djinn series, though each can stand alone as well, they are the most delightful when read in series.ckal world of Kaf and the lush world of New Orleans, and a wonderful romance that will touch your heart.

It is a delight to see talent coming full bloom - and that is what Julie Elizabeth Leto is doing. She is, without doubt, one of the strongest writers in the Harlequin Blaze series. I used to read these regularly, but got away from them because the good writers had moved on and newer writers were just not thrilling me. Then something made me pick up one of Leto's first books and WOW was I impressed. She is a strong writer, full of quirky wit, sizzling hot when it comes to her sexy scenes, but she never fails to understand romance is the foundation. Her characters are vivid, so vivid the leap off the pages, full flesh and blood. But I think she reaches perfection with JUST WATCH ME.<br />Leto is in love with what she writes, you can feel her devotion to the genre in every book, but she loves to push the envelop. In a market where female leads often run from their sexuality, Leto embraces it giving you 'good girls do' with panache. Jillian Hennessey is a good girl. She saved herself for marriage, only to have the louse not value her gift. Since, then she has ruthlessly suppressed her wants and desires, ignored the long lonely nights, giving all to her job as a Private Investigator, with the desire to one-day assuming control of The Hennessey Group, her uncle's firm. The middle child of five, she learnt long ago she had to hustle to stand out in a group, so when her brother became a cop, she moved into private investigations, following her uncle around since she was 11. Her whole life was geared to becoming good enough to take over the reins of the Hennessey Group, and as her Uncle tended to slide in his elder years, she spent time covering for his small mistakes. But suddenly, her brother, Patrick, had retired from the police force and joined the Hennessey group with intention of assuming control. Her last chance to prove she deserved what she has worked for her whole life comes with the stakeout Stanley Davison. Davison sued the Tampa Police Department for millions of dollars when he received injuries during a police change. Nearly everyone involved believed he was faking his injuries but no one could prove it. Jillian lands the assignment to stakeout Davison's home with all sorts of high tech snooping gear.<br />As she is moving in next door, she spies her drop-dead gorgeous neighbour, a distraction she can live without. However, after her uncle makes one of his little mistakes, she can hardly ignore the man. Instead of wiring Davison house with hidden camera's, he had his tech people wire Cade Lawrence's house. Giving into more than a little curiosity, she watched Cade move about his house.<br />Only, Cade has been watching the sexy redhead next door. So when a basket of lemons and a box of sugar cubes are left on his door by mistake (so he thinks), he is more than delighted to play delivery boy. In quick time, they are shooting sparks off each other. Jillian is tempted into an affair with him, but soon begins to suspect her sexy neighbour is more than he pretends after observing him observing Stanley.<br />In a series of sexy spy vs. spy, Leto leads you on a merry chase of fantasies, giving into secret desires and finding what is most important in life.

The beautiful - but knows it - Lady Charlotte Collins, like all women of the Ton during Regency period, were raised to be vain, shallow and think little past the fashions of the day.  They were taught to be gorgeous, in style and with only a generally nattering of polite conversation, never showing any amount of intelligence lest they be called a bluestocking. This was a doubled-edged sword for Charlotte was both the epitome of the Regency debutant, but she also chafes under the restrictions.  Cousin of the vivacious Gillian Leigh (Gillians story is told in Noble Intentions where she married Noble Britton), Charlotte shocked the proper and stuffy Ton and outraged her family, by eloping with a second son of Italian noble, just after Gillian married Noble.  But now she is back.  A window, penniless - thanks to the hatred of her mother-in-law -  Charlotte is more than ready to embrace the shallowness and adoration of the Ton again.  Only, she is shocked to find the door of the Ton slammed in her face.  Her father was furious with his daughter for the elopement scandal, and though now dead, her brother Matthew is determined to pick up where daddy-dearest left off and see she is not received by any of the families of polite British Society.  Charlotte rushes to Gillian for aid and support, but Gillian, now a mother, is off to the West Indies with Noble to inspect their plantation.  She gives her sage advice: marry well and marry soon.<br />Once Charlotte embraces the notion, one man comes to mind: Alistair Macgregor, known as Dare.  He looks well on her - i.e. they make a beautiful couple - he is an Earl, and he is still unmarried.  There were sparks five years ago, and Dare likely would have offered for Charlotte, but when he inherited the Earldom, he inherited a mountain of debts that would take three life times to pay off.<br />In London, to see his sister Patricia married, and to find financing for his marine steam engine, he was thrilled to see Charlotte again, disappointed to know he feels the same, but still cannot offer for her because he has nothing to offer any woman.  Especially, he has nothing to offer Charlotte, who will need to be supported in lavish style.  To his surprise, she proposes married to him!  He declines, which does not deter Charlotte.  She sets up a situation to trap him into marriageand what a situation!  The plan works, but suddenly things are not going as Charlotte planned.<br />A faulty codpiece, a circus for a wedding - literally!  - and a husband who refuses to bed his wife because he is determined, she may have caught him and used his honorable ways to get him to marry her, but she cannot force him to be a husband, a lady just has to take matters into her own handssuch as shooting her husbandto cheer him up, mind you!!!<br />In Macalisters third novel - (Improper English and Noble Intentions her others - with Men In Kilts, A Girls Guide to Vampires and Heat Wave due out later this year) she shows she is a force her to stay.<br />Dare is enchanting and Charlotte and her murdering the language is a howl.

A message lures Anne to a dark alley, where someone attempts to kidnap her, but she is rescued by a dark, handsome stranger calling himself Henry Frye.

Since the title came with a lot of debts, Lady Blythe was 'sold' off to a Scottish nobleman, who was not much of a man and certainly not noble.

I really enjoyed Claudia Dain's TO BURN, but A KISS TO DIE FOR is light-years beyond that. Very strong in creating characters, leads and supporting, Claudia score of powerhouse knock out with this Western. And when you compared the two heroines it is amazing. In TO BURN, her heroine is a warrior woman in spirit, willing to die rather than be conquered. Anne Ross is precisely the opposite.<br />Dain's writing is mesmerizing. Let's say I am not a big fan of Westerns. Give me a Highlander in a Kilt or a Knight in Amour and I am one happy lassie. From the start, this book hooked me and would not let me go. I would get SO exasperated with Anne's \\"yes, ma'am\\"s that it about made me scream, but Dain balanced Anne's timid mouse with a gamma rouge of Anne Stuart's bad boy league quality: a bounty hunter the whole town of Abilene shuns. Jack Scullard was such a marvelous character that he kept me reading even when Anne ticked me off. Anne lets the whole town treat her like some half-wit, her grandmother demoralize her and browbeat her, so I wanted to smack her. But Anne slowly starts to change, as does the whole town, after Jack comes to stay, and her slow transformation from a milquetoast to a grown woman who will fight for what she wants keeps you spellbound to the end.<br />Anne Ross meets every train that comes to Abilene, watching, waiting. So she is there when Jack Scullard comes to town, shoving his latest bounty prisoner before him. The whole town is ready to jump and blame Jack for everything happening in the town, and he does little to correct this reputation. When it slowly becomes knowledge there is a serial killer following the old cattle trail, killing young beautiful women as he goes, suspicions falls on Jack. Or is it Bill doing the killing, the sly land dealer who courts Anne when he comes to town?<br />Anne lives in a house of abandoned women. Her grandfather left her grandmother, though we could hardly blame him. Her father left her mother; a lawman that turned bad and became an outlaw. Her uncle left her aunt, driven off by a woman too weak to stand up to her mother. And Anne, a beautiful woman too timid of her own shadow, watching the trains coming and going in her life, waiting, hoping for someone to come or to someday get enough spine to run away from a house of abandoned women, from a town that was dying.<br />At first, she hopes to use Jack to scare Bill away from proposing marriage, but she is drawn to Jack. But she knows to love a man is to watch him leave and never come back, to grow old before your time. Jack is on the trail of the killer and will not rest until him catching him. Jack knows he is not the kinds of a man a woman like Anne wants, but that does not stop him from wanting her, and from being determined to protect her.<br />Anne and Jack will take over your heart. The mystery is strong enough, but does not overpower the romance. The writing is vivid, rich in historical details, provocative, moving, mesmerizing, and once again, shows Dorchester Publishing has some of the best writers around and gives them the freedom to produce works from the heart that are fresh and original.rned bad and became an outlaw.

These are not dark and deadly vamps, but very romantic ones.  All the tales were very well written and special.  I especially loved Lynsay Sands' tale.  I have been a long time reader of her works so I come to expect things about her writing that is very familiar.  Lynsay's fans, who expect her typical brand of hysterical historicals will be in for a treat as she shows yet another new side after her first contemporary The Loving Daylights, offers a much more tender and intensely romance Lynsay.  Though I love her magic humour, this tale surprised me and touched my heart.  (She will again bring you another vampire tale later in the year, as she once again pulls another hat trick  give you yet another showcases for her wonderful talent).<br />If you are looking for deadly vamps that are often more monster than man, these tales might seem tame to you.  But if you are looking for troubled souls and woman that will risk all to be with the man they love, then you will find all these tales very heartwarming.	2003-04-10

Lynsay Sands is a super historical romance writer with a light touch that often ventures into sidesplitting giggles.  She is one of the best at leaving you feeling good all over when you finish reading her novels.  This is her first contemporary romance and it is a fun romp!  In the Ladies from B*L*I*S*S* series (various writers) by Dorchester Publishers, this is the 3rd entry in the spoofs on James Bond books, right down to the parody of the 1960&#8217;s covers.  In Lynsay&#8217;s typical warm and funny style, she gives you one delicious romp!  WARNING: if you have a chest cold or broke ribs do not read.  If you are in a public place and do not want people looking at you - do no read there!!  You will laugh so hard you might hurt or embarrass yourself!!<br />Jane Spyrus makes gizmos for B*L*I*S*S* spies - and wow what gadgets!!  Won't spoil the surprises and tell you about them, but let&#8217;s say you will be howling from page one and Q would most certainly blush!  Due to malfunctions, Jane takes some of her gadgets home to work on improvements.  Her neighbor, Edie, has a hot date with a mystery man, so she comes by to borrow a few things from Jane.  Without realizing, she takes one of Jane&#8217;s spy gadgets that contains a tracking device.  Jane figures she will get it back from her later, only Edie does not come home.  The tracker comes in handy when Edie&#8217;s sexy brother, Abel Andretti (no groans please!), turns up looking for his missing sister.<br />So Jane, her wheelchair bound, ex-spy grandmother, Gran&#8217;s dog Tinkle and Abel are suddenly in hot pursuit of Edie who stumbled onto a super spy ring ala T*H*R*U*S*H*, and was kidnapped and smuggled in a back of car from Canada into California.  Abel is totally unaware of Jane&#8217;s true line of work, but soon finds out there is more than meets the eye where this lady is concerned, especially after she knocks him out and handcuffs him in the back of her van.  Jane reports back to B*L*I*S*S*, figuring they would send in the &#8220;real spies&#8221; to wrap things up.

The Stone of Destiny or Lia Fail, also called the Stone of Scone, was for centuries the coronation \\"throne\\" of the Celtic Kings of Scotland.  Nearly 700 years ago, Edward Plantagenet, King of England supposedly stole the Stone from the Scots in 1296 after his forces defeated John de Balliol's army of Scots at the Battle of Dunbar.  Edward carried it back to Westminster Abbey and had a throne built around it in 1301 for the English Monarchs.  So the last King of the Scots to sit up the Stone was John de Balliol.  In 1996 the English returned the Stone of Destiny in a big production on the eve of Scotland's partial independence from England.<br />Only the question has been asked for 700 years:  is this the real Stone of Destiny or a mockery?  The drawings of the Stone from that period (you can see them on the seals of the Kings), show a taller stone, high enough to be a true chair, with Erse drawings and symbols all around the base. Described as a hard, glassy black stone, it was smooth, slick on the sides - a far cry from the rough-cut, slab of red sandstone Edward the Longshanks dragged back from Scotland.  So the questions came.  Had the Scots hurriedly made the substitution and hidden the true Stone of Destiny away?  Did they hurried quarry this red sandstone slab and put it in Lia Fail's place giving the English King a fake to carry away?  Two years after taking away the Stone Edward came back to Scone Abbey and ripped it apart.  Was he hunting for the real stone?  Another scenario, Edward arrived to find the Stone gone, and in a bit of perverse humour, had the sandstone slab quickly chiseled out and paraded before the Scottish Nobility in August 1296 at Berwick when they arrived to sign the Ragman Roll and take oath of allegiance to an English King.  He knew it was fake, knew the Scots knew, but also was aware they could not say so out loud or else risk his Angevin temper when they refused to produce it.  At one point after Edward's death, Edward II made a promise to return the Stone to Robert the Bruce.  The promise went unfulfilled.  Some say the Bruce refused it knowing it was a fake.  This only added fuel to the belief this was not the real Stone.<br />If this stone sitting in Edinburgh Castle today is not the real Lia Fail, then what happened to it?  That is the question Scotland's great writer the late Nigel Tranter turned his attention to when he penned The Stone.  This book, written in 1958, has been reprinted several times, and again drew a lot of interest in the middle 90's when the discussion came up about returning it to Scotland.  Finding a copy was hard.  Tranter blends myth, fact and speculation into a satisfying tale of a race to discover the hiding place of the real stone and protect it from those bent on using it.  He weaves his love for Scotland, its history and legend in to one of his best works.  Those not familiar with the lore of the Stone of Destiny or perhaps has not read Tranter before, I cannot think of a better introduction.  Once in a great while, there comes a writer that has the ability to `walk in the past', to make you join him on that journey.

But this ranks up there with those as being the best in this series.<br />This is a warm wonderful tale of an Irish lass, Moya Mahoney, a lass of Eire.  She loves the small village life and the closeness of its people.  She keeps the traditions of Auld in her small village of Killarney, running a Bed and Breakfast during the day and spending her soft nights in the tavern downstairs.  Singing songs of Ancient Eire from the heart and soul, keeping alive the Irish Heroes and Legends.  She is pure Irish and proud of it.<br />But an outcomer, an American, but one with Irish roots by name of Rory O'Brien.  And he is just the opposite.  He not only disdains her love of all things Irish, he shuns his Irish heritage and worse, plans a massive factory in Killarney.  But it's over Moya's dead body and she draws the lines and is determined to see her village not lose it's precious heritage, to MacDonalds, Burger Kings, pollutions and neighbours that have not care for the life she so treasures.  He finds one tough opponent as Moya rallies the villages against the idea, though a few would love the money it would bring to the impoverished.  The two lock horns frequently, but the feelings of frustration, determination and down right ire turn into passion.<br />The characters are a delight, and anyone will love Moya's repatriating of the man who refuses to treasure the precious of the Irish ways.	2003-03-22

My Grandfather's home was covered with this items that looked wonderful.  As I grew I came to appreciate the beautiful and craftsmanship in weapons that dominated warfare for millenniums, until the coming of the more clumsy equaliser guns.  Anyone can pick up a gun and fire it, but to use a sword with proficiency was something akinned to a ballet.  Thrust, parry, block, defence and offence, from claymore to &eacute;p&eacute;es were breathtaking to watch, even more so was the feeling of hold these metal wonders in your hands.  So it was not surprising I went on to collect swords.  And this book satisfies that love of the weapon.  With various contributors, they trace the earliest origins from stone area, bronze age and bronze age to the swords of World Wars I and II.  It covers swords from the Middle East, the  unsurpassed Japanese Samurai blades, Swords used in China and Central Asia, even into India, Africa and Pre-Conquest America.<br />It is LOADED with colour pictures of the weapons, historical paintings showing them in use, even details spectrograms on the composition of the swords, how they were made, used from the most basic to the most ornamental dress swords.  Every page just is simply amazing.<br />Highly recommended any any sword collection, anyone interested in knowing more about these weapons that forged our history and especially of interest to historical writer and historical romance writers. An Absolute MUST for them.	2003-03-22

I have seen in many reviews of historical romances (and have felt it myself) there is a dearth of historical in historical romances. The only difference between the historical romance and a contemporary is they ride horses instead of drive cars. Often it's REALLY hard to tell WHAT period you are in because so much of the historical has been cut away. The editors and publishers push for the leads to be on 'centre stage' and unless the history is driving importance, then they cut it. Which is a shame. There are a bunch of wonderful writers that can give you history AND ROMANCE. The trend came about because of competing with the net, they wanted a faster, leaner reads. Which is fine for a spell, but people are tired of this. Books are expensive and they want MORE for the money. They wants the sweeping panorama of history in all it's glory.<br />I am GLAD to say Pamela Clare gives you a TRUE historical romance. It has romance, passion AND history. I almost felt like I had picked up a pre-net Historical romance - so a BIG round of applause for Clare writing this wonderful book and to DORCHESTER Publishing for ONCE AGAIN giving their writers the room to do books THEIR WAY!!! So if you wish for a historical romance that is MORE....please give this first time author a chance. You will not regret it!!<br />I applaud Clare for dealing with the period, dealing with bondsman and slaves in a tender, yet not flinching fashion. I think many writers stay away from the period of 1700-1870s US because of the slavery issue. If you are accurate you turn people away, if you a kinder gentler version of GWTW people dismiss you. Clare chose this period and gives excellent treatment. And kudos to both her and her publisher!!<br />Alex Kenleigh is a rich English shipbuilding. He warns his dissolute younger brother that he will no longer support his wicked lifestyle, that he is on a pocket money allowance, disgusted with his brother getting a teenage girl pregnant and<br />then turning his back on her while she dies trying to rid herself of the unwanted pregnancy. On the heels of this, someone mysterious catches Alex leaving his mistress' home and nearly beats him to dead. Worse, they have arranged to have a body left to be identified at Alex, while Alex is sent to the Americas as a criminal called Cole Braden. He is to serve 14 years as an indentured servant in Virginia, reported to be a defiler of women.<br />Cassie Blakewell is running her father's plantation because her younger brother is just a child and her father is suffering from madness. A young woman in this period running a going concern would have been prey for either men pushing her into marriage hoping to gain control of the vast plantation or from do gooders demanding to do what is right and put a man in charge. Especially since her father has left her with a mountain of debts that it will take years to pay. The Creditors are willing to wait as long as they believe the story she is putting about that her father was in England. If she cannot keep this story going, the plantation will be seized for debts and sold.<br />When the ship comes in with slaves and bondsmen for sale, Cassie buys the release of Cole Braden and the slave that had<br />protected him and kept him alive for the long voyage. She buys him in a charitable act thinking he will die. But he does not, in fact in a short time he regains his strength. Only Alex is now furious to learn that is thought to be Cole, a criminal, and has been sold to Cassie for 14 years. He tried to prove he is Alex, but with communications as such during this period it will take months.<br />Cassie and Alex has a slow burn attraction to each other, with Cassie not knowing whether to believe Alex or not. Yet, it does not stop the attraction. Still they have to keep distance for it could mean Alex's death if caught with her.<br />Add into the mix, a foppish neighbour who is obsessively planning on marrying Cassie, pushed by a father who wants her lands. With strong supporting characters, this is a wonderful romance in the old fashion style of REAL Historical romances, with a good eye to details of the period.<br />So APPLAUSE to Clare for writing it and sticking to her guns, and to Dorchester and the consistent policy of letting their writer WRITE.<br />Hopefully, this is a new trend in old style historical romance!.

I reviewed this and got many emails moaning it was suddenly out of print.  Well, here is your chance to catch a nifty Stuart gem no longer in print.  Molly woke in the hospital to find she could not recall anything of her life, not the dead man who was found in her car, the 350 thousand dollars - nor the husband. This book was a little rushed because of being a series, and would have been much better as a big book, but it still is a very good read. Molly leaves the hospital to return to Winter's Edge, the only home she has ever know. Yet suddenly, she is a stranger there. She does not recall her husband, nor the various people in their lives, and she especially does not to know the woman everyone says she is. She does not like the clothes she wears, does not like the bedroom she supposedly decorated, and she cannot believe she behaved as everyone said she did. She knows Patrick, her husband hates her, but not why. And she does not know who is trying to kill her. Stuart delivers as she always does, just wishes this one had a little more room to deliver fully.<br />The second tale by Debra Webb is a Harlequin Intrigue<br />reprint Safe by His Side (Intrigue, 583) which is also out of  print. Is one in a series of Intrigues centred around a private detective firm called the Colby Agency.  In this one, Kate is determined to get her 'man' even if it meant tracking him down in the great Smokey Mountains of Tennessee.  The man she is after is Raine a former government agent.  He has been betrayed and set up by someone with in the agency, and until he can find out who he is running for his life.  Kate tracks him down, but just as she is about to move in she is attacked by the people after him and looses her memory.  She winds up at Raines hideout, no memory and must now depend upon the very man she was tracking to save them both.	2003-03-19

Michael McGan brings his lay back humour to bear on everything from vacations in Jamaica, sundown worship in the Keyes, Terrible Twos and Soap Operas to Barbie & Ken and Norse Mythology.<br />His ruminations remind me of 'diaries' that were kept of travels and daily impressions during the 1800's. These are often quite witty, but are also a microcosmic slices of life from that period. Most of these treasures of insights and information sit in some trunk in the attic, food for silverfish, so it's a delight to have this as a panacea for the everyday stress you face in life.<br />If you enjoyed Real Men Don't Eat Quiche or Blue Highways, you will enjoy this witty grump on life's foibles.	2003-03-17

I loved the Vampires (at least up to Body Thief) and adored the Mummy, but I think Witching Hour is her best.  The HUGE book is absolutely compelling from beginning to end.  The Book moves from Modern day story of a young woman, the end product of centuries of witches that are under control of &quot;the Man&quot; called Lasher( because he could make the trees lash when he was angry) into the past of her ancestors.  Each generation of the &quot;Mayfair Witches&quot; there was a chosen female that 'inherited' the man, and he brought power, he brought madness.<br />The book leisurely details the woman's modern day life, returning to New Orleans for the funeral of her mother, the base of the family of witches male and female, and comes to terms with her heritage, Lasher and a destiny plotted for her leading to a horrific coming: bring Lasher into this world.  We see a lot of the tale through the eyes of the people around this family, as the agent for the Talamasca (seen in the Vampire Cycle), the watchers and recorders of witches and vampires, collect the tales on the family.<br />It is a leisurely paced book, that brings one into mind of New Orleans' slower pace, but it's spellbinding, haunting, deceptively mesmerising.  When she moves the tale of the Mayfair witches into the past and traces each generation of witch from early Scotland on, she is breathtaking.  Rice uses ancient Scots lore and gives it a new life in her evocative, provoking tale that will keep you hypnotised as few works do.<br />Don't think she was better before or since.  It's simply a master piece.  Followed up with Lasher, Taltos and Merrick.	2003-03-14

I would start this review by saying this is one of the top three of my favourite JAKs...but then I stopped and realised I have 12 to 15 top three JAKS!  Yes, she is a formula writer.  If you don't care for the formula, then don't buy her.  Simply enough.  For those that appreciate her deft wit, her sharp repartee, there is no one like her.  I adore her writings and think this is a one of her better ones.<br /><br />Mattie Sharp stared down at the man dressed all in white, watching him die.  When he uttered to \\"tell him reign in hell\\", she knew she'd stepped into the middle of something very bad.  The \\"him\\" was Hugh Abbott, a man she has been trying to avoid for a year, a man she once offered to follow to the ends of the earth - or in this case to St. Gabriel's Island.<br /><br />Hugh Abbott was her aunt's 'pet wolf'.  He was a security expert and troubleshooter for the large multinational business her aunt inherited.  Since her aunt adores Hugh's genes, she fixed him up with her niece, Ariel.  Maddie watched the mismatched romance go down in flames, knowing from the first time she saw him her sister was all wrong for Hugh.  Maddie stood by, waiting, knowing she was falling in love with him.  When the expected breakup came, Maddie made her pitch.  A candlelight dinner, a good bottle of wine, and a memorable night of lovemaking, in Maddie's mind, were the formula to Hugh's heart - or so she thought.  Only, when the morning came for Hugh to leave for St. Gabriel's Isle, he refused to take Maddie.  He tried to tell her it was bad timing.  He was angry over the break up of his engagement with Ariel, but it came out all wrong, with him saying Maddie was \\"just not his type\\".<br /><br />So hurt by the rejection, Maddie made sure she stayed away from Hugh.  This was not easy, since her Aunt is determined to get Hugh in to the family, and is most willing to help play matchmaker.  Hugh, once he got over the breakup with Ariel, saw he wanted Maddie, but she would not accept any letters or calls from him.  To Maddie's aggravation, four times during the year, he conspired with her aunt to bring Maddie and him together.  All four times, Maddie left town rather than face the man she now sees as a \\"big mistake\\".<br /><br />When her aunt sent her to pick up a medieval sword from the Island of Purgatory - from the man who was at her feet dying - she figured it was an excuse to get Hugh and Maddie together.  Her plane was due to land in St. Gabriel's, so to thwart the<br />matchmaking plans, she took another flight to Purgatory.  Hugh is hot on her heels,and she is very glad for the comfort of his arms.  Only, now they are running for their lives through the jungles.  Despite their predicament, Hugh sees this as a chance to win Maddie back.  However, Maddie is fed up with being \\"second place\\" to her beautiful and gifted sister, and is determined not to be hurt by Hugh again.<br /><br />Maddie is charming, funny and warm; Hugh is a wonderfully droll 'throw-back'.

Only, now they are running for their lives through the jungles.  Despite their predicament, Hugh sees this as a chance to win Maddie back.  However, Maddie is fed up with being \\"second place\\" to her beautiful and gifted sister, and is determined not to be hurt by Hugh again.<br /><br />Maddie is charming, funny and warm; Hugh is a wonderfully droll 'throw-back'.  They will win your heart.  It's Jayne Ann Krentz are her very best.	2003-03-07

This is the second in the trilogy of the Army of the Potomac and I enjoyed it even more.  I had been reading Gone with the Wind, stuck in bed with a terrible chest cold.  I was planning on finishing it, but my Auntie's Beagle Pepper decided GWTW was good eating...so I pick up Mr. Lincoln's army and was hooked.<br />Bruce Catton writes like no other about the American Civil War.  His insight makes you believe he was there, that he lived through it, coming from his years of listening to the veterans in his hometown. And though he is a Yankee, he strives very hard to be impartial.  He tries, but surprisingly I sense an admiration for the colourful soldiers of the South slipping through the prose.<br />Mr. Lincoln's Army, centred around the opening of the war, the trouble's Lincoln had with find a general to run his army that wanted to fight.  The \\"On to Virginia\\" cry, meaning march about 50 miles down the road and capture the Capitol of the Confederacy, was something Lincoln could not seem to rid from the mind of his commanders...he knew you had to cut off the head of the Army of Northern Virgina, not capture their capitol to end the conflict.  Was surprising, Lincoln understood this so clearly, yet the trained Generals never could until Grant.<br />His struggles to find the perfect commander continues in GLORY ROAD.  This book, quite possibly is Catton's best work,  following Lincoln's army and the changes in Generals from the battles of Fredericksburg to Gettysburg.  He gives you insight into each General, whiskered Burnsides inheriting command from \\"Little Mac\\" McClellan, to the rough-edged Hooker at Chancellorsville, and then the slow but steady Meade at Gettysburg.  He was not flashy, but he would fight.<br />Catton brings these battles alive, but more than that, he gives you to the ability to see the war through the eyes of the common soldiers, showing you everyday life, the small touches that transcends just being another history book. Like Capt. James Hall of the 2nd Maine Battery.  Catton's description of dashing Hall having a discussion under cannon fire, with Southern blasting away, yet he acts if nothing is happening.  When one shell bursts too close, he dismounts, goes to one of his guns, and fires at that the ONE particular Southern gun that DARED disturbed his conversations, remounts and returns to the talk like nothing had happened!! These snippets are just too marvellous!!<br />His prose reads more like fiction; it's so enjoyable.  I know it has been fashionable for many of the newer voices in the field to garner attention.  However, if you really want a view of the War Between the States that is more like a visit with a time machine, then you must read the genius of Catton.he 2nd Maine Battery.

Though a massive effort is launch to find the killer, he remains at large for years. Then the Killer strikes three years after the first murder, killing another young girl in the same brutal fashion, and leaving her body only a short distance from the first. The police do not give up, but this man continually evades detection until several years later Scotland Yard comes a calling with a new tool: DNA. The first time its was used to solve a police case, and to actually track a killer not just to reinforce a case. In a very controversial move, nearly 4000 men in and around the town of Narborough are tested, everyone from teen to old man are 'blooded' meaning their DNA of their blood is tested against the samples of the killer. Never has any police force taken such a massive Orwellian move, compelling every male able to commit the crime to come forward for testing. Even so, the killer continually evades being blooded, but it was a matter of time and dogged police work.<br />Warbaugh's best work since The Onion Field, may be uncomfortable for some people because of the details of the murders etc, others - believers of the right of individual - will be upset with the Orwellian dragnet, but its a fascinating detailed account that often compels as repels in the same breath.	2003-03-03

It's hard to write a good review for a good book.  You want to do it justice.  It's even harder to write one for a SUPER book.  And that is my task.<br />Katie MacAlister joined my writer's group this time last year and so I rushed off to read her first book NOBLE INTENTIONS.  She really delighted me with her freshness.  I have read thousands of romance books, and so few impress me with how original their treatment is.  So many settle for tried and true where the books fade into fog as soon as you put them down.  Katie's first book was sharp, funny and so FRESH.  So I was eager to read more from her.  This happened to me once before with Lynsay Sands.  Her first book was so special that it left you wanting more.  We had to wait two long years, but fortunately she had kept us supplied regularly since.  It was a years wait for Katie's second book, but OH WHAT A BOOK!!!!!!!!!!<br />Since I have lived my life on both sides of the pond, I grew with an oddball humour that delighted in the quirkiness of the Brits.  Katie MacAlister understands this and puts it on a showcase guarantee to have you HOWLING.  To say this book is a contemporary romance it to say the Titanic was a ship.  It is warm, loving, sexy and quirky with a capital Q.  Katie's freshness gives you a tale you will not forget.  She burrows a way into your heart and leaves you so sorry when you have to put it down.  Due to time, I rarely reread any books any more, Outside of Lynsay's, JAK gems and a couple Linda Howards.  I will reread this, likely more than once.  It's just that good.<br />Alexandra Freemar is a Yank on a two month stay in London to write her first romance book.  Told in first person, it's a little jarring for first few pages.  Years ago, Gothics were mostly in first person, but that style faded and first person is an oddity in today's market.  However, Katie wields first person with a razor sharp wit, and you will soon be in the flow.  Alix is a bit of a failure at life.  29, divorced and with the mother from hell reminding her of all her failures, so she views her writing this book as a make or break point in her life.  She does not have time for romance, though she is not against a quick summer fling.  Her landlady says she has MR. PERFECT for Alix, but he won't be interested in a quick fling.<br />The next day she meets Detective Inspector Alexander Black, a Scotland Yard detective in the Internet Squad who closes down porn sites on the net. He lives in the apartment just above Alix's and just happens to be \\"Mr Right\\" that her landlady wanted to introduce her to, sure they are a perfect match. They are instantly attracted to each other, but having been hurt so many times in the past, Alix is scared of how strongly she is falling in love with Alex.  Their romance is wickedly funny, steamy sexy and dead on.  Katie sprinkles the mix with warm and loving, strong supporting character, that are as vivid as the leads, and you end up wishing you could live in this zany apartment building.<br />But the romance is only half the joy.  You actually get to read Alix's 'WIP' (Work in Progress), some of the most terrible purple prose ever put to pen as she drags her book around London asking for everyone's opinions and input from the grocery to her hairdresser, and learning in the process 'too many cooks spoil the soup'.<br />I saw one reviewer say they got tired of Alix's self-centredness ...and sorry, they missed this point.  Alix's is a wounded, long-unloved bird and she is going through healing and rebirth.  Sure the readers gets ticked at Alix, just as the other characters do! You see, it not as selfishness, but SURVIVAL, her defence of being hurt yet once again.<br />It's a brilliant, witty romp that is just so original it will go on that keeper shelf and be visited like an old friend.<br />Only thing, I may have to sue Katie....I hurt myself laughing so hard I might have re-broke that rib that pained me so when I was reading Lynsay'sLoving Daylights!!<br />Fortunately we won't have to wait a year for her next book since NOBLE DESTINY will be out in May 2003!  Can hardly wait!!<br />WISE Writers and Readers Book of the Month March 2003Loving Daylights!!<br />Fortunately we won't have to wait a year for her next book since NOBLE DESTINY will be out in May 2003!

It's one I use at the first &quot;go to&quot; anytime I need a fast run down on a Clan or a Tartan, this is what I pick up.  Nifty wee book with punch!  Give the Clan Name in English and Gaelic, Motto's Old and Altered, Clan Badge with description, Origin on Clan Name, Plant Badge, War Cry and Pipe Music, with full plate colour of their tartan(s) and a surprisingly in-depth mini history for each Clan.<br />But that is not all!  It has a short history of Scotland from Origins, moving into the development of the Clans, the ranks within a Clan and various Customs.  Has the Dress of the Tartan with several different examples.  There is a Family and Clan name, so you can see what Septs belong to what Clan(s) A Scots History Time Line and even a mini Scot-Gaelic Glossary of Place Names and one of Heraldic Terms.<br />For a wee book its size, you cannot believe all the information in it.  A must for anyone wanting to know more about the tartans and the histories of the Highland Clans.	2003-03-02

The history is very good, more than a Wee Guide to...and is loaded with 100s of gorgeous colour photos of every aspects of the wonderful and beauty of Scotland, from its stone circles to jewellery, portraits and naturally, the castles.<br />After the Epilogue, it has a quickie Clan and Tartan section, so the book is everything for the person wishes to learn a little more than 'Braveheart' about Scotland. Likely one of the best in this range of lots of photos and a good start on its history.	2003-03-02

Sherman, Sheridan and Grant, were...well, common.  They were hard drinking men, willing to sacrifice any number - thousands of men - believing the ends justified the means.  They were not tall, handsome or dashing, so maybe that is why the Generals of the confederacy live so vividly in our imaginations.  A lot of the Southerns were gentlemen, they were the epitome of the genteel South - or at least how we often see it in our imaginations, when we can divorce the spectre of Slavery from that vision.  They were men in grey, who rode off to fight for what they believed, and no one more so than Nathan Bedford Forrest.<br />Only Forrest does not fit that stereotypical Southern Gentleman.  He was born in a log-cabin (as was Lincoln and Jefferson Davis); he was a failed businessman same as Grant.  He was hard living, coarse like Sherman and Sheridan.  And quite possibly one of the most complex figures to come out of the period.  He did not fight in the Army of Northern Virginia under Lee, which keeps him out of the general attention of those learning about the Civil War.  His first notable occurrence in the Civil War was the Fort Pillow Incident, where - still today we do not understand what happened - how black and white men supposedly surrendering were put to death by Forrest's command.  Jefferson David never understood Forrest's guerrilla-like methods of fighting - but one could not dispute the results.  He believed calvary men were not as JEB Stuart, dashing figures leading gallant charges,  but were fighting men who used horses to get from point A to point B, \\"the firstest with the mostest\\" as he is often misquoted saying.  As such, military tactics are still questioned and studied today.  He did not enter the war as one of the 'nobility' but came in as a private to rise to the ranks of Lieutenant General.  A superb tactician, a ferocious fighter unequalled - he killed 30 men and had his horse shot out from under him 29 times!  After the war, he was one of the founders of the Ku Klux Klan, it's first Grand Wizard, only to turn around and repudiate it and tried disband it for his racial hatred.<br />Forrest has been called 'that devil forrest', the 'wizard of the saddle', Historian Shelby Foote called him one of the two great geniuses of the period (Lincoln being the other) and by Lee `the most extraordinary man the Civil War produced'.  He was a slaver trader and owner, yet upon his death in 1877, it is well noted that his funeral was attended by hundreds of ex-slaves.<br />Jack Hurst gives a very balance view of this highly controversial figure and complex figure, showing his prowess, his faults and how he influences fighting of the period.  Tries not to excuse or explain away Fort Pillow, but place it in proper perspective.<br />His work is  wonderful look at the man often ignored or overlooked by general history.nder him 29 times!

In this instance, the newer version is not a totally reprint.  The 1902 version, while a wealthy of information, lacked the colour plates, which so left a lot to the imagination.<br />Foster listed in one single volume the feudal noblemen and knights, along with their heraldry, culled from ancient medieval rolls of arms.  This book stands as the standard and often the 1902 editions are considered high price collectors items.  In passing his love of history and books to me, my grandfather gave me the thrill of holding a book in my hands, sensing his timeless value.  So I love the 1902 editor for that, the timeless, peerless quality of the work in a binding we don't see today.<br />However, for the love of history I much prefer this reprint.  One, I can rattled through it as often as I like and not worry and handling with care, and two, the colour brings alive Foster's work.<br />This book is the unsurpassed standard for heraldic rolls accessible to the public, but its more than just a roll call of knights and nobles, artists and designers can benefit from the complicated and symbolic patterns, so the 80 year period between editions was one that is well worth it on many levels.  To writers of this period, either history fiction or historical romance - this is a MUST!!<br />There are a number of chart pedigrees, drawing of warriors in their medieval dress of chain and mail, with shields, spurs and tabards, so it is interesting, I am sure, to the rein-actors or SCA members looks to make their customs more accurate. Again an amazing reference for the writer wanting to give more details to their novels.  There is a special section of badges (still not in colour) and a section of Ancestral names.<br />It's just a rainy day delight to someone who loves the Middle Ages, history and a book that gives it all..	2003-02-21

It is the fictionalised account of the Geyers and the Hales, cousins - one family of the South, the other from the North, that find themselves divided and fighting each other during the War Between the States in the US. The Geyers were farmers, of the land, though were not slave owners, and the story focuses around their eldest son, John, an artist who went into the war as an artist correspondent, torn by his love for both families and seeing both sides of the argument. He hates the institution of Slavery, a hatred amplified by the hanging of his black friend, a freed man for hiding fugitive slaves. The Hales were city-folk. Not only were they divided on their views, but by their styles of life. You see all the various scenes of how families were divided, how the glory of war could turn sour for the many boys simply looking for adventure.<br />There was a real John Geyser, and he did draw a lot of pictures as his time as a soldier. But he was not a war correspondent, and not that professional of an artists. Still is immature drawing carry a power to convey the horrors of war.<br />So take the 'history' with a grain of salt and enjoy the 'emotions' of the great conflict that ripped families and friends apart.<br />This book was basis and 'publicity' version for the CBS television mini-series The Blue and the the Gray, an epic staring the great Stacey Keech and Gregory Peck as Lincoln. This book and the mini series had Bruce Catton as consultant. I also highly recommend this mini-series as giving a human side to the conflict.	2003-02-21

Men despised him because he was so bloody effective, but those same men were forced to grudging respect of Forrest's brilliance. This is not a balanced view of his life, but an excellent concentration of his campaigns. I would suggest reading Jack Hurst's work and John Allan Wyeth's in connection to this book. I have seen some grump because Hurst did not have maps and military information in his book.

Lee: His Military and Personal History	Books	5	24	29	N	N	A superior look at Lee	One time when Lee was on his travels, a woman ran from her house, grabbing his arm and dragging him into her front arm.  She told of how her grandfather had plant the tree in the front yard, how it had grown so tall and perfect.  The tree was now nothing but dead limbs.  She told how the dreadful Yankees came and stayed in her home, and they destroy the tree for fun and target practise.  To her the tree was her 'red badge of courage', and she was proud to show Lee how terrible the in justice the Yankees visited up her, how she suffered.  Lee quietly told her to cut it down.  Not the reaction the woman hoped for, but so like Lee.  When the war ended, it ended.  He made sure there the war did not devolve from armies fighting armies, into a situation similar to Northern Ireland, local resistance prolonging the fighting, likely bringing down swift retribution from the Northern Reformations.<br />Lee started his memoirs, but never finished, and at his death, the part of history was never really addressed by Lee.  There have been many like Longstreet who wrote about the war, but not Lee.<br />His father had been Lighthorse Harry Lee, a friend of George Washington and a Revolutionary War Hero - a role that would have been Lee's had the Confederacy won.  Instead of helping to forge a new nation of independence as his father had, by the simple act of the South losing, he was on the 'wrong side'.  Instead of hero, he was a rebel.  Lee was troubled deeply by his decision to leave the Union Army and take up leadership for the Army of Northern Virginia.  He was the husband of Mary Ann Randolph Custis, great-granddaughter of Washington.  Arlington, our national cemetery that is so honoured, was her plantation, and the dead originally put there was done so as an insult to the Lee family.<br />Lee was a brilliant tactician, did what so few did before him, divide his army in the face of superior forces, and succeeded until the fiasco at Gettysburg in Pickett's Charge.<br />Since Lee could not or would not complete his memoirs, A.L. Long, with backing of Lee and later his family, took up the role, an amazing chore since most of his work was done when he was losing his sight, and the writings accomplished with a slate used for the blind.  Long was military secretary to Lee and the vast amount of information was unpublished before this work.  The papers were collected with the assistance of Marcus J. Wright, formerly Brig. General of the Army of Tennessee and Agent for the Collections of Confederate Records.<br />This books provides a wealth of information on a gentleman, a husband, a father, a lady's man, but first and foremost a soldier and leader.<br />I highly recommend this for anyone wanting a clear pictures of Robert E.

There is little doubt he often took credit for those working under him, and showed a bent at making the Brady name linger in history as the first to photograph a war from beginning to end.  But that question pushed aside, forget who took what pictures, unless arguing that particular point, and simply sit back and get blown away by the sheer numbers of photos! Over 500 pages (often with half a dozen or more photos per page) of portraits, landscapes and even some illustrations in colour plates, this is a wonderful companion to the writings of Bruce Catton or Henry Steele Commanger.<br />Instead of just reading about the people and places that were the stage of the War Between the States, see them! Pictures of People, informal and formal portraits, pictures of encampments, riverboats, fortifications, bridges, of troops and the bloody aftermath of war. Brady and his contemporaries were often accused of 'stage' pictures, but it does not take away the power to move you. It was sad, 'the battles lost' often depicted Confederate dead, showing a distinct bias to further to belief the Union was invincible and the South doomed.<br />Regardless of the taint or copyright/ownership of the period, regardless of the yellow journalism of staging the photos, you cannot deny the value to casual historians, to writer of the period or to people wishes to see these places and the people that created some of the bloodies battles in history.<br />A wonderful collection.	2003-02-21

And boy is he!! A whole section in my library is filled with his amazing works.<br />This one is a two Volume Set - with Volume 1 starting with the nomination of Abraham Lincoln as President of the US and follows the events to the bloody three-day battle of Gettysburg, the highwater mark of the Confederacy. Volume 2 takes us from the aftermath of Gettysburg and follows the war to Lee's surrender at Appomattox.<br />The works are surprisingly slim considering what it covers, so this is not an in-depth look at the War Between the States. It does however give a gold mine of details. For someone looking to understand the war, its causes and the people that fought it, this is a wonderful place to start.<br />Highly recommended for the beginning or intermediate Civil War Buff.	2003-02-21

He was a complex man, a man that should stand out more amongst the 'peacocks'. Who, having had any knowledge about the War Between the States, does not know JEB Stuart? Forrest did not believe in plumbed hats, jackboots or riding around the Union army to prove a point to the Union troops and his Father-in-law. He believed war was fighting and fighting means killing, and his brilliant military tactics demonstrated this. I think by being raised on both sides of the pond, Forrest first fascinated me because I saw much the same 'force' in Forrest I admired in William Wallace. They were common men, men who were willing to give all in a cause they believed, men that were driven by fighting at 110% and never giving quarter. Many of Forrest's tactics of near guerrilla fighting came from Lighthorse Harry Lee's tactics against the British in the Revolutionary War (Robert E. Lee's daddy by the way!!), a character in himself and much in the vein of Mel Gibson's Patriot. The North despised Forrest - why?? Because he was SO EFFECTIVE. One wonders, what the outcome of the War Between the States would have been had Forrest commanded the Army of the Potomac instead of Lee. Grant and Sherman hated him - Grant giving him the label of 'that devil Forrest', while Sherman admired him - grudgingly - considering him \\"the most remarkable man our civil war produced on either side\\", and by Lee `the most extraordinary man the Civil War produced'. Historian Shelby Foote called him one of the two great geniuses of the period (Lincoln being the other). Sherman moaned in disgust that Forrest's men could travel 100 miles faster than his troops could 10. Forrest 'liberated' more guns, horses and supplies than any other single Confederate unit. He did not play at war. He rose from the rank of private to a Lieutenant General - the ONLY man to do that in the Confederate army, but he was just as a complex man before and after the war.<br />Perhaps, you will not come away liking Forrest, but you cannot doubt his sheer genius, his driven power and his ability to spur men to match his dedication and willingness to give all - just as Wallace did.<br />There are many books that give interesting views of Forrest, but I hold a special spot in my respect for this book, for unlike the others that were written with the distance of time and careful study, this was written by John Allan Wyeth - a surgeon who died in 1922. Wyeth served as a private in the Confederate army until his capture two weeks after Chickamauga. This was written by a man who lived through the war, not an arm chair historian. So his view is unique, more vivid than any other writer or biographer on Forrest. The text is base almost solely on accounts of military papers and records and the people who knew Forrest personally.<br />So if you have come searching for information on Nathan Bedford Forrest, you collection MUST have a copy of this work.s, you will not come away liking Forrest, but you cannot doubt his sheer genius, his driven power and his ability to spur men to match his dedication and willingness to give all - just as Wallace did.<br />There are many books that give interesting views of Forrest, but I hold a special spot in my respect for this book, for unlike the others that were written with the distance of time and careful study, this was written by John Allan Wyeth - a surgeon who died in 1922.

My grandfather passed on two passions: history and books. And one name is repeated over and over in my collection: Bruce Catton. There are others, who equal the superior history writing of Catton, but Bruce Catton transcends writing - he opens a door on his time machine and takes you on the amazing journey into the past.<br /><br />The War Between the States was a complex chunk of American history, and saying it was fought to free the slaves is bad information.  Less than 2% of the population of the South owned slaves.  Many young boys in the South, who fought and gave their lives for the Confederacy had, never ever seen one.  Yes, it was a factor, a rallying cry for humanity, but it was not THE single cause for the War.  Even Lincoln was willing to see slavery continue - IF it meant preserving the Union.  There were many causes, and Bruce Catton helps you understand them.  He also brings to life the men that were vital to the conflict.  Starting with this volume is an excellent point to get to know Catton and his beautiful prose.  He does not tell you history, he makes you live it, down to the smallest detail.  He makes it so accessible, so alive.  He puts you into the mind set of Lincoln, McClellan, even the common soldier, so you understand well what drove people to these extremes, to life and death decisions.<br /><br />When one reads Catton, it is like reading the words of someone who lived through the battles, the hardship.  Yet, his prose reads more on par with beautiful fiction, so that you forget you are reading just plain factual history.<br /><br />Bruce Catton had the enviable position of being a small boy in Michigan where so many Veterans of the War resided.  They talked, telling their tales of the War Between the States, and Bruce listened.  He passed on this gift, presenting us with those tales, in a form that few historical writers ever achieve.<br /><br />In this volume, Catton introduces you to a Lincoln you have never known, to the handsome, dashing and well-loved 'Little Mac' General George McClellan, and their protracted struggle over the Army of the Potomac, how each wanted it run.  Catton shows this single loggerhead between these powerful men likely caused the war to drag on for nearly a year longer than it would have otherwise.  Two strong figures, determined the army would do as they wished.  McClellan saw Lincoln as an ignorant country bumpkin, unworthy to be President.  Having his eyes on being Chief of State himself, and knowing being General of the Army of the Potomac could make that dream real, he was determined not to listen to Lincoln.  Lincoln saw `Little Mac' as all show and no action.  He just wanted a General who would fight.  Their continual maneuverings reminds one of a chess match, showing Lincoln losing patience and possessing the incisive ability to assess people, handle them.  On the other side, there is Little Mac with his arrogance and gross underestimating of Lincoln, blinded by his vainglory, and more concerned with his popularity and ambitions, than what was best for the nation.<br /><br />This is intended as a three-volume set with GLORY ROAD and A STILLNESS AT APPOMATTOX in that order.  Historical writing at its best.<br /><br />So, if you are interested in the Civil War, perhaps the films GETTYSBURG and GOD AND GENERALS make you hunger for a better understanding of why it happened, who these people were, you cannot do any better than starting your journey here.on introduces you to a Lincoln you have never known, to the handsome, dashing and well-loved 'Little Mac' General George McClellan, and their protracted struggle over the Army of the Potomac, how each wanted it run.

Even in her earliest works you see the diamond brilliance that has put her at the top.  However, I was disappointed in some of her recent works.  Then she came powering back with the marvellous \\"Summer in Eclipse Bay\\" and was SO perfect!!  So when \\"Smoke and Mirrors\\" came...I went hum....so so but could have been better - much beter.  Worse, was her Amanda Quick's \\"Don't Look Back\\" so dreadfully dull, that I wanted to howl.  Swore I would stop buying her in hardback!  And immediately turned around and could not resist buying \\"Light in Shadow\\".  It just sounded so good....and it IS!!<br />JAK is back in top form providing a warm, humourous, loving mystery that I just could not put down!!  It is billed as \\"A Whispering Springs Novel\\" so we can except two more I am presuming, and I shall be first in line for the sequels.<br />In this mystery, JAK gives us a Zoe Luce an interior decorator with a special touch: she can \\"feel emotions\\" within a room.  Currently, she is decorating a house for a new ex-husband, who claims he wants a redo after his wife left him.  However, the instant Zoe steps into the bedroom and see the missing bed and shower curtains in the bathroom, she knows he killed his wife.  What to do.

Then when the time came along, it was next to impossible to find a copy. I finally did track one down and was blown away. I adore Scottish History, but since I was raised part time in the States, I grew to love the complexities of the Civil War (in the South US it's called the War Between the States). The reasons for the war, the motivation for people to fight their neighbour, often their own brother or family members was mesmerising. Bruce Catton gave me such insight into all the factors through his marvellous works, so I thought no writer could touch him in making you feel, see and understand the men, the generals, the affect the Civil War had on a nation.<br />However, a writer did, and oddly enough with fiction. Michael Shaara won a Pulitzer Prize for the moving work that focuses on the one pivotal battle, the high-water mark of the War Between the States. He gives you the frustration of men driven to kill their brothers, of the futility, the waste. Centring on Lee, floundering at the loss of his right hand Jackson, of being cut off from screening and blind without information because Stuart was on one of his glory rides, of one general who could not follow orders, of another, Longstreet, who followed them to the letter knowing he was sending his 'boys' to their death in the glorious, yet ultimately disastrous Pickett's charge.<br />But it through Col. J.L. Chamberlain where Shaara succeeds the most, in giving you the humanity, the nightmare, the pathos, of the men of 20th Maine regiment, volunteers who held the Union's left flank on the second day of the battle at Little Round Top.<br />The book is so moving, so touching that it makes you view the war in a way you never have before. If only, he had included Captain James Hall of the 2nd Maine Battery...<br />This was turned into the wonderful film GETTYSBURG, which I also recommend highly with some truly memorable performances. However, be sure to read the book as well, for you will never forget the beautiful prose of Shaara.<br />Also recommended are Jeff Shaara his son's books that form a trilogy with Gods and General the prequel and The Last Full Measure the Ending.ead the book as well, for you will never forget the beautiful prose of Shaara.<br />Also recommended are Jeff Shaara his son's books that form a trilogy with Gods and General the prequel and The Last Full Measure the Ending.	2003-02-17

My first love is Scottish History, but since I was raised on both sides of the pond, I grew to have a great love for the complexities of the War Between the States in the US.  So, it was great pleasure I read this book.<br />Shaara, in this case Jeff, the son of Michael, had a hard act to follow.  His father was the author of Pulitzer Prize Winning Killer Angels (1974).  Killer Angels looked at the high watermark of the Confederacy which ended with the battle of Gettysburg.  That was the single most important event of the whole War Between the States, in a war that shaped the United States.  It gave such insight, such reality into the horror, the glory, the humanity and inhumanity of war, of Generals Lee, Hancock, Pickett and Chamberlain.  Shaara's words brought alive the battle and made you feel it all, the anticipation, the frustration, the fear and the anger.<br />In Gods and Generals, Jeff picks up his father's pen and gives you another masterpiece.  Though father and son, both have a different writing voices. Jeff picks up the threads of what happened before Gettysburg, a prequel to his father's award winning novel, giving you insight into the men facing what would be their hardest trial.  He again centres on the driven Lee, the bumbling Chamberlain, the dashing Hancock, but we also see Jackson, the man who could march his men 40 miles in a day and then fight a battle, one of the most efficient Generals of the whole war on either side, yet overwhelming a religious man.  What interested me most, was his portrait of Lee, his dedication to the Confederacy winning and yet the pain of being torn by his loyalty to the Union army he once served and likely of which he would have been General had he not resigned his commission.<br />A tour de force for a first time writer.	2003-02-17

Danegeld dealt with a period in Britain's history, generally ignored (last one I can recall was Johanna Lynsay in her Medieval Trilogy and that was a long time<br />ago!). It was grimly realistic, provoking - possibly too grim and too provoking for more timid readers. But there was a rare, fresh voice in the work that was so rich in history often sadly neglected in today's lighter romance market. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE fast paced, whimsical romances, but feel there is room - and need - for both styles. Variety is what keeps the market fresh. The trend is to get the history of out historicals for this slows the pace of the romance. I love romance, but I also love history, the pageantry, the drama, so Danegeld was something I was glad to see published. In her second, Sacrament, Squires gave us a thinking woman's vampire tale. Not dwelling on the vampire aspect of it, she provoked (I often wonder if provoke is not Squires middle name) you into looking at good and evil - not of the vampire, but of the desires of individuals, those acted upon and those repressed, and the choices those desire can drive one to make. Many bemoaned this was not a traditional (aka stereotypical) vampire tale, to which Squires quite blithely thanked you and agreed. Her third work, Body Electric, pushed the boundaries and was a brilliantly conceive bit of Michael Crichton techno thriller. Sometimes you might not like what Squires is doing in her books, but she never fails to provoke you.<br />All three works were of strong merit, well researched, and with interesting characters, even too a walk on the wild side...but she just missed bull's-eye.<br />Squires comes full circle, returning to that dark period in British History - and WOW - her fourth novel, Danelaw hits the target...in fact she blows it away. This is not a sequel to Danegeld, so do not buy it with that impression.<br />Danelaw stands on it on and it is Squires' best work. Rich in period lore of the British Isles and the Dane invaders during the period of Alfred, Squires delivers a powerful tale of Epona \\"Pony\\" the last of her kind, the woman who speaks to horses and lives below the great chalk horse on the Downs. She little knows she is a priestess to the Cult of Epona, the Scots Horse Goddess of War, but the fame of Epona was spread far and wide. Called 'Mare' (MAH-ray) by the Irish of Dalriada, she was the bringer of dreams good and bad. The English word nightmare is derived from her Irish name. The Goddess was even adopted by the conquering Romans whose cavalry called upon her to aid them before a charge. She was the only Celtic deity enshrined and worshipped in Rome, where they saw her as the Triple Goddess Eponae. To the Saxon Alfred, the man who would unite Britain after the Roman withdrawal, reclaim Danelaw (nearly a 1/3 of England) from the Danes, Epona was called Horsa, but whatever the name, he saw the power and potential of using Pony to achieve his destiny.<br />Her mother had taught Pony that she must bear a girl child to continue the line from the dawn of time, the keeper of the faith of Epona. Only, she warns Pony not to care for a man else he destroy her through her heart. Pony is a smart lass, though often naive, and sees her role a simple one...to fulfil her destiny to produce the next girl child to live under the chalk horse on the Downs, to continue the line. Though naive, she realised when Alfred appears on her doorstep that he means to use her, but in her shrewdness, she uses him. This is a fine man, a man to give her the girl child to continue the line, a man she will not care for so she will not die of a broken heart. Alfred beds her, getting his \\"seal\\" of approval from the Goddess Epona, with the intent of using that to rally the Saxons to push the Danes from Britain. When he leaves, Pony is secure her heart is safe.<br />Only, the Viking plunders come to Pony's door and Pony's finds there is more to fulfilling a prophecy than conceiving a child, for she is now the pawn of Valgar, the Dane leader. She expects horrid barbarians who would take her prison and try to steal her herd of magickal horses. Instead, she finds a man of wisdom, of fire, of strength. He is fair to the Saxons he conquerors, he is a man who would give his life to save a single man at the risk of losing a battle.<br />And he knows the way of the Horse.<br />Squires gives us a rousing Saga of one woman set on filling her destiny, caught between the clash of Saxon and Viking cultures in England and two equally determined men, each bent on making a kingdom in England. Her characters are vivid, well drawn, the research very impressive. I have dealt with history for decades, even wrote a triple essay on Epona being the mother-face of the triple goddess, linking her with Elphame and the Cailleach.

She is one of the few writers I will buy in hardback...but I am beginning to rethink this. Smoke and Mirrors was fun if you are a JAK fan, if not...you might be sorely disappointed in the hardback price and paperback read.<br />She is a sharp as ever in technique and style, she has polished JAK trademark of wilful ladies and stubborn men to a hard gloss. Maybe too much polishing and too hard of a gloss?? She lacks the snap and fire of her earlier works, going the same as many of the Romance Writers ( Linda Howard, Nora Roberts, Elizabeth Lowell) are - once they get into 'mainstream' they are taking off the romance banner and maybe alienating fans in the process.<br />It's a fun read, but the story is weak and the ending weaker. She has no real mystery going other than why did she not have a better mystery!!! You see who the obvious murderer is by the early part of the book, if you don't, you will known by the end for there is NO OTHER person it can be, and the reason she has been a murderer for 30 years and killed several people - to pad and protect her retirement account??? OH PLEASE, JAK, thinking cap time!!<br />I love the lead characters. She is the half sister of murdered women, he is the brother-in-law of a murdered woman and they form an alliance that is warm, witty and charming. Especially love his dog!!!<br />But on the balance, the plot is thread bear, the mystery weak as they get.<br />Sorry, I advise waiting for paperback, then the disappointment won't sting as much.<br />JAK is one of my favourite writers, I am let down by the one on the whole.	2003-02-14

Jayne Ann stopped surprising us a long time again for two reasons. First, she delivers time and again some of the most enchanting books in romance. I appreciate she has never forgotten her romance roots as some of the others that have moved from romance paperback to mainstream hardback do. Almost like they are ashamed of writing romance and want to write 'legit'. Shame on them! I get sick of writers that build their career off the very readers they turn around and seem to disdain. I think writing romance is one of the hardest things to do - it's not easy to work in a formula and deliver someone fresh and original. Secondly, she stopped surprising us because her book are like that well-worn baggy sweater that you have had for decades and always go to because it's so warm and fuzzy. JAK's books are warm and fuzzy.<br />We KNOW what we are going to get with small variations, but she weaves her magick spell and we adore it. For the most part, JAK's reprints of late and even a couple of her new ones, have been pains. The reprints are SO Dates they should be ashamed for reprinting and CHARGING NEW BOOK PRICE. They convince some readers the book is new, so everyone dashes out and buys them, only to get home and go OH NO!!!!<br />Well, this is a reprint, but from JAK at her best! This is from her middle period, where every book she cranked out was pure perfection. So if you have not read this, you will be delighted with it.<br />Jayne seems best when she is writing about dysfunctional families...so she is in full swing here. The Gilchrist family empire is failing and only one man can save it and when he is called \\"the bastard\\" by his own family, you know things are off to a rocky start. The Bastard....hum, Luke Gilchrist has been 'punished' by the Gilchrist family all his life because his father's \\"scandal\\". Worse, he never conformed to the Gilchrist way, so they cut him off to - again, to punish him. Instead of accepting their dictates, he is a rebel with a cause - but a smart one - that has done very well in business. Now the family NEEDS the bastard to save the crumbling family empire.<br />Only, Luke has had a belly full of their arrogant, cruel ways, so he is ready to come in for the kill. Time has come for him to punish them. They have to beg him to save their mysteriously floundering business.<br />The only trouble - so far Luke just might be mean enough to extract his revenge by watching the whole works go down in flames. And it falls to Katy Wade to bring him around to the right way of thinking. Katy has been to chief-cook, bottle-washer and resident keeper of this oddball family. It's been a good job, though exasperating at time, a job Katy NEEDED, when her parents died and she was left with raising her younger brother. But he is about to graduate high school, and suddenly Katy will be able to move on and do what she wants for a change instead of what she must.<br />The one stumbling block, she has to convince Luke to return and do his family duty. However, Luke has had years of wanting to get back at the family, so bringing Luke back to the Gilchrist Clan is setting the fox amongst the chickens. Worse, the first demand Luke makes in return for coming back, is Katy has to stay as his personal assistant.<br />Katy knows when she looks into the cold green eyes, she is making a pack with the devil....And Luke has his own adgenda...one that might thinking claiming Katy could be more important that revenge upon his family.<br />A wonderfully written romance, that will be vivid in your mind years after you put it down.

There are two things about JAK: She is one of my favourite writers and secondly, I have found her works - except for the Off World books - to be off beam during the last five years. She is great, but it's like she polished the gem just a little too much, and in that glossy mainstream treatment of her romances, she lost the fire that made her so special. She is one of the few writers I collect in hardback (Lynsay Sands, Melanie Jackson and Trish Jensen would be the others, but alas they are not in hardback yet, mores the pity). I still buy all JAK's works, but I have been just a bit let down by her last few books.  I enjoyed the first two Eclipse Bays, where she actually showed the flair of catching that spark again, and in this the third, she shows she still has the magick!!!<br />This is an utterly delightful, pure JAK at her best. AZ Snow is back with her conspiracy theories still going, the Bay community is full of the gossipy small town characters that made the first two so special, but in this one, she adds all the fire, passion, wit and humour that has made her famous.<br />Nick Harte (brother of the Harte sisters that married the Madison brothers) has returned to Eclipse Bay for the Summer with his son Carson, a miniture version of himself. Nursing a wounded heart, Nick is hesitant to get too close to any woman, but he cannot stay away from Octavia Brightwell - the neice of the woman that caused the Harte-Madison feud oh so many years ago.<br />Octavia runs the local art gallery, but her real reason for being there was to somehow fix the errors of the past created by her aunt, and see the Harte-Madison feud put to rest. Only by the time she has settled in the Bay, there two unexpected weddings in the Hart-Madison clan, uniting them once again, so her mission is moot and she feel at a drift, without purpose in her life.<br />She adores Carson, and is very attracted by Nick Harte, but is leary getting involved with him. The whole town knows two things about Hardhearted Harte - on the first date he gives women THE TALK saying there is no hope for a commitment, and that he never stays the full night with any woman. Octavia knows she could not stand having to face either of them, so she stays away from involvement with him.<br />Only, when a missing art piece worth a quarter of a million dollars is stolen from Octavia's gallery, and it falls to Nick to investigate - with Arizona Snow in charge - she cannot maintain that distance.<br />This is a funny, engaging book, that has some of the best lines like \\"Back in the big city, folks would probably say that Euqene and Dwayne are the products of dysfunctional families. But around here we just call them bums.\\" Or \\"I did not come in here to argue with a woman with big hair\\" or when discussing the local hair saloon she says their styles were limited to \\"Very Big Hair and the Senior Citizen Helmet.\\"<br />This is Jayne Ann at her peek form and all I can say is it's about time!!!dhearted Harte - on the first date he gives women THE TALK saying there is no hope for a commitment, and that he never stays the full night with any woman.

B.L.I.S.S. is Dorchester Publishings new Spy Spoof line...female spies that fight the terrible villains of L.O.V.E.R. - League of Violent Economic Revolutionaries - eh, tree-huggers gone radical?? . The other books in the exciting new B.L.I.S.S. line include From Boardwalk with Love by Nina Bangs and The Loving Daylights by Lynsay Sands.  I have been sort of going in reverse, having read Lynsay's first - and it's an utter howl.  I had broken ribs at the time I was reading hers and it HURT because I was unable to stop laughing.  Then I read Nina Bang's.  And it was so good!! They are fresh, sexy and so funny!!<br />I just finished the 2nd in the series, Lisa's...these are a series obviously, but not really dependant upon the other.  You will just want to read them all and cannot wait to see what others will follow in this fresh line.<br />Every time I catch Lisa Cash in writer's chat, she is either coming or going to some exotic locale.  She loves to travel, and her wonderful books benefit for her journeys.  Dr. Yes, especially.  She is rich in details of the faraway places, but she never lets that overwhelm her characters.  She always creates quirky, down to earth people that keep you thoroughly entertained.<br />In Dr. Yes, her character, unlike Lynsay's Book and Nina's book, is not a B.L.I.S.S agent.  Rachel Calais is a guide in Nepal, and dashing Harrison Wiles come to her with a request to lead an expedition in the Himalayas on behalf of B.L.I.S.S. to stop the evil villain of the moment.  In this case, the seemingly boyish, shy Dr. Alan Archer, the former lover of Rachel, and she knows he is searching for the lost city of Yonam and the rare plant that when refined turned every woman in sex slaves.  She knows she must stop him, so she accepts the request to help B.L.I.S.S save the women of the world.  They equip her with all sorts of \\"Q\\" gadgets and give her Harrison as back up.  There is suspense, humour and lot of sizzling sexual tension.<br />I highly recommend ALL THREE in the B.L.I.S.S. book.  Each are gems!!d ALL THREE in the B.L.I.S.S. book.  Each are gems!!	2003-02-07

The covers even has the same flavour of the 60's Ian Fleming novels that went on to be movies.  First up is Nina Bangs with From Boardwalk With Love, in February you get charming Lisa Cach with Dr. Yes, and Queen of the Hysterics Lynsay Sands' The Loving Daylight (have already read this one and it's Lynsay at her side splitting-best!).  Each book is done by one of Dorchester's brightest stars and if they keep up, we are in for some wonderful treats.  I am especially hoping to see more out of Lynsay's characters - they are ripe for further adventures!!<br />From Boardwalk with Love is a good kick off for the series, from the talented Nina, giving you the first of this tongue-firmly-through-check spy romps.  Camryn O'Brien is agent 36DD, on her first assignment.  If is not enough to shake a gal's confidence, super-spy, double agent Jace Sentori is on her trail.  He may or may not be the enemy, but he is determined to kill Camryn.  As with Lynsay's book, Camyrn get some help (?) from retired B.L.I.S.S. agents, armed a secret weapon that needs to be kept secret for it more dangerous to her than the enemy - thus ready, Camryn sallies forth on her charger...hum, pink Cadillac to save the world and buckleswashes with L.O.V.E.R. - League of Violent Economic Revolutionaries - eh, tree-huggers gone radical??  She ends up on teeny weeny isle off South America, that has been set up to be a reflection of the game Monopoly, where Camryn must battle evil doers to keep the richest man in the world alive (Bill Gates? :-o).  Trying to prevent her - other than Jace out to kill her - is Zed (no, not an escapee from MIB!).  This Zed is L.O.V.E.R.S most deadly agent and he is out to take the board or go home with the toys.  Camryn would like to trust Jace also known as the Game Master, but let's face it, when a man wants to kill you, it puts a damper on the romance.  But Camryn will just have to learn no man is perfect!!<br />A delightful romp, that will leave you eager for Cach's and Sand's books!!kill you, it puts a damper on the romance.

She broke into the romance world with a bang with The Deed, and has proven with such great books as The Switch, Lady Pirate and The Key that she can do it again and again. Her style is fluid, her voice so natural, and there is no one else like her around. Her books are warm, intelligent and with a ton of humour. When I am reading anything by Lynsay, I am always smiling or laughing out loud!! So many times when someone tries the light touch with historical, their heroine comes out like an idiot. Lynsay deftly walks that fine line between jest and joke, with intelligent resourceful characters that often do silly things - but for good reasons!! Most especially, her books are never contrived.<br />In Always, her Rosamunde is a gently raised fatherless daughter of King Henry, and just before his death he arranges a marriage for her to Alric. He is coming off a bad engagement and has little trust for women, but sees no choice in the forced marriage. While Rosamunde is not totally against the idea of a husband, she brings a vast lacking in knowledge to the marriage bed due to the concepts instilled in her by the nuns . Rosemunde is an adorable, charming, witty character and one you will long remember. I read a lot, so often books tend to blur together. Years from now I will think of Rosamunde and remember her well!!<br />Pick up Lynsay Sands and you are guaranteed a good time!!<br />WISE Writers and Readers Book of the Month for April 2001<br />Book of the Year for 2001 (tied with Night Visitor by Melanie Jackson)	2003-01-29

I received the poster about three month before it's release and put it up on the wall - and sold dozens and dozens on preorder because of the poster. This was unusual since most of my regulars bought by authors they knew. I feared there would be a mass groan when they did not like this author that was totally unknown.<br />Well, it was completely the opposite. They bought because of the cover, but everyone one of them came back and demanded to buy everything she had written. We had a lot of snarls, when they were told this was her first book, so we would have to wait until she wrote more.<br />And she has been writing SUPER books ever since!!<br />She gives you lovely, tender romances...but also, laughter so hard it brings tears to your eyes. Very few writers can move me to laugh out loud and Lynsay always does!! There is no writer like her today in the romance field, though I now see many trying to copy her. But her Emmaline and Amaury are gems. Her characters are engaging, charming and intelligent, but that does not mean they cannot find them in wildly humorous situations.<br />I shall not spoil the fun about &quot;the deed&quot;....but leave the sheer pleasure for you to discover!!	2003-01-29

What would you do if the handsome Highlander you married refused to bathe and lived in a near pigsty? Hit him where it hurt. Put on the Chasity belt and hide the Key!...<br />Iliana escapes her wicked stepfathers plans, by agreeing to marry a wild Handsome Scots Laird. But she never dreamt what she would have to deal with. When she arrives she finds it is a bachelor keep, and since the death of Duncan's mothers some two decades before, that he and his father and been living in horrid conditions and not sure when they last bathed. Iliana refuses to consummate their marriage, and Duncan is furious, not understanding why she should object to a couple decades of grime. So she does the only thing a thinking woman can do, put on the Chasity belt, hide the key, and set about to cleaning the castle. Duncan fails to appreciate all her hard work, so the key says hidden, but his father is slowly appreciating the positive side to having a female in the household.<br />The humour is laugh out loud in the battle of will. Iliana is a strong character, surviving abuse and imprisonment and yet not broken in spirit.<br />It is a wonderful warm and funny tale, from the talented mind of Lynsay Sands, the Queen of the Hysterical Historicals.	2003-01-29

I thoroughly enjoyed this marvellous books from first time Dorchester writer, Jennifer Ashley. This charming writer gives you non-stop action from page 1 and does not let up the pace.<br />In 1789, Evangeline Clemens is on board the sailing ship, the Aurora, heading for a new life in Boston. But it's no pleasure voyage, as she is immediately jumped by another passenger, Anne Adams, bent on rebellion. Evangeline wants nothing to do with the plot, but has little choice as Anne says Evangeline's brother's life is in the balance. Anne insists Evangeline must seduce the Captain of the Aurora, Austin Blackwell. Anne is determined to stir up enough trouble to arrange a mutiny and take over the Aurora to use it to rescue her lover in Havana.<br />Austin immediately mistrusts Evangeline. A shy woman suddenly turning siren causes bells to ring in his head. He is convinced she is an English Spy sent to fetch secret documents he is carrying to the Americas. But he cannot resist seeing how far Evangeline will go. She reaches the Captain, more than he knew, and he finds himself falling in love with her, though still believing she is a spy. Thus begins a breakneck pace of Austin trying to get his ship back and deliver the documents.<br />So many young writers have trouble with their first movel, they have a super idea for a book, but cannot sustain the action all the way through. That is NOT the case with Jennifer's wonderful book. She has breathtaking, nonstop action, with charm, wit and humour...the characters are so real they reach out and make a place in your heart. The historical element is wonderful, and a period rather neglected in the current market, makes this one great read!!<br />Congrats on your first Book, Jennifer, and look forward to your next, The Pirate Next Door. You are a welcome new voice in the romance market!	2003-01-21

Sally, so ill, wants desperately to believe this man is her long lost son, but Carolyn knows better. His coming brought the nightmare back, and she KNOWS she saw Alex killed nearly twenty years ago. Yet, the man knows too many small things, knows how she yearned for Alex, but was too young to handle the attaction...and that attraction is still there, only amplified by Alex as a grown man. Despite knowing in her heart she witnessed the 'real' Alex's death, she cannot run from the strong physical sparks they create. Only, is this man here to hurt Sally, steal the inheritance meant for the real Alex?

Thought a sequel, this book stands alone (just makes you want to run out and get Walker's Widow).<br />Hannah Blake grew up with a boy named David in an orphanage, but he was adopted by the Walker family. He was torn by the white world that had accepted him and the pull of his mother's people. Hannah grew up to be the local school teacher, though she held that boy her in her heart. David began using the Walker name, but combined it with his Indian Heritage and became Spirit Walker. <br />When Spirit Walker turns up seeking Hannah's help, he little resembles her childhood friend David, the boy who protected and looked after her in the orphanage. He has brought his nephew to Hannah, because he knows he can trust her to keep him safe, but since he is a half-breed he is putting Hannah at risk. Their attraction is instant and strong, but can Hannah overcome the scars in David's heart and the prejudices of those around them? <br />Heidi Betts gives you strong, vivid characters that makes you feel their pain, their troubles, that touch your heart. Once you read Heidi's books you will rush out and buy them all and ask how could you have missed this wonderful writer!!	2003-01-14

(Blaze)	Books	5	1	2	N	Y	Leto's shines and her characters burn	Leto is one of the fastest rising stars in Harlequin's Temptations, and maybe the brightest. I look for her to make to jump to big books anytime. She has that droll Southern Charm and she imbues every book with it, and she know how to make the attraction between her leads sizzle. I especially appreciate how her females are not stereotype, but are women with minds of their own. With this book, she once more proves why I ordered her by name only and cannot wait until her next ones comes along.<br />Is there anyone who can get you into trouble more than a sister? That is the premise of Good Girls Do. At the University in Southern Florida (sorry, Julie did not use New Orleans again for she give such a texture to her works with that as a background!) Dr. Miranda Carpenter's sister pushed the CISS - Campus Institute for Safe Sex and Dr. Noah Yeager into nominating Miranda as woman of the year role model. Teri makes sure the papers pick up on it, and next thing Miranda is label \\"practically a virgin\\" - and as the late Robert Mitchum would tell you, there's nothing worse than a semi-virgin!!<br />Miranda is humiliated by this all, and Noah understands this, and had no idea Teri would shout it everywhere. Added to Miranda's humiliation is an attraction to Noah, but she has started away from the Party Animal that was known for his one night stands and love them and leave them attitude. Noah has been attracted to her for some time, but stayed his distance because he has had two bad relationships, one which ended in divorce.<br />However, Miranda is just ticked enough to take out her anger and frustration on Noah by winding up his clock and then teaching him a lesson as she decided to go after and win the CISS virtuous award.<br />As with all Leto's work, the banter is rapier sharp, warm and light, yet this story still manages to get the safe sex message worked in there.<br />Now, WE NEED Teri's Tale, Julie!!!	2003-01-09

I have read many of Putney's books over the last decade, but this is always the one that lives in memory.  It was the first Putney I read, and frankly, I still think it her best.  A funny tale, I was running a bookstore just after this came out, and 75% of the sales was in romance so I had to stay on top.  We had male readers (shocker, but true!) and this was demonstrated one day.  A man came in and wandered around and into, romance, I commented he was now in romance and he shrugged and went on wandering.  Then I was recommending this to one lady and how I loved it.  He turned around and said, yes, Putney is really the best.<br />This book is just so full of heart, of the valiant heroine who puts the welfare of her village before herself, of a contained person that is so darn by the dark hero who is tormented because she has one foot in the world of the Lord of the Manor, but his other with his Gypsy mother.  He is cold, demanded and haughty, the Gypsy Lord (the first of the Fallen Angel series for Putney).  Nicholas has been away, unable to feel at home in either of his worlds, determined to sell the Manor for it hold harsh memories.  However, Claire the local teacher takes it upon herself to beard the lion and demand changes be made to make the people suffer less, especially in the mines.  Nicholas strikes a bargain with her - she stays and pretends to be his mistress and he will stay and make improvements.  In his own way, he knows her living under his roof marks her, and her reputation would suffer the same as if she was in his bed, so he is making her a loner whether he understands it or not - more like himself.<br />Only Claire is no one to push around.  She agrees to the pose, but refuses to be pushed into being his mistress, and has demanded of her own.  They agree on a kiss a day, so thus begins the dance with the devil.<br />The characters are so real, so life.  There is excellent plot, take actually takes you into the dark coal mines...just everything to keep you from putting this one down.<br />The rest of the Fallen Angels were wonderful, but this just could not touch the perfection of this book!keep you from putting this one down.<br />The rest of the Fallen Angels were wonderful, but this just could not touch the perfection of this book!	2003-01-07

There is a dearth of fine historical writers, and when you find one you tend to go on an on with wonderful, marvellous, outstanding. So I will trot them all out to describe this bold work of Viking lore in the tradition of Eric the Red and Lief Erickson. This is full adventure Saga set in Greenland, coastal Canada and Maine in the US, and is based in ancient Norse Myth and Lore, a period that is often neglected. It is especially interesting because it depicts &quot;first contact&quot; between the Norsemen and the Indians of the US. The story unfolds centring around a man, with his two feet in two separate cultures and his love for a woman from each. It is based on the little known work of Edward Reman,a Scandinavian sailor, who putting forth the idea Vinland's directions were misinterpreted and by his reckoning put it off Grand Manaan Isle, off the Maine Coast.<br />This is a very sweeping saga, that brings to life a period that was thrilling, but alas, suffering from the lack of neglect. The Norse were one of the biggest influences in Europe, British Isles and into the US, supposedly visiting the US long before Columbus, and yet there is little done about it, so little fiction or history. So when a special gem like this comes along it's like a beacon in the darkest night.<br />Stuart W. Mirsky has a feel for the period, and is very able to give you his vision. Highly recommend this wonderful tale!!<br />So if you enjoyed Eaters of the Dead,and want something MORE... you will love this!! Also, I highly recommend Maggie Davis' Winter Serpent. Another excellent Viking Fiction.	2002-12-29

This is a repackage of Amaryllis and Zinnia - two very delightful off world romances under her Jayne Castle name. If you enjoy JD Robb's In Death... series of futuristic romances you should like these as well.<br />I enjoyed them more the second time around. This is some of JAK's best writing of late. I had been a wee tad disappointed in her last couple HBs and her Amanda Quicks. She seems to have polished her diamond too much and lost some of the spontaneity that was her trademark. But Amaryllis, Zinnia and Orchid, and the off world antics, are her at top form.<br />Amaryllis Lark is a private detective, but she is also a prism. In the Colony of from Old Earth, people evolved with two talents: either they were a prism or a psychic. The prisms serve to increase the power of the psychics by channelling their powers through them and amplifying it. Even the strongest of psychics needs a prism, for without them they cannot control and maintain their powers.<br />Lucas Trent the founder of Lodestar hires her for her prism talents. He is an off the chart psychic who need the talent of a prism of his level. If psychic and prism are not of matched talents, the psychic can burn out the prism. And prisms that are as strong as Amaryllis are rare. In order to foil nasty cooperate todos, they are forced to join talents...and more!!<br />A super, brilliant work from the fine craft of JAK.<br />>>>>>>>>>>><br />In Zinnia the second in the series: Zinnia Spring (don't you love JAK's names!!) was called the Scarlet Lady by the press when she was mistakenly caught in a tacky tabloid triangle. She is an interior designer and instead of trying to live that down, she plays it for all its worth, creating a real Lady in Red. She dresses red, she drives red...<br />But when she is hired by Nick Chastain, owner of a Casino, things really heat up!!

When we last saw Samantha Devereaux, estranged twin-sister of Serena Devereaux, she was badgering Brandon Chance, her brother-in-law to be to let her work for him.  Chance had just retired from the Nightstalkers, due to vision problems stopping him from being a pilot, and had set up a Private body guard service. Since he could find no reason not to take on Samantha as partner, he has let her go ahead and get her license while he and Serena are on their honeymoon.  Only the joyful bliss led Chance and Serena to say away for a month longer than intended, leaving Samantha to grow antsy.  She has gone gun-ho in this new line of work, and spent more than Chance's petty cash allows on new 'toys' for the business, so she kills time and get experience and money by hiring on as security for an business expo.<br />The first day she is put on a detail to provide security for the CEO/Model of a family run spaghetti sauce corporation. Dominick Larocca loves fine food, is very family oriented, and is sexy male personified.  But when he two grandmothers decide it is past time for him to settle down, they take matters into their own hands and announce Dominick is looking for a bride.  When a man that looks like every woman's dream is coupled with a spiralling fortune, it seems every woman is ready to jump Dominick like he is a rock star.  This is very distressing to the CEO, for he cannot even take a shower without someone crawling out from under the bed, let alone carry on the business he came to New Orleans to handle.<br />Sam has spent hours staring at the huge display of the bare-chested man on the spaghetti sauce presentation, but she is unprepared for the reaction of the wild women chasing Dominick, as she is unprepared for the man himself.  She tried to calm her fantasies by saying the CEO is arrogant for appearing on his own product bare-chested.  But as she learns about him, like the fact is was his grandmothers that used his picture without his knowledge, she begins to feel sympathy for him.  So when he mentions he will need to hired a personal body guard while in New Orleans, she jumps at the chance, despite her misgivings due her personal attraction to him.  She is professional enough to handle it and keep their business impersonal....isn't she???<br />Things soon steam up as Dominick makes it clear that he wants her not only as a body guard, but for her to pretend to be his girlfriend, hoping to stop the mobs of marriage hungry females.<br />What I like about Leto's writing is she presents strongly developed good-girls-do women, ladies who are not afraid to face romance and go after it, instead of blushing and denying...<br />Her men are sexy, to die for, yet are very down to earth...yeah, they are pure alpha males, but they are mannered, raised well gentlemen who respect women of all ages.  She sprinkles her books with quirky characters, spices it with steamy love scenes, knows the difference between romance and sex and how the two go together.

She is quite successful, which is a blessing to her theatrical family, because they always have a job between roles.<br />Her current catering assignment was for the wedding of Sam Stark. Only, the bride has decamped, leaving Sam at the alter and Desdemona with two expensive ice swans that were melting, fifty pounds of tortellini salad, two hundred miniature asparagus tarts, and three platter of goatshead cheese, and she was going to get her bill collected no matter what.<br />What she ends up collection is Sam. At first, she feels sorry for the man, after all his fianc&eacute; dumped in just before the big fancy wedding, so she takes him to the caters to feed him. She think he is much too calm about being dumped, afraid he is in shock. He explains the marriage was viewed as a business deal. His fianc&eacute; was beautiful, a good hostess, and 'so perfect, so reasonable'. As Sam sees it, he needed a woman who could play hostess for his huge business dinners. When he considers matters, he sees Desdemona as the solution. She is a cater, she can plan huge receptions with an ease. So he hires her, and naturally romance follows.<br />Desdemona thinks Sam is too alone in the world, so she involves him with her fruitcake, thespian family...to teach Sam to feel with his heart, instead of think with his computer brain. She views Sam as a medieval Knight physically, but too analytical. But she is blessed with his Knight side when someone began to menace her and threaten to kill her.

Well, Jayne Ann Krentz aka Amanda Quick has basically one formula for her stories. But what a formula. She is light, she is witty, but the Quicks are just her JAKs in period costume. But that does not stop her from giving you a winner tale. If you like JAK/Quick, you will LOVE her only medieval. If you are not her fan...your tough luck..lol...you are missing one great time!!<br />The one of two medievals (Desire being the other) from the talented Ms. Krentz/Quick.

The tale is so endearing! Lady Alice will Capture your heart!!<br />When Lady Alice plucks up her nerve and approaches Hugh the Relentless, is its a dark and stormy night (lol). He is black haired, with amber eyes (with JAK you get amber, green or grey!). The first impression, he is every bit the fearsome warrior of his reputation, but to Lady Alice he is her knight in shining armour. She thinks she can control this man, after all she has been driving away fortune-seeking suitors for years, along with managing her interfering family.<br />Lady Alice has deliberately lured him to this man with the promise of a green crystal belong to him.

This is my favourite JAK novel, and I have read it several times, just because these characters are so warm, funny and loving.<br />Annie Lyncroft equated Oliver Rain to a panther taken on human form, so she knew she was treading on dangerous ground when she approached him with a business proposal. Her genius brother had disappeared mysterious, and is feared dead. Annie is not equipped to step into his shoes and run the firm, because it is built around her brother's electronic inventions. Oliver is a high powered businessman, friend of her brother, so she goes to Oliver with an offer that would save her brother's firm, until he can be found. A marriage on convenience. Marry her, give the business investors knowledge that Oliver Rain was there backing her brother's firm as part of the family.<br />Only a marriage on convenience is not convenient when both Annie and Oliver were deeply attracted to each other from first meeting. Oliver is taken off balance by the offer, only because he was slowly, calculating working to corner Annie so she would accept a marriage offer from him. Not being one to look a gift horse in the mouth, Oliver quickly agrees to Annie's terms.<br />Oliver is a quite Alpha/Gamma male, a panther on the prowl and Annie soon learns making deals with the devil can mean paying a high price. And Oliver is making a clear a marriage of convenience is the first condition to be tossed out the window.<br />JAK is on beam, at her best, with Annie and Oliver just endearing characters, with a Quirky manservant/bodyguard tossed in called Bolt.

I enjoyed McShane's read voice. Some actor/readers, try to act took much when they read - I mean males doing higher voices for females are such a pain. McShane give the right tone, a narrator and is it an enjoyed voice that carries you vividly into the world of ex-jockey Sid Halley. Injured in a riding accident, he now is a Enquiry agent/security expert that is looking into the strange accidents happening and Seabury Race Course.<br />Dick Francis' writing, quite naturally, is excellent, though it is McShane excellent narration that has me listening to this tape again and again.

Jacob is one of the Alpha males that JAK characters loves to run circles around and this is one of her better 'early' works.<br />Her writing is sharp, the wit incisive and I love the heart she put into this one.<br />Emily has been in love with Jacob Stone, corporate trouble shooter for her families international business. He once rescued her from a kidnapper, and from that moment Emily secretly kept that awe and love locked in her heart.

The family fears the son of a competitor is using Emily to gain stock in their business.

Starting from the title, this book is just the opposite of what you expect.  It is fresh, with a dry humour that is so engaging.  Since reading this, I am a dyed in the wool McCrumb fan, and this is one of her best!!<br />This is the 6th Elizabeth McPherson novels.  This time, she is on a tour of England, with a motley crew, and one really aggravating heiress, Susan.  Susan's uncle has paid the tour guide to bump his niece off somewhere along the trip...only one problem - he keeps missing Susan.<br />It is so funny, a mystery where you are rooting for the bad guy to succeed!!

Seducing Sullivan is missing some of the wit Leto spices her other works with, but she still delivers a winning tale. She is one of the best in creating such 'real' characters. They are not larger than life fictional characters, but everyday hard working people, that are so warm, vulnerable and caring. It is her strong suit, and it sets her away from other writers.<br />Seducing Sullivan is a book of wishes and what-ifs. Angela Harris goes to her 10 year High School reunion with one purpose in mind: to have her 'prom night' with Jack Sullivan. They were an item during high school, but Angela the 'good girl' kept putting Jack off. On prom night, she had prepared to give herself to him, but they ended in an argument and them breaking up. Now a decade later, Angela knows it is time to get over her teenage love for Jack, and put him behind her once and for all, but the feels the only what to do this is to finish that night, find out the reality falls short of years of fantasy.<br />She needs to face Jack and settle her girlhood dreams, but she also need to see what sort of man Jack has become. His parents were jet-setters and from what she saw in the Tabloids, Jack has taken after them. He is world famous photographer, and has been linked to one model after another. Hardly material to be considered for marriage and fatherhood. Angela needs to know what sort of man he is because of Dani, her daughter. That prom night 10 years ago, after their breakup, Jack went out with her best-friend and got drunk. The result was Dani. 5 Years ago, Dani's mother, Angela's best-friend was killed and she was made Dani's guardian. She had no idea Jack was the father of Dani until she began trying to track down the man who fathered her.<br />Angela is a very real person. She feels things for Jack, but does not trust him, she loves her best friend and utterly adores Dani, yet she also feels twinges of regret and resentment over how things turned out, betrayed by both her friend and Jack. This is quite human. She is no paperdoll character, but a complex woman.<br />Jack believes Angela never knew about his drunken night with her best friend, and fears Angela would never speak to him again if she found out. He never knew or suspected about Dani. However, he comes to the class union hoping to find Angela. He has never know a family or home, and something inside him is crying out for this sort of security, and his heart tells him Angela 'his angel' is the woman to heal him and give him hope for the future.

This time she takes her readers on rousing adventure into Scotland.<br />Edain was a foundling, raised by nuns who said she was 'special'. She was also very beautiful. The beauty provoked a minor barron to steal her from the convent, but not wanting to incur the wrath of his liege and the church, he set about to marry her off to one of his men so he could claim 'first night' with her.

I am sorry, this is nothing but sensationalism. Cornwell is being manuplitive, cashing in on the Jack the Ripper interest to push her books. It makes nice fiction, but she is off target in labelling Walter Sickert as the Ripper and borders on foolishness in saying case closed and Sickert was Jack. <BR>If anyone bothered to see the BBC interview or read Stephen Knight's Book, you would have learned Sickert was involved in the whole mess, but she totally missed the point. Sickert was a player, a user, possibly a blackmailer - and conceivably was pointing out the targets as \\"Jack\\" hunted for Mary Kelly. <br />But to claim 'case closed'....that is as false a claim as Sickert was the Ripper.	2002-11-26

But I thought Wallace such a great, sweeping figure. This was decades before Randall Wallace accidentally discovered William Wallace on a vacation in Scotland and read Anne Porter's Highland Chiefs. Wallace, to me, was such a true Patriot - not a Saint, but a man willing to go to the wall, to die for what he believed. Not many of us would walk in his shoes, so I have to admire his willingness to die for an idea.<br />James MacKay gives a richly details account of the Scottish clime of politics that formed and fermented Wallace. It might be a little bit more than the average reader would be interested in (I would suggest Grey's book on Wallace in that case), but for those wishing to know more without wading through Blind Harry, this is a wonderful work.<br />A perfect gift to that friend that watched Braveheart more than once!!	2002-11-25

I love historical romances, but often bemoan the past few years where the majority of historical romances are 99% romance and 1% history. You often wonder why the writer bothered to set it in a historical era when they book is virtually a contemporary romance with a horse tossed in for show. I love history as much as I do the sweeping passion, so I am delighted there are still a few writers out there that remember the HISTORICAL. Maggie Davis is one of the best historical romance writers around. I love her OUT OF THE BLUE, HUSTLE SWEET LOVE and THE LAST MALE VIRGIN (rumour has it Hollywood is looking to do it as a movie - cool!!). However, I am shocked her historicals have often not gotten the attention they deserve.<br />The Winter Serpent is heavy on history and it is absolutely amazing!! It is a gritty story of a Scot's lass, beautiful and strong-willed, who will let no man break her pride. Dorieann is the beauty daughter of a Scots Chieftain and Pict mother. Her foster brother kills her father and assumes control of the Scots Clan. He desires Dorieann, but she refuses his advances. In his fury, he sells her to the Viking settles, fierce warriors of the Norse Bear Cult, believing she will kill herself rather than submit to them. Dorieann is surprised to learn she has been bought for Thorsten, their leader. She survives, adjusts, and earns Thorsten's approval so much that he takes her as his wife. This is not the way her stepbrother wanted her fate to go, so he begins to ferment trouble for her and the Vikings.<br />Maggie Davis pulls no punches as she gives you a true historical romance, full of details and realistic portrayals of a woman surviving, yet keeping her pride and spirit, making life the best she can in a world that was very harsh to woman.<br />Applause for her not taking the easy road, but sticking to a believable depiction of a woman of fire. So if you want more historical in your historical romance, this wonderful tale of the Scots, Picts and Vikings is just your cup of tea!gs is just your cup of tea!	2002-11-25

There comes once in a great while an actor or writer that grabs you from the first time you see their work. From that moment on, you know you will see quality work from them. Julie Elizabeth Leto is such a writer. She is a charming, fresh voice in the romance field, and I love how her characters are very down to earth people; they are your friends or someone you know. She is able to imbue them with a vitality that lets them leap off the pages and into your heart.<br />Private Lessons is quirky, typical Leto, with sexy, intriguing characters that is written with incisive sharp wit. Grant Riordan is a stuffed shirt. He is an investment broker with a firm that deals with elderly clients who abhor scandal. The firm already has weathered one such front page sex to-do and definitely does not want another. Grant has been pegged to live in the firm's property for a year, and is under the constant spot checks of his boss. Worse, is the old bat across the street is a local reporter for a gossip columnist and she is watching Riordan like a hawk hoping to find more dirt on the firm.<br />Grant's brother Gus springs a small bachelor party at the house - with Grant sweating bullets, and the nosey neighbour already calling Grant's boss reporting there are too many cars outside. Just as the boss calls to inform him he is coming over to check on Riordan, in walks Harley: the hired stripper. In the fuss that follows Harley informing she refuses to perform, she is knocked on the head and when awakens cannot recall who she is.<br />Grant is stuck with Harley, since he cannot call the police knowing the questions about a missing person would attact notice of the press and his boss. He has to maintain this stuff shirt life because his ex-wife took him to the cleaners.

I think Julie Elizabeth Leto is one of the fastest rising voices in the series romance field.  She is so strong in her craft, she creates vivid, interesting characters that are very memorable, and imbues her stories with her love of the New Orleans area, showing a strong technique in romance writing.  She understand how to create sexual tension on a level of 10, yet still remembers the difference between sexual tension and romance.  She has the wee touches that make a writer shine and shine she does!!<br />This is the first of the Chance brothers series, and it is a knockout.  Serena Deveaux, grew up with Drew and Brandon, but at 17 the childhood friendships began to change.  Serena fell in a mild crush with Brandon Chance, and Drew thought he fell in love with her.  Brandon drunkenly ruined it all by shattering her teenage fantasies about romance one night.  Immediately after, he went off to join the air force, later becoming a Nightstalker pilot.  However, vision problems have forced him to retire and he is now opening a private investigation agency in the French Quarter.  And who should be his first client - his old love Serena!<br />During this time, Drew's insistence he loves Serena has grown to the point he is trying to force her into marriage.  She wants to discourage him without losing his friendship, and hits upon hiring Brandon to dim Drew's feelings.  She concocts a hair-brain scheme to hire him as her bodyguard against the \\"clich&eacute; killer\\", pure invention on her part (though she later admits to herself and him it was just an excuse to approach Brandon). She thinks if Drew sees them together in a romantic light, he will back off.  She makes a bet, knowing the men of Chance cannot back away from one, and banks on him living up to losing.  In short time, she see she still is very attracted to him, so fesses up to the whole thing being a red herring, that she was hoping to drive Drew away without ruining their friendship.  Only, someone else has other ideas and suddenly is making the \\"clich&eacute; killer\\" very real.<br />Aside from the problem of the threat, the main characters' have to deal with their different goals in life.  Brandon wants a wife in the suburbs, kids and white picket fences.  Serena is New Orleans all the way, loves to party-on-down-Cher and dance till dawn at The Reservation Hall (I have done this so truly sympathised with Serena!!).  Can they find that bridge between their desires and their wants for the future???<br />Serena and Brandon are very warm and loving characters. Serena is wild, full of life, but is afraid of commitment after her parents' divorce.  She is working to find a relationship with her estranged twin sister.  Brandon, while being Hunk extraordinaire, is also very human - having his vision problems, and forced to wear glasses.  Very Nice touch, Julie!!<br />Sprinkled in are Serena's twin sister (raised away from her), her psychic mother - who knows all - the kindly cook who makes all those wonderful New Orleans dishes that Justin Wilson would adore and all sort of New Orleans 'all that jazz'.<br />As a writer myself, I think creating one these series books is likely one of the harder tasks any writer undertakes.  To give so much in such a short span of pages is a great challenge and Julie Leto rising to that challenge so well.<br />She is one of the best and brightest talents in series romance - keep your eye on her - she is going places!!<br />I triple-dog dare you to read this and not love Leto's writing!!<br />;-)ideas and suddenly is making the \\"clich&eacute; killer\\" very real.<br />Aside from the problem of the threat, the main characters' have to deal with their different goals in life.

Pirates are so much a part of our myth, legend and Hollywood, we often overlook there were real Pirates, flesh and blood men and women that took the high seas. The life of roaming the 7 seas tended to leave little written record by the Pirates themselves, thus our whole 'idea' of who and what a pirate was has been formed by exaggeration, plays and movies.<br />David Cordingly started from that point and worked to see how much the myth compares to reality. Former head of exhibitions at England's National Maritime Museum, he had access to a writer's delight - records, court documents, eyewitness accounts, national archives - and mined those sources to give a new look at old views. He attempts to explode staunchly held myths and tries to give a new reality to replace them. These new 'truths' are as fascinating and complex as the Yo Ho Ho images of Blackbeard, Captain Kid and Henry Morgan. He also addresses lesser knowns pirates of the heyday of the Skull and Cross bones, and the cross-dressers Mary Read and Anne Bonny, the first womens libers that demanded equal pay for equal work!<br />I high recommend this to writers wishing to write of pirates or just anyone with a thirst to know MORE...	2002-11-13

The books, naturally, shows a bit of dating, but JAK's sparkling repartee, interesting characters and wit save this from dating too badly.<br />She is Sophia Athena Bennett, daughter of two geniuses. She refers to herself as 'the disaster' because she felt she could never measure up to her parents expectations. So, she removes herself to Texas and becomes a secretary (with hopes of opening her own design boutique) and dates cowboys. She is quite content with her 'down-to-earth' real world, until the Wizard shows up. HE is Dr. Max Travers, a mathematical professor, friend of her parents - and a genius- in other words - a wizard. Once again, all those feelings of not measuring up comes into play. She is very attracted to Max, but tries to keep him at arms length fearing his disappointment in dating a non-wizard. However, Max will have none of it. He wants Sophia and is willing to go to all sorts of lengths to get her.<br />It's funny, its sexy, it's warm...its JAK all the way.	2002-11-11

For many centuries the Picts have remained shrouded in myth and legend for the only written records - their Pictish stones - have been undecipherable. In 1958 with the discovering of the St. Ninan's Isle Treasure, a new focus has been applied to interpreting what we know. Written record mostly comes from people viewing the Pictish Nation from the outside, which often leads to misunderstanding, if not exaggeration...possibly slander.<br />In this highly readable account, they present the latest archaeological discovers, and discusses how these two difference races co-existed and ultimately merged of a nation of one through the slaughter of the Pict royal houses. Again, that is the only slight aggravation (as with nearly all books on this Picts) is the ignoring the importance of this and how it was the foundation of the Scottish Highlands.<br />Otherwise, an excellent work full of photographs, with recommended reading, and is a must for anyone wanting to more about the two races that formed the spine of Scotland.	2002-11-07

As a writer and lover of Historical Romances, I am sadden to see the flood of books out where the only 'historical' in historical romance is they ride horses instead of drive Jeeps, the women wear long gowns, and there is some vague mention of a King on a throne.  There are so very few moving historical sagas.  I have seen a trend in 'modernising' heroines to please today's reader - which is fine to a point.  But the imaginative writer can keep heroines pleasing to today's more independent woman, and yet give a her a believability within historical accuracy of the period.<br />Maggie Davis aka Katherine Deauxville is one of the best at TRUE historical romances.  She is rich in detail, well researched in history, and can give you a headstrong woman, fighting to make her life the best she can, and yet do it within the confines of reality.  The Middle Ages was a very harsh time, it was often rough on women and their rights.  But to see a writer walk the fine tightrope of creating a truly strong female character and still maintain period accuracy you should read Amethyst Crown.<br />It is the third in her medieval trilogy, (Blood Red Roses, Golden Daggers and Amethyst Crown in that order) and possibly the best of the three.  Hard to say really, because all three are superior works.  These are the kind of deeply involving, very moving historical romances that give you unforgettable characters.<br />Rich in history, Amethyst Crown follows the life of the granddaughter of the hero and heroine of Blood Red Roses.  Constance is a great heiress, the Countess of Morliax, a pawn to King Henry.  She was 14 when she was wed to a man in his 40's as a reward for loyalty.  She was 17 when he wed her to a very brutal man, part of a truce with an enemy .  And a third time, she was wed at 19 to a young man who died in war.  Now, she has bought her freedom for three years, supposedly, but she soon fears the King plans to make a fourth match for her.<br />She is returning to Morlaix for a wedding (Daggers of Gold opened with everyone going back to Morlaix because of a wedding as well - her aunt's).  This time it is the wedding of her younger sister.  At the wedding, she is shown a witch and a madman and told she must take them with her so they can be tried later.  After the wedding, on the trail home, they stop for the night and there is a terrible storm.  The madman is set free, but before he goes to slips into Constance's tent and makes love to her.  Constance is shocked; widowed three times, twice a mother, she had found the act boring, at best.  The madman - who is no madman, but hiding his identity - sets her aflame.  But she never expects to see him again.<br />At Yuletide, she is shocked to see him at the Christmas revels.  He comes before King Henry dressed as a Fool.  He later sees a troops of foreign soldier looking for him, and knows he must leave the town...but first he must see Constance.  She realises she loves him, but knows, bottom line is it can never work out for them.<br />Her half brother kidnaps her in a plot of seize part of her earldom, tries to marry her to another, but she is rescued Cedred the Madman.  After a long journey to save her people from the clutches of her half brother, she so wants to go with Cedred, but knows she has a duty to her children and the many people that depend upon her.<br />The tale is longer than the standards of today's books, but it is totally involving.  You are moved deeply by this woman's struggles in a time when woman had little power, and what they did have could be seized or given away as reward or payment due at a King's whim.  Yet through it all, Constance's is a tower of strength, a logical woman, yet a passionate woman.<br />She is a woman you will long remember, years after the book is put down.<br />I just reread this book for the first time in years, so I could write a good review - being shocked to see no one had reviewed this yet.  I intended to skim it just so it was fresh in my mind.  I found I could not 'skim it'.  Once again, I was pulled in Constance's world, enthralled by the power of her passion, her devotion, her reason and her triumphs and tragedies.<br />Kudos, Maggie aka Katherine, for creativing a truly wonderful tale of a REAL medieval woman!!ind.

She had published several novels, a guidebook for the Highland life, and other books on the Picts.<br />There are excellent photographs, maps and drawing to help illustrate her text presentation.<br />She begins by tracing the origins fo the picts from the neolithic nomad-farmer, coming of bronze age, moving into the invaders from Rome, covering Mons Graupius. The next part of the text goes into the 'foundation myths', the Kings List, St Columba. Also it covers the forts and palaces. She dedications a section to the stones and symbols, especially Pictish-Christian interaction. The 5th sections covers the important people in a Pictish tribe, the warlocks, hunters, monks and touches on Pictish Lore. Section Six dealing with what has been left behind, Language, writing, jewellery. Seventh section dealing with the everyday life in a Pictich Settlement. Finally the last section deals with the Viking invaders, later Viking settlers and the Rise of Kenneth mac Alpin.<br />The Only fault I find in the work was she lightly skipped over Kenneth's slaughter of the Pictish royal houses in order to cement his matriarchal claim to rule the Picts. Other than that, I found the work very well done and would be of interest for someone wanting a bit more detail about these fascinating people that formed the backbone of the Highlands.	2002-11-02

Blind Harry or Blin Hary the Minstrel is believed to live from 1440-1493. Very little is really known about him. However, he is recalled for this major achievement of gathering and recording stories of Wallace. Supposedly the first written work about Wallace. He sang or recited these stories in verse form, and it is noted that he was well received at the Renaissance Court of James IV. One must recall these tales were collected well over 100 years after Wallace's death, giving plenty of time for the legend to already take root. Many of the details of Harry's epic are very accurate, some are not (but then he certainly is a lot closer than Randall Wallace!!).<br />William Hamilton(c1665-1751) brought Wallace back into the minds of everyone with the translation of Blind Harry's original poem.<br />One needs to understand this is written from a very pro Scots point of view, and tends to see Scots as the good guys and English as the bad ones, with few areas of grey. But taken on a whole, with most of the works on Wallace stemming from English records, it gives a balanced picture in studying Wallace.	2002-11-02

It traces the consequences that were serious enough to push King James to leave Edinburgh and the compromise with the Kirk, and notes the Earl of Huntly was never punished for his deed.<br />Moray figured very heavily in two ballads dealing with his murder, an expression of the outrage over his murder by the people.

There is NO ONE that creates such vivid characters of men with black hearts and even blacker souls, and the woman compelled to love them no matter what. Moonrise is my ABSOLUTE FAVOURITE book, but Night Fall comes a close second.<br />Cassidy is the daughter to a famous tell-all writer father, Sean, who has just made a pack with the devil, a pack that includes 'giving' his daughter to the devil for his own dark purposes. Her ailing father see the chance to have the book of the decade - maybe his last work - to reveal what a court trial did not: what happened to Richard Tiernan's children the night he murdered his wife. Did he kill them as well and hide their bodies?<br />In order to secure the inside information, he invite Tiernan into his own home while the book is in the works, and Tiernan awaits sentencing that could result in his death for the murders of his wife and children. Manipulated by the powerful father, Cassidy is forced to agree to edit the book, but soon begins to feel that is merely an excuse to put her in the path of Tiernan.<br />What does he want with her? What dark plans does he have for her? Repulsed by a murderer, Cassidy is slowly drawn against will to the compelling man full of secrets and darkness. What more can he be hiding? Isn't killing his wife and children bad enough? What dark secrets lurk in his soul, and why is Cassidy and his complete control over her so suddenly important?<br />Stuart delivers a sexy, steamy dark mystery that will keep you biting your nails to the very end.

I have long admired Dorchester Publishing, finding I read more and more of their writers such as Melanie Jackson and Trish Jensen. They are fresh, super storytellers and Dorchester gives them the leeway to shine. And Claudia Dain not only shines in this novel, she burns!!! What a super read!!<br />There is a trend toward the light whimsical historicals and I utterly adore to leader of this pack Lynsay Sands. But while I cannot wait for one of her new books to come out, I also love 'heavy' historicals such as Danegeld by Susan Squires (both Dorchester writers), and Claudia Dain gives one super strong historical.<br />Writing of a period that many have overlooked in the romance market: the void left as the Romans pulled out of England and the Saxons rose to power - she paints the canvass not only with strong bold, sure strokes, but with vivid colours.<br />I have been in writers chat several times with Dain, and found her a lively person with a super sense of humour, but she also loves history, and being a history lover myself, I was intrigued recently as she discussed To Burn. So naturally, I rushed out to buy it and am very glad I did.<br />She gives us two very strong alpha leads. She is Melania, the roman woman who detests the loathsome Saxon. He is Wulfred, the Saxon who kills her father and destroys her villa and hates all things Roman. She calls him Oaf, he calls her snake and they utterly HATE each other. He finds her hiding in a bolthole, and sets it afire to force her out. In Valiant, almost Viking mentality, she accepts dying there, because it would be on her own terms, not his. He plans on killing her, but sees that is just want she wants. A quick death in warrior fashion. And since he hates her and all she stands for, he perversely denies her the death she so wants, and makes her his slave intending to break her spirit before he grants her death.<br />But he finds breaking her spirit an impossible task. She is constantly provoking him with diatribes against him and all things Saxon, she scratches, kick and bites anytime he gets near, deliberately trying to provoke his temper into murdering her. She continually tries to kill herself.

Katherine Deaxuville (Maggie Davis) has quietly been one of the consistent writers in the romance field, whether Contemporary or Historicals for last couple of decades. With the flush of super new writers, it is easy to over look the leaders in the field that have set the trends and lead the way. Many of Deauxville's wonderful books clearly deserve reprinting, and it causes the reader to wonder why this is not happening.<br />In Dagger's of Gold, a sequel to Blood Red Roses (be sure to read Amethyst Crown the 3rd in the series), follows the story of Simon de Bocage, a fierce Knight back from the Crusades, and cousin to Gilbert, son of Fulk de Jobourg (hero in Blood Red Roses).<br />Simon is charged with delivering Ingrith, a saxon beauty to Prince Henry as a bribe, along with carrying a secret mission to help overthrown the King. Simon has long thought he was in love with Gilbert's sister, though the sister seems unaware of this and had gotten married to another as the story opens.<br />Ingrith, is not happy with the notion of being offered as a toy for a prince, but she has been told her mother and sisters will be well cared for if she willingly goes along with this. She wants the protection for her family, but really does not relish the idea of going along with this, so she comes up with a scheme to lose her virginity so she loses her value as a toy for the prince. When a drunken Simon takes her virginity thinking she is Gilbert's sister, she believes her plan is secure. But in the morning she cannot convince Simon of what he has done - with a little assist! So she must set out to compromise him again.<br />Along the way, they are attacked by rebels, the house they are is set afire, so it becomes evident someone is trying to stop Simon's mission or kill Ingrith.<br />Maggie creates vivid, warm characters you will care about, love and laugh with...and long remember.<br />It is a wonderful book, so full of period detail, rich in history, and such engaging writing.  Maggie has a way of keeping women very realistic in her historicals. She portrays the period accurately, yet is still able to make her heroines have a fire and a spirit, a very deft turn when many reader fail to grasp the limitations on women in the period.<br />This book truly deserves reprinting ( with a descent cover!), and I find is shocking it is being ignored.<br />REPRINT PLEASE! so everyone can discover this wonderful writer!!Maggie has a way of keeping women very realistic in her historicals.

Don't get me wrong, she is one of my favourite authors and I feel nearly all her early works as Stephanie James and the others for Candlelight and Temptation hold up very well in reprint.  In many instances, I think she demonstrates her shining talent, with a fresh spontaneity she is lacking in her last few hard backs. However, this is NOT one of them. The characters are dated, the situation, near ridiculous....sorry....just nothing going this.<br />I disliked the female character especially.  She goes from logical, level head person one minute, to this very whiny, spiteful, unrealitic woman the next.  UGH, spare me.<br />Save your money and buy Amaryllis, Zinnia or Orchid and have a much better time. This one should have been released like they did some of her (MUCH BETTER) Stephanie James and given a lower release price.	2002-10-31

The Templars have always fascinated me, an order founded on a vow of poverty that rose to become one of the richest and most powerful organisations of their time, a religious order, yet it was politics and money that sealed their fate and brought about their destruction.<br />Very well written, it is rich in detail, but in a witty narrative that keeps the reader enthralled and forgetting they are reading history, which is usually dry and stale. High Recommended. Anyone interested in the Templars needs to add this one to their collection.	2002-10-31

Kathleen has created one of freshest concepts in romance: the Immortals. These are children of the Auld Gods set in modern day. Zeus, Hera and gang are from another planet, but were rebel-rousers, so were banished ages ago to Earth. Zeus, now Zeke, owner of a fireworks firm, is ageing (Sean Connery - lol) and he is looking back on life with many regrets. All the children of alliances with him, are troubled, unable to find true love unless they mate with a child descended from another Auld God. He is also sorry for all these problems the many romances caused between Hera and him. So he has decided to play matchmakers for the children of his line, determined to see them happy, and maybe at the same time, mend the troubles between Hera and himself.<br />In the last book, The Warrior, we met Dia Trelawny - a magician and Hugh Pendragon, a Soul Seeker. Hugh uses his soul seeking powers to be a manhunter for the police - only since meeting Dia his powers are blocked. He needs two cuff bracelets to use the power - though he is not aware of it - one ruby and one opal. Blackmailed by the Goddess Demeter, Dia unknowingly helped switch the opal in one cuff. Now Hugh is troubled with nightmares and unable to call upon the sight to help him in his work. And somehow, he knows Dia holds to key. He comes to realise that he can access the visions when he is in contact with her.<br />Hera and Zeus arrive on the scene knowing Hugh is the man for Dia, but Demeter has other plans, so it is up to the duo to put things right. Add in Hugh's Butler, Ronald, his jewellery stealing down, Cerberus, Dia's twin nephews and twin nieces, a missing sister and it all spells super fun!!<br />It is excellently writing, with well painted characters, full of depth and emotion. It is vital, sensual and it will capture you from the very start and keep you hooked the whole time, unable to put it down.<br />I cannot wait for the next one in the Immortal Series, but it just does not get any better than this.

When I ran a book store, there was a lady who came in and preordered everything Maggie Davis (also writes as Katherine Deauxville) wrote before it came out. Did not matter what the story was, what the period, she KNEW Maggie gave her a great read. She insisted I read her and I truly thank her for that recommendation, and never missed a Maggie or Katherine since! And there at lot of Maggie's and Katherine's keepers (okay all her works) on my shelves!! And Hustle, Sweet Love is one of my favourite contemporaries (though I am quite partial to Out of the Blue and The Last Male Virgin these days!!)<br />Hustle is just one sweet read from beginning to end!!<br />Lacy Kingsley is ending her career in modelling and taking up a new position as a junior fashion editor at a magazine in New York. While in Tulsa, she has a wee bit too much champagne celebrating the end of one part of her life, and the start of another. In her kick-back high time, she is mistakenly thought to be a call-girl by one sexy, dark and dangerous man. The champagne combines with instant attraction, so she indulges in once in a life time, one-night stand. The next morning, she really has a hangover and regrets her letting loose. Rather than face the 'morning after and morning breath' blues, she sneaks away from the hotel room, and hopes the whole thing will be forgotten.<br />Only, this is not to be the case. For who should buy the magazine where she is working??? Mr. Sexy, Dark & Dangerous. He turns out to be Michael Echevarria and no matter how hard she tries to convince him she is not that lady in Tulsa, but he won't buy her song and dance.<br />Maggie Davis gives you a feel of New York, and behind the scenes of the fashion world, with mistaken identities, tons of misunderstandings and warm loving characters that you really care about. It is simply a delight to read. The secondary characters are sharp, adding to the spice and the pace rapid, moving you from one wonderful scene to another.<br />This is one WONDERFUL GEM!! Another of Maggie's strong body of contemporaries and Historicals that NEED REPRINTING!!one WONDERFUL GEM!!

This is one of four SONG books, the last, but it stands on its own very well, and is the best of Coulter's works. It is funny, warm and you really love these characters.<br />Philippa de Beauchamp, is a long-legged girl, tall as many of her suitors. After her sisters fianc&eacute; tries to kiss her, her father says he is going to marry her to the repugnant Baron de Bridgeport. He was merely telling the suitor that, but Phillipa believe it, and decides to escape her fate. She stows away in a waggon full of wool, heading to town. Only the waggons are stolen by one Dienwald de Fortenberry. Dienwald is a self-styled lord of the manor, a rogue, a robber and answers to no one, though he does try to take care of his people. Which is why he was stealing the wool. They are in desperate need of new clothing. What he did not need was the woolly monster that rose up out of the waggon. Once it is cleaned up, he find he has a woman nearly as tall as him, one worth a ransom. So he keeps her prison. However, she takes over the castle. It is a pigsty and she sees it cleaned, she sets about to having the wool spin for cloth, then clothing made for everyone. And she slowly falls in love with Dienwald. Only romance is not smooth!! Especially when he learns that she is the bi-blow daughter of Edward the Longshanks.<br />This is so wonderful, much in the style of Lynsay Sands engaging &amp; warm historicals. So if you enjoy Lynsay, I highly recommend this to her fans.<br />Many of Coulter's older historical were rather rough in the treatment of the females, so it a delight to see one so charming and endearing.	2002-10-30

The Anglo-Saxon period was a time of turbulent upheaval and change in Britain, and Fisher provides riveting accounts of the conquests of Britain by the Anglo-Saxons, then the coming age of the Normans. The books is focused on the various parts of how Britain evolved, how the warrior bands that ruled the lands were ultimately forged into a nation, influenced by kings and church.<br />Fish is the lecturer (professor to the Yanks!!) at the University of Cambridge, and brings to bear his talents in this concise, rather straightforward work, making it one of the best books on this period for the general reader looking for answers.	2002-10-28

Linda Howard asks the question:  \\"Is there a limit to love, a point where it dies?\\" She believes there isn't and gives a very movingly works to make the case.  I give this book 5 stars because of the powerfully move story (a wee bit dated and the whole book, since it was a series, is limited in scope).<br />Howard does more in a small book, than any writer outside of Anne Stuart, and has proved consistently to be one of my favourite writers, though I have not really been wowed by the writing in the last few years.  It seems JAK, Howard and Roberts are suffering from a formula writing, that is taking the glitter off their craft, and in a move to go more mainstream is causing them to forget the romance roots, and ultimately betraying the very fans that built their careers.<br />What hurts this books, dating and limitations aside, is although you are carried along with her prose, the power of the relationship she creates, you get to the point where you just do not accept love forgives all.  I am sorry, if the man I loved believe I was an embezzler, did not confront me with the evidence FIRST and give me a chance to prove my innocence, had me arrested without the first warning or preparation, refused to take my calls from jail or after I got out....well, I just don't see how I could forgive as easily as Howard's character did.  And that in the end, it nearly cripples this book so much.<br />Tessa Conway is working in accounting of Carter Engineering.  The firm is having the losses of large revenue, they bring in Brett Rutland the corporation's top troubleshooter. Brett has the reputation of a pitbull, has little respect for women, uses them and leaves them without a care.  He is an emotionless hunter that shows no pity, and he goes after Tessa with the cutting edge of wanting sex and information.  But he falls in love with her (or so Howard would try to make you believe).  But he resents this so much, nearly hates her in his own way for taking away his control, that when he finds evidence showing Tessa guilty of stealing thousands and thousands of dollars, that he has her arrested.  No warning, no chance to prove her innocence, no support.  She is arrested and booked.  She tries to call him, believing her lover, the man she loves desperately, will make everything all right.  He refuses to take her calls.  After she gets out of jail, he still refuses to take her calls.  She finally goes to see him at his hotel and he cruels says he only slept with her to gain information.  This nearly destroys her.  All in an effort to save his pride.<br />Later, in an the middle of the night, he finally realises she could go to prison.  He loves her (? sorry that is a big leap of faith for me at this point) and cannot stand to know the woman he loves will go to prison, so he goes to his boss and makes a deal to get the charges dropped.  He tells the boss he will repay the money she stole himself, marry her.  (nice of him!!).  He arranges for the District Attorney to call her in, but she refuses to sign the agreement.  She is innocent and will not sign a confession of guilt.  It is only THEN he understands that she MIGHT be innocent.  Now convinced she is innocent, he has the charges dropped, and suddenly moves in with her to take care of the fragile woman and hunt the real thief.<br />She shows a moment of fury and lashes out with her fists.  But that is about all she does.  I am sorry, this really hurt this book.  She makes the point that she still loves him.  Well, I love so I know you will forgive a lot in your life....but you do not forgive this easily.<br />Still, with all its faults, this is a powerfully written book.  Howard weaves a spell that pulls you along, making you almost believe it...till you take a breath and reality check comes along.<br />I HIGHLY recommend it for the simple fact it is writing craft at it is highest peak, it is truly emotional...your heart will pound when she is arrested and finally comes to grips with the fact her lover is the one pressing charges.  Just sorry, that the confined treatment of the series romance, pushed Howard to take the easy road in the solution.er lover is the one pressing charges.

You know that going in, if you are looking for totally different characters, don't think you ever will find them in her body of work.  One might call her a one trick pony, but it is a very well trained pony and you really don't mind watching again and again, despite the different finery and feathers she dresses the pony in.  So if you buy a JAK, don't complain because you see the same pattern...you KNOW that is what you buying.  That said....<br />It is a fun book, with JAK wonderful quirky writing.  I mean, when her character takes one look at the Private Investigator Cyril Chandler Colfax and thinks \\"She wondered what the penalty was for strangling very large men who wore tacky aloha shirts, khaki chinos and moccasin-style loafers.  Surely no judge or jury would convict her, she thought.  Not when they saw the evidence.\\"  Well, you know the romance is off to a rocky start!!!  Eugenia Swift is a sensible young woman, a connoisseur of beautiful art, a very elegant woman.  She has been asked to go to Frog Cove Island, and artistic Haven outside of Seattle.  She is to go there to catalogue the art collection of Adam Daventry.  Only, she is forced to take Colfax as a body guard, much to her dismay.  The dismay increases to horror, when Colfax insists they pose as lovers while on the island.<br />This does not sit well will Eugenia, because she is going there not only to catalogue the artworks, but to find out what happened to her friend, Nellie Grant, the late Adam's Daventry's lover.  She thinks the green-eyed Colfax (green this time - you get green, grey or amber....lol) might crimp her investigation into Nellie's death.  What she does not understand, Colfax is on a trek to avenge an old wrong.<br />Eugenia has always keep her emotions on the shelf, putting everything into her career, but it soon becomes evident, that their lives will depend on them playing convincing lovers.<br />JAK delivers her usual spunky heroine who tries to run circles around the deceptively deep male...and does it with style.to run circles around the deceptively deep male...and does it with style.	2002-10-27

It is a heavy volume and very high glass paper.  Much care went into making this a collector's book.  The Binding is sewing not glued, so the workmanship is not often seen in books these days.<br />Now to the inside...two pages are dedicated to most Clans, showing excellent colour pictures of the tartan.  It also lists the Clan's arms, crest, motto.  It give a better than average history of each Clan, which takes up the first 2/3s of the book.  The later part takes up the Armigerous Clans, many of these are often left out of works in most Clan and Tartan reference works, so this is definitely a plus.  In Appendix 1 they give you a good Chronology of dates of importance in Scottish History.  For a timeline, it's better than most I have been in works similar to this.  Appendix 2 gives Scottish Monarchs for Kenneth I to the Union of Parliaments in 1707.  Appendix 3 is a very nice glossary of Heraldic Terms - was very impressed with this section.  Appendix 4 for gives septs and names associated with various Clans.  I have seen this in other works, and again, this one is much better.  Appendix 5 will be of special interests to people tracing their family treat as his gives you information concerning tracing genealogy in Scotland.  There is an Index, with excellent fonts, so easy to read.<br />All in all worthy, quick reference for the Clans of Scotland.	2002-10-27

This was the second strongest of the group.<br />But as usual, Angela Knight gives you the best and most memorable tale.  Red Sage's Secrets are very interesting cutting edge of Romance fiction.

This is a gentle, funny story of a young lady in a trouble family. Brother was killed race carriages through London; Father now drinks and gambles his money away, leaving Mother, young daughter and Pru making wishes they won't end up in the poor house before New Year's Eve.<br />Pru, like all Lynsay's spunky characters, decides to take matters into her hands and corner papa in the gambling hell. Her efforts to get inside the Men Only club is a riot that will have you howling out loud. And naturally, who should she meet and fall for - the owner of the gaming hell. But can he make her wishes come true?<br />Lynsay is tops at giving you really funny situations, without insulting the intelligence of the characters or the readers. This is one of those stories that will linger in your mind for years to come.<br />Mark my words: Lynsay Sands is the next big break out writer. When I was selling Books there were three names I said would break away from the pack and shine, Linda Howard, Nora Roberts, and Jayne Ann Krentz. I have been saying to friends, watch out, Lynsay Sands will be the next one.<br />Any romance reader would love this under the trees. Men, give this and a box of chocolate and you will have her heart!!!	2002-10-26

She is formula, but it is a formula we so enjoy. All her males are deceptive mild on outside, very controled inside; they are Alpha Males underneath and don't you think otherwise.  They are green, grey or amber eyed. She is not that pretty, but very vivacious, a forceful personality and is used to getting her own way. Generally, she has been hurt, maybe he has been hurt or both, and one side of their family - close kissing cousins of the Adams Family - will drive them nuts. Every book has their share of quirky characters, and lots of rapier repartee, mostly centre around a mystery that forces the leads together.<br />There!! I just reviewed EVERY JAK book every written...however, have you ever looked at Nora Roberts?? You are talking formula again. Lets face it - out side of Maggie Davis with her Out of the Blue and Last Male Virgin - most stories have already been written dozens of times. It is what the writer DOES with the story. JAK does very well. Just we sort of know her too well so the razzle-dazzle is a bit expected, so we are let down. When someone yells BOO! you jump the first time. 5th time it's the same fightful BOO!, but you go yeah yeah...<br />I really enjoyed Flash. Not as much as Wildest Hearts, Deep Waters or Absolutely, Positively, but I really enjoyed it.<br />Olivia Chantry is a messy bessy in the desk department, but she is a one woman dynamo in her business Light Fantastic. The Chantry family (the pains in the bums this go around) expected her to inherit and run her uncle's business Glow, Inc. when he dies. Instead, he was in money troubles and sold the 51% of the stock to Jasper Sloan. Naturally, they are at loggerheads about how to run the business, with Olivia not likely she is 49% owner, but they have little time to iron this out, before a blackmailer strikes. They are forced to reveal all to each other and work together to stop the blackmailer.<br />Formula, formula, formula...JAK trademark all the way...but this dog and and pony show is one well polished rendition....the blackmailer.<br />Formula, formula, formula...JAK trademark all the way...but this dog and and pony show is one well polished rendition....	2002-10-25

I rank this one With \\"Absolutely, Positively\\" \\"Trust Me\\" and \\"Wildest Hearts\\" as been JAK's best works.  It is full of warm witty JAK characters and I loved Charity and Elias!!<br />Charity Truitt is from the Truitt department store money and they expected her to marry Brett Loftus heir to Loftus Athletic Gear, a marriage of the families and the businesses merged.  Only Charity was not going along with well managed plans.  Instead, she opens a bookstore in Whispering Waters Cove.  A quaint peer, with bunch of eclectic shops and boutiques.  Only problem, the owner of the peer died and left the pier to Elias Winters, along with his odd ball shop called Charms & Virtues.  Land speculation is booming and the peer is either a thorn in the side or a place that will be developed, and everyone is betting that Elias is just waiting to make his move.<br />Only Charity, is marshalling the shop owners, trying to fight the greed mayor and their cronies, and plans to spearhead an open confrontation with Elias.  Elias claims he is not going to sell the peer, and plans on running Charms & Virtues.  She does not full trust him at first, but that does not stop her from being attracted to the controlled man.  She finds he is definitely a man where still waters run deep, a martial arts master, former career executive and a man with intense emotions that he keeps them very tightly controlled.  Add to the mix the showdown between the shop owners, the town people and a cult waiting for an alien invasion and you have one wonderful book.<br />Simply a marvellous read!!!!!!!!!	2002-10-24

It left you wanting more. It is a really neat quirky tale of a harassed sheriff hating the \\"blue moon\\" because things went wrong and there were more weirdos out than usual. He meets a witch called called Lilah. Just wish these characters could have been made into a full story. This was so quick, especially considering it was Howard's name pushing the book.<br />\\"Ruined\\" by Jillian Hunter is wonderful. A very strong, almost Gothic story that also could have benefited from a longer treatment. In 1843 her yacht crashed off of his cove of Cornwall. Rylan \\" DeWilde never expected to fall in love with his guest Sydney Windsor, especially after he learns she is engaged to marry his enemy. Would have made a super Big book!!!<br />The weakest was \\"Buried Treasure\\" by Miranda Jarrett. About two men competing for the same woman, and one a pirate.<br />Really enjoyed \\"Swept Away\\" about a PI chasing a woman he loves. But in order to keep on her trail, he must go home to a town full of bad memories.<br />I am not big on westerns, but Geralyn Dawson's \\"Castaway\\" was very good. In 1883 Texas, Drew Coryell lives alone on an island. He peace is shattered when his ex-wife arrives, needing a big favour. She wants his help in tracing a precious heirloom, but finds love the second time around even more precious.<br />Odd mix of contemporaries and historicals, but still very nice collection.	2002-10-23

This is a brilliantly funny book, but frankly I recommend the reading on audio tape because Keith Szarabajka (the gruffly stick-his-finger-in-the-fan Mickey Kostmayer of The Equalizer) makes it even better.  His sexy, gravelly voice, is the perfect foil for Least Heath-Moon's utterly droll stroll through the forgotten highways across the US.  The wit is incisive, about his personal life and the small towns and villages the blue highways(the roads mark in blue on US maps).  These were once the main arteries of the US highways system, but are the 'Norman Bates' now forgotten restaurants, motels and quirky little people that refuse to give up their way of life.	2002-10-23

I am beginning to believe Katherine Deauxville is one of the most misunderstood romance writers around. She wrote some of the most memorable historicals with The Crystal Heart ( my favourite), Blood Red Roses and the funny, brilliant Enraptured. She is very well researched, creates such original characters....well, I fear so is SO ORIGINAL people are just not getting with the program. Her writing is so witty, her tongue firmly planted in cheek...she delivers you works so unlike any others and I am THANKFUL for it!!<br />I have read so many thousands of books in my lifetime, and a LOT of them just fade into nothing, blur into the stereotypical...NOT with Any of Maggie Davis/ Katherine Deauxville's works. Each and everyone will live on in your mind!! I have noticed that Brits tend to appreciate Maggie more than Yanks!...hum...say no more...say no more...;-)<br />But I have to admit, Out Of The Blue is one that is hard to write about!!!! I start laughing, just thinking about it!<br />Maryellen Caswell awakens on morn, to gasp!!!! find that her body has been taken over by an alien. She is not even lucky enough to be taken over by a female alien, she gets stuck with Sub-commander Ur Targon. Since he not only has the ability to control her body, he also controls her voice, poor Maryellen finds herself a mess. Well, New York has seen their share of fullmoonitis and the loonies it brings out, so a lot of weirdness can be taken without a raised eyebrow, but Targon is something even the most hardened New Yorker cannot ignore. He is not really thrilled with his new assignment, and is sort of P.O.ed about the mix-up that lands him in a female body, thus he is looking for find a replacement as soon as possible. Maryellen is more than willing to help him, naturally wishing to see him on his way, if he would only keep his....er....her mouth shut and stop drawing attention!!!!!!!<br />Her sisters thinks she is losing her marbles and sends her to a shrink, but he is confirmed UFOer and is thrilled with the concept of 'catching one'. Enters Wolf Madder ( hum sounds suspiciously like Fox Mulder X Filer)...then they figure out Targon can materialise outside of her body with some help from orange juice...(well the breakfast drink ever be viewed again and not chuckled at???).<br />I have seen several people refer to this book as unrealistic...HUN???

She just does not get any better. Molly Abberwick owns a tea and spice shop, enjoying her life in Seattle until her father dies and leaves her in charge of his Foundation to help budding inventors. She is now facing a problem. The problem is Dr. Harry Stratton Trevelyn, who is the 'debunker' of fake inventions. He vets the applicants before Molly passes out the money grants. Molly gets very enthusiastic about all sorts of inventions, only to have Harry shoot them down time after time. So far, he has not approved one single invention.<br />Harry has his own problems. He is caught between the two sides of his family - the very rich socialite Stratton side and his carnival side Trevelyns. Harry is very rich, so the carnival family is always asking him for this and that, with both sides keeping a constant tug of war on Harry. This emotional battlefield has caused Harry to be very self contained, maybe too controlled. The one place his control is let loose is in the bedroom. Also around to cause him headaches is his ex-fianc&eacute;, a psychiatrist who thinks Harry might be slightly insane and is trying to warn Molly from to not get involved with him. The final mix to Harry's problem is his is psychic and does not want to admit it. Having been raised in a carnival part-time, he has seen this used as a game, so he does not like to let people know about it.<br />As Molly slowly gets involved with Harry and the whole cast of his family, someone starts to play dangerous pranks on her, and it is quickly evident someone wants her dead.<br />The characters are so warm, so loving and with that JAK razzle-dazzle that she has polished to a beautiful diamond finished.<br />Lets hope she soon gets back to this level of writing.	2002-10-23

It is quite depressing about one man's passion and his madness. It is a wonderful study of a man obsessed words. And yet, at times I found it darkly humorous. I mean if you were working on a project that would take 70 years, you would never see finished in your lifetime, you were trying to catalogue EVERY word in the English language, the origins and variations, and do this in the 1800's when there was no computers - no typewriters....well, you would HAVE to be mad.<br />So if you have ever used a dictionary, you need to read this. It will give you a new appreciation of the book of words.	2002-10-23

Maurice Lindsay is a well-known poet, broadcaster and writer on many aspects of Scottish life and Literature (see his Castles of Scotland for one). He has written several on Burns already. <BR>If it touched Burns, it's listed here. This is not a collection of Burns poems, but a companion to them. An excellent work for people just becoming acquainted with Scotland's beloved poet and need to understand the poetry better. Many editions of Burns works have glossaries to help with the Scots, but it still leaves the general reader or student with a lot of questions. This book fills in the gaps, so should be used as a study companion piece to books with Burns' complete works.<br />Highly recommended for fans of Burns wanting to understand the man and the period he lived.	2002-10-22

One of the reasons I wished to write historical romances, was because of Maggie Davis aka Katherine Deauxville.  I was running a bookstore at the time her historicals came out, and I had a customer that bought everything she wrote under either name, so naturally I had to see what had this customer so loyal. And am I glad I did!!!  I fear some people often are not sure how to take Deauxville, because she refuses to conform to pattern writing, and I am sorry for them, because she is a writer with charm, wit, with strong research and able to create characters you will vividly recall years after you put the book down.  And her medievals are just that, they endure and its a shame she does not get more attention for them.  So if you love medievals that are fresh, not formula, and have missed Crystal Heart, Amethyst Crown, Daggers of Gold, then snap these up and enjoy!!!  She is rich in detail of the period and local, and takes the reader on a wonderful journey in the Middle Ages.<br />In this tale - after the Battle of Hastings, William the Conqueror gives his knight Fulk de Jobourg ownership of Castle Morlaix in Wales and orders him to marry its heiress, Lady Alwyn Lesneven.  Her father was hanged for treason, and Fulk put in control of the lands, so Alwyn, quite naturally, is not pleased to be commanded to marry him.  Her villeins fears William's and Falk's wrath, so they truss her up and deliver her to the altar.  Fauk is disappointed his bride has to be wed in this manner, but does his duty.  Then promptly leaves her to go hunt rebel Welsh.  It is a series a hardships, pains and struggles, with Alwyn making all sorts of mistakes, but eventually Falk and Alywn must face their lives together...with her continually thwarting his power and yet, she is unable to fight her growing need for him.<br />It is a wonderful tale, very non-stereotypical.  Deauxville is able to walk the fine line between giving you an independent, headstrong character the women of today can appreciate, yet keeps within the believability of the period.<br />Way to Go, Maggie!!!  PLEASE more historicals!!!te, yet keeps within the believability of the period.<br />Way to Go, Maggie!!!  PLEASE more historicals!!!	2002-10-22

Since the homeboy keeps close ties to the old stomping grounds, she has come to seek out information to bring the Brian down. He has built factories all over Ireland, and in his wake the towns are utterly destroyed. All that was Ireland lost to the flood of MacDonalds Hamburger joints.<br /><br />However, Tara finds a second story, revolving around the Brian. It seems there has been no marriages to speak of for nearly a decade in the town, because all his old pals worship on the altar of \\"the Brian\\". If he gets a free ride with the ladies, why should not they?<br /><br />Tara finds on Ladies Night at the pub, there is not only a lot of grumbling, but a conspiracy brewing, and she is not above egging these angry ladies on in the name of a good story that centres around the Brian. So they females decide on a boycotte, cutting the men off from all creature comforts, no cooking, to company, no laundry and no....well, you can guess.<br /><br />Of course, there is the Brian's feisty grandmother, who has decided it is time the free-roaming bachelor settle down and produce her grandchildren before she dies, and see the perfect candidate in Tara Brid.<br /><br />Not many books can cause me to laugh out loud, but this one did repeatedly.

Watson a lecturer in the Department of History at University of Sterling, examines the process of conquest of one medieval country at the hands of another, concentrating on one of the most vital aspects:  the military garrisons.

This one follows Jack Montgomery (the brother of Isis we met in More than Magic).

He was preparing a following up book with additional research into this theory and it is a sad loss of an excellent writer as well as loss to the body of the Ripper works. One really needs to read his other book The Brotherhood, the Secrets of the World of Freemasonry, to get a full view of where it was moving with this study of the Ripper. Both books really work together, so to get full appreciation, you need to read both works and know the battle Knight had in having them published due to pressure from Masonic corners.<br />He puts forth a clear vision of what could be the real solution to the Ripper case, and if anyone doubts this sort of cover up - just look at the Watergate case or the Iran Contra Affair of the US. It is hard for people of today to understand the implications Annie Crook could have had at that period in time, so you must read both works to fully understand knights theory - based with extensive research.	2002-10-15

This is a trade side reprints of stories that have been reprinted several times.<br />(the weakest of the three) JAK's The Waiting Game is not one of her best earlier works. Still a good read, but the female character is really stupid at times and it hurts the rest of the book. The male character more than makes up for the silly female, but he can only do so much. This has been reprinted several times by itself so I suggest you check you old series romance and recent JAK's before you buy this one.<br /> Delinsky's Montana Man is one of her best early works. She shows a strong hand in male-female attraction and it was riveting.<br /> Anne Stuart ( one of my favourite writers) gives us a touching story of second chances. And as usual, Stuart is the BEST at the bad boy being redeemed by love. Emerson Wyatt McVey was a ruthless corporate executive that destroyed hundreds, maybe thousands of lives by closing factories.

They do not wish you to find there are things you can create and take yourself ( and with often much better results!!) because that cuts into their money!! So accept this book as written with prejudices. That said, it is still a good reference work for people wanting to know more about herbs. It details over 300 herbs, how they interact with drugs, a glossy for medical terms so you can full understand what they are say.<br />It has a nice little box that tells you why people take the herb, interactions, important points to remember, doses, what current research shows, other names and references for further reading.<br />A good work, when used as a companion piece for more balanced works and herbs and their usages.<br />Also a good reference work for writers using herbs in their books.	2002-10-14

However, there was another big powerbroker in the struggles for Scotland's independence: Clan Comyn. John de Balliol was part of the Clan, and they ruled nearly 2/3s of Scotland during this period. When the choice for a King of Scotland was made after the death of Alexander and the Maid of Norway, it came down to two contenders: Robert the Competitor (Bruce's grandfather) and John de Balliol...both descendants from David Earl of Huntington,one from Clan Bruce and one from Clan Comyn. The Comyns were the powerbrokers of Balliol's short reign and were the largest impediment to Bruce's rising. And in the end, it took the murder of John Comyn in Greyfriars Abbey in 1314 to finally put Bruce in control of the country he would have to fight to rule.<br />But little focus is really paid to this very powerful Clan that influenced not only Scotland, but England during this period. Alan Young finally brings Clan Comyn out of the shadows and places there in their rightful position as the most powerful family in Scotland in the 13th Century.<br />Young covers the rising of Bruce and Wallace and how it was impacted or changed by Clan Comyn; follows through to the Comyns roles as the later Guardians of Scotland; their role in John de Balliols Kingship; up through the murder of John Comyn by Bruce or his supports and the fallout.<br />Maybe a little more history than the casual read would enjoy, but for someone interested in ALL the history and understanding what happened then, this is a MUST!!	2002-10-14

I mean her uncle said WAIT and what does she do??  She wants to go to Southeast Asia with a man she suspects is a rogue CIA agent???  OH PLEASE.  Some intelligent needed.  When she would go on and on arguing I really got tired of WAITING...and when she was almost kidnapped off the streets the day before, what did she do...walk a mile into town to get her car with boyfriend following all the way and she never was aware.<br />Only JAK's bright righting kept this one from really sinking fast.

This one sort of walks the fine line.  I got a little irked by the arrogance of the female character, but as the book went along it turned out well.<br />Heather was the headstrong daughter of a hotel owner in Tucson.  At 18, the last the family saw of her was her waving bye bye from the back of a yamaha (sheesh JAK, you could have shown some class and made it a Harley, but this was not in the heyday of the Harleys so I shall excuse this!! lol).  10 years later she had come home to assume, what she presumes is the reigns of the family business.  Her father is ready to retire and she is itching at the bit to be boss. She also decides that a marriage of convenience - a partnership, is just what she needs so she proposes marriage to Jake Cavendish, her father's business manager.  On the night before the marriage, Heather learns she is not to take over the family business, because Jake already owns it and he would be boss, not her.  Kicking off her well controlled image, she dons her bike outfits, rolls up to the curb of the church and tells the groom in front of the guests just what she thinks of him.<br />Naturally, in JAK it is a battle to the end between two headstrong people that find love is the winner.<br />Some of the action is a little contrived, but on the whole a very pleasant read.	2002-10-09

One of Dover Editions, it has 76 illustrations and woodcuttings helping support the stories.  Now of the works are very original, no fresh look at the lore and its meaning, as I did with artist Carmon Deyo in the THREE FACES OF THE GODDESS, my essays and Carmon's paintings, which has won awards and approval for the new look at lore.  But they are a basic foundation of tales and for someone looking to start learning about the Celtics lore and myths, it is a very good starting point.  It covers the religion of the Celts, the cycle of the Irish Invasions, the Early Melesian Kings, The Ultorian Cycle, the Ossianic Cycle and the Fianna and the Isle of Women Warriors.<br />Highly recommended for those beginning the journey.	2002-10-09

She is cautious, level-headed and a woman on her own two feet, horse-trainer and breeder at her father's expensive ranch.  Years ago, she had a crush on the young man her father hired to work in the barn, Garrett Coltrane.  His father had lost his ranch through bad management so Garrett is forced to work.<br />He returns years later, a wealthy man and read to build a life for himself.  He sees Katy and the old sparks are there.  She is just what he wants as a wife, a partner to build his future - plus she has the blood-blue backgrounds that Garrett wants.  She is no vapid miss, but a 28 year old woman who is perfect for his plans.<br />The book opens with Katy having an attack of bridal jitters, because she over hears to biddies talking about how Garrett married her to give him the breeding background he lacked.  As they head to their honeymoon, she gets snappish, sour and very much the pain in the bum.  Garrett is not thrilled to find himself in a honeymoon suit that is a cotton-candy pink nightmare.  So frilly any man would balk.  Even Katy see the room as enough to give anyone cavities just looking at it, but she get mad at him because he does not appreciate it.  OH PLEASE!  As the time to go to bed nears, Katy has worked herself into a state that when she utters I love You to Garrett and he does not respond that is ready to get a divorce.  The next morning she is ready to call the lawyers - even though she admits to herself she really loves him.<br />I am sorry, Katy is such a PAIN....I just do not enjoy this sort of Katy/MS Hyde personality she suddenly manifests.  It really bad character development and it hurts the book from point one.<br />Its a reprint, so if you must read all of JAK - then try the library or get it used.	2002-10-09

I have been dusting off some of my old series JAK's since they are being reprinted, and sad some are very dated.  But this one stands the test of time.  It is JAK all the way and she scores a ten with this one.<br />When Rebecca Wade inherits a strip of land from a distant relative, she steps right in the middle of generations long freud between the Stockbridges and the Ballards.  The women of her family have always owned this piece of land and the men from both sides have always wanted and were not beneath trying to use her ancestors to get it.  And it seems Rebecca finds the situation is repeating itself.  It turns out she was given a job for Kyle Stockbridge as his personal assistant, with her not knowing he wants the lands and gives her the job for that reason.  In short time, Kyle learns her wants Rebecca even more, but he is going to have a hard time proving to her.<br />It is JAK at her best and a wonderful read!!	2002-10-09

Molly woke in the hospital to find she could not recall anything of her life, not the dead man who was found in her car, the 350 thousand dollars - nor the husband.  This book was a little rushed because of being a series, and would have been much better as a big book, but it still is a very good read.<br />Molly leaves the hospital to return to Winter's Edge, the only home she has ever know.  Yet suddenly, she is a stranger there.  She does not recall her husband, nor the various people in their lives, and she especially does not to know the woman everyone says she is.  She does not like the clothes she wears, does not like the bedroom she supposedly decorated, and she cannot believe she behaved as everyone said she did.  She knows Patrick, her husband hates her, but not why.  And she does not know who is trying to kill her.<br />Stuart delivers as she always does, just wishes this one had a little more room to deliver fully.	2002-10-08

And yes, not likely at the price they will offer, so suggest used if you can.<br />The story is a simple one, but as usual it is JAK's character and her incisive writing that makes the book.  Case McCord wanted Pru Kenyon in his life but not that the cost of marriage.<br />Carrying baggage from a previous relationship that ended in death of his fianc&eacute; and estrangement from his family, it is cutting off from any such ties that blind - and hurt.  Only Problem with that, is Pru - in spite of living with him for three months - is basically an old fashioned girl at heart and thought eventually their relationship would lead to marriage.<br />She is in a quandary when she discovers she is pregnant.  She wants McCord to marriage, but because he loves her, not because he has to...so after giving him marriage or I am leaving and he refuses, she leaves, never expecting to see him again.<br />He naturally comes after Pru, convinces her he has changed his mind and wants her.  Everything is fine until the morning after he wedding when she discovered the bill from the doctor in his pocket.  He had none she was pregnant.  Pru must face staying and fighting for the love from the man she loves.<br />The characters and real and warm, and lots of humorous touches that leaves you smiling.	2002-10-07

Anne Stuart is one of my favourite writers, has been since I picked up To Love a Dark Lord and then Moonrise.  She is the Queen of the Gamma Rogue, blackhearted heroes with even blacker souls.  She can make these bad boys so compelling so that you would think Robert Palmer wrote SIMPLY IRRESISTIBLE about them!!<br />Her tale - Kissing Frosty - is a much lighter hearted Stuart showing she is a deft hand with humour.  Written in 1996 is it a holiday tale I am so glad they reprinted.  Megan McGraw is tired of the nomad life and wants a man, a home and a baby.  She runs a healthful restaurant in a small town called Waston's Hole, and next to her is Nadjia, running a new age shop.  They are facing eviction from their shops because the owner of the building wants to put in a high priced shopping complex.  So on the night of the Winter Solstice, Meggie challenges Nadjia to summon up her true love.  They use the giant snowman as a poppet, pinned the picture of the current heartthrob actor, and conjure their spell.  And much to Megan's surprise, 5 days later the actor turns at her bean sprout restaurant!!  Only problem, he is accompanied by John James O'leary, a blackheaded screenwriter that sends her temper and her pulse in orbit.  It is a fun  tale that will have you howling out loud.  I mean with lines like \\"he was using his mouth like an instrument of the devil, seducing her into a brainless mass of bean sprouts marching toward destruction.  Oh, Lord, and she wanted to go!!\\"  Stuart keeps this one rolling.  I am only sorry it was so short.<br />The much longer THE BOSS, THE BABY AND THE BRIDE is a reprint of Day Leclaire's 1994 short story.  Reed Harding is hard on secretaries, going through 12 in less than six month.  But suddenly he has Angie (Angel?) Makepeace has become secretary number thirteen, and soon begins to take over his life - after all she is his guardian angel!!  It is a funny story that charms you as well.	2002-10-07

Of all the words produced on the Clans, this is one of the best.  Not a coffee table display, it is a comprehension history of the Highland Clans.  There are tons of pictures, and this detailed history of the origins of each clan, maps and the little small details that set it apart from any work on Scotland and the Clans.  I have literally worn this poor book down, and on my second copy.  Cannot live without.<br />So if you are interested in the in depth history of the Highland Clans, this is a must for you.	2002-10-07

The investigation blows up, causing Jamie and her employer, Miss Isabel, to have to face the press and investors angry over losing hundreds of thousands of dollars in Miss Isabel's brother's schemes.  Cade arrogantly thinks he can say his investigation and using of Jamie to gain information had nothing to do with their romance.  GRRRRRRRR<br />That was the first bad point, but figured you could work with the premise.  But instead of learning from it, he continues in the same smug, arrogant, know it all attitude, treating Jamie like he knows more about he than she does herself, and simply because he took her to bed, he owns her.  He even smirks that she is likely going to come crawling to him, because she got her pregnant!<br />Sorry, this one really sucks.  Jamie is a wishy-washy character than lets the arrogant guy run all over her and you really end up not liking either of them, and possible downright hating HIM.  I don't know any woman who could have loved this guy.<br />Saying it was dated might cover these sins of woe, but frankly, I did not like this one when it was first published.  This sort of jerk was no acceptable back then, and he certainly is not acceptable today.<br />Especially - DO NOT pay the hardback PRICE!!	2002-10-05

Emily is patted on the head by her whole family, but she never really gives into them or loses her spunk.  Jacob is one of the Alpha males that JAK characters loves to run circles around and this is one of her better 'early' works.<br />Her writing is sharp, the wit incisive and I love the heart she put into this one.<br />Emily has been in love with Jacob Stone, corporate trouble shooter for her families international business.  He once rescued her from a kidnapper, and from that moment Emily secretly kept that awe and love locked in her heart. Two years later, she decided to act on that love and Stone turned her away.<br />Now,three years since that bruise to her heart, Stone is once more rescuing her from danger - this time a bad engagement.  The family fears the son of a competitor is using Emily to gain stock in their business.  I loved how Krentz's character thought of Stone, she &quot;thought of him in the same way she thought of hurricanes, charging lions and marauding sharks.&quot;  You got to love it!!	2002-10-02

She had a stormy relationship with a race car drivers that left her want a nice peaceful relationship.  She gets that chance when he boss says they should get married.  He says they work together well, there is no reason marriage cannot work.  At first, Amber is unsure, but thinks it will work.  But she soon finds her marriage is much more than a matter of convenience to them both.<br />When you add in some terrible poetry written by an obscure cowboy, the dialogue is JAK at her best.<br />A gentle gem.	2002-10-02

Now she has to quickly find someone to jump so she can learn how t write about it........OH PLEASE!...  Earth to Julie???  Are you going out to murder someone so you can write about that, too?  Or maybe if your character is a doctor, you should go do open-heart surgery to really be able to write it.  Sorry, writers draw from what they know - but the biggest part of the time it comes from their imagination.  Hum, wonder if Cassie Edwards did it on a horse with Tonto so she could write about it?<br />If that part is not contrived enough, you have her wanting to use HUNK for her work, but protect her heart, him going along with it so he can hang on to her, yet afraid when the book is over she is gone.....<br />Leto is one of the brightest voices in series romance in the past couple of years, but this one was just to FORCED.

I have always held that the romance genre is a misnomer, that there is NO genre outside of publishing's mind, because romance is all genres - horror, historical, western, mysteries, suspense and comedy...name a catagory and there is a writer in the romance field doing it and doing it well. And Susan Squires is out to prove that point with a vengeance!!<br />Squires is a super writer, she challenges the reader, pushes buttons and makes you think.  But at times, I get really really angry at her characters (LOL)!!  This book is a stroke of near genius, but it is very hard to connect with Vic...the emotional tie you need to your main character is lacking.  At times, not only is there no empathy, you really do not like Vic.  It is that lack that causes this work to just miss mark.  She is a graphic writers (some readers complain TOO graphic - if that is the case then don't read her).  She pulls no punches, gives the reader no pleasant safety net.  She writes with a confidence that is way beyond someone with just a third book and is a name that will be around.	2002-09-29

Cursed to live alone.<br />She runs off the road in the middle of a hurricane to avoid hitting a ghostly little girl and it plunges her car into the deep waters of the sound.

He was all things good, bright and wonderful - until the night he throws Faith and her dirt-poor family out into the streets. Gray's father, a notorious womaniser has finally gone over the edge and left his family, disappearing into the night with his lover - none other than Faith's mother.

It is a dispassionate look, trying to steer away from the anti-bruce sentiment that rose after Braveheart movie - sorry gang - the Bruce got a RAW DEAL from Mel's movie.  If you want to know about the Bruce, this is a great starting point.  It is rich with details.  Covers Edward the Bruce being crowned King of Ireland and the mess surrounding that.  It systematically examines not only the struggles of the Bruce in coming to power and keeping that power in Scotland, but looks at the other little wars of the Bruces and the whole picture - the social climate inside and outside of Scotland.<br />A meticulous work, that might be a bit more in depth that the casual reader would appreciate, but to serious students on the topic this is a true find.	2002-09-24

WOW what a story.<br />Katherine Lafferty was 20 years old a good girl when she met Danny McCandles, the boy from the wrong site of the tracks.  Did not matter to her, she loved him and knew she would spend her live loving him.  What she did not know she would spend 10 years loving him and believing her was dead.  On the day they were to elope to get married Danny is shot six times and pronounced dead shattering her how life.

She goes to get wedding invitation to a wedding she resists, but is so apathetic toward the world that she allows herself to be pushed into it, and come straight face to face with Mac - at first she faints at his feet for Mac is the spitting images of Danny, but then she sees the crescent scar on his lips - the same scar Danny had and knows it is him.

Her friend Meredith, shortly there after, nearly killed in a car accidentally and is begging for her.  In order to appease his sister, Bran Rathborn, picks Cassie up at the airport and she is disturbed to see Rathborn dislikes her, totally believes Cassie is guilty, and resents her influence over his sister.  But strikes a bargain with her to stay and see Meredith through a serious operation and recovery.  She stays and pretends they are best friends in front of his sister and he will help her find a job elsewhere.

Listen up Anne Stuart fans - this is a reprint of some golden oldies - and super ones.  As always from Anne Stuart mesmerizes! They are dark, moody and mysterious and an excellent read!  One great anthology.<br /><br />In the first one, we have Molly Ferrell coming to a small New England fishing village to find out what happened to the brilliant writer/poet Michael O'Flannery. Supposedly, twenty years ago he took a gun into the forest and killed himself, leaving behind a set of near genius works that have obsessed Molly for decades. His writing touched her, reached her in a way men never did. So she is determined to exorcise the ghost of O'Flannery once and for all by writing a book about him.  Visiting his hometown, she is determined to find out why a man of such talent would destroy himself - and maybe break her obsession, once and fall. There she finds instant resistance in the town folk.  There's an empty grave with a headstone, people lock their doors or stop talking when she entered a room, and heavy, dogged resistance from Jake, a carpenter.  He hints there were other deaths in the town and maybe Michael did not kill himself, but was murdered. Stuart owns the talent of dark, moody alpha/gamma heroes, and she is flying high with this tale.<br /><br />I am not familiar with the works of Joanna Wayne or Caroline Burns, but I will be checking to see other material as their stories also impressed me.<br /><br />Wayne gives a tale of a woman running from her past, trying to keep it secret, who falls for Dr. Nathan Duncan. He is drawn to his new patient, but is sure they have met before. How long can she keep her past secret from her doctor?<br /><br />Burnes tale is very effective, very sinister.

Anne Stuart is the Queen of creating those dark complex alpha/gamma rogue males that are far from pure.  They are sin, sex, dark and dangerous and there is just no one that does it better.  Moonrise is her best, with To Love a Dark Lord and Nightfall running a closesecond .  And Ritual Sins ranks right up there.  I resisted this book, even knowing that I ADORE everything she writes.  Something about the cult angle and him being the leader sort of turned me off, but since it was Stuart and, naturally, could not resist and boy and I glad I gave in.<br />It one of those itchy, dark tales she weaves like a spell, paint a very very bad boy you are unable resist, might even hate, and cannot stop falling for despite all his dirty secrets.  Luke Bardell, conman, charlatan, runs a new age commune called the Foundation of Being, supposedly bilking their clients out of millions and millions of dollars.  Rachael Connery's mother was just one of this victims.  She willed her fortune to Luke's desert commune and then suddenly died mysteriously.  Rachael is there to prove Luke murdered her for the vast fortune and to reclaim the inheritance that should have been hers.  Luke knows why she came, what she wants, but that does not seem to stop him nor does it stop her from being drawn into his sinister web.<br />This is fiction writing at it best, and long may Stuart reign!!	2002-09-19

It is very well written, but the first 100 pages just does not capture the reader.  It is so distant, does not invoke your emotions or make you care about the characters.  BUT>>>>after page 100 things take a sharp turn and suddenly the book propels you along, and into the past lives of Dom and Laris, as the memories rise to the surface and pushes them to fight for their love or to lose it for all eternity.<br />Jackson is always a beautiful writer, but think the first part really hurt the book.  But I recommend stick through and enjoying this very interesting, thought provoke work on the question of love, past lives and how much do you really love - can you put yourself second to that love....once it moves into high speed it is breathtaking.<br />The 4 stars is because of the slow start.  Last two-thirds of the book would rate 5.  Still one of the more original works in the genre and recommended!!<br />WISE Writers and Readers Book of the Month August 2002	2002-09-14

However paying full price for these very THIN novelettes sort of make me think they are milking fans for all they are worth.<br />I applauded last years efforts of putting out the Stephanie James series at a lower price.  Now this made sense and showed consideration for the reader.<br />So here is the chance for you to catch two old JAK's James temptations Wizards and the Challoner Bride at the price of one.  Good move!!<br />They are wee bit dated, but one overlooks that, as JAK's writing is fresh and sparkling and show the fire of the love of writing for the genre that said seems to be missing in her last few works.<br />I highly recommend these for those JAK fans that missed her Stephenie James works.	2002-09-05

When one has written such masterpieces as Moonrise (my favourite Stuart) To Love a Dark Lord and Nightfall...it is hard to keep that level of superpower quality book after book.  And this one sadly just misses.  It seems rather rushed, almost like she did not have time to fully form the lead characters in her mind.<br />She still delivers a powerful read!!  Anne Stuart's 2nd best are still away ahead of the pack!!<br />When Sophia buys a rundown inn, she moves her overly rebellious 19 year old half-sister and her mother, starting to lose control of her memory, into what she hopes it to be the answer to her problems and an island of peace.  But that peaceful dream is shattered by echoes of murders commited 20 years ago.  A man has rented the cabin across the lake, John Smith, and from the start, Sophia resents his presence, resents his virile attraction and would like him to leave.<br />The tension builds as we are told he was convicted of the death of the three girls who were murdered two decades ago, though released from prison after only 5 years.  We learn John has few memories of that night and recalls nothing until he awoke covered in blood in the cabin.<br />John feels it is time to stir the embers of the past, find out who really commited those murders - even if it was himself, and finally put the past to rest once and for all.  Stuart never convinces us he could have been guilty, so she throws away that bad to the bone Alpha male she conjures so deftly in Moonrise and others.<br />Stuart's tension between Sophia and John is excellent, but I don't think she had full grasp of just who John was because there are numerous conflicting errors in descriptions (shame on the editor, too!!) - which leads the reader to not fully know John either.  The rebellious teen grated on my nerves - I read to escape the pains-in-the-rumps of the world, so this character really wears thin.  But in a way, I guess that helps you empathise with Sophia - through it is with slightly gritted teeth!<br />I applaud Stuart for giving us a down to earth 'real' woman in Sophia who is more than willing to eat that second or third muffin, to give a sweet, tragic quality in her mother facing growing less and less able to live by herself.  However, some readers just might think all of this is a little too real....lol<br />It is still a fine book, I just wish it could have been tightened up and not have that rush feel about it.  There is no one better at giving us the bad-boy we cannot resist.  Just think this one would have benefited from finetuning before being sent to the publisher (or an editor that took his job seriously and caught these mistakes before they got into print).<br />Even with the flaws, I truly enjoyed it and remain a loyal and devoted Stuart fan!!tted teeth!<br />I applaud Stuart for giving us a down to earth 'real' woman in Sophia who is more than willing to eat that second or third muffin, to give a sweet, tragic quality in her mother facing growing less and less able to live by herself.

Reprint them fine, but give the reader a decent price instead of presenting it like its a new work.<br />The book is dated.  JAK makes it readable, but I really did not care for the male lead.  Keep the little woman as a weekend thing because he could protect her from his world of big business mentality, just left me cold.  I am sorry, romance means sharing - the good and the bad, so this idea of him trying to shove her into a little hole and keep the world away, just was too dated.<br />I love JAK, but this flood of little book series romances that are very dated being repackaged for higher price really is leaving a bad taste in my mouth.

This is the second book I have read by Elizabeth Harbison, and I must say I am even more impressed with her style, voice and ability to paint ineteresting characters.  I noticed with her current title Drive Me Wild, she has a strong craft in creating living, breathing characters, with vivid, realistic emotions.  And she clearly shows that once again with this book.<br />At 19 while an exchange student in England, Megan fell in love with Nicholas Chapman, a struggling waiter.  Their affair was passionate, full of love....or at least Megan presumed so. But after three months she discovers she had never know him at all.  He is not a waiter, in fact he would never have to struggle with life at all beings he is the son of a Earl.  She also finds out the whole time, he was engaged to marry a family approved 'woman of their own class'.  So, she returned to US, heartbroken....and pregnant.  When she contacts Nicholas to inform him of the pending birth, he won't even answer her letter.<br />She struggles, but with the help of her family, she has raised her son, gotten an education and a good job.<br />11 years later, when the job takes her to England, she decides her son is old enough to know the truth.  Since her job brings her in close contact with Nicholas, emotions run high, as she still cares for him, but there is a lot of anger and resentment of his careless dismissal of her.  She finds him an aloof man, divorced for the society marriage that worked to benefit his family.  His parents are dead and so Nicholas is alone.  But will he want to know his son?<br />Harbison handles the emotions so realistically, has a good nack when writing a child's character, and is able to pack a lot into the quick read size of series romance.<br />She is a talent to watch!!	2002-06-22

Too bad the story is rather forced (not her fault but with series romance structure!!)<br />Luke Stewart was in love with Grace Bowes 17 years ago, but she married his best friend and move away. And those embers have remained banked. They flare to life again when Grace comes into to interview for a job. No longer the golden girl, part of a golden couple, she is divorced with a 9 year old son and so desperate for a job and willing to do anything - including learn how to drive a school bus.<br />Romance naturally follows, with Grace still determined to return to the big city once she gets on her feet.<br />Just a little too weak on the reasons why she wants to leave the love of her life for the big city a second time, forcing her characters to go through the motions, instead of letting the plot move them. (The books quick pace is as fault here.  With a longer length, she could have devoted more time to this).<br />Luke and Grace are achingly 'real', and she gives teenage uncertainity, of a romance that never dies a strong treatment.<br />A pleasant quick read, with strong, vivid character development.  I enjoy series romance, since many of the brighest star come there, and I think we will be hearing more Elizbeth Harbison.  I will purchase further books with her name on it and look forward to them!!	2002-06-11

Katie MacAlister joined my writers' community at MSN recently, so naturally I dashed off to buy her books since I had not read anything by her.  I have been lucky at getting so many really talented writers that I love joining, so I am thrilled to say there is another!!!<br />This Victorian charmer is funny, heartwarming.  I found myself with a big smile on my face nearly all the way through this!!!Her voice is sparkling, perfect for the period!!<br />25 year old, half-American Gillian Leigh is in London to attend her cousin's coming out season in the ton.  She is quite delighted to be a wallflower - provided she could stop doing clutzy things like setting the Dutchess' favourite gold curtains on fire!!  She does not waltz - she murders toes!!!  She is outspoken, has dogs with a 'problem' that has everyone fanning the air!!  She is a quick judge of character and is not afraid to blister her aunt for going along with the ton in giving the cut direct to the Earl of Wessex.<br />The Earl is in town for the first time in 5 years, following the death/murder??? of his beautiful wife, supposedly at his hands when he found her in the arms of her lover.  He wants a wife to produce an heir, a mother for his illegitimate son, but most of all he wants a wife that will cause no problems, no gossip.<br />Gillian's cousin quickly sets sites on the dark earl knowing reformed rakes make the best husbands, but she sees the earl has eyes for her tall, amazon, redheaded cousin.  He is drawn by her open honesty, and despite the smashed toes, black eye, bashed head and broken nose, he thinks Gillian is just what he needs.  He will make her a countess, giving her everything - but his heart.  However, Gillian is not about to settle for anything less and will wage a war of attrition to get it!!!!<br />A delightful, wonderfully writen read!  Hope to hear more from Katie MacAlister!!	2002-05-09

This was the first Lovejoy, but I warn American viewers of the Lovejoy telly series NOT to expect the books to be like Ian McShane's Version.  This Lovejoy is not quite so loveable.  He is shifty, ready to cheat anyone, ready to step over the line if he thinks he cannot get caught, he has a temper, kids shove him around, all his old girlfriends - and there are legion - use him as babysitter.  He has a very odd selection of friends - most of the telly characters do not show up to late in the series of books - he has very little respect for women as a whole, other than how he can use them, he barely pays his bills, loves animals, is a big mooch and lives on fried bread and tomato sandwiches.  He lets people shove him around, only to turn around and stick up for the underdog.<br />All in all, at times you might find Lovejoy very unloveable if not downright disgusting.<br />Ah, but to those that stick with it, you soon find that Lovejoy is an acquired taste that can leaving you howling.<br />This first one revolved around a pair of missing antique dualing pistols.  If you get through to the end and find yourself enjoying the book, you will want to read the rest in the series...though you will always find Lovejoy at times rather disgusting!!<br />Highly recommended for those wishing their mysteries laced with Brit wit and humour, and that is off the beaten path.	2002-05-03

Gianetta is getting away from a bad marriage.  He thought her the perfect, mature spouse, instead she was a young, insecure woman in love and he betrays her.  Getting away from it all, she takes a vacation to the Isle of Skye, in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland.  There she finds a mix of fellow guests, but her peaceful vacation meant to repair her soul is shattered when her ex husband arrives.<br />It is as moody and atmospheric as the Isle itself, and grows darker as they soon discover there is a madman aloose in the group, killing people in ancient pagan fashion.  As they near the Pagan Holiday of Beltaine (May Day) where bonfires were lit high in the hills, she fears that madman may be her exhusand.<br />A super timeless read that you will never forget.	2002-04-18

It did and still does.  I have reread this many times, and was just pulling it out to do it again and thought maybe I would pass on my love for this book.<br />The original manuscript was done by Arthur Quiller-Couch but never finished, so the great Daphne Dumaurier picked up the baton and carried on to give us a haunting tale of Auld Souls, star-crossed lovers shrouded in the mists of Cornwall.  A simply country doctor recognises the signs and moves to keep the doomed lovers apart so the ancient pattern will not be repeated. But the more they try to keep them from each other, the more Fate steps is so prove the pattern cannot be broken.<br />A stunning gem, one I am surprised is not reprinted more or made in a movie.	2002-04-16

Starts off interesting.  She is on a plane that crashes.  A high powered business executive with a hotel chain, she is used to giving orders and having every one follow.  However, from the first, Lucas Kinkaid declares he is the leader.  Quickly, he pulls her aside and explains in order for them and the others to survive, there has to be one leader and that is him.  She grudginly backs down and accepts his alpha male leader role, even to the point of surrending herself to him the night before they are rescued.<br />But she sees the surrender, the fact she gave up the power to snap her fingers and have people jump as a deep wound, and when Lucan comes to find her again, she makes him PAY.  When he follows her on board a cruise ship, she coldblooded sets about to have an affair with him, just so she can put a chokechain about his neck and yank it everytime she wants him to come to heel.  She is arrogant, smug and condescending.  She sneers at the fact he eats steak and pototoes, is not a polished dancer, owns a pet store and wear cheap polyester pants, while she dresses in designer clothes, loves lobster and brie and its quite at home in the penthouse of the cruise liner.  She spends nearly half of the book making this poor guy jump through hoops just to salvage her ego and frankly, I just really did not empathise or care about this woman.  And I seriously wondered just what he saw in her.<br />Jayne's talent as a writer is the only thing that makes this one readable.  She is a joy with the written word, but this one just really turn me off.<br />There are so many great JAK's out there, so unless you are into a woman that not only wants to walk on a man with spike heels, she wants to grind them in cruelly just to prove 'she can handle him'..... forget it and try Wildest Hearts or Absolutely Positively....you will have a much better time.ly just to prove 'she can handle him'..... forget it and try Wildest Hearts or Absolutely Positively....you will have a much better time.	2002-04-15

This is heavy reading for the general 'wee guide to' knowledge seekers and will likely bore them.  But to the people wanting a better understanding of their order, the climate that saw them move from a religious order to one of the biggest bankers concerns in the Middle Ages that controlled Kings and Nations, this book delivers.<br />For those seeking more than the superficial, then this book is it.	2002-04-14

Again, as all Silhouette Desires reprints, suffers from the mini book treatment.  Just too short to really develop interesting characters, but they were nice enough to give you a good price. JAK does what she can and it is a nice quick read.<br />Tabitha Graham is on a cruise looking for a little adventure.  Recently divorced from a bad marriage (he was on rebound and soon found girl wanted him back), her ego has been scarred by the marriage, leaving her doubting herself in many areas.<br />She rescues Dev Colter in a back alley - she thinks he is a mugged tourist - but he is actual a secret agent.  Due to his weakened state of being beaten, Tabby takes care of him and helps him back to the ship.  He likes the softness and womanly tenderness he sees in her and encourages Tabby in this mistaken belief he is a mild, almost shy man.<br />Needless to say, Tabby is not happy when she finds the man she 'understands so well' because they are so much alike, is nothing like he man she created in her mind.  But Dev knows Tabby likes fanciful beasts like dragons and unicorns - so he is out to convince her a live 'beastie' is even more thrilling to trap.	2002-04-12

This is super premise.  Justin Drake has targeted Cassie Bond's little sister to be his wife.  But Cassie draws the line in the sand.  He is too old and a former casino owners with a questionable past.  NOT what her perfect princess of a sister needs as a husband.  So she corners him and blackmails him into leaving her sister alone.<br />But one does not snatch the prey away from a preditor without a few scratches, and drawing the interest of the preditor to you.  Which is the situation Cassie suddenly finds herself in.  Great premise, as Justin suddenly turns his attention to her, but it is rush rush rush from there.  Justin's macho tendencies play a little heavy, somewhat dating the book.  The mystery tossed in about the house she rents really seems more a divice than a true part of the story.<br />But even a poor JAK is a good read, and at this promo price is it a good way to spend an evening.	2002-04-10

This might have worked better as a large book, but the time limit of the mini books really hurts this story.  Too much happens too fast to be fully believable.<br />Selana gets in the crosshairs of York Sutherland's quest to bring down a business rival, because she is dating that rival.  York comes after her like a steamroller, and her mind tells her it is only because she is dating the man he wants to destroy, but her heart won't listen.<br />As the first blush of their affair wears off, and questions set in, she begins to fear destroying his rival and winning her go hand in hand.  Selena naturally strives to make certain this is not the case, but the way she goes about it is just to unbelieavble.  They barely have begun their affair, when she is demanding he abandon all efforts to crush his rival - lose millions of dollars - just to probe he loves her more.  Sheesh, I wanted to tell her GET REAL.  You don't make those wild demanded in the first two days of a romance!!<br />Still all in all a nice quickie read.

She feels what is happening to people in episodic black-outs, and what she is seeing now is murder in a most horrible fashion. Though she has been there done that before, she cannot withhold the information knowing the killer will strike again and again, so she puts herself through the ridicule in hopes of stopping a serial killer.<br />Dane Hollister wants this killer caught and will use anything and everyone in his path, including Marlie Keen.  He is attracted her, and he will put himself between her and the killer, but no matter how he feels about her, he will use her as bait to stop this madman.<br />Marlie is deeply attracted to Dane, feels that attraction deeping into stronger emotions, possibly love.

Dane swears he is different, yet when push comes to shove, he proves he, too, is not that much different than the rest.<br />Despite their personal problems, they are forced to work together, because Dane knows only through Marlie and her gift will be be able to bring this madman to justice.  Marlie's visions grow stronger, just as her feelings for Dane, but then he betrays her.  He promised her if she helped track the killer he would shield her from the public and the media.

JAK's at her best	They recently repacked Amaryllis and Zinnia into a single volume called Harmony, so I got these out and decided to reread them.  And found I enjoyed them more the second time around.  Maybe this stems from the past few Jayne Anne Krentz/ Amanda Quick books not living up to the standard of her talent, making these shine even more.  These St. Helen's books, set on Harmony a plant where Earth traveler colonized are Jayne Anne writing as Jayne Castle, and writing at the very top of her form.  Originally, her fans had mixed reviews over these books.  This was before Paranormal Romance hit big in the sales.  Now they are getting a much-deserved second look.  Amaryllis, Zinnia and Orchid are the trio of tales set in this Futuristic world, with After Dark and After Glow continuing the sagas.<br />Zinnia Spring (don't you love JAK's names?) was called the Scarlet Lady by the press.  She was mistakenly caught in the middle of a tacky tabloid triangle scandal.  An interior decorator, she decides to take lemons and make lemonade.  Instead of trying to shout her innocence or trying to hide, she plays the reputation for all its worth, creating a real Lady in Red.  She dresses red, she drives red.<br /><br />When sexy Nick Chastain, owner of a Casino, hires her things really heat up for both.  Nick and Zinnia, like all the off-worlders, have a little something extra to their make up.  In the Earth Colony of St. Helens on Harmony, people evolved with two supernatural talents: they were either a prism or a psychic.  The prisms serve to increase the power of the psychics by channeling their powers through them, amplifying it and keeping it stable.  Even the strongest of psychics needs a prism, for without them they cannot control and maintain their powers for long periods.<br /><br />Though he has hired Zinnia for her decorating ability, he needs something more from her.  He wants his respectability.  He is an off the chart top psychic, but he needs the perfectly matched prism - and that is Zinnia.  Nick's father was Bartholomew Chastain, a member of the elite of St. Helens, and a respected explorer.  However, Nick's father died, leaving the legitimacy of Nick's birth unclear.  Nick maintains his father married his mother just before his last expedition, but the family disputes this.  Nick craves finding his father's journal and proving he is his heir.  He craves that respectability.<br /><br />As Zinnia falls in love with Nick, she views her Scarlet Lady as nothing more than a passing affair for Nick.  How can a man, who desires respectability above all else, want the Scarlet Lady for his wife?<br /><br />This is ONE super read for Jayne Anne Krentz Fan.  Don't miss the first in the series Amaryllis and then Orchid.  Jayne Anne, whatever name she is using, is at the peak of her prose with this book.  I compliment her deft use of Multi-POV (Point of View) so missing from many of today's new writers.  It makes the story richer and gives you a full sense of the story and characters instead of limits the writer and reader.that is Zinnia.

There are three historians that makes history come truly alive, Bruce Catton with this many books on the War Between of States in US, and two fictional writers Bernard Cornwell with this Sharpes and Starbucks, and Nigel Bruce with his passion for Scotland.  He wrote many superior novels of dealing with Scottish History, but Wallace is my second favourite, the Bruce Trilogy being the first.  When you read this book, you feel as though you opened a door and stepped through time.  You see Wallace as a man, not just a legend.  The tale is rousing covering the period when it was most active in the struggle against Longshanks.<br />Tranter's tales give you a time machine effect, to where you feel as if you were stepping back in time.	2002-03-25

But there are few storytellers.  Storytellers are so much more than a writer.  In the Gaelic, they are called seanchaidh and they were the keepers of stories, lore and history of the Clans, the historian, the recorder.  When the seanchaidh wove his tales of magick, Auld Gods or warrior-kings of Scotland, he was not recanting something created from his mind; he was passing on oral heritage that was handed down through the ages.<br />Nigel Tranter was a seanchaidh, and he is sadly missed.  Yes, he was a highly successful writer, but he was so much more, and in the tradition of old, he wove many tales of Ancient Scotland as few historians could.<br />And THE BRUCE TRILOGY is Tranter at his best (a wee bit redundant since Tranter was always at his best).  Tranter created the three books of the Trilogy to bring forth the tale of Robert Earl of Carrick who went on to become Robert the King, but he does not just tells the story, he brings Bruce alive for you to meet, to understand.  He was a young man caught at the centre of Scotland's struggles.  It was a separate country from England, having its own kings since the dawn of time, but Edward Plantagenet - called Edward Longshanks because of his great height and long legs - was determined to unite all of Britain.  Two men stood in his way: William Wallace and Robert Bruce.  Wallace (see Tranter's THE WALLACE) was a shooting star that lit the conscious mind, giving cry to a national identity Scotland often lacked, since Clan ties and oaths were generally put before homage to the King.  Wallace created the spark, in common man and noble alike, that Scotland was a country and would never bow down to the English King.  By very nature of whom he was, a commoner, Wallace drew Edward's wrath as no noble ever would, so Wallace's pivotal roll in Scotland's struggle to remain free was cut short.  It then fell to Bruce save Scotland, a man in his twenties, who not only had to fight his family's role for him, Edward's attempt to bend him and control him while at English court, but ultimately saw him fighting 2/3 of his own Country due the mighty Clan Comyn's determination to put one of their own on the throne.  You feel for Bruce, his loss of his family, the imprisonment of his wife, sister and daughter, jealousy of his brother, and maybe will understand him more as man after reading this.  So much power and force behind the man and the story as only Tranter could deliver.<br />This is a complex history, since Bruce often was seen as serving himself more than Scotland, witnessing him making homage to Edward on four separate occasions.  But you learn why Bruce bought his time, played both ends against the middle, and succeeded where Wallace failed.  Tranter does not just tell you these events happened, he make you see Bruce the man, not the man who would be king.  Tranter opens a door into Scotland's past, and permits you to walk with him, walk with Bruce, not as a historical figure, not a King, but as a man, faults, fears and all.<br />This is a magick that transcends being a writer, even a very good writer.  This is a tale told with wonder, passion and awe by fireside by a seanchaidh.<br />If you have never read Tranter, I cannot image a better introduction to Scotland's Seanchaidh.  Once you read him, you will hungrily devour the rest of his works.<br />WISE WRITERS AND READERS Recommended Readhad to fight his family's role for him, Edward's attempt to bend him and control him while at English court, but ultimately saw him fighting 2/3 of his own Country due the mighty Clan Comyn's determination to put one of their own on the throne.

Cristina Dodd has written some very witty, rather wickedly sensual Victorian novels that have caught my heart before. Especially one that dealt with a young lord of Scotland that was half Selkie. And I truly enjoyed even moment of the first book in this series, Rules of Surrender. But Rules of Engagement even Tops that!! It is a delightful witty romp that had me laughing out loud. Devon Mathewes, Earl of Kerrich, has more than his share of troubles. There is the fact he is sinfully handsome, of a superior title, boon friend of the young Queen Victoria and rich. But it the first that has the Queen ticked at her friend. Women just seem to through themselves at the much too beautiful man. No happily married, she believes this is also the solution for the Earl. He instead rushes headlong into a plan to remain a rake, but regain her favour. All he need to is 'adopt' a orphan, so his respectibility and all will right in his world again....well, almost. There is too sharp grandfather, and his cousin Lewis...good old cousin Lewis so respectible, so upright and a countefeiting pounds right from Devon estate!!! He needs Victoria's favour more than ever to protect his grandfather, the bank and the family name. So he needs an orphan quickly. But to get an orphan to be polished like an apple he needs a governess to do the polishing. An ancient, ugly governess with no hopes of falling in love with him. Only there is one problem....he goes to the Distinguished Academy of Governesses, presents his proposal with plenty of money to smooth things over...but the frumpy, ugly governess he gets is hiding a few things from the arrogant Earl.....<br />WISE Writers and Readers Book of the Month for December 2000	2001-02-04

I eagerly await EVERY Anne Stuart book.  Don't care if they are reprints from her early days, or the newest novels - historical or contemporary.  She does bad boys that we cannot resist better than any writer around.  I noticed even Teresa Mediros - one of the best Historical writers around took time to write a review for this book and called Stuart her favourite author!!<br />She is stiff scientist brought to an island by a Bill Gates/Howard Hughes Billionaire that claims to have a man - a 'tarzan' found in the jungles of his own private island.  She is there is there to study him.  She does like his right and left hand men, shady and sexiest.  Nothing 'Feels'  Right.  Worse, she sees for herself they consider Tarzan little better than an animal, a man who cannot speak.  Fearing for his life, she sets him free.  Only Tarzan refuses to leave 'Jane' behind, so they are off in a race for their lives.<br />This is one good romp!!	2000-12-18
