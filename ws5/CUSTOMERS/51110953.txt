Unfortunately, Henry's books while generally entertaining are a little too laid back in their delivery, and Arnold comes across as a less effective heroine than she should be.  In BENEATH THE ASHES, Arnold is approached by an old acquaintance to help her dig up something in a cabin where she lived ten years prior, having Arnold as her neighbor.  We immediately dislike this friend, Anne, and it isn't too long before several arsons immerse Jessie in a complex plot in which she becomes a main suspect.  Henry isn't a master of suspenseful plotting, but her images of the wilderness and her love for the sledding life is evidenced and entertaining.	2005-10-05

SOLSTICE unravels a plot of both natural and man-controlled disaster.  A series of violent sunstorms on the surface of the sun threaten to cause severe damage on planet Earth.  This is further complicated by the presence of renegade physicist Charley Pascal and her cohorts, a group named Children of Gaia.  This group feels man is destroying the earth on its own and that it is up to them to bring things back to a more natural rule of things.  This involves the use of a supersatellite (Sundog) which was put into space as an aid to manking, but now Pascal is planning on using this satellite to add further destruction to the sun's wrath.  While Hewson gives us a broad range of characters in the novel, few of them are exceptionally engrossing, and the elimination of some key players only serves to show how empty the rest of the people have been.  SOLSTICE would probably work better cinematically, so that the endless dull spots would be eviscerated in favor of high tension action scenes.	2005-09-26

Nasaw's third entry in the Pender series finds our recently retired FBI agent summoned by an old friend to the island of St. Luke to investigate the brutal murders of a serial killer(s).  The reader knows who the culprits are right off the bat, but Nasaw effectively weaves his suspenseful tale by throwing in some interesting subplots and some uniquely envisioned characters.  The island atmosphere and language is captured convincingly and the pacing is good for a novel where the suspense comes from wondering when and how the culprits will be apprehended.  Good entry and should keep Pender alive for a few more books.	2005-09-20

The Frankenstein \\"Monster\\" is back, as are Carson and Michael, the heroic cops; the autistic Randal Six; Erika 5, who this time is as baffling as she is naive; and assorted other characters, most of them part of Dr. Helios' (Frankenstein) New Race.

This time one of the series' recurring characters is bumped off, prompting a devastated Kit to look into a nursing home for the elite.  Katz' narrative is a little more preachy than usual and the pacing is not as tight as in his previous entries.  Kit has become somewhat of a staunch do gooder, always right, and sometimes doing things that rational thinking would not deem probable.  It's nice to see his supporting characters, such as Luis, Will, Evelyn and James get more use, but overall, this is a disappointing entry in the otherwise engaging series.

Hired by a woman to find out why her ex-husband has ceased his child support payments and contact with his kids, Kit becomes embroiled with not only a passel of suspects in suburbia, but also the Russian mob.  A subplot involving Kit's newly belligerent son, Ben, is overdone and I find myself becoming more and more frustrated with Ben's actions and Kit and Jane's reactions to the surly youth.  Although I enjoy the Suburban Detective series, I wish Katz would not spend so much time agonizing over his familial problems and focus more on the cases he is asked to solve.	2005-09-16

Of course, Goldy is the chief suspect in her ex's murder, and it's only through her valiant sleuthing that the culprit(s) responsible are exposed.<br /><br />Stuffed with tasty recipes as usual, DOUBLE SHOT is an intriguing blend of whodunit, whytheydidit and will they get caught?

Lucas is up against a particularly vile serial killer, and Sandford pulls all the punches in this gruesome shocking thriller.  The first victim is a young woman who is brutally scourged and mutilated and posed in a horrifying manner; the second victim is a young man whose penis is removed, and his young son bludgeoned to death.  Lucas and his partner Sloan fish through a plethora of suspects, focusing on one Charlie Pope, a somewhat doltish character who seems to be the prime suspect.  We also encounter \\"The Big Three\\" in the prison Pope was released from, who may have \\"programmed\\" Charlie to kill.  However, nothing is as it seems and the reader is treated to a fine police procedural, lots of clues, and a harrowing ending in the prison itself.  Sandford relieves the tension somewhat with Lucas' attempts to find the 100 best rock songs to load onto his iPod which his wife Weather bestowed upon him.  BROKEN PREY is not for the fainthearted but it is a suspenseful and excellent entry in one of our best thriller series.	2005-07-07

The story opens with an eight year old murder of a little girl by two teenage boys.  When one of the alleged killers is released, he contacts Delaware to set up a meeting.  However, the young man is subsequently murdered and thus begins a story filled with complex plotting and multiple suspects.  Delaware teams up again with Milo Sturgis and investigates what turns into a multiple murder scenario.  Kellerman's pacing is top notch and the novel is sharp in its deductive mechanisms.  Only its unresolved ending leaves a bitter taste, as Kellerman had done so well in keeping things cohesive and logical.  Instead of tying things up at the end as in usual novels, Kellerman opts to cement the case as it goes along, so pay attention to all the different scenarios, as you'll have to remember them all by the novel's close.  Still, a worthy entry in this popular series.	2005-07-04

He has created eight sculptures supposedly showing the agony of pain in various family members.  We discover right away just how he captures that pain.  Nyeken is effusive in his description of the murders and there is strong sexual content and graphic violence.  Except for an overly long chase scene through the desert, the novel moves fairly well, although its ending comes out of left field and doesn't seem very plausible.

Coben knows how to involve his readers in the hero's plight and infuses a sense of dark humor in his narrative.  The plot is very complex and while reading, one tries to figure out how the different storylines will eventually tie themselves together.  Matt Hunter is a sturdy hero, a victim of a tragic accidental death that found him serving four years in prison.  Now with his life back in order, a new job, a new wife, a baby on the way, things are finally looking up but then a mysterious photo on his wife's cell phone plunges him and the woman he loves into a terrifying mixture of inrigue and murder.  THE INNOCENT moves at a good pace and has a good cast of supporting characters, including the mother of the young man Hunter killed and a feisty female detective, who finds herself believing in Hunter.  There are some bad FBI agents too (shades of James Patterson) and the book's climax offers some unexpected surprises.  THE INNOCENT continues Coben's reputation for involving and thrilling stories.	2005-06-27

Rollins packs the novel with so many characters and subplots that by the time you reach the inevitable climax, you feel like you're the one who's been out fighting the sandstorm.<br /><br />Combining elements of Indiana Jones (we even have an Omaha Dunn), the DaVinci Code (this time, we're back to the Garden of Eden, Queen Sheba and even the Virgin Mary), and enough battle scenes to fill two or three novels or movies.  SANDSTORM may work on a cinematic level better than in its written format.  We have the incredibly heroic Safia, the doctor whose \\"gifts\\" date back to the time of Queen of Sheba; Painter Crowe (where did he come up with these names?), an undercover covert agent whose latest partner, the lovely Cassandra Sanchez, is a real bitch and who is out to thwart the mission, which has something to do with antimatter, but does it really matter?  We eventually encounter a tribe of women who can procreate without sex, an underworld glass city and all kinds of stuff that Rollins obviously thought would elevate his novel.  Unfortunately, by the time I finished the book, I felt I had wasted a lot of time, with little reward for my efforts.  Just too much of too little.	2005-06-23

The hero, Dr. James Wilcox, is a hunky young doctor who is also a neurosurgeon operating on people with brain tumors.  When the saintly doctor discovers he has his own inoperable brain tumor, he is devastated.  Seems that they if they remove his tumor, he will lose his senses of smell and taste, most of his vision, and will never be able to operate again.  His young and beautiful resident assistant, Dr. Sydney Coleman, becomes his lover and best friend.  Meanwhile, Dr. Albert Stern, a Boris Karloffish type of genius, has developed a kind of surgery that has unfortunate results.  Stern is able to take DNA from animals and fuse into humans giving them heightened senses, and of course is joined with General Blackwood and a rogue soldier named Jack Stone in creating perfect fighting weapons for the military.  Stern decides to try his experiments on a non-military person and of course Dr. James Wilcox is his subject.<br /><br />Thompson is one of those writers whose skill is in the ordinary, borrowing bits of Dean Koontz, John Saul and other writers.  His story is easy to read and involving, although it is somewhat predictable and the ending feels rushed and anticlimactic.  Thompson obviously likes to write about sexual encounters, as the heroes and even the villains are often getting down and dirty.<br /><br />If you like your horror stories with happy endings, then DARK MOON RISING will be enjoyable for you.	2005-05-03

Woods' complex plot is engaging, but there are many distractions, including too many dinners and descriptions of how to get somewhere.  Why do so many writers want to tell us they know their locales by giving us insufferably unnecessary travelogues?  Ah well, at any rate, by the time the novel reaches its rather unspectacular climax, we feel there's room for more of these characters in future Barrington books.

Woods paints a picture of a heroine who seems more interesting in solving the bank robbery than mourning the loss of the man she supposedly wanted to spend the rest of her life with.  In a painfully dreadful narrative, Woods presents us with another variation on the extremist group of fanatics who want to make the US better by getting rid of anyone who isn't white.  Been done so many times before, that it's redundant in this tepid story.  Woods doesn't offer us anything new and the pacing is so slow, it becomes sleep inducing.  Woods also makes the mistake of having Ham, Holly's tough father, carry the weight of the book.  While Ham's an okay guy, he comes across as a Dirk Pitt or superman in this one, and it just didn't work for me.  The ending is also pretty lame, and even the inclusion of Stone Barrington, makes little narrative sense.  A real disappointment; is the third any better???	2005-04-10

Wilson's plot asks us if the \\"direct descendants\\" are aliens or are they just a breed of highly advanced men from five hundred thousand years ago?  As the plot thickens and sometimes gets a little too thick, the reader is challenged to field their own impressions of the origins of the Ancient Man, and just what the \\"blonds\\" goal really is?  One thing that makes little sense is the radio transmissions sent by the blonds?  Sent to whom?  If one goes with the alien plot, there is some credence, but if it's merely an advanced civilization, where are the messages being transmitted to?  A little heavy on technology, DIRECT DESCENDANT will entertain you, but I wouldn't call it a great novel, merely a decent one.	2005-03-26

It's obvious he's an afficionado of the genre, because he incorporates much of his novel with tinges of John Saul, Dean Koontz, and Stephen King---but unfortunately not to that level of excellence.<br /><br />WHERE DARKNESS SLEEPS is a routine tale of that oft-iterated search for eternal youth, this time set in an old folks home in Wisconsin(?).  Young heroine Emily has been sentenced to 200 hours of community service for her involvement in a drug related incident with her older boyfriend.  Somehow her divorced parents got this for her instead of jail (he's a famous painter and she's a big shot lawyer).  Anyhoo, Emily makes friends with fellow worker Beth and finds she's the object of desire for the local hotty jock, Kerry (does anybody really name a boy Kerry anymore?).  The home is run by the evil brother and sister team of Eugenia and Herbert Temple.  Prerequisite elderly heroine Charity Francis rounds out the main cast, with community college teacher Gloria Morgan thrown in for romantic interest for pop.  The whole witchcraft/sorcery thing is so badly scripted, it could pass for a Samuel French play.  The three stars is mainly because while Reiselman offers nothing new, it kept me entertained for the time I read it, but it's a book I'll probably forget by the time anyone else even reads the review.	2005-03-23

The supporting characters, both heroes and villains, are well fleshed out and the pacing of the novel kept me interested.

The titular character is merely a ploy in the novel and without any spoiling, there is NO body.  We spend most of our time with the bickering Boldts surrounding both of their indiscretions years earlier that come to surface with this investigation.  Pearson tries to add mystery by having Boldt set up several \\"twisty\\" kinds of events that only add to confuse and when these things occur, they're not that special.

We get some strong supporting characters, too, in the legal team defending David and in the cast of villains.

The \\"hero\\" in this tale is Steven King, so that's an interesting and original concept, but much of the book employs the plot devices in the aforementioned books.  The characters of Vera and June, the weightlifting sisters, are two of the most evil characters I've visited for a while.  My problem is that since you know what's going to happen, I found myself wanting Reid to hurry the plot along.  Reid has a keen knowledge and insight into the publishing industry, and that makes for engaging reading.  However, I found the \\"twist\\" at the end a little hard to swallow.

Taking the well known legendary characters created by Mary Shelley, Koontz/Anderson weave a hypnotic and frightening tale of monsters and madmen.  Although a lot of Koontz's tiring flouresncent descriptions are still present, the book captures the spell of New Orleans and gives us many characters to either applaud or boo.  Koontz's favorite formula of having a male and female confront unknown terrors returns in glorious fashion in Carson and Michael, the two detectives seeking a serial killer.  This is more of a horror novel than anything Koontz has written in years and he piles on the gore and terror tactics deliciously.  If the follow-ups are as good, Koontz has a real career-booster on his hands!	2005-02-20

Dan was a cop who was killed in the first book before he could meet his daughter.  Woodworth uses the Violet's ability to communicate with the dead effectively in the relationship between Dan, Natalie and their daughter.  But what works so well is Woodworth's ability to integrate this personal tragedy, along with Natalie's own parents, into a spinetingling tale of the return of a horrifying serial killer known as the Thresher, who was executed based on testimony given by Natalie's mother, also a Violet.  The governmental agency that virtually imprisons Violets is also a demonic presence in this well written thriller.  Woodworth builds the suspense and thrills without sacrificing credibility or character development; in the world of the Violets, anything is possible.  Also the inclusion of the \\"bad\\" violet and smug Scott Hyland, the parent killer, is also intriguing.<br /><br />An excellent read; looking forward to more adventures with the Violets.	2005-02-10

Okay, Mr. Woods, that's original.  Too bad the rest of the novel isn't quite so fresh; but indeed SANTA FE RULES manages to weave an involving, if somewhat hard to believe tale.<br /><br />Anyone who's read a great deal of mystery novels will see the truth in this novel very early on.  Woods does manage to throw in a neat twist at the end, but it only enhances what an astute reader will have already figured out.<br /><br />Woods writes like a screenwriter; much of his narrative would transfer well to the big screen.  A little faster pacing would have enhanced the book as well.  But if you're in the mood for a superflous but highly entertaining read, SANTA FE RULES delivers.	2005-01-25

Apparently written early in Farris' career, the collection isn't brilliant, but are nonetheless entertaining.<br /><br />The first short story, THE ODOR OF VIOLETS, is somewhat reminiscent of Stephen King's SECRET WINDOW.  A writer is approached by a dying man who wants him to proofread and critique his novel.  The skeptical author is amazed when the book is brilliant; especially since he has been working on a novel for eight years and hasn't come up with anything.  Of course, we know where the story is heading.  The novice writer dies and the author claims he wrote the book; it becomes a best seller, he is on his way to fame and fortune, until the dead writer's \\"muse\\" confronts him with his deed.  The ending is predictable but it's hauntingly written.<br /><br />The second story, HORRORSHOW, is a nifty little thriller about a dead girl who uses the local closed up drive in to reveal her killer's identity.  Contrived and a little incredulous, it's still a neat and tidy thriller.<br /><br />The \\"novel,\\" THE GUARDIANS, is a little preponderous and at times hard to follow, and has an ending that is a little confusing.  Focusing on Jim Practice, the aide to a governor, it tells the story of murder, revenge and deception.  Practice is a good leading character, and the villains are notably despicable.  Not Farris' best work but not as bad as some critics have labeled it.	2005-01-21

But if you've read some of his other works, like THE M.D. and THE BUSINESSMAN, then THE PRIEST won't surprise you.<br /><br />The novel focuses on one Father Pat Bryce, a pedophile, who even after completing a rehab program, still has the desires he was trying to come to terms with.  Only now, Father Pat has more problems:  a former victim is blackmailing him, wanting him to confront all of his victims and apologize; another former tryst makes him read the ramblings of an off the wall author and get a strange tattoo; and his own bishop is blackmailing him to become the advocate for a Birth-Right program which imprisons unwed mothers and prevent them from aborting their child.  Add to this, a strange dream (?) in which Father Pat is a thirteenth century bishop during the period of the Inquisition.<br /><br />Credit Disch for some unusual dialogue and situations, but overall the novel spirals into some kind of psychobabblish nonsense, and Disch ties everything up without a clear explanation for what we've read.  Disch paints a pretty dismal picture of the Catholic Church; and it's all black and white, the only grey coming in the form of one priest, Father Mab, who seems to be okay, but even he leaves the priesthood by the end of the novel.  The turnaround of Greg Romero, one of the young girl's boyfriends, also seems out of context with what we've learned previously about him.<br /><br />Although imaginative and ultimately an entertaining read, one has to accept Disch's rantings about the Catholic faith and view this \\"Gothic romance\\" for what it is --- a horror novel.	2005-01-19

Long sets up an interesting premise and evokes a lot of the mood of the Cambodian jungles.  His characters are complex and involving, although Kleat's cynicism gets a little out of hand at times.  I don't think Long thought his climax out well enough; it's ambiguous as to exactly who these people are and just what happened in this lost city.  It seems to end abruptly, without that feeling of closure I need in my novels.  Also, Long's pacing is tedious and redundant at times, hindering any suspense he manages to build.  There is some tremendous vivid imagery, such as the leaping frogs and the killer monkeys.  But it's so esoteric in its climax that I for one felt cheated.	2005-01-17

My wife adores the writer and has read all of his books from the Dirk Pitts to the NUMA to this Oregon bunch.  I thought I'd give him a try by going with his shortest series, the Oregon crew.  Well, don't tell my wife, but if the Dirk Pitt books are like this, I don't know what she's seen in them!<br /><br />GOLDEN BUDDHA is filled with so many characters, you have to keep referring to the cast of characters in the front of the book just to keep track of who the heck they are.  None of them have any real personalities, they merely serve as a kind of Mission Impossible team, donning disguises, coming up with unbelievable weapons, etc., and setting right the wrongs of the world, while getting disgustingly rich doing so.  The head guy, Juan Callebro, is about as exciting as doing laundry and the bad guys are so out and out stupid, they offer little suspense or intrigue.  If there's anyone who can write a better action novel out there, one need look no further than Matthew Reilly, whose Shane Iforgethislastname books offer non-stop action, a little more fleshed out characters and some incredible action scenes.  Cussler may carry the weight of being a best selling novelist for years, but if Golden Buddha is an indication of his skills, I don't feel that motivated to read any more.  It might be better filmed as we could dispense with all the sophisticated albeit boring narrative and get to the action.	2005-01-16

STATE OF FEAR has an interesting, thought provoking premise that is fairly simple:  environmentalists in efforts to secure more funding and to prove their validity are planning to stage climate related disasters such as tsunamis, earthquakes, etc. to make their cause more relevant.  The bad guys are evil and unlikeable; the good guys are heroic and indefatigable.  And Crichton knows how to intersperse enormous amounts of research into his plot.  And that's what this book's biggest downfall is:  so much of this expository dialogue is wooden and doesn't seem to fit the characters at all.  In fact, the characters are so woodenly developed, you lose track of their personalities and wonder what new things they are going to spout off about.  It would have been better if Crichton hadn't spent so much time trying to impress us with his research and sway us to his political venues.<br /><br />When not preaching, however, Crichton gives us some good scenes, action at times reminiscent of Matthew Reilly, only not as quick paced, and some nasty villains.  However, two of his really obnoxious villains, he fails to tell us what happens to them.  They are the first ones we meet in the book.<br /><br />If you can put up with all the techno mumbo jumbo, and you must if you like Crichton, then you may find this a good book.  It certainly beats PREY, Crichton's last fiasco.	2005-01-14

Using Petra Conner as his main protagonist and with a marvelous new character named Isaac Gomex, Kellerman weaves a complex tale of murder and deceit.  Petra is not an easy character to like at times; she seems emotionally void at times, and her loose cannon approach gets frustrating.  However, paired with Isaac, she manages to overcome these obstacles and helps Kellerman deliver a fine thriller.<br /><br />The double plots at first seem clumsy and one has a hard time deciding which one is the main one.  However, with the June 28 serial killings still a prominent threat, Kellerman wisely folds up the Paradiso drive-bys, and focuses on the more intricate serial killings.<br /><br />To Kellerman's credit, the identity of the serial killer is a good surprise, although one can see it coming after Isaac does his chat room search.  But it's close enough to the end, you aren't cheated.  Petra's romantic involvement continues, although Eric Stahl still remains too enigmatic to care a lot about.  The return of Stu Bishop late in the book should provide some interesting sparks in Petra's next novel.<br /><br />Taut and well written, TWISTED should please Kellerman's fans who feels he's been too prolific lately.  New fans shouldn't have any difficulty in reading this one as a standalone.	2005-01-12

Follett, known mostly for his espionage novels, takes on familiar turf and in my opinion seemed right at home with it.  Set in a surprise blizzard on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day in a small village in Scotland, WHITEOUT starts off with a bang and doesn't let up.  I found the characters, while stock and predictable, still to be interesting:  there were good good guys; bad bad guys; smart but vulnerable kids; a dopey mother; a goofy dog; and lots of intrigue, suspense and terror.  This is an extremely cinematic novel.  Let's see:  Harrison Ford would make a good Stanley Oxenford; Julianne Moore a great Toni; Thomas Jane a nice Carl Osborne; James Franco a cool Kit; the sisters could be played by Nicollette Sheridan and Jennifer Connelly; their husbands, let's say Thomas Gibson and Gary Cole; the possibilities are endless.<br /><br />Anyway, it's not classic literature but it's darned fine reading for a snowy or non-snowy night!!!	2005-01-09

However, with the BIG BAD WOLF, I was somewhat disappointed, and with this tenth entry, LONDON BRIDGES, my disappointment is even greater.  Is Patterson losing his touch?  More novels like this and he just might find himself losing devoted fans.  While he retains his usual command of the quick, terse writing and short, suspenseful chapters, Patterson weaves a plot so full of misdirection, holes and incredulous situations that he seems to have written this one merely to fulfill his contractual obligations.<br /><br />Alex Cross is losing his credibility, particularly in his love life.  This man is starting to fall in love with any black woman in pants or skirts.  He seems to \\"love\\" Jamilla; he has rekindled feelings for his ex love, Christine; and now he seems to be falling for Nana's newly lightweight doctor, Kayla.  This lack of commitment to one person brings Alex down a notch.<br /><br />The villains in this book are great, as always, but I must admit the fate of one of them seems superficial and one wonders why he even brought him back for such an unceremonious fate.  The identity of the Wolf continues to be baffling; just who is he?  Who is the man who goes for plastic surgery and ends up splattered on the pavement; why does a certain person claim to be the Wolf when we know they are not; and if the Wolf is who it is supposed to be at the end, wasn't the reader really cheated?<br /><br />LONDON BRIDGES had a great premise, but Patterson's lack of cohesiveness and his overuse of unexplainable plot twists left this reader very disappointed.  I Hope his 11th Cross novel is more like the first 8; if not, it will be my last.	2005-01-07

I've loved his Alex Cross books and while I found WHEN THE WIND BLOWS whimsical and different, this follow up is a real dud.<br /><br />First of all, enough flying narratives.  Patterson fills the book with so many ridiculously redundant scenes of the kids flying around and then he has the audacity to bump one of them off.  (Sorry for the spoiler, but I won't tell you which one).  The whole concept becomes so frustrating that by the time they face the mad Dr. Ethan Kane, one is totally apathetic.  Frannie and Kit are soporific to say the least.  All the pop cultural references are amateurish and remind me of stories I wrote when I was in my creative writing class.<br /><br />James, do us and yourself a favor:  end this debacle and stick to Cross.

Williams credit for undertaking such a vast enterprise.  While it is an entertaining and interesting read, it's a case of more is less.  Shaving off a couple hundred pages would have made it more enthralling.  The inclusion of all the reports of the past earthquake are redundant and I ended up skipping them.  Also the prologue with the Indians is a nice contrast, but it could have been left out too.<br /><br />Williams populates his cast with a lot of interesting characters, including Jason and Nick, the mismatched pair who parallel Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn; the KuKlux klan sheriff Omar Patton; the hysterically insane Rev. Frankland; the slimy Micah Knox; General Jessica Frazetta; and the nuclear plant operator Larry.  However, Williams introduces several characters that we never really get to find resolution with, most noticeably the trader Charlie Johns who plays a big role in the first portion of the book and then is suddenly gone.  We know his fate, but it comes so unceremoniously, it's a letdown.  Likewise, the young ranger at the Golden Arch.<br /><br />Williams is ambitious, and some of his scenes are well written and exciting.  However, it is far less involving than say something like Robert McCammon's awesome SWAN SONG or Stephen King's THE STAND.<br /><br />If you want a book to spend a few weeks with, THE RIFT might be for you, but if you want a quicker read, avoid.	2004-12-01

Grisham populates his book with some interesting and likeable people (Sandy for instance) and some that aren't fleshed out enough to feel anything about (unfortunately this includes Eva, whose actions at the book's close are rather devastating and one couldn't see it coming).<br /><br />Patrick's brilliance in his scheme is to be admired, as is Grisham for concocting the whole thing.

The plot is meandering, and there are so many characters that one needs a scorecard to keep up with them.  Taken in small doses, the challenged Ralph would be all right, but he's so redundant and predictable, his impact is lessened.  Likewise, Nathan Jett, a potentially interesting character whose lack of fear belies his deep sensitivity especially where Ralph is concerned.  There's a group called The Specials, then there's the Crazies, and as always, some kind of religous fanatic.  Borrowing heavily on the supposedly true Philadelphia Experiment, David offers two more ships vanishing, and an incredibly drawn out sequence of dream sequences and chase scenes.  Had the dialogue been more terse and not so rambling, SHIP OF THE DAMNED may have been a novel worth recommending, which alas, after plowing through its' banalities, I cannot do so.	2004-10-12

For someone as powerful as Satan, he sure takes it on the butt a few times from the human Solaman.

I'm certainly not opposed to utilizing philosophical or religious themes in a novel, but Koontz overuses them.  He spends more time musing on Nora's thoughts than he does on focusing on the action.  The use of the dogs is laughable, and the hokey let's save the children uninviting.

This leads to the cabbie's interest in treasure hunting, looking for a sunken treasure believed to be in the river.

In his other novels, Voort has been very moralistic, and a deep believer in his faith and his family.

Meltzer paints Nora as a victim of all the attention she gets in her role as the president's daughter; she has no real life.  But at the same time, she does so many outrageous things, you have to wonder why Michael sticks with her.<br /><br />A good, enjoyable read, though.  One gets caught up in Michael's plight, no matter how dumb he is, and Meltzer knows the White House and DC.	2004-09-11

Wise for approaching the mystery genre via the Christian faith, one still can't forgive Wise for bringing us a rather dull and empty book.  THE EMPTY COFFIN sets the stage for an interesting murder, but it gets sidetracked so many ways, including Raymond Bench's accidental murder? of a liquor store manager.  Add Vera Sloan's incessant nagging, whining and seemingly a lack of understanding of her husband's job and you have a novel that goes nowhere fast.<br /><br />Sam Sloan's interrogation of Ape is so redundant, it seems like Wise is simply padding.  Sloan's daughter comes across as a miscreant Pollyanna.  You know who the killer is so fast that there's little suspense in getting him to admit it.  Slow, with some ghastly editorial errors, THE EMPTY COFFIN is the first in a new series.  Hopefully, Wise will get wise and start thinking about his reader's interests---mystery.  The Christian element is fine, but just write more interesting works.	2004-09-09

Alex Kava has proven in her Maggie O'Dell novels that she is a good writer, giving us complex plots and characters we care about.<br /><br />In ONE FALSE MOVE, Kava leaves O'Dell behind and focuses on a dark story involving a mother and her son, who have been thieves all their lives, and her recently released brother, who had a fancy lawyer get him off death row for murder.  We know that Jared Barnett, the killer, did kill the young lady, and now he's out to repay his lawyer's debt.  Also involved is a prosecutor named Grace, a cop named Tommy Pakula and a writer named Andrew Kane.  While the narrative is well written, ultimately one has to step back and admit that Melanie, Charlie and Jared are not likeable characters, and that's who we spend the most time with.<br /><br />Once again, abused children are forgiven for their behavior because they suffered so much.  And even with the \\"trick ending,\\" we knew all along who was really responsible for the Barnett's father's murder.  Melanie lets her brother control her; let's her brother ruin her 18 year old son's life; and stands by while her brother and her son murder innocent people.  And then in the end, mother and son get off pretty easy, in spite of what they've done.<br /><br />So, here you have a well written novel, but I can't agree with Kava's message here.<br /><br />I look forward to her return to the O'Dell series.	2004-09-08

Woodworth gives us a totally unique storyline, replete with a reluctant heroine, a likeable if somewhat clumsy FBI hero, and lots of government undercover and nasty villains.  The Violets are a select group of people who have the ability to be conduits for souls who have been killed.  The dead person actually comes to life again in the Violets, and that is where this story's originality shines through.  Someone is out there killing Violets, and the FBI's Dan Atwater is assigned to protect Natalie Lindstrom, a Violet who is the conduit for the murdered Violets.<br /><br />Woodworth peoples his plot with some eccentric characters, lots of suspects, and eerie sequences which show the risks Natalie and other Violets are taking.<br /><br />A suspenseful, tightly written novel, looking forward to WITH RED HANDS, the second in this promising series.	2004-09-07

He's a typical macho man, unwilling to admit his failure in relationship with his dead son; she's a whiny, overly pushy mother, whose love for Solomon is questionably incestuous.  Of course, Jonathan comes in, wins over Solomon's girlfriend, friends and everyone but Joe.<br /><br />There's hardly any real suspense or chills in this book and Neiderman pads it with redundant speeches, and a ridiculous anticlimactic ending.<br /><br />I have thoroughly enjoyed some of Neiderman's other books, but this is one I do not recommend.	2004-09-04

Once she finds out she has been adopted, she is unnecessarily cruel to her adoptive father, Matt.  Surely the girl after 15 years should know whether or not her father loves her.  Her reactions, while questionably comparable to a 15 year old, make her a very unlikeable character, and it's hard to feel any real fear for her.<br /><br />Staub does well in keeping you guessing as to who the culprit is, throwing in a few red herrings along the way.  The characters of John and Lucy, while an integral part of the storyline, are never really fleshed out enough to feel sympathy for them, either.<br /><br />But, the bottom line, is:  did it keep me interested?

The woman is an exact double for Maura, and thus we delve into the past history of this strong woman, and find that the victim is indeed a twin sister she never knew she had.

In a brave departure, Slaughter takes us back about 13 years to a younger Sara and Jeffrey, who are caught up in a web of murder and conspiracy in Jeffrey's hometown.  This storyline ties in with the present day hostage situation taking place in Jeffrey's office.  Two young gunmen have burst in, killed an officer and taken eight schoolchildren who were touring the offices and a few others as hostages, including Sara.  The consistently enigmatic Lena Adams is back, and she continues to be one of those hate/love characters.  Readers of previous novels will understand this, as Lena has never fully won over the hearts of her readers; she continues in an abusive relationship, and dark secrets shadow her life.<br /><br />There's some fancy twists in the plot, and the characters from the younger days have a little more impact in this novel, from the mysterious friend Robert to the equally curious Sheriff.<br /><br />The pacing is slower in some ways than her previous books, but it reads well and the scenes have the proper impact.<br /><br />All in all, a wonderful entry...looking forward to \\"Faithless.\\"	2004-08-31

Hmmm....Pendergast teams with his Relic buddy Vincent Dagosta and Reliquary Laura Hayward to pursue this demonic and heinous crime spree.  Counterpointing this section of the book is the Rev. Wayne Buck, a born again murderer who believes he may be the second coming of Christ.  The parallel storyline complements the main storyline with the inclusion of the reverend and the career-oriented newspaperman, Byron Harriman, a man after Preston/Childs staple journalist, Bill Smithback.<br /><br />The novel gives us more background information on Pendergast and D'agosta, making their characterizations richer and more accessible.  The corpulent Count Fosco is an interesting, over the top Goldfingerish like villain, and a formidable opponent for our heroes.<br /><br />There's much background information on the Stradivarius violin, and the Italian countryside, but it enhances the novel.

John Lutz draws the portrait of a serial killer with a penchant for enshrouding his female victims in their bedsheets, then stabs them and lets them bleed to death.  He manages to get into their high rise apartments without being detected, and gets away too.  Detective Thomas Horn is called out of an early retirement to assist NYPD in capturing this maniacal killer.  He is assisted by Cajun Paula Ramboquette and almost retired Roy Brickstaff.  Horn also has a lovely wife, Anne, head of the radiographic department at Kingdom Hospital, who is being sued over the anesthesia-induced coma of a four year old boy, whose parents John and Cindy Vine, are hellbent on making the hospital pay.<br /><br />Lutz' characterizations are sharp and there are several twists in the intriguing plot.  Two areas bothered me though:  one--little is given to justify the hasty estrangement of Thomas and his wife; and there's a lot of scenes involving a sculptor that don't seem to have anything to do with the plot and could have been left out and the book would not have suffered in the least.<br /><br />However, this is my first Lutz book and I enjoyed it enough to seek out others.	2004-08-28

In this book, Deaver takes the readers to Berlin 1936, the time of the Olympics and pre WWII Germany.  Fascinating in detail and endowed with rich characterizations, the novel gives us a view of the times and how Germany at this time was getting ready for Hitler's mad march.<br /><br />Deaver does well with the character of Paul Schumann, the NY hit man with the conscience, who is sent to Germany to assassinate Rudolph Ernst, a soldier attempting to strengthen the military.  Schumann has many levels to unfold, and only the ending disappointed me in the choice that Paul makes.<br /><br />Elsewhere we meet the fascinating Willi Kohl, a very intelligent and likeable leader of the non Secret Service police.  Partnered with a young policeman, Janssen, Kohl makes much progress in his attempt to locate the mysterious Schumann.<br /><br />Paul has a doomed romance with a German fraulein; two young German boys discover the horror of Ernst's plan; and Paul buddies up with a German version of himself.<br /><br />The pace is not as quick as I would have liked it, and Deaver's twists in this one aren't as shocking as in previous novels.  But, it is a fine change of pace and a good read, especially for fans of fictionalized history.  The addition of Jesse Owens was a nice touch, too.	2004-08-25

Brad Meltzer introduces us to this fascinating underbelly of the government and then defies all novelistic protocol by offering us a real shocker early on.<br /><br />As the narrative voices change and the story unfolds, Meltzer gives us labyrinthine plotting, some exciting suspense scenarios, particularly in the abandoned mine in South Dakota and in the finale set way beneath the Capitol building.<br /><br />Matthew and Harris are appealing leads and Viv Parker, the senate page, is a dynamic teenager who adds much depth and realism to the sometimes unrealistic plotting.

Recently transferred from a Panama assignment to North Carolina, Reacher discovers that there were a multitude of reassignments all on the same day.  A dead three star general, a gay Delta Force soldier, the general's wife murdered at home, and more await Reacher in this remarkably good book.<br /><br />We also get to know a little more about Reacher and his older brother, Joe, and his aging and dying mother.  From Paris to Los Angeles to Frankfort, Child molds a quite unique plot and unlike his others, this is more of a mystery so we don't know all the bad guys until the end.  There are several exciting scenes, culminating in a shootout in the desert at Irvine, California.<br /><br />Child has brought us a hero that can be bullheaded, frustrating, but ultimately fascinating and heroic.

I have enjoyed the Alex Delaware series very much, but THERAPY doesn't come anywhere near the rest of the books.  Kellerman weaves a plot so intricate and mundane that it's easy to lose focus on what is going on.  For example, his relationship with Milo seems tired and nothing new is revealed; also his love interest in this one, Allyson, is nowhere near as involving as his up and down relationship with Robin, who is only briefly used in this novel.<br /><br />Kellerman gives us no one to really care about, and there are no surprises in the whodunit arena.  Kellerman is falling into his wife's dilemma by starting to inject the Jewish plight into his novels; leave that to Faye; you don't need it.  There are too many characters involved in too many circuitous ways to allow the reader to experience any kind of empathy or concern.<br /><br />All in all, Jonathan, THERAPY is just dull and doesn't do justice to the excellent novels you wrote before this.	2004-08-21

Danny Cray is an \\"artiste\\" who moonlights as a private investigator for some firm.  He's offered a rather good assignment to track down someone who's \\"badmouthing\\" a certain famous person.  Well, needless to say, that's where Danny goes wrong.<br /><br />Danny is likeable, but he does so many stupid things; things that I can't see a man of his limited expertise doing.  He manages to get a bunch of people killed because of this naivete.  He cheats on his girlfriend with an exotic spy and then tries to worm his way out of it when the video of his sexual exploits is e-mailed to his sort of fiance.<br /><br />The global hopping gets monotonous; the plot incredulous, and the finale is right out of Indiana Jones.<br /><br />It may entertain at times, but it's way beyond what I've come to expect from mr.

Come on people, this is an action book and Reilly packs so many life and death scenarios in his books that you feel like you've been on a rollercoaster with him!  I don't see how he comes up with some of them---believable, who cares?

First and foremost are the inclusion of Aloysius Knight and his comrade, Rufus.  Joining forces with Shane against the many assassins out for his head, they make a potent trio (add Mother for a foursome!).  The main villain Jonathan Killian is a real loser, and you keep rooting for his ultimate demise.<br /><br />The action shifts from Washington, Afghanistan, Siberia, France, the English Channel, you name it, you get to go there.<br /><br />The short paragraph style of writing is remarkable---each page has a cliffhanger!

He kills for the nourishment he needs...and he's getting away with it.<br /><br />DEFICIENCY works because the situations are so unusual and the reader of course wants to know why this killer kills and just who he is.  The usual government coverup is involved, and the ultimate resolution fairly obvious.  Niederman does slow things down a lot with the killer's internal ramblings and the up and down relationship of Dr. Barnard and her lawyer fiance, Curt Walcott.<br /><br />But overall the novel holds your interest, even if the finale does seem a little rushed.<br /><br />It does however make me want to sample some more of Mr. Niederman's works.	2004-08-04

Marybeth has taken on a job and has become embroiled in it so much that it hurts her family life; not trying to be chauvinistic, but it gets a little repetitious having takehome food or frozen casseroles for dinner every night.  But Marybeth is an interesting and complex character; also the children are used in the subplot, and Sheridan is a typical teen, while Lucy and Jessica merely become plot devices.  Other than the Picketts, there aren't a whole lot of likeable characters in this book.  As the plot develops, we begin to question Cam and Marie Logue, the Picketts' good friends; we continue to hate the sheriff Barnum and his deputies; Nate is likeable, but seems at times a little out there.  And the mystical/alien aspect takes Box out of his usual realistic plots and dialogue.<br /><br />I certainly won't stop reading Box, I've really enjoyed the journey so far; just hope he returns to a more accessible plot development, gets rid of Barnum and lets Joe become a real cop!	2004-07-28

Jay Brandon delivers a powerful storyline, replete with incredibly realistic characters and emotional confrontations that are explicitly and thoughtfully written.<br /><br />DA Mark Blackwell is asked to do a favor for a friend---a child molester wants to confess to his crimes, and he wants to surrender to Blackwell.  When the case comes to trial, however, the molester recants and says it wasn't him.  Soon, a young ten year old boy watching news reports identifies the real culprit, but it's not the arrested molester---it's the man's lawyer.<br /><br />From hereon, Brandon takes us through a maze of deceit and cover-ups; the brave young boy who has to fight his feelings of his abuser, and testify in court.  Blackwell is aided by a dedicated underling named Betsy, and finds himself facing his old mentor in the final showdown.<br /><br />The courtroom scenes are phenomenally well done, and the pacing keeps us intrigued.  We feel the terror of the act; sympathy for the victim and their families; we also learn more about Blackwell and his own failed fatherhood with his son, David.  This is not sugarcoated; the deck is not stacked.  Faults match virtues, and even Blackwell comes under our scope at times.<br /><br />All in all, however, this is a brilliant book.  Well worth reading!	2004-07-25

Her continuing heads on with Ryan is getting a little old and redundant, but at least at the end, with Ryan's little surprise, maybe the sparring will ease up a little.  Also, the inclusion of Anne and her marital problems added little to the story, simply providing Tempe a fall guy in the final scene.  And why does Tempe insist on going into dangerous places with dangerous people without any kind of backup?  In six novels, it's always gotten her in trouble.  Reichs needs to make Tempe behave with a little more common sense.<br /><br />With that aside, MONDAY MOURNING has a compelling tale that slowly reaches a fiery climax.  The true culprit is surprising, and Reichs does have a way with dialogue and humanizing her characters as in previous books.  If the Anne scenes had been expunged, the book may have been a tighter more convincing read.  As it is, it's still a good book by a talented writer.	2004-07-23

Too bad, because for a while, we have a real pageturner going here.  While I hadn't totally picked the real killer, the revelation is no surprise, considering the direction Childs is taking us in.  Christopher Lash is an interesting hero, but his immediate love for his perfect match, Diana Mirren, comes out of nowhere; how come he doesn't fall for the lovely if offish Tara?  And we could have done without the lengthy chase scene through the buildings tunnels or whatever they were.  Richard Silver, the owner of Eden, is like most of the megalomaniacs in books like this, so his fate is likewise telegraphed.<br /><br />All in all, DEATH MATCH is a fun book, but it's overly technical climax is detrimental in the long run.	2004-07-21

Alex is certainly a diehard knight in shining armor.  When it comes to Natalie, he dyes his hair and starts eating salads.  At a rendezvous in Sault St. Marie, Alex and Natalie encounter an old man with a Hapsburg hat, who plunges them into a deep dark mystery that involves Natalie's family's past.  Hamilton once again uses the frigid landscape of the upper peninsula to compliment the dark and cold mood this book evokes.  The plot is a little overdone this time, and Natalie is not the kind of heroine I feel Alex deserves.  Sometimes the constant running back and forth from Michigan to Canada slows the pace of the book down, but it's climax is satisfying.  I do think Hamilton needs to reconsider making Natalie Alex's partner, though.	2004-07-20

The opening chapter of this tense little thriller is ample proof.  How it relates to the main gist of the novel takes a long time, but it does make sense.<br />Green's novels are well crafted, even if sometimes he becomes a little too cinematic in the way the story unfolds.  Casey Jordan is not the most likeable of heroines...she's ambitious, always concerned about the way she is perceived; she likes her rich life, her uncaring husband and her notoriety.  Once she takes on Eric Lipton, her former law professor, however, things start caving in on her.<br />Lipton is a demonic character, full of pride and arrogance, and the reader will doubt his innocence from the start.  Once his trial is over, Casey must face Donald Sales, the father of the victim whom she intimated may have been more than just a daddy.  Meanwhile, Bob Bolinger, a crusty older detective (think Lee J. Cobb) is convinced Lipton is a serial killer.<br />Green twists the plot for some interesting surprises, particularly in the relationship between Sales and Casey.<br />An involving and engrossing legal thriller, which despite its flaws, is one of Green's more intriguing novels.	2004-07-19

Oh, well, different strokes...<br />I found Margolin's style very involving, switching from the present where Miles van Meter is attending a book signing in honor of his bestseller to the time of the crimes where young Ashley Spencer loses both her father and mother to a particularly brutal serial killer.  Joshua Maxfield is an arrogant protagonist, and one can see how this maniacally self centered author could be such a ghastly killer.  Ashley is joined by her young lawyer friend, Jerry Phillips, and the delightfully enjoyable Delilah Wallace (think of Queen Latifah for the movie role) in solving this complex mystery.  Nothing is quite as it seems and there are several red herrings thrown in for good measure, including the comatosed sister of Miles, Casey; and Casey's good for nothing husband, Randy Coleman.  I was thoroughly entertained by the book and found it one of my favorite reads so far this year.	2004-07-15

In HIDDEN PREY, Lucas pairs up with a Russian agent, Nadya, in the search for the killer of a Russian spy.  Readers know that the killer is a young boy named Carl Walthers, mentored by his 92 year old great grandfather.  Walthers and his elderly teacher are pretty clever in staging accompanying deaths to throw Lucas off.<br />There are several tense scenes, but HIDDEN PREY is a little more &quot;relaxed&quot; and &quot;leisurely&quot; in its tone than previous PREY books.  This is not necessarily bad, but Hidden doesn't match some of the intense psychological battles Lucas has fought in previous cases.  Sandford of course keeps things moving well and his narrative style is as sharp as ever.  Another thing is (spoiler alert), the killer is never truly brought to justice.  In the next book maybe?	2004-07-15

I admit that the book held my interest and I was impressed with Shirley's narrative flow.  Seems there might have been too many characters to focus on, so there tended to be some redundant and superfluous scenes.  Shirley etches his characters fairly well, and there are no &quot;safe&quot; characters in this one (which is also reminiscent of John Saul and King).<br />CRAWLERS is basically a &quot;Body Snatchers&quot; with a cruel metallic twist.  These nanotechnological horrors are using human bodies to regenerate into killing machines and threaten to take over the world.  The imagery Shirley conveys in these transmutations is spellbinding, and would work very well cinematically.  There are some tightly suspenseful scenes, and some good dialogue between the teens and their adult counterparts.<br />A good novel, nothing highly original, but worth a read.	2004-07-12

With an eye for narrative flow (both in first and third person), and a deep understanding of his characters (not always likeable), he continues to mesmerize.  But isn't anybody else out there bothered by this novel's biggest flaw:  we STILL don't know why Robert Backus (aka THE POET) killed all those homicide detectives in the THE POET.  And now he's back and killing again, but with no real reason for these murders either.  There is a slight mention of Backus' stern father and apathetic mother, so we understand perhaps why he's a serial killer, but Connelly let me down by not explaining the why of his victims.  Connelly also should have brought Jack McEvoy back, as he was the real hero in THE POET.<br />Instead, we get the irrepressible Harry Bosch, hero of many of Connelly's books, paired with FBI agent Rachel Walling, who was a key player in THE POET.  Connelly wisely uses the media again in that in this book they mention quite often the movie BLOOD WORK, which is based on Connelly's own novel, revolving around the heart-transplanted cop Terry McCabe.  Buddy Longbridge's reference to Jeff Daniels' interpretation of his character is slyly brilliant.  Which is a shame..Connelly is brilliant, and this book certainly entertains.  I just wish I could understand why Connelly has let something so important be taken for granted without any supporting narrative evidence.  Maybe we'll get it again?  Anyway, definitely a must for fans, but if you're a new reader, you may be let down a little too.	2004-07-07

I am still a little in the dark as to the true motivations of THE POET, and hope that in reading THE NARROWS, Connelly will offer us more background into just why THE POET is doing what he is doing.  However, dive into this book and meet Jack McEvoy, Rachel Walling and all the other brilliant characters this book has to offer, and then you'll be like me in wanting to dive into the NARROWS.	2004-07-06

The posed naked dead body of a released rapist is found in a seedy hotel room.  The victim had just been released from prison and is found posed rather prayerfully, his neck garroted, masked, etc.  Thorne also finds out that someone called the local florist to arrange for a wreath to be sent to the hotel room.  Through this accidental phone call, Thorne becomes involved with Eve Bloom, the lovely florist who took the call.<br />Another body turns up, again a rapist recently released from prison, killed in the same method, different hotel.<br />Thorne and his reliable partner, Dave Holland, dig deep into the case to try and find out who is responsible for these killings.  Tackling the moral issue of whether this killer should be arrested or applauded, Billingham takes us on a nerve-wracking, surprising tale that climaxes in high fashion.<br />Billingham gives us a little more insight into Thorne's private life, including the bittersweet relationship between Thorne and his Alzheimer-ridden father.  Dave Holland is also going through an emotional crisis with the approaching birth of his first child.<br />Billingham knows how to write..he keeps the reader totally engrossed in his tales, and gives us red herrings and hidden clues.<br />This series is one of the best out there...enjoy!!!	2004-06-30

Perhaps it is a bit overplotted, and yes, the editors left in numerous typos, but at the heart of the novel is Coben's dry humor, his keen understanding of relationships and his witty use of plot contrivances.<br />Grace Lawson is a great heroine, one who will do anything to protect and defend her family.  Eric Wu is a cold, heartless and despicable villain.  Carl Vespa is your typical mob don, but one whose respect for Grace is admirable.  Cram, his henchman, is a memorable character---a bad guy you can't help but like.  Jack Lawson is not in the book much, but his unseen presence forms a strong foundation, even as we find out the truth.<br />The plot jumps back and forth, and as layer upon layer of hard to swallow events are revealed, we still find ourselves mesmerized with Coben's brilliant narrative style.<br />Perhaps the most vile character is Scott Duncan; once you read the book you'll find out why, and Coben does pull a biggie at the end that makes you wonder, how heroic is Grace?<br />But, undeniably, JUST ONE LOOK is a great read, just wish Coben would stop tormenting us by not writing any Bolitars!!!!	2004-06-30

Shirley Rousseau Murphy's Joe Gray/Dulcie series has so far been a very enjoyable series, with her feline hero/heroines (Kit's the other female)a delight to spend time with.  CAT FEAR NO EVIL, while sure to please Ms. Murphy's fans, is a little stale.  Murphy spends a lot of time commiserating over some of her character's dilemmas redundantly and uncolorfully.  This is true in the case of both Kate and Dillon.  There also isn't as much of Dulcie and Kit in this one; seems Murphy is spending a little more time on her humans in this one, and while Kate Osborne was initially fascinating, in this book she comes across pathetically inept both emotionally and physically.  Azriel, the black cat, also chews up too much of the scenery.  There's some far fetched plotting in this one, and resolutions come a little too easily.<br />But, the series isn't dead; Ms. Murphy needs to reassess why her readers have followed her---the three cats should be the focal point of the books, and let other fiction writers focus on the humans!!!	2004-06-22

BAD MEN is a brutal, gut-wrenching, mesmerizing, violent and excellently penned thriller.  Connolly wastes no time in getting us introduced to the bad men of the title, and they are definitely BADDDDD!<br />Edward Moloch lies in prison having dreams of a seventeenth century bloodbath on a remote island north of Maine.  Moloch wants revenge on the wife who betrayed him and took off with almost a million dollars of his money.  He recruits some really cold-blooded, despicable associates to help get his wife and his money.<br />The wife has moved on to Sanctuary Island, the very island of Moloch's dreams.  She has a new name for both her and her son, and she has fallen in love with the island's sheriff, Joe Dupree.  Joe is an enormous man, considered a &quot;giant&quot; and maybe even a freak by the islanders, but he is a gentle, kind man, and despite his size, is respected and admired.<br />A lot of corpses accompany the escaped Moloch and his crew as he slowly winds his way to the confrontation with his wife.<br />Connolly creates a terrifying mood of suspense, and even adds the supernatural in that the slaughtered villagers from the 17th century are hanging around and thousands and thousands of moths, too!  In less competent hands, this addition would be preposterous.  In Connolly's, however, they only add to the sheer terror of this breathtaking thriller.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2004-06-12

Divided into five different sections, King weaves tales of psychodrama and Vietnam War drama.  The first story (the longest) is the one about Bobby Hatfield and his encounter with Ted Brautigan and the low people in yellow coats.  At times mesmerizing and frightening, it still is pretentious and overly talkative at times.  Characters are established and King continues his deft handling of bringing us multidimensional characters.  But at this part's end, we're still not sure of just who Ted is, and unless you've read THE DARK TOWERS, King's self-congratulatory epic series, you will be lost.<br />The second part is about as electrifying as a gas lantern; we meet Pete Riley and some other King-like characters, we're reintroduced to Carol Gerber from part one, and the whole story focuses on the addiction to the card game, Hearts, with antiwar sentiment thrown in for creative balance, or imbalance.<br />In the third story, one of the characters from part one leads a triple life and poses as a blind man.  Ho hum.  Next we meet Sully again, and this time he encounters objects falling from the sky during a traffic jam.  Woah..where did this come from? And finally we meet Bobby again who meets Carol again and who tells us Ted has something planned.<br />While one can admire King's continued artistry after so many novels, it's a shame to read a King book that doesn't at least scare you a lot one time???

It's tired, it's rehash of several of Saul's earlier books in which mistreated teens seek revenge on their tormentors.  And it's not even as well done as those earlier works.<br />We meet Angel Sullivan, an overweight, unattractive 15 year old who suffers endless torment from both boys and girls in her school.  Never mind the fact that Angie has little backbone and how can one feel sorry for somebody who doesn't take up for herself, or take advantage of the talents she has?  She teams up with Seth Baker, another tormented teen (the boys call him &quot;Beth&quot;), and he too takes the guff without any resistance.  Suffice to say, his bully father still beats him with a belt?  Come on, Saul, this is antiquated stuff.  Angie's mother Myra is a religious fanatic, seeing visions of the Virgin Mary, and allowing her drunken abusive husband to abuse both her and Angel.  We have the typical stud villains and of course the catty female wenches to keep harassing the two misfits.  Of course, they stumble upon a secret place (led there by the irrepressible Houdini, a black cat that just appears in Angel's room).  We have the legend of witches and murders happening in the house at Black Creek Crossing, and we have not one original sequence in the book.  At the improbable resolution, we don't even have the satisfaction of all the tormentors getting their just desserts, except the parents of course.<br />I've always thought John Saul must have had a horrible childhood.  All of these teen books smell of abuse, loneliness and revenge.  Not a nice way to spend the evening, especially when it's done so pedestrian as in BLACK CREEK CROSSING.	2004-05-31

But the background is complex and nothing is quite as it seems.  At times Holden's plotting does get a little muddled, but by the end of the novel, you get a better understanding of George Remus and why he killed his enigmatic wife, Imogene.

But Mooney's clever enough to keep the scorecard easily tabulated.  One reviewer mentioned how glum the hero Steve Conway is.  Granted, but take a look at his life, and you might see why he's so aloof and downtrodden.  More than anything, Conway possesses the loyalty and dedication to take the risks necessitated in this cannon-fired thriller.  Take a look at the villains (and I can't name them all as it would spoil the plot):  Angel Eyes --- is he as bad as he seems?  Gunther, his assistant; Mischa, the gigantic Russian; Jonathan Cole, a despicable earchewing maniac; Owen Lee/Chris Evans, along for a ride he's not prepared for.

The accused doctor and her defense make an intriguing couple, battling with the ethical logicities of being client and lawyer and lovers.  The villains, and there are many of them, are cliche and the twists toward the end can be seen earlier if you pay attention to the lot of the clues Palmer buries.  Particularly good among the supporting characters is Dr. Rosa Suarez, the CDC whose investigation into the cause of the DIC brings the final clues.

We also meet a despicable patient named Minnefield who says he saw the murderer enter the cottage (it's on the institution's grounds, by the way).  Roberts enlists the aid of both the local sheriff and a private investigator who helped Judith get her children back when the ex kidnapped them.<br />The murderer's identity is apparent early on, but Wilson throws in enough doubt to make you wonder along the way.<br />A good, crisp thriller.	2004-05-07

Once again, Joe Lansdale's \\"amateur\\" sleuths find themselves embroiled in murder and mayhem, and it all starts with a good deed.  At his new job at the chicken factory, security guard Hap prevents the murder of a wealthy young woman by a crazed maniac.  Her millionaire father shows his appreciation by giving Hap a check for a hundred thousand dollars.  Leonard, now with his new love John, tells Hap they should go on a cruise..no real reason, just that they've never been on one before.  Needless to say, this vacation turns into a nightmare when Leonard mouths off at the concierge and they find themselves stranded in a little fishing town.  Enter a beautiful woman, her poor father, some wealthy tourists and we begin our tale of murder and deceit.  Lansdale continues his gift for natural dialogue and unique, but believable, situations.  We meet a crime lord and his seven foot bully, Hammerhead.  It seems sometimes that Lansdale can be a little cruel in his treatment of some of his subordinate characters (Billy for example), and he tends to overdo the sexual innuendo and the sexual encounters.  But it's a man's world, and Lansdale knows it.  At least the lovely if foul mouthed Brett Sawyer is back, and by the end of the book, who knows..wedding bells?<br />A fine entry in this well executed series.	2004-05-05

FREEZER BURN is certainly full of Lansdale's trademark humor and unusual scenarios, but ultimately it loses ground in the story of Bill Roberts and his involvement with Frost's freakshow.  The story is filled with sexual innuendo, thoughts, and acts; Gidget is reminiscent of Kathleen Turner in Body Heat, and other femme fatales.  Bill comes across selfish and uncaring at times, and when he does care, it's not enough.  He's definitely a man ruled by his sexual satisfaction.  Lansdale keeps the plot interesting, although the end is basically a downer, and one wonders how else Lansdale could have resolved it...guess this was the only way.  Well written but not satisfying.	2004-05-04

From improbably probable situations (like Hap getting bit by a rabid squirrel) to tense, action packed scenes (including the tornado ending), BAD CHILI is the most fun you'll get in a suspense novel!  Hap and Leonard are true friends, and their bantering is priceless.  Lansdale knows how to use the most innovative dialogue and fleshed out, likeable characters, and he uses both Hap and Leonard, along with Jim Bob and Brett Sawyer, Clinton and Leon, Charlie, etc.  The villains are nasty, and the plot deep and twisty.  The romantic involvement between Brett and Hap is one of the most true to life and sexy encounters you'll find in fiction.<br />Lansdale is a great writer, one who knows how to write for his audience, entertain and intrigue them.  It might be bad chili, but it's superb reading!  Bon appetite!!!	2004-05-02

While \\"Blinded\\" tends to move a little slower than most of White's books, it nevertheless is a worthy entry in this wonderful series.<br />Alan finds himself faced with a client from the past; a woman who claims that her husband is a serial killer.  He also finds himself faced with a career crisis that involves breach of confidentiality; and at home, Lauren's multiple sclerosis exacerbates, worsening her condition and adding extra stress to Gregory's already stressful existence.<br />Meanwhile, Sam suffers a heart attack and finds himself on administrative leave.  But he becomes involved in the serial killer case, alongside a lovely cop from California.  This leads him to Georgia and Indiana, where more of the plot is thickened and unraveled.<br />Although it's fairly obvious who the culprits are in this story, White keeps the novel interesting, and offers some insights on marriage, loneliness, and lots of sexual aberrations.<br />A fine entry in this great series!	2004-04-30

When he's at his best, he's awesome; when he's not, he's sadly mundane.  ODD THOMAS is perhaps the best book Koontz has written since &quot;Dragon Tears&quot; and &quot;Hideaway.&quot;  In fact, it may be his best yet.<br />In his past half dozen books or so, Koontz has tended to become metaphorical, bombastic, preachy and mundane.  However, in ODD THOMAS, the narrative voice that has chilled his fans for years (and I'm one of them) returns with superior focus.  Dean has learned how to add humor to his works, and the humor in this one is right on target.  The relationship between Odd and Stormy is so richly realized, so simple in its true evocation of love, that you want the best for them no matter what.  The inclusion of Elvis' presence could have been a cheap ploy in some author's hands, but the way Koontz integrates the king of rock and roll into the story is sublimely touching.  There is so much &quot;heart&quot; in this book, it's hard to remember you're reading a novel about a demonic serial killer, and Odd works hard to save those souls he can.<br />This book has moments of chilling suspense; touching humanity; crisp and believable dialogue; and an ending that will surprise many.  Koontz is in his finest form in this novel; I highly recommend it to those who have felt cheated by Koontz's latest novels, and to those who have yet to discover the voice of a man who is an artist, and who has regained his pictorial genius.	2004-04-27

Joe Lansdale, known for his black humor, whips it out in plenty in this tale of a Reverend who wanders into Mud Creek and finds himself involved in the curse of an Indian wrongly accused of killing a young girl, and lynched.  His mulatto woman was also brutally raped and murdered.  The curse is purely simple:  zombies beget more zombies, and Lansdale spares nothing in his brutally graphic and frightening tale.  Joining Rev. Jeb in the spotlight is a delightful young boy named David; the bewitching Abby and her rascally doctor father; and of course the many zombies populating the scene.<br />The book is relentless and no character is guaranteed safety by the time the book ends; it has a rather &quot;twisty&quot; ending as well; did he ever do a sequel?  It would be great!!!<br />A very good horror story.	2004-04-25

If I remember correctly, Logan said he wasn't going to show, but there is a scene where he is sitting on the beach and decides to change his mind?  If that's not the one, did I miss something?  Oh, well, anyway McGregor continues in her Koontz mode with this interesting tale of road rage gone to the extreme.  Frank Benedict is one of those high powered lawyers who cannot tolerate failure, and it seems that is the case when he feels he's going to lose a client, he's drunk, mad and decides to take it out on the innocent Charlie Calloway and her husband.  Charlie's also pregnant, but loses the baby.  Her quest for revenge leads her into an uneasy alliance with Logan, a man who after dying for eleven minutes, developed a psychic ability to touch something and &quot;read it.&quot;  Charlie, too, died briefly and she has a similar type of psychic ability.  Among the other supporting characters is an Alzheimer patient who witnessed the crash; Frank's wife, Anita, who becomes a strong focal point in the novel's last scenes; and other various FBI agents and such.  McGregor keeps her pace pretty well, and although she does write in cliches, her prose seems natural and therefore extremely readable.  McGregor will never achieve Koontz's fame, but in writing in similar venues, she will probably keep a loyal following.	2004-04-24

The leading characters of Ward Hopkins and Nina are given a little more depth this time, and the Upright Man himself pulls off some neat trickery.  The subplot involving a bigfoot and a nice old lady are muddled, and not fully resolved at the end, either.  The presence of Tom Kozelek as a man bent on committing suicide also tends to cloud the central plot.<br />However, most of these subplots and twists come together in a susspenseful showdown in the snowy mountains of Washington state.  Marshall also suggests a possible third entry in this unusual, if sometimes frustrating, series.	2004-04-22

Aside from that though, McGarrity once again weaves an intricate plot, focusing a little more on Clayton Isee, Kerney's just-discovered son, and giving Kevin a little bit of a break.  Kerney is going to have reconstructive surgery on his knee, Sara's a typical pre-natal mess, and the other cops are interesting to spend time with.  Once again, a respected politician figures in the maelstrom of corruption, drugs, prostitution and murder.  The victims this time are a long-missing Hispanic woman and a low-life hustler.  McGarrity works the plot well, providing some early clues, but unlike his previous novels, they just aren't as intriguing.  But I won't give up on McGarrity---he's been too good so far, and this one is far from mundane.	2004-04-19

Kerney is embroiled this time with a huge government coverup.  The first victim:  Phyllis Terrell, the estranged lascivious wife of ambassador Harrison Terrell.  Looks like her murder might have been an act of passion.  Kerney's investigation however reveals a close connection with the murder of a priest as well.  McGarrity brings back officious undercover agent Charles Perry, a brief appearance by Enrqiue de Leon, Kerney's nemesis from two previous books, and of course, Kerney's wife, Sara.  Sara, now pregnant, is considering leaving the service so she and Kevin can build a better life together.<br />Again, McGarrity uses fellow police officers to aid Kerney, and with his usual flair for scene and substance, pulls off another remarkable entry in this excellent series.<br />Outstanding!	2004-04-18

Kerney is called in when six murders along a single stretch of highway include a well respected judge.  Kerney doesn't think it's just a random sweep killer, but the judge was the intended, and the other murders done to confuse authorities.  Along with this, Kerney is now a married man, with his wife Sara off doing her thing, and their long distance marriage causing some strain.  Add to this, Kerney had to kill a fellow cop who threatened his life and someone out there doesn't like killer cops, no matter what they did.  And on a personal note, Kerney finds out he has a son by a previous relationship years ago..this son is also a cop for the Indian Reservation.<br />As always, McGarrity knows how to write his stuff, once again involving other law enforcers in solving the case.  While the murderer's identity is not totally surprising, proving it is worth the effort.<br />Excellent writing.	2004-04-16

Kerney has inherited land from a schoolmate of his late mother's, and he is ecstatic, even though he may not be able to pay the inheritance tax on it.  While looking at his new land, he and his friend Dale Jennings, discover the bones of a female, and it looks like homicide.  If that weren't enough, a local citizen, Carl Boaz, is found with a bullet in his forehead on a cabin on Kerney's property.  These two crimes propel Kerney and his associates into a maelstrom of rape, murder, and burglary.  And, Sara Brannon, Kerney's love from a previous book, returns to add romantic complications to his life.  A side plot involves a fellow cop's plight with his son and the son's notoriously bad friend.<br />Again, the dialogue and settings are rich and authentic, and Kerney plows ahead in this excellent series.	2004-04-15

Of course, if that happened, there'd be no novels!  At any rate, Kerney who was critically wounded during a drug bust is faced with a request for assistance from the partner who let him down.  Reservation sheriff Terry Yazzi asks Kerney to help locate his son, who has been reported AWOL from his army base.  Kerney is young Sammy's godfather, and this is what induces him to take up the search.<br />Nothing is as it seems in this search, however; Sammy may have stumbled upon something that led to his disappearance.  Rare artifacts are being stolen and shipped out, and Sammy may have discovered this.  Kerney teams up with tough Sara Brannon, the army's investigator, and becomes embroiled in a plot as thick as molasses.<br />McGarrity has a way of introducing you to his settings and characters that is primal and informative, without bogging down his plot.  Kerney is a tough, likeable hero, and you root for him against the inumerable bad guys.<br />Gutsy and down to earth; well written and involving.  A good series.	2004-04-13

A Mexican tourist is murdered, and his senile grandfather wandering around the area; seems, too, like there are some poachers in the area.  Add to this a sixty-year old family feud, a lovely ADA, and a great partner (Jim Stiles), and Kerney is off and running in trying to find murderers, poacheers, and the harvesting of rare animals for illegal sales.  As in TULAROSA, the plot is thick and juicy, and Kerney once again the penultimate hero.  A great read in this wonderfully engaging series.	2004-04-13

However, once the identity of the culprit becomes obvious, Cassutt keeps with his technical side and loses his momentum.  Cassutt obviously knows the inner workings of NASA, and while this is good to help provide a background, I agree with other reviewers who felt it interrupted the flow and ultimately destroyed any chance for suspense in the final moments.  What could have been breathtaking suspense on the MIR turned out to be an obligatory and &quot;safe&quot; ending.  The ending is too pat and cliche and having the bad deeds remain unknown only hinders Cassutt's intentions to give us a true blue hero.	2004-04-11

SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS is a beautifully written tale of love, hate, deceit, hope, despair and mystery.  David Guterson fleshes out his characters so brilliantly, one can't help but feel like they are visiting with people they see every day.  It's hard to single out one character as more compelling than others, but there are several extremely original ones:  Carl Heine, the victim, a strong, yet silent man, who wants to give his family a home to be proud of, who fishes only because there's little else to do; Ishmael Chambers, the newspaperman/war veteran, whose silent love of the defendant's wife brings him to a crossroads where life and death meet; Hatsue, the wife, whose recognition of her true feelings for Ishmael may have been brought about by circumstances alone.  The book also shows a side of our American history that in retrospect is so shameful, in the way we treated Japanese Americans after the bombing of Pearl Harbor.  While one can readily understand our nation's fear at this time, herding them off to work camps with such despicable conditions was no way to treat these people.  A tale of prejudice, indeed, yet within there are people whose love for each other carries them through.<br />SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS is a quiet, slow-moving, yet mesmerizing tale, and it's resolution, while acceptable, still leaves one feeling the sense of loss and hope that accompanied the tale.<br />Beautiful!	2004-04-09

Although a little wordy, I found myself intrigued with the various plots and subplots.  Jack Kirkland is an amiable, brooding hero; Karen Grace is a feisty, intelligent, if somewhat obsessive feminine hero; her friend, Miyuki, exudes some charm and intelligence; Gabriel, the computer, is a viable nonhuman member of the cast; and David Spangler, as the villainous rival of Kirkland's is despicable and meets an approprirately &quot;delicious&quot; end.<br />DEEP FATHOM pours it on and Rollins, while no rival of the incomparable Matt Reilly, does pack in more action scenes than usual.  If you're looking for believable action, this is not your book, but if you're in the mood for some derring do, this one fits the bill!	2004-04-07

This was the case for me in Lansdale's wonderful A FINE DARK LINE.  Although it is a mystery, it is also a marvelous look at growing up in what seemed to be more &quot;innocent&quot; times, when the local drive in was the hottest place in town on Friday and Saturday nights.  The Mitchell family, including the story's narrative voice, Stanley, is a warm and comfortably stoic group, highly developed morals, a sense of family love, and a warm heart for even those outside of the family (most noticeably in their &quot;adoption&quot; of the Negress Rosy).  Buster Lighthorse Smith, who works as the projectionist at the Mitchell's drive-in, is a moody, often caustic alcoholic, who becomes a friend to young Stanley and helps him in his investigation of two murders committed twenty years before.  Although this mystery is what drives the storyline of A FINE DARK LINE, it is the development of the characters, including Stanley's friend, Richard, and many other supporting characters, that elevates this book to its level of excellence.  One of the murders is solved; the other,well, that's for you to decide.  But nonetheless, I wanted to spend more time with Stanley and his family and friends; the wrap up at the end adds to the nostalgic feel of learning about people you knew.  A great book!	2004-04-05

Ultimately, it is a novel of revenge:  Both John and Joshua want to avenge the accidental death of the woman they loved; Joshua also inwardly wants revenge for knowing that prior to her death, Rebecca was going to choose her lover, John and not Joshua, her fiance.  Fueled by this revenge, John and Joshua work together to bring the killer to justice.  A complex undercover assignment begins, with startling, if predictable results.  There are times in the novel when you want Parker to hasten things along; it seems like the time John spends on the ranch is interminable, and there are times when the action slows down.  Fortunately, this doesn't hurt the overall impact of the story.  Parker is to be commended for allowing us to like and dislike both John and Joshua; to like and dislike the villain, Vann Holt; and to feel sorry for Valerie, Holt's daughter who ends up falling for the mole, John.<br />This is a thoughtful, emotional novel and though not as suspenseful as some thrillers, still manages to both entertain and stimulate.	2004-04-04

THE DAWNING takes place in some forseeable future when man has corrupted the earth so much, that it decides to strike back.  A group of survivalists decide to go out and start all over, getting back to nature and away from its violence and waste.  There's not a character who isn't derived from some other book, no scenario that can't be predicted and no fresh look at anything.  It's not suspenseful enough to be scary and it's preachy and there's one character who keeps calling his wife &quot;love&quot; so much, it's saccharinic to say the least.  A livelier pace may have helped, but if Cave is one of the grand masters of modern horror, this is not a book that showcases that talent.	2004-04-01

Then one day she sells three of her sculptures to a mysterious man; he's charming, handsome, rich and sweeps Annie off her feet.  He's also &quot;The Teacher&quot; and tells her she can have her career, her life, the safety of her child and friends if she says two words:  Not guilty.  From there she is thrown into a maze of deceit, lies, and ultimately bone chilling fear.  A subplot involves a polish detective helping out the Teacher's girlfriend, who thinks her lover is cheating on her.<br />The pace of the novel is great and even after the trial is over, it's not over for Annie.<br />Fine good thriller.	2004-03-30

He is known only as Chadwick, and that may indicate the kind of personality Riordan wanted us to identify with.  The cast is full of unique and uncompromisingly original people:  the young Mallory, victim of a cruel childhood disaster, now drug-ridden and sent to a \\"reform\\" school in Texas; John and Ann Zedman, her divorced parents; Norma, Chadwick's ex-wife; counselor Olsen; escort Kindra; the Melrose family; David, a [***]-kisser; etc., etc.  Riordan weaves his plot intricately and pulls a few surprises at the end.<br />A very good book, one to be enjoyed by fans of the genre and others.	2004-03-28

Here we have this guy holed up in his cabin in the Montana mountains, arming even his children with aforesaid guns, and accusing the Federal Government of instigating the war which is about to take place.  Considering the fact that a US marshal was killed, and that the whole thing started when the redneck anarchist shot at a sheriff simply doing his duty.  John Banish, the antihero of this book, has a past few characters would ever want to claim, and Hogan uses the book to show just how frustrating it is to uphold the law and save lives.  The media, stupid supporters of this redneck, and countless others get into the melee.  Hogan's problem:  Why did he have to have baddies in the picture?  Ables is simply a no good racist who uses his own family as protective shields.<br />This book angered me with its portrayal of gun-crazy fanatics who claims their right to bear arms gives them the right to shoot lawmen.  That's why it's so good.  Hogan succeeds in exposing these racists for what they really are---guntoting cowards.	2004-03-17

This is severely challenged with two of her patients:  a self-absorbed serial killer named Justin Gray, and a cop on the take, Alan Brand.

He is a good writer, he is definitely strong on character development.  This is one of the drawbacks of this book.  We get to know the characters well enough, but in doing so, Bova stifles the pacing of his book.  This would work great on the movie screen; there are some really original and exciting virtual &quot;games&quot; going on here.  There aren't a lot of characters to like in this book, although Dan certainly goes through hell to best his lifetime friend, Jason.  Dan's wife, Susan, is whiny and sometimes I wanted to slap her; the daughter is a typical little brat, and what Uncle Kyle wants to do to her is pretty sick.  WE get a lot of background on why Kyle Muncrief wants little Angela so bad, though.<br />If Bova had cut some of the excess fat off this book, it would have been a stunner!	2004-03-10

Sarah Whitaker has recently married Alex, a strong, stable high school teacher; Sarah herself is a beautician, co-owner of her own shop; they have a son, Brian, a precocious six year old.  However, this is Alex's second marriage; his first ended violently when madwoman Christine Halstrum murdered his wife and adopted son.  Christine is the natural mother, of course, and she wanted her baby back.  Christine was apprehended, and committed to a mental institution.  Now, four years later, Christine has escaped and wants her revenge.<br />Allegretto does a nice job in creating characters you can feel for and with, but his meandering pace tempers the suspense, although there is a nifty ending on the roof of the Whitaker home.<br />An enjoyable read, not too gory, or sex-driven; family kind of murder!<br />Cozy up by the fireplace and enjoy.	2004-03-06

In Richard Barre's THE INNOCENTS, yes, depressing things do happen; it amazes me that some reviewers found the book such a downer.  I found it a tense and credible look at a very different PI, Wil Hardesty, who finds himself investigating the most heinous of crimes.  He doesn't deliberately endanger the lives of his friends, and yes, he does have a cross to bear in the tragic loss of his son.  In this debut novel, Wil is up against a powerful tycoon who donates lots of money to a church; the charismatic priest who will do anything to get money for his mission and to further his own &quot;saintliness&quot;, and some tragic events that lead to the deaths of some of Wil's friends.

Tom hooks up with his ex-biker/computer genius buddy Mike Tubbs, and sets out to find out where his newspaper reported daughter has disappeared to.  You see, she's working on exposing Michael Gleason for the dirtbag he is.  Daughter Jane is also falling in love with a mysterious informant, Mark Allen, who is probably more than he appears to be as well.<br />Green's plotting borders on absurdity here as the heroes kidnap and torture Senator Gleason.

However, within five years, Frank's other son, David, dies mysteriously from a rare form of cancer, as does Janice Fay, David's governess.  In the present day, VJ acts like a little Hitler and it's not long before his Mom suspects something pretty evil going on.

Bailey gives the story a foundation of atmospheric tension, a puzzling mystery, a connection between past and present events which he brings together in the final pages.<br />Henry Sleep is a likeable character; his past haunts him still and his relationship with Emily is strong, though tentative.  Ben Stranger is another good character, a newspaper writer given a reprieve; Harold/Grubb is a complex and unique type of psychopath, whose conflict with his two personalities forms an important part of the plot.<br />Set in a rural West Virginia town, Bailey knows how to use blizzards and small town life effectively.<br />There are no real surprises here, but it's an entertaining journey and displays the writing talent of Mr. Bailey.	2004-02-16

It's more of a combination of books like \\"Turn of the Screw\\" \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" and \\"Bad Seed.\\"  Gresham is brilliant in the depth of characterization he gives to much of the cast:  the sexually confused Teddy who spends most of the novel mooning over his sensuous and mysterious cousin, Judith; David, the boy whose sexual love for Teddy leads to a tragic end; Teddy's brother Junior who becomes a man in an ill-starred love affair; and of course the tragic Togler family, the ghosts who haunt the lives of both Teddy and Judith.  There are some exquisitely tender moments of the innocence of youth, and a few plot twists in the end that make the story more palpable and real.<br />Gresham is a wonderful writer; the novel is slow paced, but in this type of work, it's inherent and necessary.<br />Not for die hard blood and guts horror fans, but a disturbing psychological adventure.	2004-02-15

Drawn out, unbelievable situations and meandering dialogue draw this book down.

The book seems long, long, long....so much of it is spent on teasing the reader with the dark secrets our characters hold.  But he overdoes it, even using redundant passages to keep us hooked, without any real payoff.  By the time the book reaches a point where something is really going on, you've had to test your own endurance levels to get there.  At what point does a reader have to admire a writer's command of language enough to forget you're yawning more than feeling the chills he obviously wants us to?  The characters are well drawn, but I found his choice of who to use for the final villain a little disconcerting.  Oh, well, variety is the spice of life.  I just didn't enjoy this book.	2004-02-08

While Tess manages to keep the reader braced for unexpected twists, Cook leads you to where you know it's going, and peoples it with some of the most uninteresting characters I've had the displeasure to spend time with.

It's like Cannell is showing how he panders with the upper crust celebrities.  Cute, but rather unbelievable.<br />The plot is straightforward, although Cannell doesn't have to let the reader know on every other page, how &quot;ugly and fat&quot; Herman Strockmire is, or how &quot;beautiful&quot; his daughter Susan is.  Judge Melissa King is too much of a villain to be believable, and the chimera aren't used enough to generate the suspense.

Moore knows his horror compatriates well, mirroring King, Koontz, McCammon, Little and Bradbury.  Without rehashing the plot, let me offer you my pros and cons on this both mesmerizing and disappointing novel.<br />Pros first:  Moore gives us a small town that seems to have all the elements of a small town.  Being xenophobic, they don't like newcomers, and only accept them on their own terms.  This gives our hero Mark Howell his first problem.  Moore has a keen understanding of a teenagers' psyche, although at times, his handling of the adult characters isn't quite as sharp.  Jennifer Howell is one of those we fail to truly understand, and by the end, when we realize her agenda, it seems unfair and out of sync.  Moore though does build some suspenseful scenes, and his imagining of the fairies is quite entertaining.  The way Moore handles friendship among the teens is commendable, and his allowing darker characters to come to a more affable personality is also rare and enjoyable.<br />My main disappointment with this novel is that Moore gives us a hero, Mark, who is really a victim of what happens and even after the possession begins, it's not Mark who's evil...it's the creatures that have molded him.  By the end of the novel, Mark and Cassie are relegated to supporting roles, and all of a sudden, Tyler (who is an enjoyable character) and Lisa (who is not) come out as heroes.  We put our stakes in Mark throughout most of the book, and then he is put to blame.  Also, the character of Jonathan Crowley seems too heartless and uncaring to really be the &quot;hero&quot; he is painted to be.  Oh, well, guess I'm just a little too particular ?<br />Anyway, this is a good involving book and despite my disappointments, was enjoyable to read.	2004-01-30

While Green shows his football background knowledge, its use merely distracts rather than enhances this story.  Luther Zorn is not a sympathetic character, and Green should be ashamed of how his book concludes.  While there is a satisfaction in how the killer gets his revenge, Green seems to forget all the innocent people murdered, and he lets the villain come across as some kind of avenging angel, thereby negating what has come before.<br />Not a bad novel, but nothing to rave about.	2004-01-28

Mooney's debut novel is a well-crafted, intelligent and disturbing thriller.  The hero Jack Casey is definitely a flawed one, but he's also multi-layered, sympathetic and brave.  Maurice Fletcher is also quite flawed, but his cool efficiency and participation in the hunt for the Sandman is quite forceful.  There are several breathtaking chases, some nerve-wracking suspense, and even though it verges on being ludicrous and unbelievable, Mooney writes so well it carries you right along with it.<br />One peeve, though:  late in the book we meet a character in a wheelchair named Matt; he's taken care of, but his friend Phil is never clearly explained.  An editor's faux pax???<br />Any way, I highly recommend this adrenaline charged thriller.	2004-01-26

Stracynzski's first novel, which he admittedly wrote because he wanted to read a novel like this one, is a mixed blend of horror, Indian legend and paranoia.

However, once the novel gets going, and it takes a while, you're hooked on who is going to get possessed next, and how will Eric defeat the demons?  I was disappointed at the ending in which the identity of the first through isn't revealed.<br />However, it is reminiscent in ways of SALEM'S LOT and THE STAND, and is a very interesting novel.	2004-01-25

In this offering, Masterton demonstrates a commendable mastery of his words and of his characterizations.<br />The novel starts out a little slowly, but builds into a disturbing and horrifying look at a very unusual serial killer.<br />Katie Maguire, the highest ranked woman in law enforcement in Ireland, is called in when the bones of eleven women are discovered in a farm.  Meanwhile, someone is killing young women in the same way.  These killings are EXTREMELY GRAPHIC and disturbing.  In a religious vein, Masterton obviously questions &quot;why bad things happen to good people.&quot;<br />At any rate, what goes from here is a vortex of interesting scenarios, and if you're astute, you won't have trouble figuring out who the person is trying to resurrect the demon Morgana.  I don't know whether I understand Masterton's lesbian subplot; it does seem out of place, but it's not overdone, but seems rather unnecessary.<br />However, who am I to criticize one of horror's masters?  It's definitely a page-turner, and recommended.	2004-01-24

JINN cooks...part RELIC, part DIE HARD, part BEOWULF, JINN Starts off with a bang and through 500 pages of admittedly small print, moves like a firecracker.  Delaney has a lot of the superb Matt Reilly in his fabulously staged action sequences, and some extremely eerie and spooky moments.  The scene that takes place in The Pit is one of the most frightening passages I've read recently.  Delaney takes us to St. Petersburg, to Bosnia, in a riveting and frightening explosion of unexpected violence.  Jefferson, McKenna and Brogan are fascinating characters, and there are some unexpected twists in discovering who the four demons are.  Delaney also blends the past and present in a stunning, harrowing manner.<br />This book is excellent for a debut, with a young capable writer who will hopefully outdo himself in future endeavors.<br />Good luck, Matthew!	2004-01-22

Tyler Bryant has just married idealistic and impressionistic Quinn.  It doesn't take long for her to suspect her husband in a series of hideous murders:  a teen shoots an Archbishop at her confirmation and then shoots herself; a teen brutally attacks two door to door religious men, and then kills himself; and on and on.  The sole factor that connects them:  they all played Practice Run.  Add a heroic FBI investigator; the maniac's imprisoned half-brother, and a stoic friend, and Quinn is off to tell the world.<br />There are some cliche scenes, some inane dialogue, but Racina knows how to hook his reader and keep them involved.  His books move fast, and I enjoy them.	2004-01-20

McGregor spends so much time rambling on about how each character feels being invisible to the point of where it's like come on, get back to the action.  What little action there is doesn't compensate for the long, unimportant passages.  Reni's character is especially whiny, and the character of Luis is so overboard, it's funny.

The relationships with his father, Jacob; his mother May; his sister Tom; his grandmother; the elderly Miss Maggie, and all interweave into a complex plot.  There is a point in the novel where the identity of the murderer becomes obvious, but it's so deftly interwoven, you forget until it is identified.

But in &quot;Black Water,&quot; the character who stays most indelibly in my mind is Archie Wildcraft.  Archie, an up and coming cop, with a seemingly ideal life, is thrown into a maelstrom of unbelievable proportions.<br />He's in bed with his wife after celebrating her 26th birthday.  While Gwen sleeps, he hears something in the living room..a rock has been thrown in their window.  Taking his gun with him, as any sensible cop would do, he goes outside, and is shot in the head by an unknown intruder.  We soon find out that his wife, Gwen, whom he sent into the bathroom to hide, has been brutally murdered, and all evidence points to a murder/suicide.<br />Archie doesn't die, though, and he becomes the prime suspect in the murder.  Parker risks credibility in using a frame in two consecutive novels, but it's Archie's plight that makes it work.  Archie miraculously pulls out, but his memory has been damaged, and even worse, and here's the key to what makes this novel so devastating, he can't feel emotions anymore.<br />Archie hears Gwen's voice talking to him, and in opposition to RED LIGHT, Merci believes in Archie's innocence, and strives to prove this and find the two Russian mob members who have done the deed.<br />The ending with Archie being a modern day Icarus is heartbreaking and tragic.<br />A brilliant book in its examination of Archie Wildcraft; like some reviewers, though, I think Parker lays it on too thick with Merci and her son.  It's not a plot driven device and only blemishes an otherwise marvelous book.	2004-01-14

Parker is a marvelous writer, deft at both plotting and character development.  And while I agree he's \\"somewhat softened\\" Merci, I still find her hard to like a hundred percent..and that's good in a way.  What she does to Mike McNally in this book only accentuates her driven psyche...she even seduces Mike to gain evidence against him.  Then she asks for his forgiveness.  It's a shame, I think.  I like Mike's character, and his involvement with the prostitute only proved that Merci was neglecting him in a big way.  You can have friendship with a member of the opposite sex, and if he found himself \\"falling\\" for her, he realized that she was no good for him, and he was never unfaithful to Merci.<br />Back to the plot, though.  Parker interweaves the two seemingly disparate cases together to come up with a somewhat surprising solution to the murders.<br />A complex, gritty novel.	2004-01-13

Having given us such classic t.v. shows as ROCKFORD FILES, A-TEAM, and WISEGUY, he knows how to write action scenarios, and fill them with almost cardboard characters that work only because they're in his books.  We have the renegade DOC agent, John Lockwood, divorced from his beautiful wife, separated from his sweet daughter; the beautiful, brilliant and lonely Karen Lawson, a victim of only doing what her father wanted, who finds herself paired with Lockwood; and the handsome dashing (think Johnny Depp) computer hacker who seeks revenge on the man who put him in jail (Lockwood).  Throw in the obscenely vulgar villain named Leonard Land/Rat/Wind Minstrel, who suffered abuse as a child from his religously fanatical mother, and you have the ingredients for this enjoyable diversion.<br />Toward the end, Cannell seems to make some incredulous things happen to hasten the plot, because if the two heroes are as bad off as they've been depicted up to this point, there is no way in hell they could do what they do at the end.  But, hey, let's have fun, popcorn, etc., and enjoy this dose of high-velocity fluff.	2004-01-10

The plotting is sharp, if a little muddled near the end; there are lots of twists and turns.  He evokes a real feel for the seventies, a decade in which his stardom shot to the top and left him somewhere in the middle by the time it was over.<br />So why only three stars?  I just didn't LIKE the book and it's self-serving, egotistical, devious, sexually depraved characters.  While K. O'Connor certainly is an interesting character, her sexual lusts and her ease in being duplicitous hardly makes her likeable.  In fact, there's no really likeable characters in this book, and who O'Connor ends up with is a real downer for me.<br />A case of brilliant writing, but a vacuous and empty feeling was all I was left with.	2004-01-09

Rollins can't quite come up to the amazing level of Matthew Reilly or Lincoln and Childs, but he nonetheless is pointed in the right direction.<br />What's right about the novel is the characterization of its two leads, Matt Pike and Jennifer, the ex-wife sheriff.  They have the essential heroic qualities, but maintain their human flaws as well.  Bane, the superdog, is right out of a Dean Koontz book, and the villains of the piece (of which there are many)offer little in the way of novelty.<br />Another flaw is the fact that our own US government is just as villainous as the Russians.  In this time of let's stay behind our government, Rollins' use of them as devious and covert echoes the lack of creative writing.  So many books paint us as villains, it would be nice if a writer would cut us some slack.<br />All in all, though, it's an enjoyable what if vehicle, and would make a great movie.	2004-01-07

At any rate, there have been ups and downs in the Alex Cross series, but BIG BAD WOLF has more than enough of good moments to validate the continuance of this series.<br />What makes this work is Patterson's trademark short chapters; his terse dialogue, and his understanding of Alex Cross and his family and friends.  The addition of Christine Johnson coming back to reclaim her son adds an additional emotional tension to the book.  Patterson gives Alex some good supporting characters in Monnie, the FBI computer hacker, who helsp tremendously; his long time friend John Sampson, who is going to be a father, and a nice array of despicable villains.  The Wolf?  Who is he...we have to wait until the next novel.  Typical of Mr. Patterson who so floored us when we find out who FBI agent Kyle Craig was.  Oh, yes, Kyle's in this one, too, as vile as ever.<br />I liked this book; for those of you who have given up on him, shame on you.	2004-01-03

The accident has left Joe with many physical and emotional scars; how he gets through these scars is the basis of this book.

For me, the fault lies in the overworking of the autistic young man, Shepherd.  So many scenes are drawn out to unreasonable lengths by the redundancy of not only Shep's dialogue, but you know that each scene will go on for a couple of pages and ultimately brother Dylan and friend Jilly will get what they want out of them.  Dean has come to be a writer who is getting too involved in his own skills.  He overwrites, not only his usual descriptive blabber, but in much of the dialogue.  There ARE some wonderful scenes, though:  Shep and Dylan revisiting the murder of their mother; Dylan helping out an old cowboy locate his long-missing daughter, and the climactic wedding scene.  They're very well done and if the rest of the book had matched this kind of writing, I would have been impressed.  Needless to say, it looks like &quot;The Moonlight Club&quot; may be coming?  If he can focus a little more on making a tighter narrative and not overdoing his characterization (as with Shep), he may return to his higher level of writing.	2003-12-17

She continues to resent teamwork, and now she finds herself madly in love with an Ethiopian Jew.  A disarmingly handsome nurse who helps her out when she finds the abandoned baby.  Again, Kellerman lets her religious fervor dominate.  What's odd about this particular romance is that obviously from Koby's own words, his relationship with Cindy is primarily physical.  He wants to have sex with her all the time; he also has dark moods that are never truly explained or resolved.  Combining the racial and religious problems fails to enliven this meandering romance.<br />Then we have this other plot where Rina is investigating the murder of her grandmother in 1930's Poland.  She goes all out to discover the truth, but when the novel ends, we have no further understanding of what really happened.<br />And perhaps the biggest disappointment is that even after the child abandonment, the hit and run, etc., the killers are characters who have had little time in the novel.  So who can really care?<br />I have read all of the series now and still maintain that \\"love/hate\\" relationship with Kellerman's books.  She might be better off just writing family tales of the usual marital and romantic woes, than trying to slide a mystery in.<br />Not the best of her series in the long run.	2003-11-24

Oh, yes Chris is definitely sadistic, egocentric, psychopathic, childish, brutal and conscienceless.  However, Kellerman has been smart enough to show his &quot;good&quot; side.  Maybe he obssesses and uses Terry and others to achieve his own goals, but somewhere in all the brooding good lucks, his buff body, there is a soul of a man abused as a child, reaching out to find someone to love.  His cruelty to Decker only masks his intense hate/love relationship.  The ending is quite unexpected, and obviously leaves room for Donatti's return.<br />Elsewhere, Kellerman has fleshed out Jonathan Levine more, and his relationship with Decker grows in admiration and respect.  The mystery actually gets overshadowed by the complexity of the relationships and the fiery Donatti.  Suffice to say, it's easy to see who the real culprits are...it's just a lot of fun getting there.<br />ONE OF THE BEST IN THE SERIES.	2003-11-20

Like a fellow reviewer, I'm finding myself with a &quot;love/hate&quot; relationship as far as Faye Kellerman's Rina/Peter Decker series.  For instance, Faye, who in the world was responsible for Rina's attempted carjacking---talk about loose ends!!!<br />Anyway, here Faye focuses on Cindy Decker, Peter's newly initiated rookie cop.  In previous novels, I have found Cindy's impetuosity and energy refreshing and likeable.  Boy, has she changed.  What words can describe her?  SNOBBISH.  KNOW IT ALL.  IMPETUOUS.  BITCHY.  MANIPULATIVE.  INSINCERE.  Hmmm...maybe not all the time, but these qualities tend to lessen one's admiration for her character.  Like when she goes to Belfleur to look up the people who invested in a sham property deal.  She finds one name right away and immediately assumes it's the only one...not thinking to look at the whole list!  Also, she acts like she doesn't want to fit in with her fellow cops, and the chauvinism of her fellow male cops is a little exaggerated and over used.<br />Rina's not in the book much this time, but she still comes across as super mom and super everything.  She doesn't seem to have any flaws now.  Also little daughter Hannah has turned into a whiny, spoiled brat.<br />The main problem, however, with this book is despite a couple of tense scenes, the book drags and one gets tired of all the landscape descriptions; what furniture is in any house or room, and also the romance between Scott and Cindy is way too impractical and unnecessary.<br />NOT A BAD BOOK, BUT SHE'S DONE BETTER (AND WORSE).	2003-11-17

After her last two books, I expected much more than JUPITER'S BONES delivers.  While the book focuses on one of those Jonestown cults, Kellerman wastes no time in assuming that anything outside the Jewish realm is fair game to the typical barbs and jokes.  While in this case, the barbs are justified, Kellerman's continued use of religious stereotypes and obvious religious prejudice, I still think Kellerman should focus more on her mysteries than her religious predilections.<br />In Ms. Kellerman's favor, she continues to develop her supporting characters, particularly Tom Webster, who is becoming one of my favorite characters as he is smart, witty, and intensely human.  Marge's character gets more attention, and although her actions regarding Vega are just too Pollyannish, she remains an enigmatic figure.  Why does she have trouble in her relationships?  Hmmm..the focus on Sammy and Jacob's problems is a nice touch, but they don't seem like real teenagers at all in Kellerman's hands.  They always do the right thing and when they start wandering away from their religious background, Rina harnesses them back in, not all that convincingly either.<br />Kellerman has remarkably good skills in her writing; this one's too formulaic to be one of her best, but it has moments of real brilliance.	2003-11-16

SERPENT'S TOOTH is one of the better novels in this series; her reduction of time spent on religious background and squabbles actually aids her in this one.  The first chapter is intriguing as Kellerman sets us up for what's about to happen by letting us know a little bit about some of the people in the trendy restaurant who are about to meet a fatal end.  Once the killer \\"kills himself,\\" it seems like an open and shut case, but where would the novel be if this was the case?  Decker is now more willing to accept the advice of his daughter, Cindy, who is about to enter the police academy; Rina once again goes behind Peter's back to give him some assistance; we learn more about some of the other detectives:  Webster, the southern transplant, is a likeable and a good addition; I haven't decided if I like Scott Oliver yet, what a chauvinist and ... fiend, but Kellerman is smart in giving us that sensitive side that indicates his main problem might be loneliness; Marge continues to be the lonely amazon woman--I think she's really in love with Peter?<br />Anyway, the cast of meanies in this one are despicable:  Jeanine Garrison, the daughter of two of the restaurant's victims, who has her own financial agenda; Sean Amos and Malcolm Carey, two vile teenagers; Joaquin, a rather nerdy teen, who is a champion Scrabble player; David Garrison, Jeanine's brother who has (there's one of these in each book it seems?) a drug problem, and winds up iced, too.<br />The whodunit isn't overly exciting, but the way Kellerman interweaves all these personalities makes for good reading for fans of this series.	2003-11-14

The voice of this novel is student Terry McLaughlin, a virginal Catholic girl, who finds herself tutoring a stud muffin with a somewhat colorful and enigmatic past, which includes the murder of his abusive father, and ties to his Mafia-family.  Chris Whitman is the boy, a handsome, charismatic youth who develops an obsession with Terry.  Problem is Chris is the chief suspect in the murder of his trashy girl friend.  When he confesses in order to protect Terry, Decker finds himself in an unusual kaleidoscope of inter-departmental intrigue and trying to justify Whitman's conviction.  Another powerfl presence in the book is Wanda Bontemp, a black cop, whose own prejudices and misconceptions have been her own private demons.<br />The story is well written, and Kellerman's religious preferences don't dominate the novel.<br />A good book in this up and down series.	2003-11-12

This time the double-edged mystery sends Peter and Rina to Israel to track down the sons of a wealthy diamond magnate and his wife.  Did the boys kill their parents?  Add to this, the search for a friend of Rina's from New York, who comes to California for a visit with her three children and then mysteriously vanishes as well---to Israel.  Add a cool ice queen named Kate Milligan, a shady partner named Shaul Gold, add a few other nasties and Kellerman sends her heroes off into a labyrinthine plot.<br />Kellerman's a good writer and as she progresses, she tries to focus more on plot and suspense, and not so much on Rina's faith.  It does seem surprising though that she manages to slight other religious beliefs while sanctifying her own?  Hopefully, as she progresses she'll take some clues from her husband Jonathan and write more substantial works.	2003-11-11

This time, Rina gives birth to their daughter, but in doing so, complications force a hysterectomy on her.  Decker gets involved in the kidnapping of an newborn infant who is sharing the nursery with his new daughter.  Cindy Decker is along with them this time, and decides to play detective, against her father's stern and chauvinistic wishes.  Marge Dunn continues her slide into more adamant cynicism, and that's just for starters.<br />While this one is not one of Kellerman's best, it maintains some interest due to the complexity of the mystery and the discovery of key facts.  The character of Tandy stretches the imagination a bit, and her fate at the end, along with nurse Marie Bellson is not one of comfort or resolution.<br />Still, I find myself initrigued with the series and even with their faults, Rina and Pete are a strong couple.	2003-11-09

What other book could spend so much time describing how to do everything you need to know on a sailboat.  This should be called SAILING FOR DUMMIES, it's so full of self-congratulatory knowledge.  Most writers whose knowledge of certain things manage to make this knowledge a key part of the book and interesting.  Sorry to say, Garrison comes up short on this one.<br />That's not the only problem.  This plot is so unbelievable, and the pacing is sluggish to say the least.  First of all, we have this Jim Leighton character who is very narcissistic about his unbelievably muscular body.  How many times does Garrison exploit this by calling him Mr. Muscles etc., etc.  He becomes very boorish even as his role as the novel's hero and focal point increases.  Add Will Stark, the sometime hero, sometime villain, and you get another portrait of an ego-driven, self-centered fool who has something somebody really wants.  Then add the buffoonish villains who haven't got the sense to send out airplanes or helicopters to find out where young Leighton and Stark are, you get a novel so unfocused and leaden, it's hard to get through it.  Not to mention Shannon, Leighton's sweetheart who is stupid enough to join him on his mission.<br />And let's get real.  The sailboat sets out of Barbados, supposedly on its way to South America. Then the villains intercept them and now it's off to South Africa.  We get to South Africa and then we're expecting them to return to Florida.  But no, Stark insists they go on to Rio De Janeiro.  Then Stark goes and dies, leaving Jim to fend for himself, who then decides he needs to go to South America, only to have to divert to the Falkland Islands and then into the Arctic area, where he fights not only the villains but icebergs and snowstorms.  Then once that battle is finished, it's back to South Africa to retrieve this mysterious computer chip.<br />I swear, I was sealogged by the time the book ended.<br />Garrison has delivered before in &quot;Fire and Ice&quot;; but this one is a real clunker and I'd file it in Davy Jones locker without hesitation.rrison has delivered before in &quot;Fire and Ice&quot;; but this one is a real clunker and I'd file it in Davy Jones locker without hesitation.	2003-11-08

They can find themselves in strained emotional conflicts over simple things; Peter sometimes seems so macho it's annoying, and Rina is so Jewish it's distracting.  At least in this one, the plot focuses more on the mystery than the personal religious crises.  Faye is good with her dialogue, and in this one she develops a few unexpected twists.  However, I concur with one reviewer who felt the book just ended without any real closure.  Who did kill who?  And Pete's over-protection of his now pregnant wife foreshadows what type of new father he'll be.  But to Kellerman's credit, I keep reading.  Marge Dunn is also becoming a little too cynical and sarcastic, which is sad, because she used to be a lot more likeable.	2003-11-08

He's egocentric, rude, boorish, overbearing, humorless, a racist, and a heart as cold as a Connecticut winter.  Allander Alsatia, the &quot;villain&quot; is equally abhorrent and definitely deranged.  Agent Travers (no first name) is a beautiful FBI agent who finds herself partnered with Jade and their relationship is belligerent to say the least.  Although there's one love scene that's hilarious in its &quot;abruptness&quot;.  So what makes Hurwitz's novel so entertaining?  It's bullet-paced; some of the scenarios bristle with excitement, and one can only laugh at the ineptness of this so-called &quot;super tracker.&quot;  Add the mysterious Wonton (I wonder if his last name is Soup?), who is as mysteriously evil as Donald Plesance's Blofeld in &quot;You Only live Twice.&quot;..and you have one seriously warped book.  But it's fun, and I found myself eager to get to the ending...woops!  What a strange, strange ending....no closure.  But since one doesn't really care for Jade, his future isn't all that exciting.  Anyway, this is Hurwitz's first book and he's gone on to more critical acclaim, although as far as enjoyment goes, this may be his best?<br />IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A MINDLESS IF GRAPHIC READ, THIS ONE'S FOR YOU!	2003-11-05

This 4th in the series of Decker and Lazarus is weighed down by Kellerman's insistence on focusing once again on Jewish tradition and its place in the newlywed's lives.  While Kellerman has entertained in the previous three novels, in spite of this what I consider weakness, this novel is just not exciting.  The entire middle is spent interviewing and moaning over Noam's disappearance, and of course, more Jewish lore and tradition that has become redundant and plot-suffocation.  Faye needs to adopt more of her husband Jonathan's panache for good plots and a faster pace.  This one bogs down and its resolution is unsatisfying.  I've obtained her whole series and plan to continue to read, I just hope in the future books, she makes plot, suspense and intrigue more important than the obvious love she has for her family tradition.  And hopefully Peter and Rina will start treating each other as adults rather than spoiled children trying to outdo each other.<br />NOT RECOMMENDED UNLESS YOU'RE INTO THE SERIES.	2003-11-05

While marvelously written scenes evoking the 19th century Edinburgh frame this novel, much of its substance gets a little too esoteric.  Evelyn Todd's character is certainly multi-faceted, and her powerful imagination certainly breeds a rather contemptuous killer.  I agree with a fellow reviewer's comments that the overlapping of the investigations by the police and the freelance professor and his friend does bog the novel down somewhat.  The transference of Satan from body to body stretches the imagination a little too much and we end up with a novel that doesn't know where it wants us to go.  O'Neill is definitely talented, but I was expecting something a little more straightforward and accessible.<br />RECOMMENDED FOR ITS LITERARY MERITS.	2003-11-03

While this is one of his better books of recent years, my main problem with it was its lack of originality, or should I say it's predictability.  Did you ever doubt that Mark would end up with Lily?  Did you ever doubt that Ronnie would be caught?  The ending is new-age mysticism and doesn't really satisfy my idea of closure.  Tom Passmore's character is wasted and Tim Underhill's is too narrative in substance.  Phil Underhill is completely unlikeable and I just never felt thrilled.  I wish I could say it's a classic like fellow reviewers but for me, it was a moderately entertaining spook story.	2003-11-02

Reformed drug addict Dr. Adrian Lancaster is drawn into a maze of murder and betrayal, and is ultimately set up for crimes he has not committed.  Holden makes us feel for Lancaster, especially when he &quot;falls off the wagon.&quot;  Frank Brandon's character is immensely appealing, as is fellow cop Ellen Burns.  The character of Storm Summers is the typical femme fatale and her true identity is prophesied early on, but what happens from there is unique and twisty.  Julian Kline, the DEA agent , is also an interesting character.  Flashbacks aid in helping the reader figure things out along with Lancaster and Brandon.<br />A nice, tidy psychological study of hope, despair and revenge.<br />RECOMMENDED.	2003-10-28

Owen Parry's narrative, in Jones' first person narrative, sparkles with wit, sharp perception of the time and place he shares, and a knack for interesting and well-developed characters.  While a murder mystery, it doesn't focus all of its time on the killer, and the perpetrator is easily discovered early on.  It is Jones' dedication in exposing the killer that Parry shines.  Jones is moral, sensitive, and extremely dedicated.  He hates the war, but feels he owes it to his new country (he's originally from Wales), and his wife and young son, as well.  His wife, Mary's, advice about the crime is sharp and Parry gives us a couple whose love and devotion is obvious, even though Mary has only one scene in the novel.<br />Parry also gives us some great supporting characters in Dr. Tyrone, Jones' unexpected ally; Mrs. Schutzengel, the German boarding house manager, with her dedication to a German revolution and her keen cooking skills; Molloy, a former friend of Jones who comes through when needed; and even Abraham Lincoln himself in a marvelous cameo at the book's close.  Matthew Cawber, a potential villain, has a wonderful scene with Jones in which he powerfully states his innocence in the murder of the saintly Andrew Fowler.<br />All in all, a great start; am looking forward to reading the additional two books in this well-constructed series.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2003-10-27

Cook has become the master of those &quot;flashback, here's what happened&quot; books, and this one is his best.  It is almost Dickensian in its use of coincidence and happenstance events, each leading to a tragic denouement.  The interrogators, Pierce and Cohen, are richly drawn, flawed characters, each with secrets to live with and deal with.  There is a sense of ominous tragedy in each of these characters; Thomas Burke, the Chief of Police, has his own tragedy:  his vagrant/dope addicted son is dying; we have the characters of Eddie and Terry--garbage collectors.  Eddie feels guilty because he has to work the night shift while his daughter is at home sick; Terry is the boss' son and doesn't want to even be associated with Eddie; there are so many characters whose twisted lies and deceptions lead them irrevocably toward doom.  And of course, we have Jay Smalls, the man the police think killed little Kathy Lake in the park.  Did he?<br />The resolution of this is mouth-dropping, but logical.  My only reservation is why was Jay Smalls like he was?  What happened to him when he was a youth?  Cook lets us make our own decisions on this one.<br />This, however, is one heck of a read!	2003-10-26

Ms. Due's prose is polished and well written.  Most of her characters achieve a good realization, and her book seems well planned and focused.  However, as suspense works go, the suspense comes in small doses and seems protracted and manipulative.  The strongest presence in the book is the teaming of Corey Hill and Sean Leahy.  Their friendship seems strongly bound by their &quot;differences&quot; and in their doom-making &quot;ritual&quot; that unleashes the terrifying baka.  The book is cinematic in its structure, and there are few really frightening sequences.  However, Ms. Due virtually negates her ghost story by its &quot;miracle&quot; ending.  I like happy endings, but this one is so contrived and ridiculous, it leaves a bad taste.<br />Due is obviously a talented writer, and her skills are evident.

Author Siegel travels territory familiar to both James Patterson and Harlan Coben, but in his own way, fashions a more believable plot.  Its hero, Charles Schine, is a normal everyday working stiff who finds his life unbelievably changed when he oversleeps one morning and has to take a later train.  He meets a Catherine Zeta-Jones type of beauty named Lucinda; he starts an affair with her; loses a major ad account; and that's just the beginning.  Although not as devastating as the characters in Scott Smith's brilliant A SIMPLE PLAN, his lies and betrayal leads to horrifying consequences.  I found myself liking the supporting character of Winston, the mailroom guy who trades sports trivia with Charles; Deanna, Charles' wife, who he should have had more faith in.  You'll have to form your own opinions about Dexter, Vasquez, and the mysterious Lucinda.  Suffice to say, the book is a real page turner, with several plot twists and a very satisfying ending.

The prime issue in this one is gun control, and Patterson's tale captures the complicated issues in a straightforward, terse narrative.  The shifting focuses keep the novel from becoming too stagnant, while there are times where it seems Patterson pads the book with a little too much personal philosophical meanderings.  However, they do not tremendously overcome the power of this strong novel.<br />President Kerry Kilcannon finally asks his long-time lover Lara Costello to be his wife.  Kerry and Lara remain strong, flawed, but extremely committed individuals, and they both face tremndous obstacles to marital bliss within three days of their wedding.  The shocking murder of six innocent people by an abusive husband sends the Kilcannon's world into an intense and grief-stricken whirl.  Further strengthening the president's intense desire for better gun control, this event leads him and Lara into some difficult and compromising situations.<br />The supporting characters of which there are many are developed with care and we become familiar with the different personalities.  Chad Palmer, one of Kerry's best friends, becomes both a hero and a villain, and his quandaries are well depicted.  Sarah Rush, the lawyer from a previous Kilcannon novel, returns given the harsh task of handling a wrongful death client in an effort to bring down a powerful SSA (Sons of the Second Amendment).  Lara's family is capably drawn and the subsequent tragedy is heart-wrenching.<br />Patterson has done a tremendous amount of research in this book, and if you're previously &quot;put off&quot; by political novels, Patterson's stories have a tense dramatic core which makes for informative and compelling reading.<br />Overall, a fitting finale to the Kilcannon series; will RNP now go back to his defense attorneys and murder cases?  Who knows, but Patterson will be heard from, I'm sure.	2003-10-16

Nicholson takes so much time in overexposing his characters that you just want him to get to the good stuff.  The religious overtones are so zealously drawn that they are all religious fanatics, especially Bill and Nettie.  My God, people, this is the 21st century; nobody, even religious zealots, are this clueless.  Bill's over the top finale with the demented and &quot;converted&quot; Armfield Blevins is a real hoot!

The plot is labyrinthine, opening with a gruesome murder by David Moses, who also turns out to be Nightmare, a deranged psychotic who is seeking to kill the First Lady because of a scorned love affair years ago.<br />Add some vicious government agents, an almost romance with the First Lady and Bo, and some tense suspense scenes, you've got a rip roaring conspiracy novel.  Sometimes Bo seems a little less than what you'd expect in a hero (he's always getting beat up), but he is human and that makes him engaging.  Krueger's President Clay Dixon evolves from a rather self-centered ass to a really good president during the course of the novel, so that's unusual...if a little incredible.  But, hey, fiction is fiction, right?<br />A good book and I am anxiously awaiting more from Mr. Krueger, maybe both Cork and Bo?	2003-09-30

Adolescent pranks instigate revenge and so on when they become adults.  The opening sequence involving the initiation rites for nasty Whitey Dobbs is tense, chilling and quite well done.<br />Once the boys grow up, though, it becomes a Twilight Zonish nightmare, with Whitey obviously out for some nasty revenge.  Dobbs' character is effectively nasty, and the heroics of Piper Blackmoore and Dean Truman are appropriately chivalrous.  However, by the time we realize what's happening, Brown falls into the trap of trying to explain time travel, and gets lost in his own revelations.  But taken as a sci-fi creepfest, it works and Brown does well with developing his characters and the frightening scenarios.  Brown's second novel is actually a little better than 24/7, and I think once he finds his &quot;voice,&quot; he'll be a better writer.	2003-09-12

Amazingly, Gruber's first novel demonstrates his skills with the use of words.  In my opinion, too many words.  I found the whole inclusion of Jane Doe's journal not only vague, confusing and rambling, but boring.  The narrative part of the novel, however, was spellbinding in its own way and I really liked the characters of Jane Doe, Paz and Barlow.  However, the invasion of the journal entries, merely served to deflect the suspense of the novel, and does anyone really want to know all those different African luminaries?  If a writer does this to show off his research abilities, this is unpardonable.  I want to be informed of things necessary for the plot, but there is so much hoodoo and funny words, I found myself yawning, when I should have felt the terror the rest of the book so hauntingly portrays.  Hopefully next time out Gruber's &quot;literary thriller&quot; will be at least a little more literate.	2003-09-12

It's sometimes frustrating to see how some reviewers sometimes spend so much time worrying about some of the technical accuracies in a book.  Just sit back and enjoy the ride.  Martini is in fine form in this nail-biting thriller.  The characters of Joselyn Cole and Gideon Van Ry, in particular, are easily identifiable and likeable.  Dean Biedel/Thorn is also an irreprehensible villain.  Even though one can identify with Scott Taggart's overwhelming sense of loss, and agree with him on the ineffectiveness of our government, it does not condone his actions in killing innocent people.  Written not long after the Oklahoma/McVeigh incident, CRITICAL MASS feeds on our fears of terrorism, that have even been more prominent since 9/11.<br />I liked this book a lot; it's ending is somewhat sad, but in light of all that goes on, appropriate.

It reminds me a lot of Sidney Sheldon's forays, but Martini's brisk pace and innate sense of plot and characterization propel this novel into higher ground.  The plot revolves around an author/lawyer who after several misfires in writing finds she's written a hit---a big, money-making bestseller.  Only problem is, she's an over-40 woman, not incredibly beautiful, and she knows her past flops will prevent any publisher from wanting the book no matter how good it is.  She creates a pseudonymn, Gable Cooper, as the author and then sets out to find a handsome hunk to &quot;play the role.&quot;  In steps incredibly gorgeous hunk Jack Jermayne, a perfect fit to play the role.  But, what have we here:  murders of author's friend, ex-husband and her friends' vicious ex-husband start to point evidence that Jack may not be what he seems??  Hmm..in typical cinematic fashion, the author flees for her life to seek help from her long-time friend, Spencer.<br />The climax is appropriately suspenseful and the little &quot;twist&quot; at the end satisfying.<br />A fun, involving tour de force for Mr. Martini.	2003-09-07

Bronson's DEATH WISH movies are taken to new heights in this book by 29 year old Hurwitz.  The opening is like a thunderbolt.  Rarely does a book start off with such a devastating beginning; I instantly felt great empathy with Tim Rackley and his wife, Dray.  We've all heard of those cases where a criminal gets off due to legal technicalities revolvlng around miranda rights, improper search, etc.  Some of the most devastating scenes in this book are the ones in which Tim and Dray find their marriage falling apart in trying to handle the grief and vast emptiness in losing their only daughter.  When Tim is given the opportunity to kill the known perpetrator, he relents, hoping that a supposed accomplice can be weeded out.  From there on, Tim's life turns inside out, and as he joins this vigilante team called the Commission, he finds that there's not such a satisfying feeling in playing God.  The twins, Mitchell and Robert, start out wacko, then you end up feeling sorry for them, and then they go ballistic, ending in a tense and suspenseful confrontation.  While reading, you know what Tim and the Commission is doing is wrong, but you still want them to succeed.  When Tim realizes what has happened to him, he tries to back out, and the fireworks start.<br />Even though the ending is a little unrealistic, it fills the need to exonerate without condoning Tim's actions.<br />A very good book, and I Highly recommend it.	2003-09-06

Martini's knowledge of the legal system and his ability to explain things in laymen's terms helps this tale move feverishly along.  Although I spotted the real culprit early on, it still held me spellbound to see how Madriani is going to get his client, a former lover, off the hook and out of the gas chamber.  Speaking of which, the opening prologue in the gas chamber, is chilling and disturbing.<br />What sets Martini's books above so many other of the genre is his impeccable characterization.  His characters, even some of the minor ones, come across realistic and human.  I know I will spend many more nights exploring the life of Madriani and his fellow legal eagles.<br />RECOMMENDED.	2003-09-03

We never really understand what happened to his marriage, suffice to say his wife is a hypocritic flirt and his son, Rhett, an insufferable wimp.  Roy ends up participating in one of those Civil War re-enactments and from there the story goes into a mind-boggling maze of ambiguities and unbelievable twists and turns.  This might have worked if there had been some element of true suspense; however, Abrahams pokes along, losing character and plot development and an ending that comes out of nowhere.<br />Abrahams, the good writer he is, should have left this one alone.<br />NOT RECOMMENDED.	2003-09-03

He has once again developed some rich, sympathetic, vile, and interesting characters, and set them in a time of superstition and ignorance.  The lead character, Matthew, is a fine hero, a twenty year old whose quest for truth and justice leads him on a harrowing attempt to save Rachel Howarth, a woman accused of witchcraft.  Matthew's relationship with the magistrate is many-leveled, and touching in its candor and strength.  The assorted villagers, including the wealthy Biddell, the arthritic Johnstone; the cunning Winston, and the wonderful Mrs. Neeling and Goode, are all well penned.  Even the uprorariously named Exodus Jerusalem goes beyond the cliched fanatical preachers.  The ratcatcher is a nasty little creation, and the intricate webbing of plot and circumstance are up to McCammon's standards.  However, this book is a little too long, and rambles on, at times diminishing the story's inherent mysticism and suspense.  Its' rare to get &quot;bored&quot; with a McCammono book, but I found myself at times wanting him to get on with the plot and stop all the inner-discord ramblings and it felt as though McCammon was stretching to find a way to end it.  The identity of the true villain is surprising, but almost seems forced.  Ouch, I hate to say negative things about Robert's books.  I've now read them all and find him to be one of our finest fantasy/horror/thriller writers.  This one just overstays its welcome a little bit, but other than that, I can heartily recommend it.  It's a well written, if wordy, novel.	2003-09-01

Only this is much better, and is one of his liveliest and entertaining works.<br />As usual, Robert peoples his story with a vast array of characters, and embroils them in a frightening battle against STINGER, an alien being who remains ominously veiled through most of the book.  But we have:  a little girl who is seemingly possessed by the spirit of a benevolent alien whose spacecraft has plummeted to earth---her parents are placed in the agonizing realization that if anything happens to the alien force, they may lose their daughter; we have rival gangs, Anglos vs. Hispanics, that become key participants in the ultimate battle; we have a sheriff who is being bought by a nasty big shot; in fact, in STINGER you got it all.  And McCammon uses his superior story telling voice to involve you and have you glued to the page, and cheering for the heroes, and hissing at the villains.  The revelation of STINGER's true form is awesome.<br />A GREAT READ.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2003-08-23

One can compare him to King or Koontz, but Robert surpasses them in his rich narratives; his understanding of human strengths and weaknesses; and his uncanny sense of plot development.  Not to mention his diversity.<BR>In this sci-fi alien adventure, McCammon takes us to the town of Inferno, appropriately named for its hellish geographical locale, and the burning hate of some of its townspeople.<BR>The &quot;good&quot; alien takes over a little girl's body, and the bad alien comes and he,,,,well...read to find out just what he does.  Beautifully written, with enough action and suspense to fill three books, &quot;Stinger&quot; stands as a representation of the creative genious of Robert McCammon.

Unfortunately, his laconic, laid back style hinders the suspense in this novel.  Charley's back (from &quot;Tidewater Blood&quot;), and his character is not one of my favorites.  Although he was done wrong in the first book by his own family, his retreat into a fantasy, anchorite's world only makes him irritating.  His desire to leave the world behind, live in the wild and avoid people may be idealistic but still unrealistic, too.  He's hooked up with Blackie, a woman with a criminal record, and his relationship with her forms a strong foundation for what drives a lot of the story.  The mystery surrounding the mysterious death of Aunt Jessie takes a back seat to Charley's own obstinance and lack of perception.  His sudden act of infidelity only shows how shallow he can be, and his decision to keep it from Blackie leads to the inevitable dissolution of their relationship.  It doesn't take long to figure out the culprits in this one.<br />Although not an exceptional book, Hoffman's skills make it one worth reading; let's hope he picks up the pace in future novels.	2003-08-15

And the most terrifying aspect of this well-written, fast-paced shocker, is that we the audience are what makes the shows successful.  And in this one, the audience tunes in and votes--not merely to exile the person from the island---but to decide who should DIE.  (Death comes from a designer virus that kills in a horribly ebola-like fashion).  There a lot of subplots, but some really interesting characters including the seemingly unheroic Tyler Thorn.  His newsphotographer/reporter role feeds the reader with the solution to many of the puzzles.  The islanders themselves are stereotypical, balancing between the likeable (Dana, Justin and Nerine) and the despicable (Foster, Brandon, Renee).

While not quite as fast paced as some of his earlier Special X novels, the story is interesting, and even though the identity of the Goth is no real surprise, it does have its twists.

Kristen is almost as bad, she falls for anything; Maggie is a Jekyll-Hyde lesbian with more teeth than a comb; Nicole is a self-centered and murdering golddigger; Chris Daniel is a cop with no sense of humor and some of the stiffest dialogue ever written.<br />While the ending does pull a good surprise, it's torture getting there.<br />NOT RECOMMENDED.	2003-07-22

Giles Blunt has written the kind of novel many mystery writers would \\"kill\\" for...Tony Hillerman even admits it.<br />What makes this such a great book is the development of the characters:  John Cardinal, a good man but not necessarily a good cop; Lise Delorme, a special forces internal investigator who is partnered with Cardinal to find out if he is on the take; Edie Somas, a homely, love-starved woman who turns to crime and evil to make up for her loneliness; Eric Fraser, a merciless and cruel killer, who uses Edie to help him attain his goals; there are so many interesting and complex characters in supporting roles, it's impossible to single them all out.<br />Blunt creates an atmospheric of unbelievable depth; one can feel the frigid environment, see the breaths of the characters.<br />Dark and disturbing, it is still a tremendous first novel for this talented Candian writer.

The hero, E.L. Pender, continues to be an unconventional hero, overweight, balding, and not someone who stepped out of GQ.  His replacement, Linda Abbruzzi, is likewise likeable, considering she has a life threatening disease and the FBI doesn't want her around.  Add phobic Dorie Bell as a mask-fearing heroine, and you've got the setup for a tasty thriller.<br />Unfortunately, the sum is not as good as the parts.  The villain, Simon Child, is nasty enough, and his relationship with his Down Syndrome sister Missy, is touching, yet repulsive.  What hurts the book, I think, is that instead of a tense whodunit, it becames an example of police procedural, and let's see how long we can keep these people tucked away in the basement.  Pender's romance with Dorie sometimes gets in the way of the action.  Child's reunion with his childhood buddy Nelson Carpenter, is also drawn out to the point of losing its momentum.  Although the deaths we share are gruesome and nerve-wracking, they are so coldly presented, they manage to lose some of their impact.<br />And Nasaw missed a great opportunity to finish off his villain.  Way late in the book, Dorie remembers what Simon is afraid of--after all, they met a convention for phobics, which he put together to suit his dastardly purpose.  Why didn't Nasaw use this fear in the end?<br />Oh well, I don't mean to sound too negative.<br />It's a good book that could have been better.<br />RECOMMENDED.	2003-07-13

The book is way too long and filled with too many flamboyant descriptions and attempts at satire..a little bit of the satire would have been enough, but the book reeks with it.  Koontz has sabotaged this book with his \\"over-writing.\\"<br />However, if you can strain through all the superflous flowery narrative, you'll find a great story and some strong characters in security chief Ethan; the precocious Frik; and the staunch detective, Hazard.  The villain, Corky, is way over the top but deliciously evil, to say the least.  Unlike most Koontz books, there is no strong female presence in this novel; and why, oh why, must EVERY hero have a dead wife or fiance haunting him?  This must be the fifth book in a row that the poor hero is mourning his lost love.  Koontz is a great writer overall and I've read almost all of his books, and they've all been meritorious in one way or another.  Fans will like this, and the ending is sufficiently upbeat, considering all our heroes have to go through.  It's interesting, too, how \\"The Face\\" of the title is not who you might think it is.  Check out the last scene in the elevator.<br />All in all, it's a ponderous read, but I still recommend it---it's better than a lot of other pretentious [garbage] out there!	2003-07-11

The plot has been examined in other reviews, so I'll stick with what really makes this one such a tour de force.<br />First of all, the characterization of Teddy Daniels is incredible.  Haunted by the untimely death of his wife, his own self-destruction seems imminent and his quest for revenge unquenchable.<br />But ponder on the intense atmosphere Lehane creates, especially during the catastrophic hurricane that sweeps the island; the lost soulds of the inmates; the disturbing dreams haunting Teddy; the mysterious disappearance of his only ally; the appearance of a female in a cave.  Lehane establishes quite an aura of suspense, wonder, and mystery.  Go back and read the prologue and see if you can find anything in there to prepare you for the jawdropping climax; read the last chapter again to see if you can determine what happens; think about the white material with the gleam of metal.<br />This is a thinking man's thriller; but it is full of incredibly suspenseful scenarios.<br />Undoubtedly, Dennis Lehane is at the top of his craft, and we readers are to be thankful for such an original voice in the world of whodunits!<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2003-07-08

He's a rich cop, sure, but he has strong family and moral values, and he still goes to church and prays to God for assistance.<br />Six years ago, Voort did something to really tick somebody off, cause now they're killing people and leaving notes that blame Voort.  His superiors want to know what Voort did and why this killer is accusing him.<br />Wendell Nye, the villain of the piece, is one strange dude, and even when you find out what happened to him those six years ago, it still doesn't seem to justify his actions.  Even though his victims are villainous in their own right.<br />However, the book moves extremely well, and the climax is quite good.  Poor Voort..he now has his widowed sister-in-law after him, and he's reconciled with Camilla.  Their bantering is a humorous respite in the murderous atmosphere.<br />A very good novel.

Known for their expertise in characterization, unusual plot, and climactic action, Preston and Child take us on a journey into a little town in Kansas.  The murders are grotesquely described, and an atmosphere of menace and terror permeate the book; their writing style is both interesting and imaginative.  Pendergast is as always an intriguing if somewhat frustrating hero.  Corrie Simpson is the latest in teen-age misfits who aid our heroes.  Most of the locals are typical rednecks, but still have their own little traits that make them unique:  Tad, the deputy, is one of them; and Winifred, the innkeeper and cave lady, are others.  The references to Wren and the cabinet of curiosities, while interesting in that we know another novel must be coming, are distracting to this plot and serve no real purpose.  The climax in the cave is way too long, and repetitious.  But the real letdown is that Preston and Childs have taken a plot device that has been in countless novels, and therefore, you know who the villain is, if you've ever read a certain Koontz novel, or several others that have used this.  While it has a unique twist at the end, I would have thought these talented writers would have come up with a better solution.<br />Not a bad read by any means; it entertains; it's just not up to par with their earlier works.<br />RECOMMENDED.  WITH RESERVATIONS.	2003-07-03

Alas and alack, it appears there are TWO serial killers working together.<br />As we come to know the two villains in flashbacks, Billingham weaves a tightly constructed tale of a warped love, and it's disastrous results.<br />There are some strong supporting characters in Billingham's novels, and they help move the twisting plot along to a heart-stopping climax in a schoolyard.

Marc Seidman is a strong lead, and ably supported by his ex-girlfriend Rachel; his best friend, Lenny; and the loveable biker in the book's last third.  Lydia, the former child-star turned psycho, is a real Cruella deville for the new millenium, as is her sidekick.  They are ruthless, cold blooded, and Lydia's bizarre turn at the end is one of those that make you wanna strangle her!!!!<br />At any rate, the mystery is mysterious; the suspense is plentiful and the tragic loss of love and friendship is touching.<br />A great read!<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.<br />WHEN'S THE NEXT MYRON COMING, HARLEN????	2003-07-03

The characters of Earl, Jolene's ex-stud, Miles the lawyer and Allan the doctor are also very well developed.  Of course, Hank Sommer comes across very sympathetic, too, as he watches the people around him plot his demise.<br />Broker is a fun, no-nonsense hero, and since I haven't truly met his wife, Nina, I couldn't relate well to his marital plight...but what the heck??<br />THIS IS A GREAT BOOK..HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2003-06-26

Not a fan of those \\"noirish\\" novels of the forties, I wasn't sure what to expect from Diehl in this one.  However, it is a stunning work, filled with excellent characterizations, true plot twists, and some excellent scenarios.<br />We start the novel out with Brodie Culhane, a young man given a new life by a wealthy landowner in turn of the century California.  Brodie becomes our hero, ending up fighting in World War I, surviving and returning to his home to become the sheriff.<br />Next, we have Zeke Bannon, another policeman in the 40's, who investigates a murder that leads him to the domain of Sheriff Culhane, who is now planning on running for governor.<br />How could our hero from the first part of the book be such a corruptible character in the 40's.<br />That's what makes this novel so complex and interesting.

In reading several of Klavan's books over the years, I have found him to be both original and derivative; challenging and pedestrian; engaging and boring.  His best works, \\"True Crime,\\" \\"Don't Say a Word\\" and \\"The Animal Hour\\" worked on all levels; \\"Corruption\\" doesn't fully satisfy this reader.<br />I agree with Robert Beveridge's review in that the last chapter is definitely not traditional in wrapping up the many plot developments.  While this may be an \\"artistic\\" achievement, it doesn't satisfy the reader in at least wrapping up some of the story; after all, isn't that why we read this book in the first place?<br />Klavan develops some strong characters, flawed and imperfect, such as Sally and Sid; Ernie and Chase; Vince Scotti, Teddy; Cindy, etc.  Sid's betrayal of his wife, Emily, is handled very expertly, although one can't figure out how he can love both women so deeply.<br />The mystery of which there is little is never really solved; what happens to all these people?

Reacher is the incredible Hulk without the green skin; he's Superman without the cape; he's Conan the Barbarian for the twenty-first century; he's destined to become a movie star.  (Hugh Jackman would be a good choice).  At any rate, they don't come much bigger or bolder or tougher than Jack Reacher.<br />This man continues to be an anchorite, hiding from the world, taking on different jobs that he somehow falls into.  This time he's out to nail a man he thought he had killed ten years earlier; a man who cold-bloodedly murdered a woman he cared deeply about---Dominique.  The flashbacks to this time work well interlaced with Reacher's current dilemman.  He's got the FBI behind him, but \\"off the record\\" as the FBI [messed] up when they sent one of their agents in undercover.<br />I like Reacher, though--even though he's sometimes extremely unemotional, he has his tender moments; I also like the return of Roy Lindell, a character from previous novels, whose presence allows us to see a more human side of Reacher.<br />This is a punishing book, filled with despair, violence, and some tense scenes.

Diehl, who I found so enjoyable in his Martin Vail series, goes back to another time, and leads the reader on a journey of the heart and soul.  He has two strong leads in Brodie Culhane and Zeke Bannon, and by the time these two collide, it's hard to decide who you want to root for.  This is because Diehl builds such a strong character in Brodie, that you identify with him early in the book.  When he's older and running for governor, it's hard to believe he's corrupt.<BR>A well written \\"noir\\", but something \\"moir,\\"...a heartfelt thriller.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2003-06-20

However, it's still a pretty potent serial killer thriller.  Nasaw gives us \\"Casey\\" a serial killer who has been murdering strawberry blondes for ten years, and is the prey of a rather ruffled FBI agent, E. L. Pender.  Pender is a great character, flawed with his personal appearance, and his sometimes loose cannon tactics.  But he is immensely likeable and his determination to prove that Casey is the serial killer he has hunted is admirable.  As usual, the rest of the FBI agents are portrayed as bureaucratic buffoons; the local law enforcement is rather ineffective, but Pender's quest is intense and undaunting.<br />Irene Cogan, the lovely doctor, who is kidnapped by the malicious \\"Casey\\" has a lot of spit and vinegar, yet her inexplicable attraction to Casey tends to mitigate her psychological expertise.<br />And then, here's Casey..a vile, inhumane, sociopathic killer who has so many personalities it's hard to keep up with.  And who is the dominant one?  Is it the charming lothario Christopher; the abused child Lyssy, or perhaps the self-proclaimed \\"control unit,\\" Max?<br />And what of the scarred Miss Miller---isn't she a rather vile character herself?  The two characters are the best villains in recent serial killer fiction.<br />By the time the novel ends, there is some question as to who really is in charge of \\"Casey's\\" body....is Irene so \\"dumb\\" (I hate to use that word, but what else..?) that she really falls for Max's final charade?<br />I'll leave that up to the reader.<br />I haven't read \\"Fear Itself\\" yet, which continues Pender's pre-retirement career, but if it's as tasty as this one, it should be good.<br />RECOMMENDED.	2003-06-15

This is a tremendous book...regardless of its flaws (which are few), or its grim outlook, it nonetheless is a thought-provoking, beautifully written tale of just what secrets, lies and pain can do.  Katie Marcus' murder is the juggernaut that sets the story rolling to a tragic ending, but solving the murder does not seem to be Lehane's focal point.  The richly drawn characters' reactions to this and their sad, tragic past are the true catalyst.<br />In 1975, three boys playing in the street are approached by what they believe are two cops.  When the \\"cop\\" orders the boys into his car, only one, Dave Boyles, gets in.  He disappears, and after four days, Dave returns.  But a new Dave that ultimately destroys the friendship of the three boys, and asks the question:  what if all 3 had gotten into the car.<br />Fast forward to 2000, and we meet these boys again in their adult lives:  Sean Devine is now a state trooper; Jimmy Marcus, after a life of crime, has settled down into married life, with his second wife, Annabeth (his first wife died while he was in prison), and he has three children:  Katie (by his first wife); and two younger girls.  And we have Dave, with his wife Celeste and son, Michael.  It is Dave whose inability to reconcile what happened to him after he got into the car, that emerges as the most tragic of all the characters.  It is his lie to his wife that pushes her to believe the worst of the man she loved; Jimmy's grief over his murdered daughter carries him into a rage that eventually leads to more tragic death; and it is Sean, whose own marriage has failed, who must confront the truths about his old friends.<br />Atmospheric and moody; chilly yet warm with some of the character's relationships, \\"Mystic River\\" is the kind of novel that deserves to be remembered in years to come.

At any rate, it reads quickly and there are some stunning plot twists.  I thought the addition of Allison's thoughts were a great addition, and helped us feel the real sympathy for her, and her courageous decision at the novel's climax.

From thereon out, Honey finds her rigidly organized life as a book seller representative in a tizzy.  And now she has about four men in her life---her secret lover; a handsome if dense cop; a smoothly exotic gardener, and an old friend from school who is now a movie director.  In the first half of the book, I can't count the times I laughed aloud at Honey's escapades, especially her paranoia and fear about the pantry in her parents' home.

But shouldn't Scott known better than to sneak off with him anyway?  Scott's only 16, and his judgment throughout the book exemplifies his inadequacies.<br />I didn't like this book as much as I wanted to; I found myself intrigued to reach the end because Gilstrap's writing is good enough to sustain interest.<br />But, I may be getting old too quick, but Scott didn't charm me in the least.	2003-05-30

However, if you've read his first three books, you can probably understand why Frank's the way he is.<br />In this one, he agrees to help an old friend in a murder case of a three month old twin, and hopefully prevent the murder of her sibling.  Frank falls much too quickly in love with Julia Bishop, the mistress of the household whose child was cruelly murdered.  As the novel moves along, we have several choices for the villian, and by the end of the novel, it turned out to be exactly who I thought. (Maybe I'm just getting brilliant?)  Ha ha.

Long has certainly delivered one of the most unusual novels I have read in some time.  People with tons of characters and subplots, the story follows a team into the depths of earth to find Satan.  There are several hints that Satan is really one of the Beowulf Society, a gathering of elderly scholars intent on discovering the true origins of the Satanic master.  The resultant discovery is predictable, yet still has a sense of chills when the culprit is unmasked.  Before that, though, you get several really creepy scenarios, particularly the opening chapter focusing on Ike Crockett and his doomed tour group; the hellish damnation of Branch, to name only a few.<br />This book has some real chills, some philosophical food for thought, and yes would make an interesting cinematic experience.  Quite a different read.<br />RECOMMENDED.	2003-05-24

I read \\"Black Cross\\" first, and was extremely impressed with Iles skill in blending fact and fiction.  It was interesting, too, to have Jonas Stern back.  Having met him in \\"Cross\\" first, it gives me a better understanding of the man's motivations and personality.<br />This is one lengthy book..not that this is bad, but I somehow feel like someone who's gone to an \\"All You Can Eat\\", stuffed myself, and then had a tummy ache all night!  Iles tries to stuff so much in this book that by the last third, I was having trouble remembering who's who, who got killed, etc.  I also was confused at all the different situations between all these different countries..Russians/Arabs/Brits/Americans, etc. etc.<br />But one cannot deny Iles' expertise in this expansive, suspenseful tale.  There are quite a bit of extraordinarily well-crafted action scenes, especially when Hess' fortress is attacked.  One thing after another; there are tons of villains, all of them incredibly despicable; there are heroes where you least expect them; also heroes who turn a little villainous themselves when they don't get their way (Gadi, e.g.).  Iles' finesse with characters is phenomenal, particularly with Captain Hauer; Ilse; Hans; Sparrow; Jonas Stern; Sergeant Schneider; Luhr; Pieter Smuts; and of course, the indomitable Thomas Alfred Horn/Rudolf Hess.<br />All in all, a terrific book, but I was extremely disappointed in the ending, not knowing what fate awaits Hauer, Hans and Ilse; and also by the \\"twist\\" in which one of the characters decides what needs to be done with the remaining copies of the Spandau papers.  What in the world good would it do?  Maybe I'm too \\"conventional\\"?<br />Anyway, Iles' two WWII historical fiction efforts are tremendous examples of this gentleman's talents.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2003-05-16

(Scott had written a few novels in his real name, Ben Mezrich).  &quot;Skeptic&quot; has a marvelous premise, and if Scott had followed up a little more with this, instead of the James Bond espionage, he might have provided a truly original novel.  As it stands, though, once the premise of how &quot;ghosts&quot; are made is introduced, it is used only once more effectively in a harrowing scene in a stable.  Other than this additional scene, Scott doesn't truly explore how much fun this could have been.  Instead he goes into the unbelievably chaotic scenario of having this brutal Chinese assasin out to dominate the world.  By the end, though, one is not truly quite sure what exactly this new find would do in that regard.<br />I enjoyed most of the book; Amber Chen is way too &quot;perfect&quot; and Mike Ballantine is too James Bondish for a doctor.  But suspending belief is nothing I'm opposed to doing; but in this particular novel, the characterizations are so undeveloped, and the plot so confusing, one ends up admiring Mr. Scott's skills and wondering why he didn't use them a little more effectively.<br />There is one huge surprise though in the &quot;insider&quot;, but I'll leave that one original injection to your discovery.<br />RECOMMENDED BUT ONLY AS A DIVERSION.	2003-05-12

I have read his later books, which are gripping contemporary suspense stories.  His career got jump started with this book and the previous \\"Spandau Phoenix\\" (which I haven't read yet, but am planning on starting soon).<br />\\"Black Cross\\" is an involving, complex story of trust, greed, love, evil, heroism, and change.  As always, Iles' characters are superb, and not black and white stereotypes.<br />Join Mark McConnell, the pacifist, who joins in a suicide mission only to help defend, and finds himself in the position of having to risk the lives of innocent people to achieve a goal to save the invading Allied troups; Josh Stern, a daredevil Jew, whose bravery and macho charm, are equal to his selfishness and innate brutality; Anna Kaas, an undercover nurse, who has faced the horrors of the concentration camp and who realizes that she too must act to save more than the prisoners; Rachel Jansen, an incredibly brave, level-headed prisoner who watches both her husband father in law murdered, and then desperately tries to save her two children; and Wolfgang Schorner, the head of the camp who falls for Rachel and wants to help her, but who is still a murdering, consciously Nazi.<br />All of these leading characters are devastatingly real; but the supporting characters are stunning, too:  Ariel Weisz, the \\"weasel\\" Jew who helps the Nazis; Frau Hagan, the burly woman who befriends Rachel and teaches her the tricks of the prison; Sergeant Strum, a heartless, mindless killing machine; Duff Smith, the arrogant general who recruits McConnell and Stern to do the bidding, lying to them in the process; Avram Stern, the shoemaker who also has another secret; and Ian McShane, the burly Scotsman who trains McConnell and Stern in how to get the gas bomb to the camp.<br />What a stunning book this is.  At first, I thought I wouldn't get involved as I am not a fan of blending historic characters into fictional plots.  (We have Churchill and Eisenhower here).  But Iles is a genius.

The gloom permeates the novel and while that is probably necessary for this particular book, it's not the kind of book to read on a rainy day or stormy night.  Nathan Lee, poor guy, goes through hell to make it to the Los Alamos site where scientists are working feverishly to come up with a cure for a centuries old plague released by a greedy Greek millionaire.  The plot's been described elsewhere, so in to avoid redundancy, I shall refrain from any more on this.  Long's pacing is very slow at times and you just want him to get on with things.  There are some marvelous scenarios though, one of which is the time devoted to Nathan's working with the clones to \\"humanize\\" them.  The relationships between he, Izzy and the clones is touching and interesting.  The character of David Ochs is rightfully despicable and there is one cruel segment where he urges Nathan to find his missing daughter.  His suggestion when this happens typifies the nastiest of villains in some time.<br />This is a truly apocalyptic novel, and I hope mankind never has to deal with this type of plague and that if he does, he behaves a little better.<br />My biggest concern centers on the clone for Cavendish, the mad scientist.  He disappears from the book for pages and pages, and yet figures very prominently in the book's denouement.  More of him might have made his acts at the end more understandable?<br />RECOMMENDED WITH RESERVATIONS.	2003-05-07

When Holden Scott first started writing as Ben Mezrich, there was an obvious talent there that somehow seemed to elude critical or public acclaim.  However, since changing his name and writing \\"Skeptic,\\" seems his fate is a little more promising.<br />\\"The Carrier\\" is a by the numbers chase thriller, which has some interesting scenarios, and some truly frightening scenes (reference to the above mentioned public toilet scene..yipes!).  However, so many \\"coincidences\\" occur and agent Thomas Moon is so over the top that you have to grimace at some of the cliches Scott uses.  However, this is an effectively creepy and involving book, one that flows nicely and gives us another one of Mezrich/Scott's typical young medical heroes who is caught up in the bureaucratic/evil world of modern science.  You can't help but admire Jack and his quest to save his beloved Angie from cancer; and you can't help but hate Michael Dutton, who cruelly steals Jack's \\"miracle.\\"<br />A nice, engaging read and one that I recommend; it's fun.	2003-05-04

This one has plenty:  why is a ten year old boy involved in the bombing of the church where Charly and Max are to be married?  Who is trying to frame Ryan for the murder of her estranged no-good husband?  Where did the silver dog come from?

In Maxwell's debut &quot;Point Fury&quot; we meet one Chris Nielson, a self-absorbed, self-pitying, fly by night who seeks the reader's sympathy because he's had such a terrible breakdown when his band breaks up and he loses his girlfriend.  So he does what any self-respecting hero would do----cops out by agreeing to &quot;housesit&quot; for an eccentric friend of his father's.  He plans to &quot;get hia act together and spend time writing his own music.&quot;  Well, he spends most of his first days in the house just sitting around and moaning his fate.  Then he meets Caroline, and he's smitten, but of course, this young lady is not what she seems (gasp!).  Then we find out that the man who hired Chris is (gasp) not what he seems.  Then the cruel henchman for the boss (gasp) shoots and kills Chris' beloved dog.  From here on out, things just get weirder and more confusing, culminating in some type of mafioso bloodbath at the end, that leaves Chris determined to lead a better life.  And even though it seems Ted Harper's motives for imprisoning Chris are to punish his father for talking him out of being an actor (huh?), we never understand why he does this to Chris and not the father!

In \\"From a Buick 8,\\" it's not so much the \\"horror aspect\\" that makes this such an engaging read.  It's the characters---the troopers who have kept a horrific secret for almost three decades, and whose lives are played out in reminiscences from many of the troopers.  All for the sake of young Ned Wilcox, whose father was killed in a terrible accident just a year before our story begins.  Seems his father was the most mesmerized by this strange car that comes out of nowhere and over the course of these thirty years, does some strange things.  It's not as compelling a plot as I would have liked, but the characters are all gripping, believable and speak the vernacular that has both won praise and condemnation from those nasty critics.  At any rate, if you enjoy Mr. King's novels as much as I have over the years, this one won't disappoint.  At times, it's leisurely, but never dull.  The character of Shirley Pasternak is one of the best female characters has created since Dolores Claiborne.  She is rich in compassion, humor, and is the kind of woman any man would delight in going home to.  Although King does go a bit overboard with Brian Lippy (no one really behaves like this, do they?), it does help in the full realization of the wonderful character, Eddie, whose fate is inevitable, but sad nonetheless.  Don't get me wrong..King hasn't lost his touch for creating some really creepy, horrifying scenes.  Just focus on his wonderful style; even his personal experience of being hit by an automobile is woven into the story, and it's as frightening as the Buick 8.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  HE IS THE KING.	2003-04-25

Iles also has the rare ability to write scenes that are extremely \\"human\\" and believable.  In this outing, Iles introduces us to Penn Cage (a character he later resurrects in \\"Sleep No More'), an idealistic lawyer who is trying to cope with the death of his young wife, and raising his eight year old daughter in her absence.  His return to his Mississippi home involves him in a twenty year old murder that hints at the involvement of a local political bigwig, who just happens to be the father of the girl Penn loved while in college.<br />Iles doesn't totally make the mark in this book, however.  It seems a little too long, and sometimes the pacing slows the suspense down.  Also, I found Penn's undying love for Livy rather absurd, considering what she did to him, and how she acts in the big trial scene.  He also doesn't take long to get the hots for Caitlin, the reporter.  His wife only gone for seven months, seems like his hormonal juices are flowing a little too quickly.<br />With that flaw aside, the rest of the book is devastating in some of its scenes.  The death or Ruby is crushing, and handled beautifully by Iles.<br />RECOMMENDED.	2003-04-12

With that aside, this second entry in the Susan Shader series (And I hope there are more to come!) is an excellent thriller, featuring the very interesting Susan Shader, and also her sidekick, David Gold, who is also an integral part of this series.<br />This time we have two despicable killers, one that Shader thinks she's helped put away (early in the book), and then a serial killer called The Undertaker, who is as sick and bloody as they get.<br />The book has several unsettling scenes, and you're never quite sure who the Undertaker is.  The characters of Wendy Breckinridge and Tony Garza, as well as Scott Carpenter, are also great ones, although the fate of one of them is truly sad, and one has to wonder why Shader allowed it to happen...but it's realistic enough, and brings the book to a hair-raising close.<br />A brilliant read.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2003-04-12

Who else could take such dark themes, and with his art of writing, create such somber yet optimistic landscapes.  In this book, this brilliance sometimes gets in the way of the plot, and manages to slow the pacing of the book down at times, but it is nonetheless a mesmerizing addition to the Charlie Parker series.<br />Parker has a remarkable narrative tone, and his humor is downright incredible at times.  I don't think readers will enjoy this as much as they should if they haven't read at least &quot;The Killing Kind,&quot; the brilliant predecessor to this work.  There are too many holdovers from that novel to enable anyone to fully grasp the situation if they haven't met Reverend Faulkner and Pudd before.<br />Some real surprises here, including the murderous rampage of Louis and Angel; Angel's morose attitude since the incident with Rev. Faulkner in the previous book; Rachel's pregnancy and her love for the sometimes misguided Charlie; a horrifying killer in Cyrus Nairn; Connolly's elegant use of the supernatural in his detective tales; and a compelling &quot;ghost&quot;...all add up to another fantastic read.<br />You can't do much better than this series; in four novels, Connolly has demonstrated what a terrific writer he is.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2003-04-02

However, Andrew Warne is such a complacent hero, he doesn't carry the novel as well as previous Child creations.  His split from Sarah seems trivial and his pending romance with Terri subliminally unerotic.  Add the typical teenage daughter (why can't these novels gives us a childless hero just once?), and villains that are as obvious as they are banal.  Who is John Doe?  He even says near the end of the book that the people wouldn't believe who he REALLY is.  Guess not...Childs never solves that interesting little tidbit.  The &quot;mole&quot; is pretty obvious if you just use your mind a little. I will give Childs credit for the character of Angus Poole, the tourist who becomes a pivotal part of the plot and its resolution.  Overall, it's a fun book, it just bogs down a little and the lack of telling us who John Doe really is leaves a little sour taste.  But, what the heck..you could do worse!<br />RECOMMENDED.	2003-03-26

Unfortunately, this one is nowhere near the novel \\"Wither\\" was.  And why is that?  I think one of the reasons is that Passarella seems to be going more to charm his \\"Buffy\\" audiences, and in doing so, has resorted to gratuituous gore, crude sex scenes, and a lack in creating the true suspense he had done so well in the original.<br />Wendy Ward, who is obviously going to be Wendy the Witch Slayer, is an alright heroine, but her character is not fleshed out enough to really get into what she's gone through.  Her \\"Mirror\\" diary is so contrived, and even though it's used to let us know Wendy's thoughts, it's more a distraction than aid.  Although her last entry is more to the point and seems more real.  Not that I'm saying \\"Wither's Rain\\" is supposed to be \\"real\\", but within its framework, the diary loses its punch.<br />The addition of The Crone is okay until she starts philosophizing on this \\"time\\" thing, and for two or three pages, some weird doctrine on what time really is seems to come out of nowhere, makes little sense and the resolution of who the Crone really is, is downright implausible and ludicrous.<br />Also in this book, moreso in the first, Passarella seems outright cruel in the way he handles several of the deaths.  Key characters are wiped out, and dealt with superficially.<br />And Gina?  Well, she's so overblown, she never seems menacing; she merely acts as an actress chewing up the scenery, and her evil is so over the top, she doesn't create the terror Elizabeth Wither did in the original novel.<br />It's sad to see such a unique book obscured by this exercise in teenage angst.  I think Passarella is a good writer, but I don't think I'll be following his Wendy Ward books.  His lack of strong adult characters in useful roles (Sheriff Nottingham is basically ineffectual and Abby's turning into a wolf?  Oh, puhleese!) will limit his audience to the market age of 16-18, or whatever.<br />Sorry, can't recommend this one.

For over the top plot twists, outrageously spectacular plot lines, nobody does it better than Jeffery Deaver.

Maybe Tom Hanks and Renee Zellwegger?  Anyway, the villain in this one is the Conjurer, who uses his amazing illusionary skills to murder and offer Rhyme and Sachs an incredible chore--who the heck is he?  And what the heck is he doing?<br />The book has the usual Deaver pacing, and although the two subplots tend to get in the way on occasion (this \\"white supremist\\" story and Sachs' possible promotion), they manage to blend into a cohesive and exciting addition.

His stomping through the floor was a fitting demise for this evil little gnome.<br />In John Katzenbach's ingenious thriller, \\"The Analyst\\" we have another Rumpelstiltskin who is as every bit horrendous as his namesake..even more so.<br />Without rehashing the plot synopses, suffice to say that Katzenbach creates a rather unusual leading character in Richard Starks/Richard Lively/Frederick Lazarus...he's not all that likeable, but his growth and resolve to find his nemesis is powerful, and even though it's at time a little hard to swallow, we find ourselves searching along with Ricky for the man who has so destroyed his life.<br />The real identity of Rumpelstiltskin is not too hard to decipher, however; there aren't that many characters in the book to suspect, so his revelation is fairly predictable.  However, some of the other surprises are nifty and add to the suspense.<br />The ending is a little disappointing in that we never really know what happens to Rumpelstiltskin.<br />All in all, though, a good read.<br />RECOMMENDED	2003-03-16

However, Patterson should return to the \\"thriller/murder cases\\" and get out of this pontification on abortion and seedy politicians.  Caroline Masters and Kerry Killcannon, who I sincerely enjoyed in their previous appearances, are now given halos and are so saintly and self-righteous, they are nauseating.<br />First off, Kerry, being a Catholic insinuates that he is pro-life, but defends the rights of those who aren't.  As a Catholic, he's forgetting that abortion is not condoned, and if he wants to walk the walk, he needs to stand behind that; otherwise, he becomes a hypocrite, as indeed he does in this book.  He is not the vital force evidenced in \\"No Safe Place,\\" and he merely appears smug, determined to do whatever he wants in the name of doing what is right.  He even sends the FBI after information from a newspaper doing a story on the trial.  It's okay, Kerry says, to break the law, if you're noble in doing it.<br />All of the political backstabbing gets extremely tiresome, and so overdrawn, it's cartoonish.<br />However, it is the Mary Ann Tierney story that proves Patterson's pro-choice stance, and in this book, everyone who is prochoice is either mentally ill, outright cruel, insensitive and wrong.  Meanwhile the prochoice people behave so magnaimously, and they are portrayed as the victims.  Heading this farce of a philosophy is young, FEMALE Sarah Dash, who takes in Mary Ann when her parents continue to force her into having her baby, even though it will probably be born dead, and Mary Ann may never have any more children. Stacked deck indeed.<br />First off, Mary is only 15; she had sex with her boyfriend in the back of his car; he didn't use a condom because it wasn't as much fun.  She says her parents never told her anything about sex.  Now, she's pregnant, and all of a sudden this fifteen year old girl is something like Joan of Arc; where did all this maturity come from?  And why did she neglect to tell her lawyer that her mother DID talk to her about sex, but obviously mary Ann didn't listen?  Seems that her mother became sterile after having Mary Ann.  Stacked deck again.  Also, is it really realistic that so many people have had abortions, as evidenced by Chad Palmer and Lara soon to be Mrs. Killcannon?  The death of one of the other young people just to prove how heinous the press and abortion are, is totally manipulative and ultimately a cruel plot mechanism to advance Patterson's love of Masters and Killcannon.  Also, when Mary Ann finally has the abortion, wouldn't it have been interesting if the baby (not the fetus, as Patterson keeps calling it!!) would have been normal?  No, Patterson is not content to pull that kind of twist.<br />What a sad world where abortion is so prominent; granted, this was a tough choice for Mary Ann to make, but her total disregard of her parents (who were also portrayed as evil villains) left her to make that choice alone.<br />I really disliked this book; and I will not read any more of Mr. Patterson's treatises on abortion or gun control.  If he sticks to his earlier works, I'll certainly continue to enjoy them, but I don't want to be exposed to such one-sided partisan views in my entertainment.<br />NOT RECOMMENDED.Joan of Arc; where did all this maturity come from?

Taking the lead in this novel, Stella's &quot;darkness&quot; and lack of trust in people deflates her character, and her relationship with Michael suffers because of this.  The murders, while seemingly unrelated, will obviously be somehow connected.  It is this plot device that fuels the book.  Patterson spends a great deal of time fleshing out his plot in this one, but not as much as with his characters, and once again, as in previous books, suicide is used as a resolution, and in this one, it's just too contrived.  I still admire Patterson's work and there are some effective scenes in this book, but oveall, it's not as passionate or sharply etched as earlier works.<br />I recommend it to those of us Patterson fans who still realize what a major talent he is.	2003-03-11

I was disappointed at first in &quot;No Safe Place,&quot; as Patterson moves away from criminal law to a political drama.  I even considered not reading it after the first few chapters.  But once again, Patterson's skills as a writer forced me to finish it and I'm glad I did.  For what he achieves again is an incredible mixture of characters and situations that can't help but grab you by the throat and never let you go.  In the alternating flashbacks, we learn so much about all of the characters.  At times, Kerry Killcannon seems too good to be true, but beneath this saintly figure is a man with bitterness, the need for vengeance, and a need to climb out of the shadow of his assassinated brother, Jamie.<br />The scenes of family abuse are stunning--and disturbing---the moment at the end of the Anthony Musso trial is shocking and heartbreaking.  Kerry's decision regarding the child in this situation has far reaching results.<br />Lara Costello, the lovely reported that Killcannon has fallen in love with, is portrayed as a career-driven, but ultimately a woman of substance.<br />The issues attacked in this book are the hard ones that we all face each day.  Pro-life/pro-choice/gun control/spouse abusal protection...Patterson packs some powerful comments and whether you agree with them or not, you have to admire him for trying to be fair and realistic in his approach.  Journalism takes a beating in this one, as it should.  It gives further evidence how the media will do anything to get a story, even ruin people's lives.<br />The tragic Sean Bean is a very disturbing but pitiful character and the path he takes to his own destruction is gutwrenching, but at the climax of his scene, you'll understand why.<br />A brilliant book, and quite well done.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2003-03-09

Richard North Patterson continues his string of outstanding novels with this penetrating look at friendship, faith and love.  Tony Lord, who we first met in \\"Private Screening\\" is the legal wizard who is called to his hometown after nearly three decades to defend his best friend of the murder of a sixteen year old girl.  Tony himself left his hometown because he had been accused of murdering his girlfriend, Alison Taylor.  Tony's guilt was never really clarified, because the only other person who could have murdered Alison was killed robbing a convenience store.  We know Tony didn't kill Alison, but the townspeople believe he did.<br />So now his best friend (who also may have thought Tony was guilty) is facing similar charges, only he gets to go to trial with Tony as his lawyer.<br />A stunning novel, filled with secrets; heartbreaking scenarios that are so lifelike in their structure, you can't help but feel for those involved.  The confrontational courtroom scenes, as always, are brilliant and riveting.  The relationship between Tony and Sam is superbly etched; Tony's feelings about Sam's wife, Sue, are painstakingly real; the enigmatic Sam Robb is focal---is he capable of such a brutal murder; does he lie about everything?  Is he really Tony's best friend?  And is Tony justified in what he does to Ernie?<br />The novel cruises along with such intensity and fervor, one can't help but gasp in awe at its structure.  The finale is devastating, although you can see it coming, you just don't want to admit it.<br />A brilliant, exceptional novel.<br />HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2003-03-07

As I read more of him, I continue to become fascinated with his style and his understanding of human foibles and complexities.<br />Caroline Masters, featured in supporting roles in two previous books, gets the whole shebang this time.  There are many surprises in this book, and as the tragic picture of a New England family, dominated by the patriarch, Channing Masters, unfolds, one is caught up in the seemingly unending heartbreaks that have touched the family.  There are some truly heart-tugging scenes and some real thrills in the murder and Caroline's resolution of it.

As in all of Patterson's books, we find characters that are far from perfect, and whose personal secrets and disappointments can be both heartwrenching and disturbing.  Unfortunately, I read &quot;Eyes of a Child&quot; which was written after this, so I knew some of what was going on with Mary and Paget and with Teresa and Richie.  Patterson's development of the tension between Terri and her worthless husband is chilling; with no resolution truly in this book, one can find out what happens in &quot;Eyes of a Child,&quot; but you would do best to read this one first.<br />Anyway, we know from the beginning that Mary Carelli murdered Mark Ransome, but why and what is all the intriguing things that Mary has done that she won't share with Paget?  Patterson brilliantly unfolds a scenario that takes us back into Chris and Mary's past; and how Terri and Chris become the best of friends and more so.  It's a great book, I don't want to go into too many plot details, but trust me, this one is a real winner!<br />HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2003-03-05

The whole concept of hostages being negotiated and aired as a t.v. special is all too frighteningly real, considering the nation's obsession with so-called reality television.  But the premise is intriguing, and the story has some tense and riveting scenes.  My main complaint is that within the novel, John Damone tells Stacy that &quot;the man I hired killed him.  Lord just brought it up again..&quot;  So i figured Stacy was in on it, but obviously she wasn't.  This little confusing issue kind of squelched my overall enthusiasm for the novel, but even then Patterson was writing awesomely, giving us a glimpse of what he's come to do best---trial novels!<br />RECOMMENDED.	2003-03-05

Adam Shaw is a young lawyer employed in his father-in-law's firm who is asked to drop off a document to his friends, Lydia and Henry Cantwell.  Shaw finds the murdered body of Mrs. Cantwell, and then discovers the document he was delivering was the latest edition of her last will and testament.  The prime suspects in the murder are the husband whose alibi is he was out of town for the night, and their psychotic son, Jason, whose girlfriend says he was with her all night.<br />Nothing is as it seems from this point; there's much more than meets the eye in all of the characters' secrets and so forth.  Eventually three people end up dead by the time the crime is solved.  The true culprit is somewhat of a surprise, although the character's presence in the book is never really likeable.  The showdown at the end is somewhat contrived, but it serves its purpose.<br />If you're a true Patterson fan, this book will please you but savor his later efforts.<br />RECOMMENDED (SLIGHTLY)	2003-03-02

THE ELEVENTH PLAGUE revolves around a madman's plot to mirror the ten plagues of Moses and kill off vast amounts of people all in the name of God.  Character-wise, there's no one here we haven't met before, and even the villain is rehashed from Dr. Phibes through Hannibal Lechter.  However, the book has some terrifying scenes and some surprises, too.  It's a little long in the tooth and is nowhere as realistically frightening as THE HOT ZONE, but it's still a scary read.<br />RECOMMENDED.	2003-02-27

However, Kearney tries mightily hard in this thriller, which all occurs in one long day.  Chuck Hausmann and his new wife, Gretchen, and step-daughter, Kara, return to an isolated island in the middle of Lake Superior, to attend the reading of his father's will.  We soon learn Chuck is hated by pretty much everyone in the little village.  We also learn Chuck had been married before and his first wife died under mysterious circumstances; Chuck feigned insanity to keep out of the draft.  From the get-go, we know Gretchen and Kara are in for some dark, disturbing moments.  The island is populated with stereotypical characters, but still they're interesting antagonists.  We do wonder \\"Is Chuck really the insane killer\\" the town makes him out to be; was Mary's death really an accident; did the old man really extort money from his church-going parishioners; and is Chuck telling the truth about anything?<br />The novel spins towards it's unusual climax, and many people suffer because of one lie, one betrayal.  Sharp and enthralling, this is no \\"Simple Plan\\" but is a fine psychological thriller, with an unexpected ending.<br />RECOMMENDED.	2003-02-24

These people whirl though several close-calls, calamities, second guesses, second chances, and some rather suspenseful scenes.  All in all, it's a good read for when you don't really want to be overburdened with complexity and intricacies.  Smith is to be credited, however, for a good read, a little long in the tooth, but with a good, satisfying climax.<br />RECOMMENDED.	2003-02-23

I can't wait to go back and get them all.<br />\\"Eyes of a Child\\" is one heck of a story, that grips you right from its chilling opening until it's shattering finale.<br />The characterizations are richly drawn and extremely credible.  Patterson's way with setting up compelling dramatic scenes is amazing.  There's one long scene in the book where Terri and her mother Rosa finally discuss why Rosa stayed with the abusive husband.  It's forthright, somber, believable and sad, as well.  Patterson does this kind of great work in other scenes, too, including the one where Terri comes to find out her daughter, Elena's, horrifying \\"secret.\\"<br />Christopher Paget is a noble hero, and I didn't realize he has been featured in other novels, so I was beginning to think he was the murderer.  His trip to the Goodwill is one factor; the \\"journal\\" is another.<br />All of the characters are brilliantly conceived:  the evil and despicable Richie, whose death seems more than justified; Paget's teen-age son, Carlo, trapped in those waning years between adolescence and adulthood; Rosa, the mother, is compelling and one can't help but sympathize with her; Caroline Masters, Paget's defense, who is a brilliant lawyer and seems to be a true friend as well.<br />There are no easy answers in this well-crafted novel and our heroes do some foolish things, but it chronicles the tragedy of what happens when a child is placed in a \\"used\\" position, and how sometimes even love isn't enough.<br />EXCELLENT!<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2003-02-21

His older brother approaches PI Laura Principal to find out not if his little brother did the deed, but WHY?  Laura's fascination and dedication involve her in some dark family secrets and some other interesting characters.  Principal is a fresh heroine, one with a heart and a sense of commitment.

It advances no new fields in spook writing, or even psychological suspense.  Ms. Rusch's novel is slow and plodding, yet she does give you some richly developed characters.  The problem is most of them are not very likeable at all.  Take the novel's focal character:  Addie Hawthorne..what a real bi..anyway, somehow she manages to come out sort of a heroine by the novel's end, but you have to go through some really lengthy scenes to get there.<br />The plot is somewhat muddled at times and one never really knows who to blame for the disasters befalling the cove and what really lies within the churn.  Although the climactic scene does reveal some facts, overall I found myself wanting to know more:  what was Lisa's involvement?  Who really killed the man in the car?  What will happen to Spencer?<br />Why the three?  I guess I found myself involved in the book and there are some really touching scenes.  Not a great book by any means, but a good time-passer.	2003-02-18

The novel opens in the early 1950's and we meet the Carey family, impossibly hard-hearted father John; brothers Charles and Phillip; the self-centered, somewhat demented Allie; and the charming little boy, Peter, who grows up to be the focal point of the novel.  The first section has a lot of information in it, and though sometimes hard to digest or keep the many plot mechanizations in context, it sets a very sad and lethal plot for the remainder of the book.<br />Grown up Peter, having amnesia after the accident that claims his parents' lives, now must face the sale of his father's company and fend off some mysterious and deadly pursuers.<br />What makes this book work so well is Patterson's handling of the psyche of Peter, and the difficult time he has trusting people.  Several key characters are introduced including his girlfriend, Noelle; the crazed killer Martin; two psychiatrists, one a longtime friend of his father; and Ruth Levy, the mistress of his deceased father and also the sister of his psychiatrist.<br />The plot thickens, secrets are hidden and revealed, and the novel ends in a blazing finish that is more than satisfactory.<br />Not by any means a brilliant classic, \\"Escape the Night\\" is a well-written study in suspense and terror.<br />RECOMMENDED.	2003-02-16

We meet a spoiled, egocentric, self-centered lawyer named Peter Hale who botches a case for his stricken father, who is so upset with him he fires him from his law firm, disinherits him and ships him off to the boonies of Oregon (guess every state has their own boonies)to work as a public defender.  His new boss, Amos Geary, immediately dislikes him, and Peter ends up handling the defense of a mentally retarded man accused of the horrible slaying of a college co-ed.  Mixed in with this are a couple of druggies, Christopher Mammon and Kevin Booth.  Add a career-minded, unethical female prosecutor, Becky O'Shay, and things heat up.  Not to mention Peter's friend, Steve Mancini, and his new wife, Donna, who happens to be the accused's sister.  Whew!<br />At any rate, the plot moves along well, and there are several surprising revelations in the book.  And yes, Peter, does become a better man after going through this mess!<br />Highly enjoyable entertainment.<br />And I think the title is pretty obvious once the book is ended.<br />RECOMMENDED.	2003-02-15

Here's the set-up:<br />You are a lonely middle-aged CPA and you eat at the same places almost every day.  You notice a sad looking woman, not a pretty one, mind you, just sad, and you identify with her because she is so obviously lonesome, just like our CPA.<br />You get the nerve up to try and speak with her, and it doesn't work.  She doesn't tell you her name or anything about her.  You follow her home one night and find out her name is Janet Mitchell.  You are obsessed with why she's so lonely.  Soon she stops coming to the restaurant and you're worried.  You go visit her apartment complex and speak to the oriental landlady.  She tells you that the lady is dead, committing suicide in her bathtub.  Now, would you even imagine pursuing this any further?  Well, James Messenger, our hero does.<br />Although I found the setup for this novel quite unbelievable, Pronzini manages to make it work with his wonderful prose and sense of characterizations.  Needless to say, Messenger ends up in the lady's hometown of Beulah, Nevada, and finds out her real name, and learns that she had been accused of murdering her philandering husband AND her eight year old daughter.  Messenger knows she didn't do it (how, you got me!).  Soon, Messenger faces the expected town bullies and even the dead woman's sister.  He takes a job on her ranch, and gets more and more involved with the lady and the townspeople.<br />The book is short, moves along well, and the ending is quite a surprise, at least to me.<br />It's not what I consider a great book, but if you can get past the ludicrous setup, you should enjoy it.<br />RECOMMENDED.	2003-02-12

Ms. Strayhorn's prose reflects a little of the Harlequin romances, with a little \\"soft\\" sex thrown in for fun.  And the book is fun.  I read it in one day, as it is a very easy read.  The plot revolves around a woman and her daughter who return to the Mom's hometown to help her vanquish the \\"ghosts\\" that have haunted her.  Mom was in a very nasty orphanage when she was young, and ever since she's been haunted by memories of that horrible place.  Daughter Lena falls for the ex-con next door.  Their repartee throughout the book is at times hilarious and then even touching.  Lena is a pain in the ... for the first half of the book; Rafael (the ex-con) is a real sex-maniac in some ways, but once you get to know him a little better, one can almost understand his immediate lust for Lena.  Eugenia starts having more visions of the past, which focus on a despicable wife of a Civil War something or other, and how she manages to get him to kill his sweetheart.  Also in the picture is Ross Schweig, who gives both Lena and Rafael jobs at his sandwich shop; and Lorraine Lake, his bitchy girlfriend who has a demented son.  All these characters do have something to do with what happened in the past, and it's fun guessing how it will all turn out.<br />Strayhorn keeps the plot moving, and the dialogue, though derivative, is fun.

At times, you have to wonder if he's got all his cookies; but in some ways, that's what makes this book an eerie, if not classic, thriller.  Straub is a wonderful writer, and even though at times, he gets too wordy, he sets a very suspenseful mood, and keeps an impending sense of doom permeating the novel.<br />When Miles returns to the scene of a horrifying &quot;accident&quot; after twenty years, we wonder when and if his beloved Allison will keep the vow she made those many years ago.  If you've read a lot of this type of book, you pretty much know what the big revelation will be halfway through the book.  Once you find that out, the story loses a little of its punch and the rest of the time, Miles is involved in finding out whodunit, although it's pretty obvious who did!  At any rate, the novel moves along rather nicely, but the ending seems somewhat rushed, and the murderer's identity is something that is obscure and not fully fleshed out.  Overall, though, if you are a Straub fan, this book fits nicely in your library, although &quot;Ghost Story&quot; and &quot;Floating Dragon&quot; are his best works.<br />RECOMMENDED.	2003-02-07

Heroine (?) Nan alternates between being a shrewish wife, a doting but inattentive mother, and a nymphomaniac with her stud cousin Sky.  Enter typical &quot;woodsy&quot; people like doomed Lucy; the psychic Flutie; the redneck moonshiner Jerry; the kindly bookstore owner, Cooper, and then worse of all, Nan's estranged husband Gabe.  Seems like something terrible happened to Nan and her playmate Tucker back in 1968, that she just can't remember.  Twenty years later, she returns to the family home in Tennessee and finds that the ghost of little Tucker has intentions on her eight year old son, Stephen.<br />While the ghost story itself is intriguing, the payoff is a real disappointment.  And what's even more frustrating--what happens to Nan and Stephen?  Do they stay in Tennessee?  Does she continue her relationship with hunky Sky?  What does Gabe do?  Why is what happened in 1968 such a washout?<br />Not recommended unless you need something besides a sleeping pill to sleep.	2003-02-05

David Hunt's prose is certainly well-written, and as a male, his first person narrative in a woman's role is very good.  However, at times, I found the \\"present tense\\" style a bit distracting and manipulative.<br />I found the novel a bit windy and long.  There's a lot of superfluous narrative and descrption, and Kay's character vacillates between someone you like and someone who seems very self-oriented.  Her love affair with Sasha, for instance..he obviously loves her a great deal, but she's content with just \\"using\\" him, as she doesn't feel the same towards him.  She overcomes her fear of guns quite easily, too; and her quest to find out what happened to her mentor, Maddy, tends to get bogged down in lots of repetitive disclosures.  The goings on in the apartment are never fully developed so that they seem frightening. When we learn that a gun (erotically decorated, no less) is at the heart of the murder, little is done to keep it suspenseful.  There's also the continued dalliances of her boos, Josh, that takes the story into different areas without serving the main plot.  All in all, a technically polished writer giving us a trite and not so interesting tale.	2003-01-31

Known for his grand style of writing, employing several different storylines at once, he brings this to the police procedural genre and overall, I think, brings it off well.  The characterizations are well developed, and Malcolm Ainslie is a flawed hero; his bitterness over the Catholic faith, however, is never fully rationalized, and I was sad when at a point where his life was about to end, he still refused to admit God's existence.  However, this is what makes Ainslie so complex.  He also seems to have a hard time stifling his urge to \\"roam\\" in his marriage, and it is his affair with one Cynthia Ernst that propels him into a dark, and complicated vortex.  A strong debate about capital punishment also enters the picture as Ainslie is called to a death row inmate's execution for a final confession from a despicable nasty character called \\"Animal\\" Elroy Doil.  There's some other subplots including the mysterious murder of a wealthy woman's husband; a lot of background into Cynthia's youth; and many other goings on that contribute to the breadth of the novel.<br />This was Hailey's first attempt at this type of novel, and although as a mystery/thriller, it sets no new territories, it does come off as well-developed and interesting character study about the life of a detective; the wealthy; and the religious.<br />RECOMMENDED.	2003-01-27

These and more are \\"explained\\" in Jim Hougan's overwrought conspiracy thriller, \\"Kingdom Come.\\"  Hougan is half the team using the pseudonymn John Case for his/their other books, and I have to admit, Case's works are far superior to this one.  Admittedly, I am not a true fan of the \\"espionage\\" thriller, so I may be a bit prejudiced, but as a thriller connosieur, I found this book tedious, redundant and at times very boring.  The pacing is incredibly slow, and when the action scenes do arrive, they are crisp and efficient, if not a little bloody.  Anyway, Jack Dunphy and cohort Clementine are likeable characters, and you find yourself wanting to cheer them on as they search for the reasons Jack was booted out of the CIA and why his life is in danger.  The additional threat from the man Jack \\"steals\\" money from only tends to bog down the true plot.  At any rate, by the time Jack and Clementine reach the source of their search, the ending is so mystic and enigmatic, that one wonders why the book was even written.  Technically, Hougan has some fine touches, but overall, is at best a mediocre read.	2003-01-24

With Ms. George's passing, a void now exists that hopefully other cozy writers will continue to fill.  How refreshing to have such witty dialogue and energy courtesy of Patricia Anne and Mary Alice.  Their repartee is so realistic, I can just imagine sipping tea with Patricia and boogying with the hefty Mary Alice.  George pokes fun at so many of the little idiosyncrasies of our common folk that you find yourself laughing on every page.  As far as mysteries go, this one's a little more involved than some of the earlier books and the resolution is a real stunner.  This time the ladies are involved in the murder of an Elvis impersonator who died while dancing with 29 other impersonators at a benefit to restore the mooning Vulcan statue.  But it's really the characters and their individual crises that make this a winner.  Where else would you find a character bursting onto the scene telling an astonished Patricia that he is there to impregnate her niece?  Or have characters eating tuna sandwiches and Dinty Moore beef stew.  it's these little touches that have endeared Anne George and these marvelous characters.  They will be sorely missed; maybe someone can pick up the series, but it will take Anne George's uncanny insight into human nature to pull it off.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2003-01-22

With \\"Next Victim,\\" Prescott comes to full fruition with his damsel in distress/psycho villain themes.  This one's true culprit is a real shocker to me.  The plot involves a serial killer named Mobius who has been killing women both in Denver and then two years later in Los Angeles. FBI agent Tess McCallum has a special interest in this case, as one of Mobius' victims was her partner/lover Paul Voorhees.  Add to this a woman who has a secret chemical weapon she intends to sell to the highest bidder,  which she stole from the government, and who makes the mistake of going to bed with none other than Mobius, and then who gets the disastrous chemical?  Mobius!  The identity of Mobius is concealed quite effectively and just when you think you know who it is, whammo...the revelation is pretty effective!  The use of the \\"Wipeout\\" killing introduced in the prologue is chilling and its continued tie-in effective.<br />There are some obnoxious characters aside from the villian too:  the disgusting cop Jim Dodge; the obnoxious FBI agent Michaelson, and the sexual pervert Hayde.  A good book from a developing writer who seems to be finding his niche.<br />RECOMMENDED.	2003-01-20

An intensely structured plot leads you on several paths toward discovering the heinous villain.  Although many readers deducted the identity early, it still didn't keep you from wanting to see how things turned out.  And I admit that I, too, caught on, but was never 100% certain I was right until later when a key clue is introduced in a list of comparable crimes in other cities.<br />Given that, this is one heck of a ride.  The pacing is great; the characters are all good, some chilling, others sensitive and touching, and some nasty and despicable.

It reminded me of the frightening opening sequence in the Stallone movie, \\"Cliffhanger.\\"  What makes this so remarkable is that author Andrews accomplishes this without the visuals.  The scene of course is the one where Jack Keller's mother meets her fate in a high rise building at the hands of a madman.  Wow, goosebumps upon goosebumps in that scene.  There are two other scenes in this book that almost match it: the bizarre shootout in the Charlottesville restaurant (where you keep saying, \\"No, no, don't let this happen..\\", and the final climactic scene on the terrace of Keller's own high rise.<br />While the characterizations are nowhere as sharp as others like Greg Iles and Robert McCammon, Andrews manages to weave a tale of mystery and intrigue.  A lot of sex, so if that bothers you, you might flinch a little.  Although the book is well crafted, and you're never really sure who is doing what, I had my suspicions about the killer, and even though author Janet Evanovich felt it was impossible to detect, somehow through all the red herrings, I figured it out.  Pat on back for the year!!!<br />The supporting characters including Kid Demeter, Bryan Bishop and Dominic are all well developed, and the whole novel is intense and brooding, but a heck of a good read!  Would make a tremendous film!!!<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2003-01-15

In \\"The Undertaker's Widow,\\" Judge Richard Quinn is said hero.  He has what he thinks is the perfect marriage with a career-driven wife, Laura, who doesn't find his sexual demands as worthwhile as he does.  This obviously leads to Quinn's involvement with a mysterious young woman on a trip to an island called St. Jerome's.  If Quinn is as moral as the book makes him out to be, his rendezvous with Amanda only shows the shallow side of this hero.<br />Other than that, he does some more stupid things and winds up in the middle or a really nasty murder case.<br />The titular widow of this book is one Ellen Crease, who is running for the senate, and kills a man who comes into her mansion to kill her wealthy husband.  He does kill him, and from there on, we have a chaotic investigation, with several possible suspects, and Judge Quinn smack dab in the middle of it.<br />Laura's turnaround near the end of the book, while not totallyl credible, at least is pleasant for our hero.  The identity of the murderer in this one is, I admit, a surprise, but it's hasty resolution and it's \\"cute\\" little epilogue involving the lady's housekeeper is rather trite.<br />Not a great read, and certainly not one of Margolin's best, but it's not a waste of time.	2003-01-15

In \\"24 Hours,\\" his skills as a plot technician, suspense/thrill master, and most importantly, character structure, is impeccable.  While not as engaging and plausible as other books I've read by him (\\"Mortal Fear,\\" \\"Dead Sleep\\"), this novel nonetheless is one you can hardly put down.<br />Again, skipping the synopsis already well covered by other reviewers, I'd like to focus once again on the tremendous ability Iles has in giving us richly developed and flawed characters, even the heroes.<br />The leading characters, Karen and Will Jennings, have fallen into the recognizable \\"stagnant\\" marriage.  Jennings is a doctor who has come up with an amazing new medicine, and Karen is a wife who wanted to be a doctor, but had to give that dream up when she got pregnant, with their daughter Abby.  This resentment fuels the story, and is both agonizing and convincing.  It's also indicated in the fact that Will's concern for his kidnapped daughter, doesn't include his wife until late in the novel.  He is also tempted by the sultry Cheryl, although this is initially when she's an audience member of his presentation, and before he finds out her role in the kidnapping.  Even then, his temptation for sexual relationship is obvious.  (He and Karen have conflicting views on the frequency and/or need for sex).  Overall, Karen and Will are piercing characters, and you end up supporting them both in their desperate struggle to get their daughter back alive.<br />Abby, the little girl, is a different child character than usual.  She is quite a charmer, a five year old with both the innocence of youth and the wisdom of intelligent and caring parents.  She is also a diabetic, and is keenly aware of the need to watch what she eats and to make sure she gets her insulin shots.<br />The book has three villains, so to speak, but only one is truly irreprehensible.  That's Joe Hickey.  This man is evil through and through, and although he uses revenge as his motive for his fifth kidnapping, the other four show how cruel he can be also.  He has a perfect crime on his hands, and has been successful four times before, but he meets his match in Karen and Will.  He is vile, and quite well written.<br />Cheryl and mildlly retarded Huey are different; you can see their good side, and how they have been enamored and \\"captured\\" by the evil in Joe.  I especially liked Cheryl's character, in that she \\"matures\\" in the reader's eyes.<br />The ending is spectacular and breathtaking; I can see its' cinematic value.  \\"Trapped\\", screenplayed by Mr. Iles, is the movie version, and though I haven't seen it, reviews have indicated it stays close to the book.<br />Wow, this is a great read.  I look forward to catching up on all of Mr. Iles' books.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.ugh and through, and although he uses revenge as his motive for his fifth kidnapping, the other four show how cruel he can be also.

Rarely does a book come along that is so intelligently written, beautifully paced, and so hard to put down.  It's one of those books that when you've finished, you want more of the people you've spend a few hours with. Greg Iles \\"Dead Sleep\\" is quite an exceptional work.  Instead of reiterating the plot (which is superb in itself), I want to share with thoughts on things that happen in this book that are quite outstanding.<br />First, the characterizations:<br />I have never read a more touching and realistic love scene than the one Jordan Glass and John Kaiser share in this book.  Both of them carry scars from the past and they have shared these scars.  Now, the time has come for them to consummate the relationship they've developed.  Even though John has just received a serious bullet wound to the leg, his love for Jordan transcends this, and what results is a mature, poignant, and downright touching scene.  Instead of the usual focus on the sexual side of this lovemaking, Iles takes us into the hearts and souls of Jordan and John, and we feel for and with them in this moment of passion.  It's amazing how Iles can write from a first person POV as a woman.  He certainly does seem to understand a female's thoughts, and that's rare in writers today.<br />Next:  The brief, yet powerful, description of Jordan and Jane's \\"makeup\\" when Jordan is injured and estranged twin Jane comes to visit and take care of her..it's truly an accurate portrayal of the familial bond that very few events can shatter.<br />The tragedy of Jane's disappearance/death is brought home even more vividly when Jordan visits her sister's husband and his two children.  The children,of course, see Auntie Jordan as their mother, since they look so much alike.  Even distraught husband Marc has a hard time separating.  The ensuing scene where Marc gets drunk and wants to spend one night with his sister's identical twin, is heartwrenching, incredibly realistic, and an astounding writing feat.<br />Another powerful scene is between Jordan and suspected murderess Thalia.  Their conversation which reveals a terrible secret in Jordan's past unites them in a closeness that regardless of the outcome is something they both will remember.<br />And, finally, Iles has done something I've never experienced in serial killer novels:  I do feel the symmpathy and empathy for the murderer in this one.  This is because Iles has so carefully constructed this madman, and his revelation of his youth and past is so gut-wrenching and plausible, you can't help but feel pity for him, regardless of what he's done.  You don't condone or appreciate his evil; but you can certainly understand it.<br />The final scenes are both joyous and sad, and the novel's resolution is fitting, and you feel like applauding.<br />I wish Greg would bring these characters back in a sequel; they are rich, beautifully embodied, and a pleasure to have known.<br />Thank you, Mr. Iles, for such a beautiful and entertaining novel!<br />HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.ul scene is between Jordan and suspected murderess Thalia.

Connelly continues to exhibit his virtuoso writing skills in \\"Chasing the Dime.\\"  While it is not as well done as his Bosch or McCabe books, the book holds it's own thanks to Connelly's deft use of English language and strong secondary characters.<br />Henry Pierce is not the brightest hero in the world, although he is certainly a brilliant chemist.  Even with the background of his dead sister Isabelle, his involvement in the whereabouts of Lilly Quinlan seem far-fetched.  He is definitely a loner, even with his friends.  His relatioship with Nicole is certainly understandable as he is totally devoted to his work.  His attempts to reconcile are painful, but obvious.  The character of Lucy LaPorte (aka Robin) is well developed, yet she seems a little too \\"golden\\" by the end.  The identity of the culprit is quite a shock and I never suspected this character.<br />The ending is obviously open-ended, as we never find out who the biggest big shot is behind the setup.  So I hope he does a sequel to satisfy this little bit of cliffhangerism!!!<br />RECOMMENDED.  (Void Moon is better, though!)	2003-01-05

However, \\"Death's Door\\" is a disappointment.  Why?  For one, Slade has gone a little overboard with the gore in this one.  This book is almost sadistic in the way it presents the tortures of the many victims.  Unlike his other books, it seems as though the violence, carnage and explicit sex is piled on for gratuitous reasons.  By no means prudish, I feel this over use harms the book's many interesting plot twists.  Once again, Slade has done a tremendous amount of research on everything from the ancient Egyptians to the pyschological examination of Alfred Hitchcock's films.  Some of our favorite characters are back:  DeClerq, Nick Craven, Zinc Chandler, Mad Dog, George the Cree Indian; Gill McBeth; Jenna Bond, and even a nasty villain from a previous book.  It's hard to keep up with some of the information given, but it moves the plot along, and as usual, Slade's men go through hell to \\"get their man.\\"<br />A major concern of mine was the fact that there were a couple of major plot faux pas:  1.  Who was the Undertaker?  We were never given his identity, nor were we rewarded with knowing his outcome.  2.  Halfway through the back, it is intimated that the Undertaker \\"takes out\\" David Denning and we're led to believe he was shot.  However, later on, Dr. Denning reappears.  The Director (the head villain) intimates that the Dr. Denning was given plastic surgery to make him look different, but as who???<br />Slade usually doesn't have such gaps in his plot, so this adds to the disappointment.<br />A good book, but not as good as it could and should have been.

All because of witnessing his blonde mother being murdered at the hands of his father.  But what's truly amazing is the gullibility of his wife, Zelly.  Pat is an electrician, running his own company, and it's not until late in the book that she starts wondering who would be getting their house wired in the middle of the night.  And then when he almost rapes her, all she can think about is he made their infant baby cry.  Of course, throughout the book, the criminal profiles never suspect that a married man with a little baby could possibly be a serial killer.  The involvement of one of the victim's brother and a woman who survived his attack, also borders on the ludicrous.  Perhaps Ms. Hunter's true glory in this book is the way she presents the hookers, transvestites and gays.  Amazingly enough, these seem like the realest of her characters.  The book does build to a satisfyingly chilling climax and even though this is not great literature, it's a surprisingly effective little effort.<br />RECOMMENDED.	2002-12-31

The Alex Cross books have always been exceptionally well-written, carefully plotted and full of unexpected plot twists.  In &quot;Four Blind Mice,&quot; Patterson falls short in all these areas, giving us only a minimally enjoyable entry in this established series.<br />Alex's plans to retire are thwarted when his buddy John Sampson comes to him to help prevent the execution of one of his old war buddies, who has been wrongfully accused of three brutal murders.  Early on, we meet the &quot;Three Blind Mice&quot; responsible for a series of staged murders, setting up military veterans.  Why?  And who is their big boss?<br />Patterson spends too much time on the love interests this time; they don't really help further the plot or show us anything new about the heroes.  It's nice to have a lot more Sampson in this book, but Alex's relationship with Jamilla is so shallow, in comparison to all the other women Cross has supposedly fallen in love with.  Add the mysterious illness of Nana Mama, and a couple of scenes with dear Kyle Craig, and you come up with a diversional novel.  Patterson needs to remember what made Alex Cross so interesting and so successful.<br />This is the least effective of all the Cross novels.<br />RECOMMENDED ONLY TO THOSE FANS WHO WANT TO SEE ALEX CROSS RETURN TO FORM!	2002-12-28

That's what happened to me with \\"Impulse.\\"  Granted, Rick Hautala has created one of the most vile and despicable villains I've encountered.  Greg Newman, the sociopath in this novel, has no redeeming qualities.  What can you say about a [sick man] who:  pees in his ailing mother's water; spits ... into same; strangles a helpless stray cat; kills a black Labrador with a baseball bat; wounds another dog; beats to death an old woman, a convenience store clerk, a wino, a valet, and to top it off, he murders the book's short-lived hero, John Ross.  And that's only the beginning.  Watch out for the grisly and nerve-wracking finale, too!<br />First off, let's look at the back of the book and it's description:  it intimates that this worthless scumbag is seeking forgiveness from the policeman's widow; now, where in the world in the book is that ever seen?  And, it says he is getting close to her children (physically, maybe, but not in the affectionate terms).<br />The book has a lot of stereotypical characters and situations; widowed Angie and her kids, who actually are nothing but teenage brats.  She is constantly battling with them; they are constantly battling each other; her little boy is even battling other kids in his new school.  Sometimes there are so many scenes of this familial discord that it makes you want to scream or slap Angie!  Not to mention the overuse of Greg Demento's voices urging him on to kill.  The book also never says whether Angie takes the job that took her to Maine in the first place.  Brandy and her boy friend, Evan, are like two [X-rated] stars in their frequent sexual attempts, with Brandy whining she doesn't want to go all the way with Evan---yet....hmmm..could've fooled me.<br />But the biggest indicator of this book is its editing.  I think they must have been drunk when they did it.  Here's some rich examples:<br />a)The first time we meet Angie and her two young ones, she is on their cases for being up so late, particularly on a school night.  She goes on and on; the kids battle back, and you think, wow, what a family.  The next time we see them, and this is the next morning, the kids are amazingly not in school.  Little JJ is off playing computer games, and Brandy has traipsed off to the mall.  Why all this [stuff] about being up on a school night?<br />b)Later on, when cop John is on the phone with his friend, Frank, John's character mysteriously becomes Frank.  Hautala writes, Frank said..when it's really John!<br />c)  Okay, here we go again.  Nutcase Greg is hauling his killer bat around, ready to pounce and the author calls it his basketball bat?  Now have you ever played basketball with a bat?<br />d)  In several spots, Greg's name is mistyped Grey.<br />Being picky?  No, just amazed that someone of Hautala's stature is represented so poorly by these editing faux pas.<br />Oh, well, I had to read the whole thing to make sure that Greg gets his just desserts.  He does, but not before blazing one of the most sadistic murderous paths in fiction since the Marquise de sade!<br />This is a very uncomfortably dark book; there are no safeties in this one; bad things happen to good people, and you shudder as they do.<br />I recommend it if you find it in a bargain or used book bin, but prepared for one disturbing read.we meet Angie and her two young ones, she is on their cases for being up so late, particularly on a school night.

However, Harvey DOES manage to provide some very frightening scenes, and these are what elevates this book above the usual.  Jud McElroy, the young Police Chief of Braddock, NY, finds himself confronting the supposed return of the legendary Headsman, a murderer from the 1700's, who by legend, comes back every so often to take care of sinners.  But Jud faces even more trouble with the town's uppity town council.  Add to this a girl friend who wants to be the new Brenda Starr; a psychic who sees the murders as they happen; and a hellish blizzard---you have quite a setup for gore and goosebumps.  Harvey does a good job in masking his murderer's identity, giving us several false \\"herrings\\" and by the time the identity is revealed, you want to smack yourself for not recognizing the culprit.  Of course, our heroes do stupid things, and what would a good thriller be without that?  In spite of its length, it moves well, although we could have been spared some of the extemporaneous fluff that must have been added to make the book larger and therefore better? Ah, well, off with their heads!<br />RECOMMENDED.	2002-12-14

There is no explanation as to why the Senator has this gift, and why one of his resurrectees crumbles in front of a worldwide television audience.  Conveniently, other beneficiaries of the senator's gift turn out okay.  Overblown, overdrawn, and derivative, I give it three stars only because it holds your interest to a rather disappointing climax.	2002-12-13

He has a boss who hates him and the feelings mutual.  He has a best friend, Kelsie Brown, who is everything Joe is not.  Then one day out of the blue, Moreson's strongly supportive wife, Karen, shows him an advertisement for the sale of an old movie theater in a little town not far from San Francisco.  Seems like Joe's dream is to run his own movie theater, and this is just what the boy needs.  Right?  Wrong!!!<br />\\"65mm\\" is perhaps the most depressing and \\"hopeless\\" horror novel I've ever read.  Needless to say, Joe's dream turns into a nightmare, as the theater is actually \\"alive\\" and has its own minions to keep feeding it.  Seems like every Friday, Joe shows a movie that gets the audience to look at and confront their \\"Hiding Self.\\"  Now, what in the world this really means is beyond me, and Hoover doesn't really explain it.  Unless you consider Kelsie's hidden fear of doing something to his rabbits when he was a youngster?  Joe goes batty; Karen starts to worry; Kelsie comes in to save the day.  However, Kelsie and company have to be some of the most inept and outright stupid heroes we've ever encountered.  And the villains are so despicable, they border on nausea.<br />Hoover's book is really just a shade shy of being sadistic.  The gore is thrown on for effect; the heroes never seem to get anywhere, and even when they do, there's even more thrown at them.  Poor Kelsie suffers inhuman torture at the hands of the minions; his friend, Jeff, is also subjected to cruel and unnecessary torture.<br />I'm not a prude, and I like the gore to be appropriate, but this sadistic story makes you feel uncomfortable and when you're done, you can only say, \\"What in the world was Hoover trying to do?\\".  Fortunately, the book didn't sell too well and the inevitable sequel has never surfaced.  In fact, Hoover hasn't written since this.  Hope she's on Prozac!<br />NOT RECOMMENDED.	2002-12-11

The first and last parts of the book are a lot of fun---Koontz pulls off some delightfully zany scenes, but in the middle it bogs down with too much superfluous narrative and the characters bog down.  At first you think Koontz is going to pull a \\"Trilogy of Terror\\" rip-off, using the voodoo doll to torment our hero, Tommy Phan, as the little monster did in the Karen Black classic.  However, this doll grows as the story develops and turns into something out of \\"The Hidden.\\"  Deliverance Payne is obviously not what she seems and you can pretty much figure out what she really is early on, by just following her questions.  The dog, Scootie, is a typically well-drawn Koontz animal, but the real stars of this book are the hero/heroine's mothers.  Mrs. Phan is a laugh riot, as is Deliverance's mother who has about 75 different first names.  The book doesn't really have a real scary feel, some slight suspense, but the humor is certainly something you don't find in most of Dean's darker tales.  \\"Tick Tock\\" is enjoyable, though, but it's certainly not one of his best works.<br />RECOMMENDED FOR THE LAUGHS.	2002-12-06

Reading the \\"prequel\\" to this novel will give you a clearer understanding of Grover Mudd.<br />This novel asks was it possible that Bruno Hauptmann, the man executed for the kidnapping and murder of Charles Lindbergh's baby, had a female accomplice.  It all starts when Rick Beanbottoms, a hero from Thayer's \\"The Weatherman\\" and his lovely anchorwoman wife, Andrea, are the victims of a nefarious kidnapping of their one year old son, Dylan.  Rick's search for the villians sends him back into the past to one Grover Mudd, a newspaperman in the 1930's who was somehow involved in the Charles Lindbergh investigation, which eerily parallels the 1999 kidnapping.  Using great flashbacks, interpolated with the present dilemma, Thayer craftily constructs a tale of vengeance, murder, sex, duplicity, and loss.  The ending in the dome of St. Paul's cathedral is appropriately bizarre and tingling.<br />A good book that stands on its own, but with \\"Saint Mudd\\" becomes a wonderful, complex couplet.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2002-12-05

Focusing somewhat on the tragedy at Columbine, Peretti tells us of his own wounded spirit at the hands of bullies and insensitive people during his school days.  Peretti relates the story of the night of his birth, when his father had to replace a tire in a raging snowstorm.  The faith his parents have in God is awesome and he uses a quite unusual object to aid in his repair of the wheel.<br />Peretti is never self-pitying, and he offers some really wonderful insight into the reason bullying is such a devastating occurrence to a withdrawn, self-conscious young male.  I'm sure many male readers can share in the terrors that awaited the &quot;different&quot; in phys ed class and the showers.<br />Peretti then goes on to suggest ways we can heal our wounded spirits, and stand up for what we believe in.  He also tells us that when we wound, we too should ask for forgiveness.<br />This is not a preachy book, it is well written, and it can be read easily in one or two sittings.  It's a joy to read someone who has such faith in his Lord, and is willing to share his past with those who have also been there.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2002-12-03

In this one, it's the plotholes that are constantly attacking.  Although one must admire Huggins' attempt to parallel this story with Biblical references, and show the Christian fight of evil vs. good, he does it such a soporific way that I found it hard to get involved.  So many scenes are repetitive, contrived, and at times, laughable.  While Thor is definitely a heroic type, his battle with Leviathan can only be considered high camp, even from a spiritual point of view.  There is so much computer jargon that it bogs the story down.  Also, if you look at this dragon that these scientists have created, it is supposed to be the world's most effective killing machine, virtually indestructible, and yet a handful of humans manage to destroy the creature, but not before going through some hilariously impossible schemes.  Here we have another hero, Jackson Conner, a mere electrician, mind you, who fights like Spiderman, practically gets himself killed, yet manages to single-handedly finish off what Thor started.  Some of the characters just disappear, without knowing their fate.  And Huggins must love the word muscular, as he uses this at least twenty times with the heroic serviceman, Barley.  Conner's wife, Beth, serves no purpose but to hang around and moan, although she is clever enough to decode the special encryption set up to disallow anyone tampering with the GEO computer.  Which by the way is encrypted with the brain of Dr. Frank's dead wife, Rachel.  The scene in cyberspace is virtually (no pun intended) a big anti-climactic howler.<br />I appreciate the Christian approach to science fiction/fantasy; in fact, Frank Peretti does a beautiful job; however, Huggins spends so much time spouting out philosophies, his narrative loses its punch.<br />I WOULDN'T BOTHER IF I WERE YOU.	2002-11-30

Those were great witch stories.<br />Barbara Shapiro's \\"See No Evil\\" is one of those plodding books where you can predict almost every move the heroine, Lauren Freeman, will make.  She's separated from her philandering husband, Todd, and takes care of precocious and rather bad little boy, Drew.  Her best friend, Jackie, gets her involved in writing a book stating how important witchcraft was in shaping Colonial life in the 17th century.  The book opens with seven witches in the 17th century vowing to return every 101 years and do the same type of shenanigans they are doing now, and eventually, in 1995, they will become immortal.  So if you like silly reincarnation stories, this one's for you.  There's little suspense; Lauren behaves like a nincompoop.  Her affair with the handsome and successful Gabe leads exactly where you know it will.  Not a good entry in the witch series.<br />NOT RECOMMENDED.	2002-11-29

It was even written under a pseudonymn, David Axton?  At any rate, once he soared to his incredible heights of popularity, Koontz went back and revised this okay \\"thriller.\\"  When one considers the \\"Ice Limit,\\" by Preston and Childs, and Matt Reilly's adventure books, \\"Icebound\\" pales in comparison.<br />We have this collection of adventurers who are in the Arctic to blow up and iceberg and set it sailing south so that it can be used to replenish the earth's vanishing water supply.  But, nature doesn't cooperate at all, sending the snowstorm from hell to disrupt everything.  Add to that there's a psychotic killer on the loose, and a Russian submarine that wants to rescue the team because one of their members is the nephew of an assassinated US President, and that'll make the Russians look good.  The hero's wife has an incredible phobia of ice, snow and cold.  The characters are pretty much cliche, and the presence of the killer adds little or no suspense, as it's never clear why he or she wants to kill the aforementioned nephew.  It's all handled in pretty pedestrian fashion, and in the aftermath of everything, all the characters' fates are cleaned up...EXCEPT that aforementioned nephew.  Why 3 stars?  It held my interest and it certainly isn't a horrible novel; it's just way below the standards of the writer we now know as Dean Koontz.<br />RECOMMENDED ONLY FOR KOONTZ FANS AND PEOPLE WHO LOVE THE COLD	2002-11-26

Without going into a rehash of the plotline, suffice to say Russell Andrews has woven a tale of deception, intrigue, murder, betrayal, you name it..it's in there!<br />The novel opens with a mysterious suicide, and then goes on in so many different directions, your head spins.  But it's done so well, you can't help but get involved.  The characterizations, I think, rather than being cliche, are wonderfully original.  Take the hero, Carl Granville...he's so desperate he gets into something he knows very little about. But once he gets fully involved, he takes the bull by the horns and as any good hero would do, he sticks it out and comes out just fine in the end.<br />Momma One Eye is beautifully drawn.  Although she's not in the novel a lot, her presence is so essential, you can almost hear her chanting her psalms.  Then we have Harry Wagner, a very different villain...cold-hearted of course and irreprehensible, but there's a softness in him that makes you like him, just a little.  And then, of course, there's President Tom Adamson and his wife, Elizabeth.  Now here we have a different take on the president and his wife.  Tom Bickford, the vice president, stricken with Bell's palsy; Amanda Ways, Carl's ex-girlfriend who finds herself getting involved; Toni, the would-be actress who lights up Carl's life briefly; The Closer, a cold-hearted villain that you can't find ANY good in; Father Patrick Jennings, a priest who hears a horrifying confession; Nora Adamson, the president's mother, whose one scene is riveting; on and on, throughout, this novel cooks, and has some real shockers in it, too.<br />Wow, this book blew me away.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2002-11-25

Granted, the Holocaust is a horrible, horrible part of this world's history, and my heart goes out to anyone who was subjected to this heinous persecution.  But in this book, Patterson expects the reader to sympathize with a group of Jews who want revenge, and don't stop at anything to get it.  This is not a case of \\"an eye for an eye\\"; it is really a literary ploy to churn out this pedestrian novel.  There are so many plot inconsistencies and shallow characterizations.  How can the hero David Strauss fall in love again with Alix so quickly after his wife's murder?  And how in the world can we expect this doctor (a gynecologist) to become such a super hero by the end of the book.  I love James Patterson's works, but this is sadly rock bottom.<br />NOT RECOMMENDED.	2002-11-24

The interesting premise of a Nazi \\"catcher\\" still on the prowl is fascinating, but at the same time, Katzenbach makes us plod through a lot of superfluous narrative, that overstates many of the characters' inner thoughts and slows the pace down a little too much.<br />Overall, though, characters like Simon Winter; Walter Robinson, and Espy Martinez, are glowing in their richness and intricacies.  Even Leroy \\"F\\" Jackson, an ignoble druggie, turns makes an astounding turnaround in dealing with the horrifying murderer.<br />There are some riveting scenes, as well; early in the book, there's a scene where Sophie gets ready for bed, and it is laid out so slowly that it creates a tremendous aura of suspense, as you know the old lady is going to bite the bullet.  Unfortunately, other lengthy scenes, don't quite have this edge.<br />The ending is quite well done, and it has one of those \\"ah no\\" endings.<br />All in all, despite is plodding pace, it's a very well written story.<br />RECOMMENDED.	2002-11-21

Interesting concept, but it's handling is mundane.  Heroine Suzanna Lord is feisty, for sure, but she's also pretty stupid and careless, finding herself in more than one predicament she should have known better.  The most ridiculous scenario is when she tries to pass herself off as her military sister in order to get to the chief of the CIA.  She also has a lover named Jay who is tormented about something he didn't do in the Gulf War, and finds herself falling for one of the microchips recipients, an impossibly handsome artist named Andrew Dugan.  The pacing of the book is a little slow, and some of the dialogue is forced and derivative.  The main villain, Archer Mosser, is also cookie cutter monster, replete with damaged face and a muscled body.  There aren't many surprises and one can see the \\"surprise\\" ending a mile away.  But, if you are in the mood for fluff, this is adequate.  I don't think Spruill has ever caught on, since I'm the first to review this book, which is almost ten years old!!	2002-11-19

One is Kathleen from Boston; the other Colleen from a little village in Ireland.  Kathleen has some weird memories about a night in January that she can't recall, but upon examination by many doctors, she finds that she truly hasn't been \\"penetrated\\"; Collen likewise has never had sex with anyone, and both suffer from the disbelief and belief from others.  Of course, in America, the media hops on the bandwagon and turns it into a circus.  One can only imagine what would have happened to Jesus if he'd come now,too.  Of course, we find out through the passionate Father Nicholas Rosetti that the secret of Fatima has been revealed, and that one of these women carries the child of God, the other, the child of Satan.  It's intriguing to surmise which of these two innocents is the true virgin, and which one is carrying Satan.<br />There are some sinister subplots and one big question Patterson failed to answer:  who killed the doctor in the women's clinic in the opening prologue?<br />The other investigator, former nun Anne, is involved in all this mess, too, and she even had fallen in love with a dashing priest.  Their involvement underlines the intensity of the emotional tangle felt by those who were not meant to be in the religious life.<br />But, sit back, put your feet up and enjoy this well-crafted gem.  It's certainly not Patterson's best work, but it still beats a lot of other nonsense out there.  And James, you MUST give us a sequel.  It's not fair to leave us wondering what's going to happen.<br />RECOMMENDED.	2002-11-18

The concept of &quot;mind vampires&quot; is quite unique, and the shifting points of view, along with the first person narrative of Melanie Fuller, combine to make an almost perfect horror novel.  There are some marvelous characters including the sheriff, Rob Gentry; the heroine, Natalie Preston; and even the over-used Saul Latski.  I say overused only because Simmons employs a little too much reminiscing and self-pity in dealing with Saul.  Indeed, most of the flashbacks incurred by the characters, tends to slow the pace down, making you want the author to get back to what's going on now.  For instance, the first human chess games is novel and tense; when we go to the climaxing chess game, it seems very repetitive, tedious, and not as gripping as I imagine Simmons wanted it to be.  There are tons of villains, and at times, it's hard to keep up with them.  The main villain, the Oberest, Willie Borden, is such a shadow figure that when we finally meet him again, he doesn't truly live up to the expectations you have of him.  The character of Tony Harod, the movie producer, is so despicable that you want him out of the book long before he gets his just desserts.<br />But, if you stick with it, persevere with the immensity of the book itself, it is a rather major accomplishment.  The ending is sort of a surprise, and it's open-endedness smelled of a sequel, which I don't think Simmons ever gave us?<br />Anyway, plan to spend a few days with this book.<br />RECOMMENDED	2002-11-16

It opens in a small village in Italy where a priest practically has a stroke in hearing an old doctor's confession.  What possibly could it have been?  Then the priest is off to Rome to secure a meeting with a cardinal to relate this horrifying unimaginable sin.<br />Enter Joe Lassiter, a well to do private investigating enterpreneur, who gets involved with all this when his sister and her young son are savagely murdered and then burned to a crisp in their home.  Lassiter's trail leads him all over the globe, ultimately to a fertility clinic (or is it?) in Italy.  The book, like other Case novels, opens with this jarring prologue and then meticulously details lots of technical information, mysterious men, secrets, secrets and more secrets, and a look at a very unusual religious sect, determined to bring the Catholic church back to its days of Latin masses, and to completely ignore the Vatican II council.<br />It moves well, though, and I agree that Lassister takes a long time to figure out what's going on.  However, by the end, it all makes sense and resolves with a disturbing scene with a young boy and a fish bowl.  As in all of Case's works, however, the main flaw is that his climaxes seem to zoom in and then poof, it's over...but even so, my friends, it's a great read.<br />RECOMMENDED.	2002-11-13

Our hero this time is newspaperman Frank Daley, and he's quite the assertive journalist.  The plot is so involved that to retrace it here would be redundant and superflous.  As in all Case novels, he people it with some really nasty characters, and again religious sects play a big part in the whole scenario.  I did have a problem with the character of Susannah.  Here's this obviously ditsy young woman who has a child, casually murders people...puts poison...on the hero's steering wheel that sends him into...hallucinations, then when her religous leader tells her she isn't supposed to be having a baby, he engages her in a violent boxing match, puts a plastic bag over the baby's head, and then when it's done, tells her she did a good job, the baby is fine and she is actually thankful to him...that's stretching it..and the ending, as per previous Case books, is again anticlimactic, and over much too quickly.<br />But, hey, what the heck..it's one great roller coaster ride, so hop on and enjoy, and think WHAT IF?????

The young psychologist finds himself strapped to a table, his throat has a tube in it, and they're peeling his face off!  Yikes!<br />Then, we hear no more from Mr. McBride.

She goes to Florida, kills an elderly gentleman, returns home and kills herself in the tub.  What you say?  Enter half-sister Adrienne who blames Dr. Duran for her sister's demise.  What happens after this is let's pull out the plugs excitement.  Whether credulous or not,the novel moves along briskly and we realize there is a truly horrible plot afoot.  Suffice to say, you'll see what happened to Lew McBRide, and you'll join in the flight with Adrienne and Jeffrey, unlikely partners, but what else can they do?<br />There is some real chemistry that develops between the two, and as the book progresses, we find ourselves really liking both of these \\"weirdos,\\" so to speak.

However, Sandy isn't quite so smart when she finds herself falling for the prime suspect:  Dr. Nicholas Ramsey, charming, debonair and perhaps a hard-hearted killer.  Ramsey also had a brother who was a demented serial killer, and it is his motifs that a new killer is using in homage to the crazed Neville Ramsey.<br />There are some major inconsistencies, however, that keep it from being a true \\"5\\" thriller.  For instance, letters are being sent to Mansfield after each of the killings, urging her on.  However, when it seems as if one of the killings is a copycat crime, she still gets a letter with the main killer taking credit.  A big plot faus pax in an otherwise tightly written medical thriller.  The ending is rather overblown, but it works okay, and I guess one can't help but wish Ms. Mansfield well.<br />The book moves well and the dialogue is terse and believable.<br />RECOMMENDED.	2002-11-10

She is also a widow, with two engaging daughters.  Who should come back into her life but her teenage sweetheart, Otis \\"Campy\\" Camp, who went off to Vietnam and out of Amy's life.  But he's back and Amy's confronted with two hot and heavy lovers.  Meanwhile, the poor girls is having horrible nightmares about something that happened when she was four years old--in the woods, in the dark.<br />And, to top off everything, ER patients are dying from heart attacks that they shouldn't have died from.  Who is murdering these elderly gentlemen(all bankers at a certain height and age)and will Amy's billionaire father, Winnie, be next?  And what about Amy's mentally challenged brother, Phillip?  Is he is as \\"dumb\\" as he seems?<br />There are lots of histrionics in this book and it manages to hold your interest even with its many flaws.  The true villain is hidden quite nicely until about a third towards the end when the obvious becomes obvious.<br />However, Sprull has wound a clever, if derivative, tale, and is an entertaining read, just not a classic.<br />SLIGHTLY RECOMMENDED.	2002-11-10

Perhaps when one stumbles upon a good author and a great series such as Temperance Brennan, we get our expectations set very high and it's disappointing when we're let down.<br />Perhaps the problem with this book is its preachiness.  While I can certainly understand Ms. Reichs' horror at what happened in Guatemala, it tends to bog down the other mystery in the book, concerning the disappearance of four young girls and the discovery of a body in a septic tank.  Now, that's ONE unnerving scene, in which Tempe goes into the septic bank to remove the body.  It makes me think about what goes on in our septic systems.  The addition of Bat Galiano as a possible love interest also seems unnecessary; I think Reichs has prolonged long enough the romance between Tempe and Ryan.  They're obviously meant for each other, and her cute little ending about which one of the cops is Tempe running off with is really a cheap slam to her fans.<br />This book moves a little slower, and additonal preachiness comes in regard to stem cell research.<br />Write good mysteries, Kathy, as you have in the past and don't expose us to your views on world issues.  Including them in the plot is one thing, but jamming them down our throats is another.<br />But, hey, I'll be there for #6.<br />RECOMMENDED.	2002-11-08

What an awful thing; the description of the carnage, graphic as it is, is horribly effective.  The addition of the foot in a coyote's mouth adds more mystery to the event, and Tempe once again finds herself in deep doodoo!<br />There are some fine supporting characters in this, too:  Crowe, the sheriff, is an Amazonian doppelganger for Tempe's perseverance, determination and strong will; of course, Andrew Ryan, is back and someday Tempe's going to see what a catch Ryan would be if she'd only &quot;loosen up&quot; a little.<br />The inclusion of her daughter as a possible passenger adds some fire, and the reason for the crash is ironically appropos.<br />All in all, Reichs grows her characters and I look forward to more.<br />RECOMMENDED.	2002-11-07

I found both \\"Death DuJour\\" and its predecessor, \\"Deja Dead,\\" quite good.  I like the second one a little better, as I feel Reichs has found her \\"voice\\" in Tempe's character.<br />This book is a real whirlwind of complex plotlines, and there are times when Tempe is in Carolina that you wonder how in the world will these storylines converge?  I think Ms. Reichs does a fine job in showing the relationship to all the different things going on.  The mystery behind Sister Elizabeth is given a big clue in one of Tempe's dreams and although it certainly isn't the focal point of the book, it's inclusion demonstrates the vast amount of research Ms. Reichs' imbues in her works.<br />Tempe's relationship with Andrew Ryan is an interesting one, kind of like two alley cats in heat, but I hope their \\"courtship\\" evolves; I think he's good for her.<br />I agree with a previous reader that the addition of Harry, Tempe's wacko sister, is unnecessary; she reminds me of Marla in the Goldie (Diane Mott Davidson) series.  Superflous, and not really essential.  I think Harry's inclusion was to give Tempe a more personal interest in the cult aspect.<br />I was totally surprised by whom the culprit was in this one, and even though in some ways, it's a little bit of a let down (there's one other person I feel had more motive), but hey, she's the writer.<br />All in all, a book well written with some incredibly suspenseful scenes, a great knowledge of not only forensics, but cults, and religious propaganda.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.<br />Can't wait to make some \\"Deadly Decisions.\\"	2002-11-04

Books	4	1	2	N	N	NOT OF HUMAN KINDNESS	Taylor Smith's \\"Random Acts\\" plays out like one of those made for USA-TV Movies.  Here's some of the ingredients:<br />*A feisty determined female reporter who has recently divorced her no-good husband who has subsequently married her sister.<br />*A gorgeous but icy cold FBI criminal profiler who may have had something to do with her husband's (also an FBI undercover agent) murder.  Her husband, COINCIDENTALLY, was having an affair with above mentioned reporter.<br />*A rough and rugged FBI agent, a former cop, whose partner was killed mysteriously, and the father happens to be the father of the aforementioned reporter.<br />*A sneaky, yet sexy, FBI agent, who may have been having an affair with above mentioned criminal profiler, and who also may have helped in killing her hunky husband.<br />*A serial killer who kidnaps and then murders little babies.<br />*A dog who you know will somehow play an important part in a climactic scene.<br />So, with all that above, what happens?  Well, to Smith's credit, she pulls off an interesting narrative, some nice characterizations, and a somewhat surprising climax.  We can forgive her for some of her really mundane dialogue, and the plot contrivances that border on incredible.<br />But, and here's the point, it's a good read and one that entertains.  That's what it's all about.<br />RECOMMENDED FOR GUILTY PLEASURE.	2002-11-03

A hapless heroine returns to her home and begins to believe she is the reincarnation of her murdered aunt.  Only problem is, there's no proof her Aunt Nan is dead.  She simply disappeared about 18 years ago.  She supposedly ran off her ne'er-do-well boyfriend, Scott.<br />Our heroine, Alexis, finds out that when she was a mere toddler, she discovered the body of a young woman in a local pond.  Now, 15 years later, she thinks she may have even witnessed the murder.  She falls for a hunky artist, Josh, and they investigate the murder of another girl, a rival, Tawny.  Along the way we meet a dotty old woman named Dottie, who may be the reincarnated Josh's mother, and Alex's senile Aunt Sidney who thinks Alex is Nan.<br />There aren't many surprises in this book; the killer's identity is fairly obvious in the way Ms. Rule utilizes him in the book.  But it's a fun, spooky read, and one you should enjoy.<br />RECOMMENDED.	2002-11-02

I have only done it when absolutely necessary.  After reading &quot;Pandora's Clock&quot;, I don't think I'll EVER get on a plane again.  Quite a chilling premise, and overall, well told by Mr. Nance.<br />I sometimes felt that the dialogue was not realistic, and some of the scenes felt redundant and not totally necessary.  The characters are fun to &quot;ride&quot; with---Captain Holland and aide Rachel are typical hero figure and very likeable.  Holland's nemesis on the plane, a smarty-pants &quot;reviewer&quot; starts out pretty obnoxious, but turns out to be okay at the end.  The chemistry between Rusty and Sherry Ellis is fun and provides some additional levity.  Eager beaver and acting CIA director Jonathan Roth is one of those people John Lithgow or Tim Roth would play, and is effectively menacing.  The killer Russian pilot Yuri is an interesting character, although what happens at the end with him is a little far-fetched.  Nice climactic scene at the end, though, and does offer that chilling fear of &quot;What would happen if this really happened?&quot;<br />RECOMMENDED.	2002-11-01

Not being in that valued 18-49 age range, I sometimes feel the media ignores us to the point of absurdity.  I think it's great the real hero, Tommy, is just average looking, with a slight weight problem; now did the girl have to be so drop dead gorgeous?

For some reason, even though I had the book shortly thereafter, I never got around to reading it until now.<br />This book has some exceptionally well written scenes; vignettes that touch the heart and make for some truly memorable moments.  For instance, the hero (?), Evan Scott, needs to buy ammunition so he goes to an old childhood friend whom he has neglected since becoming a well established architect.  Their scene of what friendship can truly mean is really heartfelt.  Later, Evan,along with his unsolicited sidekick, Dass, are walking through Central Park and the elderly man suddenly reaches out and takes Evan's hand to hold and walk.  Although initially embarrassed, Evan lets him do that and they walk hand in hand, like a father and son walking along the beach.  It's moments like these that elevate this somewhat ineffective thriller to its heights.  Unfortunately, a series of touching vignettes and some suspenseful action scenes, do not a great novel make.  The plot focuses on Scott's efforts to stop a Hindu (that's right) mob from killing people who know about their secrets at a construction site.  A girl falls from the building, Scott catches her eyes on the way down, and from then on, Evan is embroiled in a complex scenario with the usual cops won't believe him, wife doesn't believe him, etc.  Add to this that Scott has a mistress who works in his office, and you get the ingredients for the melodrama ensuing.<br />I wish I could like this book more, but there are too many distractions.  Even though Dass is a wonderful character and his relationship to Evan really nice, his constant ramblings about the Hindu culture get repetitious after a while.  Likewise, the constant reflections of Evan's Vietnam days, while helping identify Evan's character and justifying his derring do, they too get a little too repetitive.<br />The book does show Smith's unquestionable talent with words and characterizations; unfortunately, in this case, they're so heavy-handed, we miss the thriller aspect.ble talent with words and characterizations; unfortunately, in this case, they're so heavy-handed, we miss the thriller aspect.	2002-10-29

Unfortunately, so much time is spent on the development of the characters and their &quot;dark secrets&quot; than to explain exactly what kind of horror the citizens of this little town are facing.<br />Suffice to say, the constant snowfall is unnerving and provides quite a &quot;chilling&quot; (no pun intended) atmosphere for this brooding tale.<br />The main characters are Marilyn, a woman recently divorced, who returns to Bastion Falls to start life over again.  And that's basically all we know about her background.  The other focal character is Shandy, a fifteen year old teenager, cursed/gifted with the ability to read minds and predict the future.  She is romantically involved with the rather self-serving David, and their romantic plight falls under the weight of not only the snow but Ms. Moloney's incomplete development.<br />The character of Candace Bergen (that's right, she shares the same name as Murphy Brown, and it was intentional) is so overdramatic that she comes across rather cartoonish, and by the end we don't know what happened to her. Also, there's mention of a body behind Northern Lights, and we never find out who it is, unless it's the carefully concealed identity of the town mayor?<br />I liked Hickory, the phys-ed teacher, only because he seemed the most real of the characters, and he wasn't overused.<br />The climax is rather disappointing, considering what you've been waiting for.  But alas, you get no real info on what happened at Fort Bastion and what these dreaded black things are, what they really want, or where they go.<br />Living in an area where schools are cancelled after the first snowflake, it was amusing to see how the school principal has to call a meeting of the school board at 3:30 p.m. to discuss what to do with all the kinds who got snowbound.  Should have sent them home earlier, maybe?<br />Also, the scenes involving Tully and Emma are grotesquely overplayed, and if Moloney expected sympathy for Emma, she doesn't get it from me.<br />All in all, it has a spooky feel and would make an interesting book to read during a snowstorm.<br />MILDLY RECOMMENDED.ound.

Only when this POV shifts to other people near the end of the book does this device seem so contrived.  All of a sudden, we're shifting between Pilot and Eric's point of view, and if that weren't confusing enough, we even get little Fiona's point of view.  If Smith is trying to suggest that Pilot has all of these thoughts in his head, it's a weak way out, and it almost negates the complexity of his work.<br />From the onset, I pretty much knew what to expect by the end.  Pilot was such a &quot;put upon&quot; youth, even by his older brother, Eric, that to think he was truly insane wouldn't have worked iin Smith's plot.  With that aside, it's just a matter of finding out exactly what happened to little Fiona.<br />We never really get to understand what's behind Katherine's seemingly compulsive behavior of biting her fingernails until they bleed; the section with Pilot, his father and father's mistress, Patricia, seems forced, and what happens when they are on the deserted island, also seems way out of nowhere.<br />Given all these flaws,though, the book does have some genuinely good thrills and Pilot's mental illness is handled well.<br />RECOMMENDED, BUT DON'T PUT YOUR EXPECTATIONS TOO HIGH.	2002-10-27

His dialogue is crisp, terse, and very believable.  If he sometimes overdoes it, as with the character of Bernie, it does serve to educate the reader into the different types of things going on.<br />The leading characters of Lou Boldt and Daphne Matthews are complex, and well-developed.  I did not realize that this is a part of a series featuring these two, so much of what they described happening in the past was new to me.  Does make we want to read more in this series, though.<br />The plot in this one is chilling:  someone is poisoning food and massing up killings in a revenge plot against the millionaire behind Adler Foods.  Adler is also Daphne's love interest.  There are no real clues in the beginning, but as the drama unfolds, ATM machines play a huge part in the extortion plan of the killer.<br />Lou's relationship with his wife, Liz, is credible and realistic.  The supporting characters particularly John LeMoia and Kenny Fowler are also strong and well-written.<br />The biggest problem with the books is its length.  It's long, and there are several times I found myself losing interest in some of the secondary storylines.<br />But it is an excellent read, and I do recommend it.	2002-10-26

We know that from the start, but that doesn't weaken or nullify the suspense.  It's in wondering how and when the old guy will get caught.<br />Using the familiar background of a child being abused sexually, physically and psychologically by an older sister, Solomita's novel nonetheless validates the use of this background.  I didn't feel a lot of sympathy for old Zeke, but one has to admit the abuse he had to take while a child is horrifying.  Once Zeke gets into the army, though, and becomes a sniper, we learn how his twisted mind relates to snuffing out women's lives.  It's amazing that he gets away with it for so long.<br />Pat Detrick is an interesting female lead, and her involvement with security guard Rick Morello is fetching and believable.<br />My deepest regret, however, is the rather nebulous ending wherein we don't know exactly what is going to happen to Pat.  One can only hope it's good stuff.<br />RECOMMENDED.	2002-10-24

He is brainwashed and becomes a suspect in a bombing that kills two people.  As most heroes do, he stupidly runs from the FBI, and tries to find out what really happened on that bizarre weekend.<br />Along for the ride are several standard characters:  the vulnerably shy FBI agent, Jill Landis, who falls in love with Herr Berger; the power-driven Combs, who resurrects a government program called \\"Mirage\\" after it is shut down by the government; Chuck Durham, one of those nice, well-built guys who knows all about mind control; Berger's mother who is one heck of a woman; and several other cookie-cutter characters that serve no purpose but to help advance the plot.<br />But, look, I don't think Passman wanted great literature, just a chase novel, that is loaded with some pretty effective scenes, and even a major plot twist at the end that you didn't see coming.  All in all, a good diversion.<br />RECOMMENDED.	2002-10-21

Wouldn't you be the most happy person on earth, particularly if you were the embattled and waning NASA?  Darn tootin you would.  And thus sets off this intricate and exciting book by the talented Dan Brown.  Brown follows up his breathtaking \\"Angels and Demons\\" with this tale of deception, power, greed, murder, skullduggery and just out and out non-stop edge of your seat thrills.<br />Rachel Sexton, a \\"gister\\" for the United States, is approached by the president to verify that this remarkable find is indeed the truth.  Once she lands at the site and joins with several civilian scientists, including a handsome Michael Tolland, who is also the host of a popular \\"real life\\" adventure series, she begins to suspect all is not what it seems.  And thereby spins this tale.  Brown has peopled his book with some outlandishly evil and suspicious characters such as the downright ugly Marjorie Tench, who seems almost as powerful than her boss, the President; Senator Sedgwick Sexton, the incumbent's opposition in the upcoming election, who also happens to be Rachel's father.  Sexton will stop at nothing to get what he wants---the power of the presidency.  We also meet William Pickering, Rachel's by the book boss; Gabrielle, Sexton's assistant who has her own agenda for power; and lots of other good and bad guys.  The suspense is relentless, as Brown shifts from scene to scene, leaving mini cliff-hangers along the way.<br />A technical master, Brown has obviously done his homework and his addition of realistic facts and dilemmas adds to the nightmarish tone of the book.<br />A great adventure, maybe not quite as electrifying as Matt Reilly, but still good on a more cerebral level.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED	2002-10-20

As much as I admire King, though, I wish he hadn't totally abandoned what he did best:  out and out scary tales that made you shudder when you read them--the vampires amid the seeminly normal \\"Salem's Lot\\"; the bond of childhood friendship and the impending horrors of \\"It,\\"; the doomed people greedily seeking their gluttonous fantasies in \\"Needful Things,\\"; the evil car in \\"Christine,\\"; the victimized \\"Carrie\\"; and all of his other truly scary stories.  While I have enjoyed his short stories, most notably in \\"Skeleton Crew\\" and \\"Night Shift,\\" I never fully enjoyed \\"Nightmares and Dreamscapes,\\" nor this current collection of fourteen \\"dark\\" tales.  It seemed as though King was insistent on being a literary force, one who would be taken seriously as something other than a \\"horror\\" writer.  I feel that King's status as a horror writer is what has made him the force he is.  So with that in mind, let me say that I only read thirteen of the stories, as I never could get into the Dark Tower series.  The stories I read have a varying mixture of plot and character studies, and King continues to reign supreme with some of the characters he gives us in this collection.  The narrator in \\"L.T.'s Theory on Pets\\" is a brilliant narrative, that is both funny and eerie.  If L.T.'s wife was really killed by the Axe Man, where is her body and who is the Axeman?  All of the stories have something of merit, but not all of them were truly scary or unnerving.  \\"The Road Virus Goes North\\" is a spooky tale, but is reminiscent of the Night Gallery episode in which Roddy McDowall sees his fate change on the picture.  That still doesn't negate the terror in this story as the writer knows his fate is coming after him.  It's one of the best in the book.  \\"Riding the Bullet\\" is unsettling in that it really doesn't explain itself truly.  The hero's encounter with the dead driver is quite frightening, but its denouement offes little other than that the boy's guilt over the death of his mother haunts him; what IF he had stayed with the crotch-grabbing, pee-smelling old man?  One of my favorites is \\"This Feeling, the One You Can Only Say is French\\".  This deja vu thriller works on several levels, and its conclusion is haunting, it's one of his best I think in years.  \\"Lunch at the Gotham\\" is out and out gory slapstick, that gives us a crazed maitre'd, with King's underlying theme that no one really pays attention to what goes on around them.  And do we ever really know why the wife left her husband?  \\"Luckey Quarter\\" (and why is the luckey mispelled?) is a hopeful story that shows a mother's love and faith in her children---but scary?  Dark?  Not really.  The opener \\"Autopsy Room Four\\" is a blatant rip off of an old Twilight Zone episode, which King readily admits.  His method of discovering the cataleptic corpse is however very up to date, sexually oriented, I'm sure, to please our current marketplace of readers.  \\"1408\\" is a wipeout in my opinion.  We get this guy held by a foreign country for his contributions to a drug lord; he gets out, and makes it back, so what?<br />This book also has several significant subplots involving smoking; I wonder if King has some kind of hidden agenda in this one?<br />At any rate, King's fans won't be totally disappointed in this collection.

However, when this book was re-released in the mid-nineties, Morrell chose to go back and do the book the way it was originally envisioned.  Morrell's creative desires aside, I wonder if the original was any better.  It couldn't have been any worse.  I am only harsh on this book because it is heralded on the cover as one of the best horror novels of the past twenty years.  Ooops...someone's tastes and mine are vastly different.<br />What do we have here anyway?  It opens with a Marlboro-man clone (Sam Bodine) looking out over his vast property and then he goes down and finds his steer (they are not cows, as Morrell points out) horribly mutilated, but nothing was eaten.  So did a wild animal do it?  We then meet Nathan Slaughter, a relocated Detroit cop who was wounded in a gunfight in a convenience store, and who has come West to start a new, peaceful life.  The problem with Slaughter is he is at heart a coward, he readily admits so.  Then we meet all sorts of characters that piddle along and add to the body count.  The Bodines disappear and we never find out what happened to them; a little boy gets bit by a raccoon and turns into a sniveling, carniverous animal, and we begin thinking perhaps this is a story about werewolves.  Morrell gushes in his introduction that one of his favorite books was Stephen King's \\"Salem's Lot\\" which took the vampire legend and combined it with \\"Peyton Place\\" subplots, and he's right, \\"Salems Lot\\" is an incredibly good novel.  But Morell missed the point severely.  In trying to do the same, he comes out with little character development and an incoherent, muddled plot.  Evidently some hippie commune in 1970 somehow got this mysterious virus (we never find out how), and they've turned into something like a werewolf, but not quite.  We have to put up with a drunken, washed-up newsreporter who by the end of the book is a mute idiot, and the ending is so whitewashed and contrived, I almost laughed when I put the book down.  And what is the totem?  Morrell gives us the definition in the front of the book, but I can't quite seem to figure out what it has to do with anything.<br />Sorry, guys, this is in my opinion one of the worst horror books in the past twenty years.  Now I see why he stuck to Rambo.<br />NOT RECOMMENDED.  TWO STARS ONLY FOR SOME OF THE SCARY SCENES.quite.

There's so much wrong with this book that it's hard to focus on some of the pluses:  like the creepy atmosphere he establishes in the opening murder scene of Brad Evans; the detail and horror he gives us in the Rockwell building itself; and some of the earlier expository scenes.  But, here's what bothers me most:<br />1.  The pacing is incredibly slow, and Saul once again uses the \\"thought overs\\" to rehash things we've already talked about, and nothing new occurs in them.<br />2.  Doesn't Caroline marry Anthony Fleming a little quickly, particularly since she's having such a hard time getting over the murdered Brad?<br />3.  And aren't Ryan and Laurie two of the worst brats you've read in a while?  Ryan's antics in the last part of the chapter are about as believable as the Loch Ness monster.  He's shown no resourcefulness up to this point, so his emergence as a hero is somewhat hard to swallow.<br />4.  Who in the world is the little boy in the basement, and was he the one who had the italicized dream (it was a he, but it wasn't Ryan?).<br />5  What in the world happened to Anthony's first wife and sons and daughter?  Did they just disappear---does Saul expect us to use our imaginations that much?<br />6.  And who killed Brad and Caroline's best friend?  Saul doesn't let us know.<br />7.  And what in the world happens to all those lovely old people?<br />8.  And what is the significance of the shattered tombstone at the end?<br />I am not trying to spoil anything about the book for readers, but this novel seems so hastily written and so poorly edited, I wonder why Saul even wrote it.<br />NOT RECOMMENDED.	2002-10-16

Suffice to say, what goes on in the caves is a wild ride, indeed.  It's a very cinematic novel, one that would probably be easier to digest if it were a movie.  Much of the cave description becomes redundant, and sometimes the actions of some of the heroes borders on stupidity.  But the characters have their strengths, especially those of Damian Finnerty, the dedicated marshal; Chester, the brilliant but tubby 19 year old who really solves many of the mysteries; and Cricket, the resourceful 14 year old who becomes a real woman during the crisis.  (Physically as well as metaphorically---which is one of the original plot devices Sullivan uses).  It's almost a Matt Reilly book in that the action is pretty consistent, although far from the cataclysmic action that adorns Reilly's books.<br />A good read, though, with plenty to keep you occupied.<br />RECOMMENDED.	2002-10-15

Ultimately, in spite of the book's flaws, it has a dark noirish feel, and Thayer pulls some surprises, and yet are they really that surprising?  If you think about it, the main surprise is pretty obvious, but even though you may think about it early on, you don't quite think it's so.<br />The setting of 1960 is a unique one, and its inclusion of the Nixon-Kennedy presidential campaign is not only historically significant, but intricate to the plot.<br />The main problem is the narrator himself, Pliny Pennington.  He doesn't seem all that heroic, at least in the traditional sense.  He seems to have a low moral code; a self-pitying attitude about his sexual inadequacies; and a thirst for vengeance.  Also, he is an out and out voyeur.  His love for the victim, Maggie, seems like one of those adolescent crushes left unfulfilled, and what did he really see in her anyway.  The rest of the characters are all as deep as a trickle of water, so you end up not really caring about any of them.  There really isn't one likeable character in the whole book.  So, with that in mind, it's to Thayer's credit that it's still an okay read, just not as good as his previous works.<br />There are many better books out there to read, folks.  Check out \\"Swan Song\\" by Robert McCammon or any Michael Connelly books.	2002-10-14

I had NO IDEA how I would be BLOWN AWAY by this mammoth classic.  Although compared to King's \\"The Stand,\\" this novel goes a little bit further into examining the people behind the terror.  McCammon's post-apocalyptic view of the world is frighteningly realistic.  But what this horrifying novel so brilliant is the richness of the characters he has created.  There are so many wonderful characterizations in this novel that it's hard to begin writing about them.  The ultimate battle of good vs. evil is convincingly and yet \\"fictitiously\\" told.  Some of the things that do stretch credibility feel quite at home in McCammon's hands.  And oh what hands!<br />To me, the character who stands front and foremost, and upon whose shoulders this novel truly stands is Sister Creep.  A combination of Whoopi Goldberg/Carol Burnett and Rosie O'Donnell, this woman is truly a heroine to be admired and respected.  Starting out as a bag lady in the pre-nuclear New York, Sister Creep shows such fierce dedication, loyalty and strength that you can feel her reaching out of the book to embrace you.  I don't think there's ever been such a rich female characterization as Sister Creep in any horror novel I've read so far.  And I've read plenty!!  The way she and her ragtag crew of survivors forge ahead to find the mysterious Swan is heart-rending, encouraging and downright amazing.<br />Close behind is Josh, the Black Frankenstein of the story.  A Professional wrestler (i.e, actor), Josh embodies the strength of his gigantic size with the gentle heart of a child.  Like Sister Creep, Josh feels the need to \\"protect the child\\" and goes through several visions of hell to do so.  His relationship with Glory and Aaron in Mary's Rest is simply beautiful.  McCammon is uncanny in his capture of what characters feel and don't express.<br />And then of course, there is Swan.  What a remarkable character.  We first meet her as a helpless but magical child, who is left parentless after the apocalypse.  Her fate has been decided and she is the one to save the world.  As she matures into a young woman, we can see the confusion, fear and doubt in her mind, sort of a Gethsemane, but she grows so much in her resolve, her love of mankind, and her belief that there is good in the world.  Simply a beautiful creation, no doubt.<br />The other characters, both good and evil are outstanding:  the manic Corporal Macklin; the blood-thirsty boy Roland Croninger; the ill-fated Leona; the happy Rusty Weaver and Artie; the evil Lt. Lawry; the prostitute Sheila; the demented Alvin; even the President of the United States.  There are SO MANY I can't begin to let you know how good they are.<br />And, of course, there is the evil one...the man with the scarlet eye...never has a creature of such evil and malevolence wormed its way into the pages of modern horror.  He is worse than Hannibal Lechter; Jason; Freedy; Michael Meyers; he is closer to the devil than anyone in this genre.<br />This book is outstanding; it will move you and will stay with you long after you've closed the pages.

Her leading character, Nicholas Cross, has the \\"honor\\" of being the first male to carry on and act like one of those whimpering heroines from countless romance books, who bemoans all the terrible things that have happened to him, and does little if anything about it.<br />I'm not trying to be too hard on Ms. Manz, but Nick is not your typical hero.  A successful horror writer, Nick lives in guilt for the horrible murder of his wife five years earlier.  What's worse is that his twelve year old son, Jeff, was there when the murder took place, and he feels guilty about not being there when the dastardly deed took place.  Now, five years later, looks like the murderer (who was never caught) is back at it again.<br />We meet one Thomas Bevin, an egocentric who claims to be an \\"occultist,\\" which is not necessarily a psychic, but who can \\"direct\\" supernatural things.<br />We also meet one Miriam Cramer, a spiritualist writer, one who can touch a person's hand and get psychic vibes from themm.<br />We also meet Diane Nelson and Alan Howarth, the two detectives assigned to the case, of course Diane falls for Nick immediately and thus ensues a real problem in the story.  Diane's career is obviously a tenuous one, and getting involved with such a whiny wimp as Nick, is certainly not going to further her case with her media-centered boss, Lt. Parks.<br />The story takes off with the apparent suicide of Nick's self-proclaimed \\"best fan on earth\\"--a moonstruck 19-year old named Daniel.  Daniel spends the night with the Cross family, and the next morning, is found dead in the same chair Nick's wife Linda was found mutilated and murdered.  Suicide?  You know better.<br />The story piles on so many different attempted twists and turns, from the strange Bobby Tarp to the equally strange Carl Neff.  But, it's a derivatively written book that neither scares nor delights.  Ms. Manz has potential, but since she has written only one other book, it more than likely was never reached.<br />NOT RECOMMENDED.she has written only one other book, it more than likely was never reached.<BR>NOT RECOMMENDED.	2002-10-11

Maggie joins her friend Gwen Patterson, partner T. J. Scully and policewoman Julia Racine in an attempt to catch the culprit.  It appears that a serial killer is on the loose.<br />I liked this book, in spite of some of the things I found either annoying or incredulous.  First of all, the annoying.  Kava proves that the youth of our society have listened to too many adults and have adopted profanity as their main vocabulary.  Almost every other word uttered by the teen boys is \\"F\\", and no wonder, since many of the adults use it proliferously too!  Not a prude by any means, but there came a point in the book that it became overbearing and annoying to the plot ... Nick Morelli was also underused in this novel.  And what about Ben Garrison, the seemingly self-centered, death-obsessed photojournalist.  Could he really get away with the photographs he takes and sell them for money?<br />The characters are stock, but still worth spending a few hours with ... However, some of the relationships revealed do come as a surprise.  All in all, this is still a good series ...<br />RECOMMENDED.	2002-10-10

I have read most of Mr. Little's books, and found most of them to be entertaining, although some (Like \\"The House\\") have been mundane at the least.  \\"The Return\\" is perhaps the most ridiculously plotted horror novel I've read in years.  People are introduced (Like Bonnie and Richard) and we never hear from them again.  The leading characters are as cardboard as they can get.  Glen Ridgeway is such a superficial, self-centered loser.  Melanie is almost as bad.  The professors are dumber than most students, and to top it off, we get a barbecued child (?); people going crazy and doing really dumb things, towns disappearing, volcanoes arising out of nowhere, and so much padding, it felt like a Depends.  The only scene that was original and quite funny is when the mayor of a town that is preparing to battle another town, walks into his office, finds his secretary [making love]on the floor, and tells her to stop it and come take minutes.  That is funny.<br />Unfortunately, Little tries to equal the expanse and depth of Stephen King's \\"The Stand\\" and \\"It\\", and Little just can't match the master.

Well, here it is, and it's a winner.  Terry is now married and has a young child, and is drawn into a complex murder case by his former cohort, Jaye Winston.  Of course, Graciella doesn't want him involved, even though they would never had met if she hadn't drawn him into her sister's murder years earlier.  Anyway, Terry jumps in and guess who the main suspect is?  Hieronymus \\"Harry\\" Bosch!!!<br />The way Connelly uses Harry's name is unique and a focal point in why Terry thinks Harry's guilty.  Of course, Harry's involved in trying to put away a sleazy Hollywood director, accused of murdering a rising starlet.  The case rests on Harry's testimony, as the smug killer confessed to Harry that he did indeed kill the girl.<br />Terry investigates and finds many unusual clues, such as an owl, which leads him to discover the painter Hieronymus Bosch, who Harry was named after.  The pictures reveal murders that fit the graphic crime scene, and McCabe is certain Harry may have finally gone off the deep end.<br />The plot moves along and you keep wondering, what in the world is going on?  Is Harry bonkers? Is he being set up?  And why did Graciella turn out to be such a whiny woman?<br />This is answered and more, and the dark sides of both Terry and Harry are revealed.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2002-10-07

Connelly offers Bosch this time in a rather unusual dark, brooding story that indicates Harry might be on the way out?  It's hard to tell, although as Harry thinks about things, maybe it is time? I certainly hope not, as Harry continues to develop into a quite complex character:  a man who has many, many good points, but continues to develop his darker side, and pulls a couple of things in this one, too.<br />A dog digs up a bone, that turns out to be the humerus of a young boy, who has been missing and dead for twenty years.  In spite of myself, I did enjoy the pun when Harry's talking to the command desk sergeant:  \\"Harry, come on..humor us on this humerus.\\"  Connelly's wit is sharp, if derivative!<br />Harry and Edgar (who continue to exhibit a rather unusual friendship; Edgar seems jealous of Harry and hurt when excluded)become involved in the case.  Harry falls head over heels for a new rookie, Julia Brasher, who shares some of Harry's darker side.  Of course, Harry is not supposed to be shacking up with a rookie, but you knnow, Harry----nothing stops Harry from what he's doing, whether it be right or wrong.<br />As the case builds, a former pedophile is involved; a seedy friend from the little boy's past, and of course, the father and the sister.  It's a web of intrigue, deceit and false leads, and Connelly masterfully weaves them to the predictable, if strange, denouement.  \\"City of Bones\\" is not the best, but it is a marvelous addition to the series.

There's one time in here in which his new chief, Grace Bittell, looks at him and says, \\"Harry, why don't you grow up and stop these pissing games?\\".  Bravo, Grace.<br />Now, don't get me wrong.  Harry's still a great cop and he has a nose for finding out the details in snaring his criminals. Although in this one, he and his cohorts Kimz Rider and Jerry Edgar, blow it big time.  But the new chief is a more intricate and understanding one than the previous Harvey Pounds.<br />Anyway, in this multi-focused book, Bosch is up against the murderer of a small-time Hollywood producer who is killed in the trunk of his Rolls Royce and it looks like a mob hit.  Of course, Harry is not so sure about it, so off her goes to Las Vegas to do more research.  He stumbles upon a likely suspect in Luke Goshen, who is more than what he appears to be.  Lo and behold, Harry also stumbles upon his former love, Eleanor Wish, who has spent five years in prison for her part in a nasty crime committed in an earlier work.  So add this to Harry's problem and you've got quite a bit of trouble brewing.<br />Connelly makes this work for him most of the time, although I tend to agree that the ending comes a little quicker than usual and even though we have an exciting climax in a little shopping mall, there's even one more little twist that Connelly tags on that's not really that exciting.  However, there is a surprise for Harry at the end as far as his love life goes.<br />All in all,  you really can't go wrong with Harry Bosch or Connelly.  He's a great writer and you can't help but fall in with Bosch and his bullheadedness...he gets the job done!!<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED	2002-10-04

Even though that's the whole premise behind Harry Bosch, his flagrant disregard for his superiors and for the badge he wears sometimes makes him infuriating.  But, heck, what the heck...this is a darned good entry in the Bosch series.  It has a lot of haunting imagery and his dealings with the murder of his prostitute mother bring out a very poignant and sensitive side of Harry that he is too willing to hide.  Poor Harry...once again, he is \\"suspended\\" because he put Harvey Pounds (you'll remember him from the previous novels) head through his glass window.  Now undergoing psychiatric evaluation by a very understanding female psychiatrist, Harry decides to take his off time and investigate the 30 year old murder of his mother.  No one ever solved it, and of course you know that Harry will dig deep to find out who did it and why.  This one has plenty of surprises, including some deaths you won't believe happened, and a real twist at the end.  Women may pick up on the hidden clue better than men, as we tend not to worry about how we're dressed.  Anyway, I have to agree with a previous reviewer who found Harry's terminated romance with Sylvia somewhat disappointing.  Seemed like in the \\"Concrete Blonde,\\" Harry and Sylvia were at a reconciliation point, and now she's gone off to Venice.  What happened, Michael?  And now Harry's involved with a woman named Jazz, and he's head over heels in love with her, but I gather from the previous review, she's not mentioned in Bosch's next novel.  What gives, Michael?  Getting Harry into bed is not a requirement of these novel's excellence.  It tends to weaken Harry rather than strengthen him.  Hopefully, as I go through the series, some of these questions will be resolved.  If not, so be it.  It's still a compelling read and one that adds credence to the continuous of the Bosch series.<br />RECOMMENDED.	2002-10-03

CONNELLY'S TALENT	I had read \\"Concrete Blonde\\" about a year and a half ago, not knowing it was the third book in the Harry Bosch series.  Now, I have read the first two Bosch books, and see how good a book \\"The Concrete Blonde\\" is.  Bosch is as always a well-developed and complex \\"hero\\" or \\"anithero.\\"  At least in this one, Chief Irvin seems to be a little more understanding and appreciative of Bosch.  Bosch also shows his sensitive side as he refuses to the ruin the career of a fellow cop who leaks information to the sharp lawyer, Honey Daniels.<br />The book balances the courtroom action and the new Dollmaker case with marvelous dialogue and scenarios.  It's hard to really judge Harry on what he did with the Dollmaker four years ago. Was he right?  Is he a cowboy?  Does he really like death and violence?  These questions aren't quite answered, but we still get a feeling of what Harry's gone through since this case started.  Bosch also solidifies his relationiship with Sylvia, the ex-wife of a cop who was featured in \\"Black Ice.\\"  The ending intimates more to come in this regard.<br />My favorite character in this one is \\"Hans Off\\", the administratively proficient, but criminally incompetent, lead investigator.  He is good at getting a coffee pot in the team's unit, but can't think of anything on his own.  A sharp character.  In fact, Connelly's supporting cast is always very well developed.<br />A great read, now on to the \\"The Last Coyote.\\"<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED	2002-10-02

I also found some of the dialogue a little more wooden than usual, and once again, Harry falls in love at first sight.<br />However, those things aside, Connelly thrusts Harry into a labyrinth of deception, greed, murder, leading him across the border to Mexico.<br />Bosch is certainly to be admired in his pursuit of justice at the risk of his own job.  Sometimes, it's frustrating for me that Harry seems to focus on nothing but his desires and his wishes.  He doesn't seem happy with his job, so why does he stay in it?  Wouldn't he be better off as a private investigator.  He has no friends, and it's because he's such a lone wolf.<br />Now that I've sounded off about that, I will continue to finish the Bosch series, as Connelly is a skillful writer.  This just isn't one of my favorites.<br />RECOMMENDED, THOUGH.	2002-10-01

It's Edgar Award is justified in that this is a good debut novel.  The plot is intricate, well-woven, and ultimately satisfying.  The climax is fairly predictable, but Bosch is a good hero, one that has flaws and lets his solitude at times interfere with his job.  However, almost all of his peers are jerks, especially the unbelievable doofuses, Lewis and Clarke.  FBI agent Eleanor Wish is a good supporting character, although her relationship with Bosch is fairly predictable in its outcome.  There are some great scenes of &quot;film noir&quot;, although Connelly at times gets a little carried away with his various descriptions.  The young boy, Sharkey, is an interesting addition, neither likeable or dislikeable, but a good addition nonetheless.<br />Connelly's expertise as a criminal writer for the LA Times is evident in his knowledge of how police procedurals, although the stock characters in official roles sometime seem unrealistic.<br />I like Connelly's non-Bosch books better, but the Bosch series is certainly one to contend with.<br />RECOMMENDED	2002-09-30

ONE REVIEWER IN THIS SERIES LET OUT SEVERAL KEY PLOT TWISTS!  DON'T FORGET...EVERYBODY'S NOT READ IT YET!<br />With that out of the way, I must say that I was disappointed somewhat in the novel.  Margolin takes a little more time in this one in capturing us right away.  After the interesting opening, there is too much time before any more significant scenes ensue.  Also, in this book, his hero, Daniel Ames, is certainly likeable, but he comes across pretty stupid in some of the things he does.  Like going into someone's house and finding the place ransacked; a good lawyer would NEVER do something like that; and when he arranges to meet Briggs later, he doesn't use good sense to take someone with him; and then he later agrees to meet Dr. Sergei Kanadiov (something like that!), and again goes alone.  His criminal background also seems superfluous, and like other reviewers, don't think he'd have been admitted into the bar association.<br />HOWEVER, once things get cooking, Margolin proves his skill in throwing some red herrings in.  The identity of the woman in the photograph really took me by surprise, although I figured who she really was in her past.  I liked some of the other characters, too, particularly Billie, the police detective; Joe Molinari, Dan's friend who really pulls through.  Flynn is utterly despicable, as is Briggs.  It takes a while to get hooked on this one, but it's better than most other books out there.<br />RECOMMENDED.	2002-09-27

While some may claim his characters appear superficial, I don't agree.  A reader has to use a little of their own intuitive imagination to fully interpret the characters.  Margolin gives us David Nash, a high-profile lawyer, whose clients are almost always guilty---and he gets them off.  Even though he's called the\\"Ice Man\\", Nash is anything but.  He finds himself getting involved with his clients and their crimes.  His hopes rise when he is given a client that he feels is innocent.  (Even though, he has reservations).  He is defending a rising young lawyer, Larry Stafford, who is accused of brutally murdering an undercover cop posing as a prostitute.  His wife, Jennifer, believes he's innocent, but guess what----she is involved romantically with David, his lawyer!  (This is one aspect that bothered me a little, in that Jennifer and David fall in love much too quickly to be believable).  However, Margolin uses this entanglement to create quite a labyrinth of problems.  Early on, we meet Thomas Gault, a man who Nash manages to get off in the brutal slaying of his wife.  Gault's character is bonechillingly evil.<br />The novel shows the moral dilemmas lawyers and policement must confront in trying to bring criminals to justice.  Ortiz, the young cop, who is the murdered cop's partner, faces such a crisis, and of course so does David Nash.<br />The resolution is satisfying in that the criminal is brought to justice, but what a price Mr. Nash must pay.<br />FINE READING<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED	2002-09-26

Margolin gives us the murder of two upstanding young people on a November night in 1960.  Richie Walters has just asked cheerleader Elaine Murray to go steady with him.  Their love and hopes for a future together are gone before you know it.<br />As we examine this murder in depth, we find there are many people involved, and we find ourselves wondering, who really killed this couple?  And why?<br />The immensity of characters doesn't overwhelm the book; you may stop and ask yourself, why are these characters introduced?  But by the time the book is finished, you'll see why.<br />Although the lawyers and the suspected killers are certainly strong focus in the book, I found the heart of the book to be Esther Peglosi, the rather ... teenager who becomes the key witness in the prosecution's case.  We first meet Esther as a rather well-developed young woman who doesn't have trouble bedding anybody, but we are also introduced to horrifying facts about her childhood and her parents.  Later on, Esther is cunningly seduced by a cop obsessed with the case into being hypnotized, and here we begin to see how the power of suggestion breaks down this girl, and how her love for this cop propels her toward inevitable disaster.  Esther's character is very, very well written and she holds the book together.<br />It's interesting, also, to see the development of young Mark Shaffer, the up and coming lawyer, who finds himself defending the accused Bobby Corbett.  He starts out totally ineffectual and enamored with the defendant's live-in girlfriend, and ends up becoming savvy and accomplished.  The denouement of this novel is shocking, in what happens to Bobby and Esther.  Also, the deathbed confession of the titular character is a whopper.<br />Can't forget to mention the true villain of this book and that is officer Roy Schindler, who uses his authority to basically fix the case and use poor misguided Esther.  Although Al Caproni is culpable, too, he is just another victim of the political schematics.<br />A STUNNING AND WELL WORTH IT BOOK.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.guided Esther.

We've had this book in our home library for years, and I've finally gotten around to it!  Wow...did I waste some time!  This is an outstanding, well-written and terrifying book.  Margolin has captured a lot of \\"personality\\" within most of the characters in this book:  flawed, driven, ambitious, and of course with the killer, actual demonic qualities.  The book is filled with many surprises, including some really nasty ones, too!  I especially liked the characters of Alan Page and Betsy Tannenbaum---lawyers that seem to have a true sense of justice, fighting even their own demons.  Betsy's failing marriage to Rick at first seems cliche, but as it evolves and it's final dramatic resolution, we can see how two people who love one another let jealousy destroy their lives.  The character of Nancy Gordon is also a good one, and one has to wonder during the proceedings if she could perhaps somehow be involved in the killings.  But at the heart of this book is Martin Darius and Peter Lake----these guys are truly villians in the worst sense of the word.  No remorse, no compassion, evil to the core.  A stunning book that certainly made me go in and put the rest of his books on my wish list; hopefully, my wife will have such a hard time deciding which ones to get me for Christmas, she'll get them all!<br />HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2002-09-24

It's a building!  Kerr's \\"The Grid,\\" originally published in 1995 as \\"Gridiron\\" is a very good way to spend a few hours.  Full of stock characters and some rather cliche situations, it nonetheless is a fun trip.  Seems as though this building's computer has decided to \\"generate or procreate\\" and the smart computer whizzes make sure they kill the offspring...or do they.  On a Friday evening, like an Agatha Christie novel, all the principals are brought together into this fantastic building, and then one by one, they are all picked off in uniquely grotesque fashion, as the building locks them in for the weekend.  Some of the deaths are quite gory, and some come unexpected.  Kerr paints a rather nasty portrait of our villain, Ray Richardson, but attempts by the end of the novel, to make this villain see the error of his ways and become a hero.  Not the smartest thing to do, but it works anyway.  Earlier in the book, when one of the first murders occurs, Richardson warns his employees they are not to attend the funeral unless they take personal leave.  Wow, sounds like someplace I used to work.<br />There is an important clue early in the novel, one that you may miss, so keep those attentive reader's ears open.<br />This is a fun book, and even though it gets pretty far-out at the end, I still had fun.<br />RECOMMENDED.	2002-09-23

This is my first Greg Iles' book, as I have not been a favorite of espionage or spy thrillers.  However, this book is one heck of a read!  Over 600 pages long, it still maintains interest throughout and is definitely one of the best serial killer books I've read.<br />With that said, I won't go into the details of the book, as it has been expertly done by other reviewers.  What makes this such a stunning novel is the rich characterizations Iles has given to his characters;not just the leads, but even some of the supporting characters, as well.<br />Of course, the book would have no foundation if not for the main character, Harper Cole.  This is not your typical hero, in fact, he's quite an antihero at times.  Selfish, childish, sexually confused at times, and a keeper of dark secrets.  However, Harper is so well fleshed out, I felt like I was right with him during the entire narrative.  His relationship with Drewe, his wife, goes from intermittently shallow, to an incredible depth of emotion.  He is intelligent and savvy in his dealings with the on-line killer, but still sweats out any confrontations with him, either on line or off.  His response to what happens with his sister-in-law, Erin, is heart-wrenching, and I found a little moisture in my eyes during much of this and his confrontation with Drewe about his secret.<br />Drewe, likewise, is no usual heroine.  Not only is she brilliant, but she is deep in her love for Harper, and proves to be a formidable adversary to the killer in the flinchingly suspenseful climax.<br />Miles Turner, Harper's friend, also turns out to be quite the antithesis of a true hero.  His involvement in the killings is quite surprising, and establishes the many levels this gentleman goes through in the book.<br />The policemen and FBI characters are quite good, too.  Although many books try to portray cops and FBI agents as pretty ineffectual, Iles gives them the depth of human nature we all possess.  One of them, Billy, is the freshest depiction of a \\"Down home\\" cop on paper.  Billy is not quite the typical redneck you expect, although he's not the brightest guy, either. But he possesses a strong sense of justice and takes his job seriously.<br />Bob Anderson, Drewe and Erin's father, at first appears to be one of those stuffy influentials that everyone in political circles is afraid of.  Nonetheless, by the end of the book, we again see a well-developed, complex man, driven by the love for his daughters.<br />Of course, what would this kind of book be without a superior villain?  And we have one of unbelievable cunning; heartless, brilliant, and in a rare accomplishment, Iles actually makes you feel just a pinch--pinch, mind you--of sympathy.  The on-line conversations he has with Dr. Lenz, Drewe and Harper are brilliantly written.<br />The only character we never really fully understand is Erin's husband, Patrick, but I think Iles wanted us to feel isolation from him, as his role is one of mystery as well.<br />All in all, this book ranks up there with the best, and Iles has won me over!<br />HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.of a \\"Down home\\" cop on paper.

Okay, in this one by Little, we get a 13 year old who starts longing for his 17 year old sister; a little girl who splats a kitty cat onto a rock to offer sacrifice to an ancient bathhouse; a Bible that flies around and kills a minister; a woman who gives birth to a smiling cactus, and a little elf that runs around killing people!  Enter the strange world of Bentley Little, born not long after his mother attended the world premiere of \\"Psycho.\\"  Thank God, she didn't have him while watching \\"Halloween,\\" God knows what Bentley would have turned out like.<br />Nonetheless, this is one of Little's more intriguing books simply because he does have some shuddery, scary scenes.  The characters are typical Little characters:  cardboard, one-dimensional, easily dispatched.  There is a great deal of gore and sexual situations, so it's definitely not one for the young folk.  Adults who enjoy this genre should enjoy Little's tale of a town that is haunted by some kind of Russian spirit, turning a nice all-American family into something close to the Osbornes, but I'll admit, nothing could be as bad as the Osbornes!  (Ha ha).<br />Anyway, RECOMMENDED FOR FANS OF THE GENRE.	2002-09-17

Might explain why it seems Ms. Heckler only tried one more thriller after this one.<br />Heckler's prose is terse and succint, and her chapters move quite smoothly, with brief &quot;vignettes&quot;, alternating different POV's from her characters.<br />Unfortunately, we know who the killer is early on in the book, and despite attempts to &quot;legitimize&quot; his craziness because of his overly disciplinary father, the killer is so cold-blooded in his crimes that no sympathy can be elicited (at least on my part).<br />Deena and Tim's marriage is so superficially &quot;perfect&quot; that it becomes less realistic just about the time Tim is done in.  While one does empathize with Deena and her five year old son, Jon, her belief that Tim was murdered comes so quickly that it's not credible either.<br />The addition of the mute witness and her devoted daughter are essential to the plot, but otherwise thinly etched.<br />The climax in the cave is anti-climactic, as we know there can be only one resolution.<br />The character of Martin is so self-pitying he offers little except for his part in the unraveling of the so-called mystery.<br />Not highly recommended unless you find it in a bargain bin.	2002-09-15

It's quite voluminous and at time tedious and boring; in fact, I had to force myself to continue after the first 100 or so pages.  But I stuck with it.  And although it's not a classic, Herbert does manage to create the most unusual protagonist in some time.  Nick Dismas, a PI, reincarnated from a major Hollywood star, is not your typical private investigator.  He is hideously deformed, and Herbert doesn't let you forget it as he continues to reiterate this awkward self-pity in the first half of the book over and over again.  He also spends much too much time on explaining how Dismas' investigative service works, and he does it too much as well.<br />However, if you stick with it, the last section picks up and features some rather gruesome spectres and some suspenseful moments.  The characters of Constance Bell and Louise are also very well-developed.  There are many things that happen in the book that are quite far-fetched and incredulous, but nonetheless spooky.  The denouement in the Restless Peace nursing home is full of scares and thrills.  However, the last scene is somewhat \\"dismal\\" and ends on a rather down note.<br />Herbert obviously is preaching about our society's attitude toward those who are not physically perfect, and it's ironic in some ways that the handsome Hollywood star is sent back from Hell in such a despicable guise.  Herbert also preaches on the use of drugs, the existence of God, and the loneliness of homsexuality.<br />A rather difficult read, but for its originality it gets the three stars.  RECOMMENDED WITH RESERVATIONS.  DON'T EXPECT A CLASSIC.	2002-09-13

While \\"Hush\\" is certainly a worthwhile effort from a new writer, it's far from the classic that so many have credited it.<br />While the plot is unique in its depiction of a serial killer, Frasier doesn't do a lot to add much to the whole genre.  He has, what else, a mother who has abused, dominated, and humiliated him all his life.  The dead baby letters that purportedly push him over the edge is stretching credibility, and the denouement is fairly predictable.<br />Now, what's good is the dimensions she gives Ivy Dunlap and Max Irving; they are quite different for leading roles, and at times, they're not that all likeable.  Ethan Irving is a real pain in the..., whining and worrying about who his real parents are.  His going off with the killer is also somewhat immature for a sixteen year old to do, but it does make the plot more \\"chilling.\\"<br />A graphic, somewhat overwrought, novel, but has some merit in its narrative and does demonstrate Ms. Frasier's potential.  RECOMMENDED.	2002-09-11

As it stands, though, the Kaminskey's fall short in providing the chilling doomsday of the aforementioned children with the white eyes.<br />Instead we have twelve children released from a cult commune by their insane leader, Josiah Hummock.  Once released, the complex is blown to smithereens and Hummock along with it.  (Although don't miss an early reference that might provide a hint to the ending?).  At any rate, FBI Nick Burrows and psychologist Sally Price try to get the kids out without any violence; when it does occur, Nick is blamed and sent to a field office in Tulsa.  He also loses his globetrotting wife, and he hits the bottle!  Nothing new, there, huh?<br />However, four years after the event, the children all disappear from their homes; two of them fake their deaths to lead them, and a deadly plan is set forth in motion.<br />While an interesting premise, the Kaminskey's fail to generate the chills or impending doom they obviously intended.  The childrens' murders are predictable, although the poison in the doughnuts is a new one!  Burrows and Price rush to convince everyone that the kids are plotting something, but no one believes them.  Typical again.<br />This book, written in 1999, obviously hoped for a sequel, as the ending is another one of those, \\"never count out the bad guys\\" finales.  Since no sequel has emerged since then, one can only feel a little cheated by the nasty ending.  RECOMMENDED, BUT ONLY MARGINALLY.	2002-09-07

Racina is such a \\"cinematic\\" writer, in that his books feel like made for tv or straight to video movies. But, that's okay, as long as they're entertaining.<br />This one is a hoot!  Some of the dialogue and the descriptive narrative is a riot.  I remember one section where one of the characters, Ben, is said to \\"chortle.\\"  Who in the world uses the word chortle?  And the characters are some of the most shallow I've read in some time.<br />Audrey Goh is supposed to be so beautiful she stops clocks..but she's also a tease, and rather a self-centered one at that.  She kidnaps her boyfriend, Mark, and whisks him off for a secret weekend in a maximum security apartment complex she is building.  And all, just to get him to propose.  In addition, she is pregnant.  Her best friend, Bobbie, your typical \\"dumb blonde\\" warns her that Mark is not worth it.<br />Earlier in the book, we find that someone wants revenge on Audrey and her family for causing the suicide of his father and subsequent death of his mother, too. So he waits ten years and lo and behold, he's back to carry out his revenge.<br />I was kind of surprised at the identity of the revenge-filled lover; the inclusion of a \\"Rear Window\\" peeping Tom is also misleading, but that's okay, cause it does keep you guessing.  But then the plot really soars into mayhem.  A Chinese couple wants to buy an apartment in the complex; turns out they aren't who they say they are; then an elderly Chinese couple gets mercilessly killed; and we find out that somehow (and I still haven't figured out yet how), a bomb is placed in the safe, set to go off at 1:00 a.m. on Saturday morning.<br />An unlikely, but courageous, hero emerges and the race is on to save the damsel in distress.

Thom Racina has become a master of what I would call the \\"soap opera thriller.\\"  And that is not all meant to be derogatory.  As a former writer for \\"Days of Our Lives,\\" Mr. Racina has learned what people really want---escapism.  So he gives us stereotypical characters, predictable plot developments, and the usual sex/scandal/murder collage.  And he does it well.<br />Who is so obsessed with Judy that he/she wants to bump off anybody who likes the girl?  Is it the strange gardener Juan?  Or how about her new boyfriend, Ben?  And what about her roomie and former lover, Skeet?  Or is it someone else?  And why did Judy's first lover kill himself?  And why did her second one disappear?<br />Racina weaves this mystery in good style, and he keeps you guessing until you realize that the obvious killer is right in front of your eyes.  The character of Annie Chestnut is a hoot; she reminds me of Kathy Bates or maybe even Roseanne Barr.  Her private investigation styles are vastly reminiscent of several of the popular \\"cozies\\" and she steals most of her scenes.<br />The epilogue is kind of disappointing in light of what the reader has experienced in the book, but it is a twist I hadn't expected.  Also, the scene in the gondola where Judy and Ben are forced to decide who jumps out is so overboard, it's hilarious.  But, don't get me wrong.  I devoured the book.  Only reason I didn't give it the fifth star is the epilogue.  Otherwise, I recommend it---it's a fun escapist fare!	2002-09-04

Well, that's why it's so much fun.  \\"Hidden Agenda\\" reads like the script for a tv movie of the week with Jaclyn Smith and Gregory Harrison, with Leslie Nielsen and Dabney Coleman as the villains.  But, I have to admit, I really enjoyed this book.  It certainly sets no new standards for contemporary fiction, but as an old fashioned, good guys vs. bad guys, political vs. religious fanatics, it's a whopper!  We NEED perfect husbands like Steven Patterson; we need gullible heroines like Jonelle Patterson, who works her way up from a child with an alcoholic mother, not to mention a problem of stuttering, to become the most famous newscaster in the world!  Sure, the use of real people in fictional roles is quite a manipulative move, but it adds a little color and humor to the goings-on; and the love scenes between Rex and Clay, though brief in number, are outright ridiculous.  But, what a fun read.  There are several scenes of suspense and you have to wonder---will they make it in time???  The finale is so over the top it's wonderful!  Catching the villain right on t.v.!  And the epilogue is so woefully predictable, that you almost want to say, \\"What else?\\"<br />Ah, but readers, if you are looking for a way to kill some time and have some fun along the way, grab this one and have fun!<br />RECOMMENDED	2002-09-03

But, \\"Minutes to Burn\\" is far too long, and filled with useless description and repetitive sequences.  A blend of every sci-fi/horror cliche of the past twenty years, the novel starts off well, but gets bogged down by a little too much technical garbage, and scenes that seem padded to expand the characterizations.  Unfortunately, most of the characters in this book are not that likeable.  Once again, we are treated with a Sigourney Weaver pair of female warriors, one black, one white.  Szabla is so obnoxious in her braggodocio that I wanted to slap her several times; meanwhile, the tough Cameron is such a self-centered, whining brat that she and her husband Justin come across as the Ken and Barbie of the future.  Savage is such a pompous and evil, insensitive character that one can't find much in him to admire.  That leaves Tucker and Tank as the only real likeable SEALS, and poor Derek goes off so weirdly, and becomes a father figure to the larva of one of the monsters.  Needless to say, Daddy doesn't fare too well.  Through the novel, we learn that Derek's child died a horrible death, obviously at the hands of its mother, but in the revelatory scene, we aren't really told WHAT the heck happened.<br />But, nonetheless, the last section of the book does move better, and the action sequences are very well developed.  The inevitable sequel looms, but I don't think Hurwitz has anywhere to go with this one.<br />Not a horrible read, but not one I'd recommend at this time.	2002-09-02

However, Hoffman has a strong command of his environment, and even though there are many flaws in this why did they do it?, it's still worth reading.<br />Four men go off hunting, and right away we find out that one of them has been killed in an unfortunate \\"accident.\\"  Hoffman is to be commended for not making the West Virginia law enforcement the typical hillbilly buffoons.  Bruce Sawyers is a modern, healthy, young efficient sheriff whose investigation leads to the possibility that the accident was indeed a murder.<br />Although Walter is certainly not the most stalwart of heroes, his emergence at the end makes up somewhat for this lack of bravado.  Along the way, we meet some interesting characters including Phyllis Duke, a woman with a very strange history; Drake Wingo, the he-man hunter who has found his newfound \\"fame\\" pivotal in his decision making; Cliff Dickinson, a rather foppish artiste type who is the supposed murderer; and Boomer, a clerk at the Grizzly store whose brevity does not diminish his interest.  Unfortunately, the main female focus is Josey, and she comes across as being rather selfish and uninteresting.  The inclusion of the Prince from Arabia story only serves to slow down the otherwise engrossing story.<br />There aren't many surprises; you can pretty much figure out what is going on, but it doesn't dilute the quiet impact of this story.  Drake's exposition while hunting in the last section is a hauntingly realistic expose on how we refuse to face the truth.<br />RECOMMENDED.	2002-08-29

After finishing the book, I thought to myself: this is one preposterous, overblown, confusing and inconsequential book.  However, after digesting some of the better points, I found out that though is quite a \\"weird\\" book, one can't help but enjoy the narrative style of two geniuses of modern horror.  As in any King/Straub book, there are moments of sheer brilliance in some of the dialogue, some of the imagery, and some of the humorous things even the bad guys do.  This one is also replete with lots of gore and carnage, and most frightening of all, it's focus is on the kidnapping, murder and cannabalizing of small children.  If you haven't read \\"The Talisman\\", you may find yourself lost in some of the background, regarding the Territories.  I read the book a few years back and I still got lost.  However, \\"The Talisman\\" is too big a book to go back and read.  There are times in this book when you want to push King and Straub on to wrap things up a little quicker.  And the disappointing lack of resolution to the Marshall family situation is a big faux pas--after spending much of the book with Fred, Judy and Ty, we only know what happens with Ty.  And, unbelievably, the authors who serve as the narrators flying around on a crow(?), have a disclaimer that lets you decide if you want a happily everafter ending, or a not so happy one.  The choice is yours, they say.  Of course, who ISN'T going to finish the entire book?  I wasn't too pleased, to say the least, but it obviously leaves room for more tales of Jack and Sophie.<br />Now, what makes this book really worth the \\"4\\" rating is some truly exceptional characters:  Henry Leyden, the blind comrade of Jack, is one richly realized character, full of pathos, bathos, humor, wit, intelligence, courage and compassion.  It would be like having Anthony Hopkins steal a movie away from Tom Cruise.  Leyden is brilliant.  Also quite good are the motorcycle gang consisting of \\"dropouts\\" from society:  intelligent, college educated men, who have a big part in the story and whose bravery, persevarance, and sensitivity are not what one usually expects in a motorcycle ensemble.  What happens with Mouse is extremely unfortunate, but well conceived.  Other characters well-developed include:  Wendell Green, an outright obnoxious news reporter, reminiscent of the evil guard in \\"The Green Mile\\"; Chipper Maxton, the deceitful and conceited owner of the Maxton Nursing Home, who certainly gets his come-uppance; Fred Marshall, the father of one of the children who goes from a tough, \\"together\\" salesman to an on the brink father, terribly afraid of losing his son; the cops are also fun to read about, even the rather \\"goofy\\" one who blows the cover on some important facts when he tells \\"only his wife.\\"  The way this spirals into a community newscast is funny, and so realistic.<br />Wow...all in all, it is a big, big book....and if you suspend your belief of what is real in this world, then you should have a grand time.<br />RECOMMENDED FOR KING AND STRAUB FANS AND READERS OF \\"THE TALISMAN\\".ant.

Nevertheless, &quot;Meltdown&quot; is not the enthralling book &quot;Sea Change&quot; was, at least to me.  &quot;Meltdown&quot; is overburdened with technological narrative.  Powlik is obviously a brilliant man, and brings this expertise expertly into his novels.  However, for the average Joe like me, I don't want such indepth explanation.  It merely serves to distract me from the plot of the story and more importantly, the characters.<br />While Powlik has done well with his main characters (Carol, Brock, Sergei, and Junko), I can only call Charon and Krail derivatives of hundreds of other suspense/thriller novels.  The inclusion of Victor is certainly ethnically powerful, but his involvement merely serves as &quot;politically correct,&quot; instead of powerful characterization.<br />By the time the novel gets cooking, and that's not until the last third, it has merely limped along to get there.  The romance between Carol and Brock is a pleasant surprise, considering all they went through in &quot;Sea Change.&quot;  However, Sergei's romance with Junko is manipulative and the resolution of such is rather &quot;mean.&quot;<br />But, if you like a lot of technological background, you won't be disappointed, but I cannot recommend this book on a higher level.	2002-08-25

In reading a review of \\"The Straw Men,\\" I found out that Michael Marshall has also written under the name of Michael Marshall Smith, and \\"One of Us\\" was his.  Wow...has he EVER come far!<br />\\"The Straw Men\\" is one of those books you can't put down.  Marshall creates a web of mystery and terror that has long been missing from recent thrillers.  His mastery of the English language is awesome, and his use of both the first person and third person works beautifully, and he is to be commended for pulling it off so well.<br />The heroes are all well-written and not without their flaws.  Wade, Bobby, John and Nina are all flesh and blood humans, with dark secrets, hurts, and fears.  The villains, of which there are many, are surprising and unrelentlessly wicked.<br />The book has a lot of stuff going on, and if there is a tendency to get a little confused, it merely adds to the emotional impact of the book.<br />The plight of fourteen year old Sarah Becker is well-developed and one can't help but empathize with this poor girl in her terrible situation.  Although there are obvious hints to the true identity of the main villain, The Upright Man, his identity still comes as quite a shock, and the \\"resolution\\" of the novel is frightening in its implications.  I sincerely hope Mr. Marshall plans on a sequel...this is great stuff.<br />HIGHLY AND UNRESERVEDLY RECOMMENDED.<br />ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR!	2002-08-22

Joe Gray, Dulcie and the tortoiseshell Kit are fun to spend a few hours with.  They seem so &quot;human&quot; in their dialogues, and the way Murphy gets them to do the crimesolving continues to be clever, resourceful, and highly imaginative.  Now, if that were only true of the humans!  The Senior Survival Club is a nice gesture, but all five ladies are basically interchangeable and sometimes I found myself forgetting who was who.  Vivi Traynor is such a caricature, derivative of any dumb blonde in any mystery novel.  The real mystery is pretty easy to follow, and solve, IF you remember what goes on when Charlie sneaks peeks at the so-called great novelist's current work.  I don't know why Murphy keeps Kate Osbourne's character---she's used very rarely and her connection to the cats, which is pretty awesome if you remember from previous books, is never fully utilized.  Also, there is a little too much description of the areas, the houses, the women's dresses, etc.  I am not trying to be a spoilsport or a nasty critic.  I love cats...our 20 year old feline recently passed away, and we've acquired three new delightful kittens.  I wish I could communicate with them! But, this book is definitely worth reading if you've followed the series.  And thanks to Ms. Murphy for her knowledge of cats and sharing it with us feline lovers!	2002-08-20

Klavan is very reminiscent of Thomas H. Cook in this tale, but Cook has mastered the art much better.  Cook doesn't give away his ending so early.  There's a lot of merit in this book; Klavan's narrative skills are sharp, and there is much empathy for the character of Peter Blue.  However, I found little empathy for Cal Bradley or his wife.  Bradley seems immune to his surroundings and although he can help other people, he can't seem to help himself.  To be married to Marie for so long and not realize what an emotional void she had, doesn't add much in the lines of credibility. By the time the book comes to its all too inevitable conclusion, I couldn't like Bradley or his wife very much.  Peter Blue's fate is inevitable, but their lack of moral terpitude is unforgivable.  RECOMMENDED ONLY FOR KLAVAN'S FANS.	2002-08-18

Michael Connelly sure knows how to spin an intricate and original tale, as he does in \\"The Poet.\\"  I've read some of his books out of sequence, having read \\"Blood Work\\" prior to this one.  I am a little confused as in \\"Blood Work,\\" the poet killer is mentioned, but not much else is given away.  So as far as this book goes, it is a maze of twists and turns, and many surprises.  The character of Jack McEvoy is a strong one, possessing both flaws and attributes.  His involvement with FBI agent Rachel Walling is also interesting.  William Gladden's character is gleefully evil, and his killings abominable.  The denouement is full of shocks.  I do have to admit though that the motivations for the Poet are not fully developed here, so I was hoping for a sequel to tie up the many loose ends.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, THOUGH.	2002-08-16

And this book has tons of it.  I like the characters (at least the heroes) very much.  The villains----wow...there are enough here to populate a dozen books!  Suffice to say, you're in for a real exhausting read on this one.  Bears, kimodo dragons, crazed prisoners, South African hitmen, Air Force traitors, resurrected dead men, you name it---it's here.

At least not the upstanding, moral heroes we're used to in thrillers.  With \\"Void Moon,\\" Michael Connelly gives us Cassie Black, a casino robber par excellence, who finds herself in jail for manslaughter on a hit that went terribly wrong, and cost her the life of her lover, and as the reader finds, even more.  Cassie then finds herself lured back into one more crime so that she can start a new life.  Of course, that's not always so easy.  From start to finish, this is an exceptionally riveting and brutal exercise in crime.  So even though Cassie is not the most \\"moral\\" of heroines, she is someone you root for and admire for what she does.<br />The main villain, Jack Karch, rivals Gary Soneji (from James Patterson's books) as one of the most vile and disgusting killers in modern fiction.  There are some really brutal scenes in this book, but they are depicted with such ferocity, you can feel the visceral impact.<br />The concept of the \\"void moon\\" is also eerily employed in striking fashion.<br />THIS IS A HIGHLY RECOMMENDED BOOK.	2002-08-12

Conrad Voort, believe it or not, is a moral man, who goes to church and prays asking God for help not only in his personal life, but also in his cases.  And with this case, he finds himself looking for people on a list who may or may not be murdered, although their deaths have been made to look \\"accidental.\\"  His friend, Meechum, embroils him in this plot, and when Meecham disappears, Conrad and his reliable partner/friend, Mickie, try to stop an unbelievable terrorist type of plot.<br />Along the way, the hormone-driven Conrad falls hard for Dr. Jill Towne, one of the people on the list.  Conrad's past relationship with Camilla (who lied about aborting their child)surfaces, and the book ends on a \\"what if..\\" type scenario.<br />The first third of the book is engrossing, although it tends to sag a little in some parts, becoming a little too talky, but it entertains.  The ending seems somehow rushed and far-fetched, but you can't help but root for our hero, and hope the nasty villain gets his just desserts.<br />A top notch thriller, highly recommended.	2002-08-10

Terry is no super-human, that's for sure.  Also liked his relationship with Buddy Lockridge, who becomes his &quot;driver,&quot; but still wants to be a real detective, too.

I've always been a fan of Saul's novels, although many of them were so similar in theme and characterization, it's hard to tell them apart.  However, with this shocker, Saul demonstrates his gift for characterization and riveting suspense.<br />Jeff Converse's fate is one of those \\"I Can't believe these idiots think this man is guilty.\\"  Once the seemingly impossible plot emerges (sort of a twisted \\"The Deadliest Game\\"), we follow Jeff's horrifying entrapment in the massive tunnels of New York.  Add some really strong supporting characters such as his estranged parents, his undoubting girlfriend, and a heinous bunch of villains, you have quite a story here.  Jagger, the ruthless killer, who becomes a friend to Jeff, is also a great character---couldn't help seeing Vin Diesel in the movie role.  The real stars though are the homeless people.  Particularly, the teenage Jinx.  She's a really well-developed, fleshed-out character, whose bravery and perseverance, help Jeff immensely.<br />This, undoubtedly, is Saul's best book yet.  His departure from a true \\"horror\\" novel to psychological suspense is welcoming, and one can only hope he keeps up the good work.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2002-08-10

Clara's quest for revenge is bloodthirsty and she'll stop at nothing to get the mob leaders who set up the hit.  Of course, Lucas is in the process of wedding his also-pregnant lady, Weather Kinneman, and this figures in the plot, in a rather shocking way at the finale.  There are some real plot twists, and the action never lets up.

It is a mind game, and there are times when you really start wondering if Dale has lost his mind.  There are several disturbing scenes with the black dogs, especially in how it starts out with one small dog and gravitates to several huge killers.<br />It's a good book for a cold winter night to read by the fireplace and look over your shoulders.<br />Simmons is an ace writer.	2002-08-03

Ms. Davidson continues to decrease her ability to create any type of suspense or as one reviewer, put it so nicely \\"dramatic tension.\\"  By the time you get through all the descriptions of the recipes (a gimmick that has gotten old in the last few books), you really don't have much in the way of believable characters or even a tidy mystery.  Marla is not used much in this one at all; Tom is sidelined as a kind of \\"Father Knows Best\\" figure; and Arch continues to be a real pain in the butt.  Goldy doesn't show much disciplinary skill at all in handling his smart mouth and surliness.  Even if his behavior is indicative of our teens these days, he's becoming a real hard pill to swallow.  The identity of the killer comes so unspectacularly that you scratch your head and say, why was so much focus put on the other suspects when this one is the culprit?<br />I've read all the series and think Ms. Davidson has done well most of the time, but I sincerely think it's time to hang up the apron for a while.	2002-08-01

In reading many of the reviews of this book, I think some of them are being a little TOO harsh on Mr. Patterson and Mr. Gross in \\"2nd Chance.\\"  Patterson's not up to par with this one, but it's still better than much of what's out there.  The story is crisp, moves along nicely and overall, you find yourself rooting for the \\"women\\", and hoping they nab this dreadful Chimera.<br />I find their dialogue fairly realistic; maybe a bit contrived at times, but sometimes it's great to get away from reality.  There's enough horrible stuff going on in the world that I don't think I really want my mysteries to be TOO true to life.<br />Unlike most of Patterson's book, I spotted the Chimera early on, and if you read it carefully, you'll spot him/her too.  There is a major weakness in that the relationship between Frank Coontz and his son is never fully explained.  Cindy's relationship with the handsome African-American minister, Aaron Winslow, is also a nice departure for the group.  Jill's \\"disaster\\" is painfully realistic, and despite what some people may think, realistic in its delivery.<br />All in all, Patterson continues to be one of our most dependable writers, who when even not at his peak, is worth the read.	2002-08-01

Co-writer Peter DeJonge may be responsible for the majority of the writing, but that's something we'll never know.<br />The first person narratives of both the victim and his brother are interesting, and put things in different perspectives.<br />One of my main concerns however focused on the victim, Peter Mullen.  Obviously he comes from a very moral, tight family, so how in the world does he end up in all this trouble.  At an early age, dear Peter is engaging in sexual activities that most people wouldn't consider at any age.  He's selfish, greedy, juvenile and completely immoral.  So, how can his brother feel so close to him?  I know brotherly love is a powerful force, but in this novel, it's almost ludicrous.<br />Also, what motivated Sammy the gay barber to do what he did?<br />The courtroom scene at the end is pretty far-fetched, but admittedly involving.<br />Overall, certainly not a waste of time, but not vintage Patterson.	2002-07-30

His Myron Bolitar series is outstanding and his first non-Myron book, \\"Tell No One\\" was great.

It's fast paced and has characters you care about..BUT and this is  a big BUT..THERE IS A MAJOR PLOT FLAW EARLY ON THAT NEGATES THE POWER OF THE BOOK.  So as not to spoil this for those who haven't read it yet, I won't give away the plot.  But, early on in the \\"Ghosts\\" reminiscing, there is an incredible story about how he relished his murder, and later on, we find out something quite contrary.  I've e-mailed Harlan on this all too conspicuous mistake, and am awaiting his reply.  So, read the book---it's very good...but I only gave two stars because of this big, big faux pas!

I have been a Deaver fan since reading \\"Praying for Sleep,\\" and have appreciated all the nifty off-the-wall twists that left my mouth agape in wonder!  \\"Stone Monkey\\" is Deaver's most predictable and least surprising work so far.  You can pretty much see all the plot twists coming in this one, and they are not as grandiose as in his previous works.  Although Lincoln and Amanda remain interesting characters, I felt Rhyme wasn't used very much in this one, and it is also a slower paced novel than one expects from Deaver.  The character of Sonny Li is a great addition, and he seems to be sharper than both Lincoln and Amanda.  The subplot involving William Chang is both meaningless and uninteresting, and is never really resolved.<br />The settings are unique, some of the dialogue is great, but overall \\"The Stone Monkey\\" is not one of my favorite Deaver books.  Hopefully, he'll ignore the erudites who think incredible plot twists aren't good reading....	2002-06-18

And the main reason is the superfluous, redundancy of his prose.  Good Lord, Dean, as one reviewer noted, why in the world did you litter this book with so much unnecessary description and philosophizing?  You've done it before, but this time, you've really overdone it!  There's one passage in which he describes a sunset that is so overwrought, I burst out laughing at the imagery.  So, Dean, please remember your books are meant to entertain, not teach poetic English or convert readers to a strange, if pleasant, philosophy.  Now, as far as the book and its plot, Dean interweaves many of his past motifs into a sometimes incoherent, although intriguing, storyline.  My favorite character was Noah Farrel, and I'm not really sure, but I guess because he seemed so tragic and had such a deep love for his sister, he came across a little more credibly.  In his Curtis Hammond plot, Dean does manage some very funny dialogue.  But, how many more superdogs is Dean going to give us?  And it's fairly obvious early on who Curtis really is.  The way all of the characters get together is pretty far-fetched, but I'll abide by the standard of creative license.  The characters of the twins, Polly and Cassie, are great, and I really enjoyed them, too.  The ending is so \\"Mary Poppinish\\", it almost smells of a series?<br />Well, Koontz fans, I'm sure we'll stick with him, but I hope the bougainvillea suffer drought, and Dean returns to thrilling, instead of frustrating us!	2002-03-06

(Also, what happened to Geoffrey Shafer?  He hasn't resurfaced yet?).<br />However, Patterson's style is still engrossing, and I like the short chapters.  It makes it easy to read when you have other things to do.<br />The vampire killings are a little gory and the resolution is a little &quot;forced,&quot; but it still maintained my interest.<br />I think Alex's continuous failures in love is getting too unbelievable.  I like Alex, but he falls in love with any woman he meets.  Jamilla Hughes seems like a nice woman, but her characterization isn't fully fleshed out, and doesn't seem to be the right person for Cross.  They're too much alike.<br />And what about Christine Johnson?  Is that who he's falling in love with at the end of the book?<br />The finale to this book doesn't give us a real exciting sequel possibility.  He says he's going to resign and that he's fallen in love.  So, if Patterson's planning on finishing the series, I would be sad, but if he feels it's necessary, I have certainly enjoyed the series!  And his &quot;First to Die&quot; sequel is coming soon.  Thank you, James, for giving us such pleasure in the Alex Cross series!	2002-01-03

A neighborhood boy raped her; she went to threaten him with her cop father's gun, and accidentally shoots the boy dead.  Dad helps cover up the crime, and no one suspects the truth, or do they?<br />Flash up to the present day and Alexandra finds herself involved in a serial rapist killer's horrifying carnage.  Add to this a truly psychotic husband who is planning a major armored car heist, and two thieves who are like something out of a David Lynch movie, and you have the many ingredients of this strange, but mesmerizing, crime novel.  If things weren't bad enough, Alex's father is now senile, suffering from Alzheimer's, and getting her in more trouble than she could ever dream possible.<br />Hall goes out on a limb in his treatment of the father's character.  The overwhelming tragedy of Alzheimer's should never be milked for comic relief, but Hall does this quite often, seguing sometimes very uncomfortably from serious repercussions of the disease to the inherent \\"comical\\" side effects.<br />The book has a nice pace and Hall certainly demonstrates a feel for his locales.  (...)  It's fairly obvious who (the rapist) is, (...) so obvious, you almost want to laugh at his attempt.<br />The characters of Norman, Emma and Jennifer are so over the top, they never achieve one moment of lucidity or credibility.  Emma and her pet cockroach; Norman in his Quasimodo shroud; and dimwit Jennifer, the epitome of the dumb blonde provide some comic relief, but they are so sinister and unlikeable, you can only welcome their inimitable demises.<br />Perhaps Hall tried to hard to give us a complex novel that he forgot his audience's suspension of belief levels.	2001-11-13

While I like the characters of Michael Chandler and Ellen Wilder, their constant rehashing of their background crises is overdone and essentially seems to be Hynd's way to pad the book.  Chandler's death experience is frightening, but we are over-saturated with his feelings about it; same goes for Ellen Wilder and her decision to buy the failing newspaper and her regrets over giving up a child for adoption.  The &quot;Lost Boy&quot; of the title is really two lost boys, as the reader will find out.  The Corbett family is despicable and typically redneck, which is odd for a Connecticut setting.  They are so over-the-top sometimes that it's almost farcical.  Franny Corbett is initially pictured as such an evil force that when we find out who he really is and why he's like that, it seems like such a turnaround...not totally credible.<br />Why give it three stars?  The book has some really frightening sequences, and in spite of the length, I found the book a good read.  When Franny shows Chandler some of his &quot;tricks&quot; in the cemetery, including making it snow, there is a poignancy and haunting atmosphere realistically conjured.<br />Hynd is not one of my favorite &quot;spook&quot; authors, but he has given us some good chills in the past and this book is worth a read if you like ghost stories.	2001-11-09

The plot is eerily realistic and frightening, with a \\"monster\\" that is so simplistic in its concept that it's devastation is overwhelming.  There are plenty of actions scenes, with plenty of bodies piling up.  There is a stalwart Dirk Pitt-type hero, Brock Garner; a stalwart female doctor, Ellie Bridges; a nasty opportunist who seizes the devastation as wonderful PR; and your stock of supporting characters, both heroes and villains.  The villains get their just desserts, and even some of the heroes don't make out too well.  Kids are even wasted.<br />Powlik does get very technical at times, and he fails to resolve the character of Charles Harmon to satisfaction.  There are many, many cliches, and even the way the monster is dealt with is hauntingly familiar.  Yet, you can't help root for the heroes and hiss the villains, especially when you consider Seattle(of all places) is the monster's ultimate destination.<br />Campy, but fun; serious but witty.	2001-11-04

Twenty years later, it still stands up as good evidence of Farris' skill as a writer.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed in the resolution of this book, particularly in the relationship between David McNair and Anneliese Girda.  The story starts out with the brutal murder of a woman, whose young daughter stumbles upon the aftermath.  We find out early on that the murderer is a renowned gentleman named Frank McNair, who just happens to be the hero's father.  A deathbed confession prior to a clever suicide sends David off to locate the young girl who witnessed his father's deed.  Anneliese is now a clothing designer living in Germany and also being terrorized by a group of terrorists she once belonged to, and feel that she has betrayed them for money.  The plot moves along fairly nicely, with some good suspense scenes and some crisp dialogue.  However, the ending leaves one wondering why Farris brought these two together; also, Reba McNair's &quot;brilliant&quot; assertation of her philandering husband's mistress seems to come out of nowhere.<br />Not a bad read, but not one of Mr. Farris' best.	2001-11-01

In &quot;Contagion,&quot; a maverick pathologist, Jack Stapleton, is convinced that a series of three different types of epidemics is being purposely caused by a large HMO, AmeriCare.  When attempts are made on his life, and when one young lady who has tried to help him, is brutally murdered, Jack is pretty sure something fishy is going on.  Is it the conglomerate health care organization, or could there be someone else?<br />The book opens with three mini-chapters in which we meet characters who will later &quot;converge&quot; and flesh out the plot.  The key character in the first scenario is pretty well camouflaged by Cook's writing; a clue----watch for nicknames or surnames; in the other two, we meet Stapleton and the lovely advertising executive Teresa Hagen.  Add to this some nasty gang members, and you have the recipe for an intriguing, if somewhat heavy-handed plot.<br />The book is long, but it moves well enough; I liked Stapleton's inter-relations with the African-Americans who let him play basketball with them after he buys lights and buys new equipment.  Warren is a particularly enjoyable character.  Also, Jack's relationship with Laurie is a nice one, and you can almost see how this relationship will determine the outcome of his relationship with the aforementioned Terese.<br />My main disappointment with this novel is its denouement.  The villain is completely unexpected, at least on my part; and the last scenes in a deserted Catskill cabin border on maudlin melodrama.<br />One big hole is exactly what the role of the HMO really was in the epidemics; why did Dr. Martin Chavereau fire Beth, really?  And why had he ordered plagues from the plague catalogue company??  And when the plot ends, we don't know how these important plot pieces fit the whole puzzle.<br />I would have given it more stars if these puzzling questions hadn't been left unanswered.<br />But, in spite of that, I recommend the book.

Allison has her own sordid past, in that a roommate of hers was brutally murdered the year previously.  Ben doesn't know this of course.  Ben has a loving mother, who is a veterinarian, and a charming, handsome older brother, Michael, who wows the women, including one Denise Fletcher, a married woman whose husband is maniacally jealous.  Enter David Weyrich, a seasoned PI, who is looking for one Steve Conners, who he is sure killed Allison's roommate, and just happens to be a good friend of none other than Michael Tyler.<br />Gorman gives us some very touching scenes, including one in which Ben has to help his mother put his feline-leukemia afflicted kitten to sleep.  This is poignant and rare in a book of this nature.<br />Of course, there are now shocking surprises, once we find out the truth about Steve and Michael; from then on, it's a cat and mouse game, with the evil villain doing his best to silence those who could give away his dreaded secret.<br />Gorman presents a strong case of inherited traits, in that the killer may have inherited his traits from his murderous grandfather.<br />All in all, the story has some great moments, and even though our beloved heroine bites the dust, Ben's revenge, along with the just desserts for Allison's killer keep the plot moving.<br />A nice, sneaky thriller.	2001-10-22

This second entry in his Robert Payne &quot;Moon&quot; series clearly demonstrates just how nice a guy this Payne really is.  Although sometimes you might think he comes across as being too good, or too nice, you can't help but like and yes, admire, this man.  He has a strong sense of friendship and love; his reminiscences of his deceased wife are some of the most touching in modern crime fiction.  You know Payne really loved this woman.  And his relationships with different characters in both books further proves that Payne is probably the nicest &quot;detective&quot; out there.<br />As for the plot of this one, it's a little complex and sometimes incoherent, but it moves well, and once again, his parallel story telling ties the two segments together nicely.  Particularly unique is his handling of Anna Tolan, a police investigator back in 1903, who in addition to trying to solve a similar case to Payne's in the nineties, is having doubts about her relationship with Trace Wydmore, a nice young man who is trying to score a &quot;home run&quot; with the virginal young girl.  Considering the times, one can understand both Anna and Trace's different problems.  Their dialogue rings so true, it's refreshing.<br />The murders that Payne has to solve lead him to a belligerent Native American named David Rhodes, whose estranged wife, just happens to be policewoman Cindy Rhodes.  I'll say one thing for Iowa---they certainly advanced women's lib in their use of women as police officers.<br />The supporting characters are appropriately shady and/or nice, and Payne's adventures with the two elderly Native Americans who want to fly in his biplane is extraordinary.<br />A great novel in spite of its minor flaws.	2001-10-17

Okay, so it's fluff and yes, there was an overload of profanity, and yes the story that Judy tells young Dusty before he goes to sleep is one of the most ridiculous ones ever, but this book is fun.  That's why I liked it.  It had me interested all the way through, cheering on feisty Judy Maddox and hunky Michael Quersic, hissing at the nasty villains Priest, Star, and Melanie.  The plot is a little far-fetched, but isn't that what good writing is all about; transporting you to an unbelievable environment and making you believe it at least for the length of time it takes to read the novel?<br />Follett has a particularly graphic and disturbing murder early in the book, that made me hate Priest immediately.  Even though Follett tries to make the reader understand where these eco-terrorists are coming from, Priest's way of life is no better than the life he is condemning; he has no conscience or moral code, and he has to have things his way or else.  I cannot understand how Star could have stayed with him so long.  The book's pace is commendable and Follett has a way with words that keeps everything smooth and interesting.<br />The climax is powerful and the wrap up of all the characters is a nice way to let us know what happens with all these people.  Poetic justice befits Mr. Priest's eventual outcome, but I wish he had gotten a little more of what he deserved.<br />All in all, though, it's a good read.	2001-10-16

I especially like the way that Gorman jumps from the main storyline of investigator Robert Payne looking for the serial killer of young girls to the prison scenes with an unnamed prisoner and his sordid, graphic past.  How these two stories come together is brilliantly done.<br />Gorman is great with establishing the atmosphere of New Hope, Idaho, a fictional town near Cedar Rapids.  He also gives us a sympathetic leading man in Robert Payne.  Payne seems to have a strong sense of duty, decency and justice.  There are many suspects in the overall case and I think you'll be surprised at the climax when the killer's identity is revealed.<br />Yes, this is a gory book and the final scene with the rats is nerve-shaking to say the least.<br />Gorman is a good writer, weaving a good plot and believable characters and a good underlying sense of humor.<br />Can't wait to read the follow-up Moons!	2001-10-16

However, I really liked this book; it moves well; it has likeable heroes and nasty villains.  It addresses the question of nature vs. nurture, and Follett obviously believes that no matter what's in your genes, it's important as to what kind of environment you are raised in.<br />Jeannie Ferrami, the heroine, is a strong, determined character, and I liked her persistence in proving not only that her scientific studies are correct, but that the conspiracy she has uncovered needs to be addressed!  I wish sometimes other reviewers wouldn't...mention some of the plot's \\"surprises,\\" such as the number of clones, but even though in reading the reviews, you get advance information, don't let that spoil the finesse in which Follette weaves his tale.<br />I liked Steve Logan, too.  He comes across as a sincere, honest type of guy, who wants to be a good lawyer and is caught in the unbelievable maze of discovering he is a clone.<br />The novel opens briskly with one of the evil clones rape of Jeanne's best friend, and we get involved with the confusion when Steve enters Jeannie's life.<br />The villains are all particularly vile, but Berrington Jones is the worst.  Such a pompous, self-serving fool.<br />Fortunately, after our heroes go through countless setbacks, the ending is justifiable and the epilogue at the end is particularly touching.<br />A great book; I really enjoyed it for it's entertainment value!	2001-10-09

While there are times, you want to smack her for her sarcastic view of life and her equally cynical comments, you have to admire her for her tenacity and her determination to resurrect her life and her career.  Belsky pulls some effective twists in this thriller, making the reader wonder is this a new Loverboy copycat or is it the original returned for whatever reason.

I thought &quot;Salem's Lot&quot; was strange; but the weirdos in that one were all vampires.  In Tamara Thorne's shamelessly derivative &quot;Eternity,&quot; the weirdos are pretty much everybody:  the strange mayor who looks like Ambrose Bierce; the two Elvis impersonators; an Amelia Earhart lookalike; weird twins named The Dimples; so on, so forth.  And on top of it, there's a serial killer who says he's Jack The Ripper and he offs almost the entire town of Eternity, which has only a population of 500. But what a town!  It has several restaurants, an insane asylum, two hospitals, a mall, a couple of nightclubs, and hookers!  And if that's not enough, it has a strange Stonehenge like site where if you step into it, you won't age, and in fact, you can even &quot;teleport&quot; yourself from different time zones and places.<br />Therein lies the problem with this novel.  Thorne has taken on so much she has a hard time focusing on any particular nuance of the plot.  Suffice to say, a cop named Zach Tulley, whose wife and child were killed by an unknown serial killer, leaves L.A. and accepts the position of sheriff in Eternity.  Seems the last couple of sheriffs have met untimely deaths.  Also, the tour guide there, Kate McPherson, has fled to Eternity to escape her obnoxious psychologist ex-husband.  She also has a son named Josh, thus setting the stage for Zach's falling for a surrogate family.  And is the current serial killer also the same one that murdered Zach's family?  Well, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out where this book goes.<br />There are some humorous moments, but there so much that's contrived, and illogical.  One big fault, I felt, was that if Zach Tully was such an ace cop and supposedly had brilliant powers of deduction, how come it takes him so long to figure out the clues in the murders and the murderer's identity.  I pegged the culprit right after he/she was introduced.  The reasoning behind the killings is never clearly stated, and the whole &quot;science fiction&quot; aspect of the story is uninvolving.<br />I did enjoy reading the book, though.

First of all, this book, written in 1998, is eerily in tune with our recent American terrorism tragedy.  In &quot;Reign in Hell,&quot; the terrorists are militia men, posing as religious fanatics, who want to bring our country to its knees.  Unfortunately, the President in this scenario is a real weasel and the people who support him are likewise unethical and self-serving.  I know that this has been a mainstay of many writers, showing how corrupt our government can be.  Even so, with our lives now irrevocably changed from the 9-11-02 tragedy, we don't need to harp on our government's clandestine operations, so I don't recommend this book at all from that standpoint.<br />As part of the Martin Vail series, however, &quot;Reign in Hell&quot; falls short of its two predecessors.  Vail seems tired and almost lethargic in this book which finds him appointed Assistant Attorney General of the United States.  His relationship with Jane Venable is heightened, but not with any real memorable scenes.  Diehl's biggest disappointment is the return of Aaron Stampler as a &quot;blind&quot; religious fanatic, posing as Brother Transgression.  Whereas Stampler was definitely a viable and horrifying character in the first two novels, his portrayal in this one is so preposterous that it's hard to even imagine him as the real Aaron Stampler.<br />I don't know whether Diehl is planning any more Martin Vail novels, but he had a winner going; this book almost destroyed Vail though.  In more ways than one!	2001-09-24

This novel has more plotlines than any I've ever read.  Although some have said it loses focus, I don't think so.  The different mysteries are well-conceived, and we want the killers to be brought to justice.  In Darby's case, accused of killing his wife, we see what a sleezebag he is, and cheer Shana Parva on in her quest to bring him to justice.  The case of Edith Stoddard, the executive secretary who admits to killing her lover/boss, is more difficult to cheer, because there's something fishy in her confession.  The denouement of this particular crime is somewha nebulous, but still packs a punch.  The main interest for all &quot;Primal Fear&quot; fans is the reappearance of Aaron Stampler.  Someone is murdering people in the same grisly fashion Stampler did; only Stampler is locked up in maximum security and cannot be committing the crimes himself, so is there a copycat or an accomplice?  And what about the identities of the newest victims?  Hmmm....this is a crafty plot, indeed.  If you think hard enough, you will be able to identify the culprit who is aiding Aaron.<br />Along with these plots, it's nice to see some romance develop for Martin Vain and Jane Venable and also Shana Parva and Flaherty.  A well done book, with exciting sequences and some truly chilling ones, too.  Will make all UPS drivers think twice about rural deliveries!	2001-09-21

When I Saw all those &quot;5&quot;'s given this book, I could not imagine giving it anything else but.  However, this entry in the Southern Sisters series deserves it.  I was somewhat disappointed in Ms. George's last mystery, but this one returns to the homespun, acerbic, and silly humor of the previous entries.<br />Patricia Anne and Mary Alice get involved in the disappearance of their cousin Pukey Luke's wife, Virginia.  When it seems that she's run off with a snake-handling minister, the ladies find themselves kneedeep in rattlesnakes, cover-ups, and murder.<br />What's so nice about this book, however, is not really the whodunit aspect, but the relationships these people have with each other.  The sisters are funny, and their respective hubbies or boyfriends are amusing, too.  George has a way of knowing how important family and friends are; how important pets (such as Woofer and Muffin) are; and although the murderer's identity is fairly obvious early on, who cares?  We have lots of fun getting there.<br />A real treat.  So sorry to hear that Ms. George has passed away, with one more Southern Sisters mystery left.  I know she's with the angels, and thank you for bringing us your talents and time!	2001-09-17

What a classic legal thriller!<br />The character of Martin Vail, although an obvious egotist who will do anything to win his case, is still a fascinating character, and his defense of the psychotic killer Aaron Stampler proves how cunning and brilliant he can be.<br />Although the obvious dark secret of the murdered archbishop is readily apparent, the way Diehl moves through the various clues is simply stunning.  The other characters are likewise brilliantly executed and the courtroom scenes crackle with tension and surprises.<br />Of course, at the heart of this novel is the villain, Aaron Stampler.  A seemingly cherubic and victimized young man, we find out a great deal about Aaron, his childhood, his teen years, and it is hard to believe that this mild-mannered young boy could brutally murder the Archbishop.<br />That's where the fun starts as Diehl wields a mighty sharp pen in this exceptionally good thriller.<br />Am anxious now to read the sequel, &quot;Show of Evil.&quot;	2001-09-11

What make this book work so well is Gerritsen's ability to create individual scenes that ring of truth, particuarly in the relationship between Toby, her sister, and her mother.  Some of the dialogue is biting, harsh, yet with an underlying compassion and confusion that accompanies the anguish of Alzheimer's.  Tess also establishes a great deal of sympathy for a supporting character, Molly Picker, whose life as a prostitute leads her into an unbelievably cruel outcome.  Her phone call home to her mother, begging her to let her come home, is gut-wrenching in its realism and her mother's cruelty.  The story builds well, and Toby's romance with Dan Dvorak is well-done, although the curtain of doom that hangs over Dan at the end does leave a little bitter taste.<br />All in all, Tess continues to be a master of the medical thriller; check out her excellent &quot;The Surgeon,&quot; &quot;Harvest,&quot; and &quot;Bloodstream.&quot;  She makes you wonder just how safe we are in a hospital!	2001-09-09

Cook's 1991 book, &quot;Night Secrets&quot; certainly doesn't indicate the vastly talented writer he was to become.  His later books, including &quot;Chatham School Affair,&quot; and &quot;Places in the Dark&quot; are outstanding examples of his expertise in writing the mysteries that involve incidents from the past and their effect on the present.<br />However, &quot;Night Secrets&quot; is a meandering, slow-paced yawner involving a burned out PI named Frank Clemons who takes on a &quot;day case&quot; involving a mysterious woman whose husband suspects an affair; his &quot;night&quot; case involves a mysterious gypsy accused of murdering an old woman.  Frank's daughter committed suicide, his wife divorced him, and his lover married somebody else.  No wonder; Frank is one boring guy.  His insane desire for the mad gypsy woman is completely unfounded and preposterous; the denouement is really overwrought and unsuspenseful.  A real sleeper, indeed.  Beats Sominex.	2001-09-07

I found this book highly entertaining as a medical &quot;what if&quot; thriller.  Not a treatise on anything.  Just a fun read, people with interesting heroes and villains.<br />The story centers on a mysterious compound that not only causes healthy young men to bleed to death, but also causes infertility in males.<br />The hero, Jake Foster and his wife, Brett, start out the story by trying to have sex in order to procreate a child.  Their lovemaking is clinical, measured and not highly enjoyable.  But once the mysterious compound kicks in, Brett and Jake discover that there are more important things to worry about right now.<br />The action is cinematic, cartoonish, and tremendously involving.  I find this to be Mezrich's most entertaining novel, and the scene in the grocery store with the melons is outstanding!  If Ben can keep his humor about him, and whisk away to these faroff lands, he will probably enjoy more commercial success.	2001-09-06

The way their relationship develops from the protective friend of his dead partner's daughter to a possible romantic interest is well done and you really like them and hope things work out.<br />Which is difficult, considering the mess the two find themselves in.  The dead teacher's mysterious death is cited as an accident, but there's every indication that it could have been murder.  But who did it?  The darling little children, three of whom are like miniature Freddy Kreugers, or is there someone else lurking in the background?  And what about this strange nephew, Wesley Gomes, who is not only embezzling money from the bank he works in, but is also doing some other strange things, too.  And what about poor Paul, a local cop who looks like Jarrett, and is killed by a mysterious stranger?<br />The plot gets a little convoluted, and there are some strange twists and turns that are too conveniently constructed and left dangling.  For instance, once you find out who the murderer of the teacher is, there's no explanation as to how this person got there.  Also, the revenge of the drug lord's brother is so predictable that when it happens, you wonder why it didn't happen sooner.<br />However, in spite of the flaws, I did enjoy the book, mainly because of the characters of Jarrett and Molly.  It left an opening for a sequel, which hasn't happened yet.	2001-09-04

First of all, its heroine, Dr. Iris Lanier, is about as likeable as a skin rash.  She is self-pitying, whiny, self-centered and socially inept.  Delving into her past only makes her less likeable.  There are so many inconsistencies in this plot, and the whole focus on Iris' dig in Guatemala has absolutely no integral part in the plot.  Her relationship with her father is about as deep as a bottomless cup of coffee.  The Angel Gabriel's character is so unbelievable, it's funny.  Also, what about the couple Iris sees while staring at an apartment building across the street?  What in the world was that supposed to mean?  Her visit with Madame Zora--what a waste.<br />There is so much wrong with this book, that by the time it reaches its preposterous conclusion, you can only ask yourself, &quot;Why did I read this?&quot;<br />Not recommended.	2001-08-31

However, in this book Alex brings much more depth and understanding into some of her characters. Even though Maggie O'Dell starts out being a little hard to like, a little paranoid, and belligerent, by the end of the book, Maggie has finally come to grips with her ghosts. Her reunion with Nick Morelli is especially well done. In &quot;Evil,&quot; Nick came across as a woman chasing stud, with only one thing on his mind. This time around, Nick seems to really have matured, and with his new job in Boston, he has a new outlook on how to show a woman he loves her. It was nice after the Barbara Caitlin scenarios Kava gave us last time. The supporting characters in this one are far from cardboard cut-outs, as one reviewer surmised. Tess McGowan is a strong female character, and almost steals the book away from Maggie. Complete with a horrendous childhood and a life as a prostitute, Tess has bounced back and come into her own as a real estate salesperson. Her current boyfriend, Daniel, is a real jerk, but Kava gives her a one-night stand with a young stud lawyer named Will Finley, and establishes an entirely different relationship for such a one-night stand. When Tess finds herself kidnapped by Stucky, she shows fortitude and strength, and refuses to let him control her. Maggie's partner, Tully, is also a well-drawn character: disorganized; a recent divorcee trying to understand his 14 year old daughter, but actually a genuinely nice guy. Some of the other characters do well, too: stuffy and stubborn Detective Manz; Maggie's psychiatrist friend, Gwen Peterson; FBI Chief Kyle Cunningham is both stern but compassionate. The villain or villains (?) in &quot;Split Second&quot; are completely despicable and even if one reviewer thinks Stucky's antics are implausible, this is fiction, and considering how the FBI bumbled some important cases (remember Timothy McVeigh), one can see how someone as brilliantly insane as Stucky could outwit them. I'm sure in her next adventure, Maggie will return to Father Michael Kelly, and hopefully, her relationship with Nick will continue to grow. I wouldn't mind having Tess and Will around as secondary characters, too. I liked this book a lot and recommend both Ms. Kava's novels.despicable and even if one reviewer thinks Stucky's antics are implausible, this is fiction, and considering how the FBI bumbled some important cases (remember Timothy McVeigh), one can see how someone as brilliantly insane as Stucky could outwit them.

She delivers a well-paced, suspenseful novel of medical terror. In &quot;The Surgeon,&quot; Tess gives us a very despicable murderer, who is attacking and killing women who have been sexually assaulted. He imprisons them in their own beds and then removes their uteruses, and lets them live a while before he slashes their throats. Not the nicest guy in the world. Ms. Gerritsen is extremely good at interjecting much medical terminology and information, but does so in a way that it does not become too technical or wordy. The characters in this book are very well conceived: the heroine, Dr. Catherine Cordell, a victim of the killer who manages to survive and kill him; Thomas Moore, an unusually &quot;saintly&quot; cop who finds himself falling for the lovely doctor; Jane Rizzoli, the embittered female cop who wants to break this case to show that women can do the same, if not better, than men; Peter Falco, Cordell's partner, who harbors a secret love for his comrade; and of course, the killer. The identity is truly well-hidden, and does not resort to a lot of other writers' tired cliches. My one question, though: what was in the IV bag the killer put in the elderly patient of Catherine's that resulted in his sudden death? There's no follow up on this, or the patient's indignant son who feels the hospital did nothing for him? This of course doesn't detract from the book's overall effect, but it seems Tess might have forgot about it? But, hey, this is one great book...I found it hard to put down. Looking forward for more from this brilliant writer/surgeon.	2001-08-27

Since many have already rehashed the plot, I'd like to focus on some of the characters and subtle ironies that enhance the book. Roger Cullingwood is a perfect idiot, although a brilliant one; some of his rationalizations and thought processes are so bad you have to wonder how he's survived as long as he has. His wife, Francie, has many layers and when she suddenly becomes friends with her lover's wife, it really puts her in a pickle. Anne, the wife of Ned (Francie's lover) is a real whiner, but her depth is brought out once she becomes friends with Francie. Ned, the lover, is a real jerk, and his true personality comes out at the end, and even though you knew it was coming, you still want to bash his head in. The character of Whitey Truax is another one of Abrahams' really sick villains, and his pact with Roger can only end up one way, of course. Who gets murdered comes as a mild surprise, and the clue the person leaves is muddled until you finish the book, flash back and remember why the clue was left. The addition of Joe Savand, the cop whose wife was Truax's first victim, is nice, and his role in the novel comes to a nice fruition in the unexpected ending. Lots of sex talk and gory violence, but it's a great read. I liked it much better than &quot;Crying Wolf,&quot; and that was good, too!	2001-08-26

The leading characters of Nick Barnes and Samantha Craig are so &quot;perfect,&quot; they are nauseating. Add to this those crises in their lives that have left them bitter, and you have two heroes that need to grow up! The plot is rather interesting: a biological virus spread through televisions and computers. We also have three over-the-top villains: Marcus Teal, a black billionaire, who wants to use his technology to &quot;CONTROL&quot; who gets ahead in the business world, most notably, of course, minorities and the poor guys; Melora Parkridge, who is like a modern-day Margaret Hamilton, who wants to use her technology to wipe out technology altogether, for some reason the reader is never fully told; and then we have nutso Ned Dickerson who is being &quot;controlled&quot; by the virus. He's a whacko who is the real culprit in this serpentine maze of incredulities. &quot;Reaper&quot; in the hands of a more mature writer, could have been fun, but it ends up being one of those books you would have passed on had the promotion and premise not been so intriguing.

The setting is new and original, but the story is nothing more than a &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot;, who-will-survive-the-murders? story.  I'm astounded that so many well-known authors, as well as some of our Amazon reviewers, found the characters &quot;Well-developed.&quot;  Other than the lead, Richard Corrigan, we don't get to know too much at all about the other characters.  Dara is the typical spunky reporter, who amazingly knows about the street person Corrigan chases in the novel's flamboyant opening; the governor, president-wannabe is your typical get ahead at any cost politician; his wife, Elizabeth, we know nothing about except her clandestine affair; I'm not sure I remember any dialogue at all from her.  The rest, including staunch guide Ben Donnelly, and the others, are merely players in the chess game of murder.  The ending is predictable, and the reason for the murders quite obvious.  Also, what happens to Fielding's wife, Elizabeth?  No clue to that one.  Also, the killers, Bright and Nelia Esteban, are almost funny in their over-the-top villainry. Not a bad book; just doesn't impel me to search out other Standiford novels.	2001-08-21

However, Black does create a set of believable characters, and even though the &quot;twist&quot; does come early and is not too hard to decipher, he keeps your interest by exploring the many different personalities of the psychopath.  Conrad Voort is a very interesting leading character.  He is rich, handsome, and deeply in love with Camilla, a television news reporter (notice how many heroines of thrillers these days work for T.V.?).  Voort has a sensitive side, and although I got frustrated with his obsessive love for Camilla, by the end of the book, you know he really does love her, and his decision at the end is refreshingly honest and understandable. After just finishing the Special X series by Michael Slade, this novel is amazingly tame in its treatment of gore.  The murders are not really described in great detail, and it almost seems as if they're &quot;cast aside&quot; to avoid any description.

For some reason, I thought &quot;Ripper&quot; was first.  So in going back to read all the novels, I have found that Slade is a crafty writer, usually full of surprises and tons of research.  Unfortunately, &quot;Cutthroat&quot; doesn't have that many surprises and the research is so wide-range that it weighs this book down.  We not only go back to the time of Custer and his last stand, but we also get tons of information on evolution (Darwin even appears briefly), and the legendary Sasquatch and/or &quot;Bigfoot&quot; and even the Yeti.  Although the research does tie into the main plot of the story, it becomes burdensome after a while. The main problem is the story itself is not up to the usual standards Slade sets himself.  Someone named Cutthroat is killing judges.  DeClerq teams up with Zinc Chandler, and Carol Tate of the FBI, to try and tie all the loose ends together. There's typical gore and bloodshed, but it's not as intense a thriller as &quot;Ripper&quot;, &quot;Primal Scream&quot; or &quot;Hangman.&quot;  The ending is a complete question mark, and I have to go back to read the next book, &quot;Ripper&quot;, to see if Slade resolved it.  (I don't remember, but since I read &quot;Ripper&quot; first, I may not have paid attention?). Another tricky clue from Mr. Slade.  Notice how he always starts his chapters and their sub-chapters with the date, location and time.  That's key in this book, in one section that may remind you of a certain episode of the t.v. series, &quot;Dallas.&quot;  Pretty sneaky of Mr. Slade; whether it works or not, I can't quite figure out yet. I am looking forward to the next Slade &quot;Special X&quot; adventure to find out what happens to Zinc, Nick and all the other colorful characters.	2001-08-16

We meet for the first time Zinc Campbell, one of the Mounties' more colorful characters, and join him on his search for a mysterious rock band called The Ghouls.  Earlier in the book, we meet a strange collection of young men who initiate a rather nebbish-like youngster in their group called &quot;The Ghouls.&quot;  His initiation rite sets the stage for some ghastly goings on as he grows up. Meanwhile in London, Hilary Rand, the female Chief of Police about to get ousted by her sexist peers, faces several ghastly killers:  The Vampire Killer, Jack (a homophobe bomber), and The Sewer Killer.  Just who these gentlemen are remains a mystery throughout the book and how they intertwine provides for some fascinating commentary on the psyche of a psychotic! Zinc manages to get involved with two women:  the Amazon FBI beauty, Carol Tate, and the frumpishly beautiful Deborah Lane, who has some dark secrets and connections of her own. Other than Zinc and Bob George, the regulars from &quot;Headhunter&quot; and the upcoming novels are noticeably absent. The identity of the different killers is a little more obvious than in the other Special X books, but Slade still manages to pull a real whopper at the end. All in all, worth reading to maintain the flow of this outstanding series.	2001-08-14

In this opus, Nick Craven finds himself accused of murdering his dear old Mom.  Add to this a crazed killer who is targeting the good old Mounties themselves. As with all Slade books, expect lots of background on the Canadian mounties and in this book, the Zulu war.  Additionally, expect the usual shocks and twists, as no one (not even our favorite recurring characters) is safe in a Slade book.  Poor Nick Craven----from this book on, he certainly does have a lot going against him!  The identity of this killer is resolved only on the last two pages, and it is a definite shocker. Slade's style is still mesmerizing; you get used to all his background research because eventually it does tie in to the plot of the book. Once again, a skillful entry in the Special X series!	2001-08-11

It has passed many enjoyable hours with many treasured friends over many years!  Michael Slade has taken this relatively harmless game and turned into a gut-wrenching signature of a very nasty killer.  The Hangman is playing the game in reverse.  Start out with a whole body and then remove a part at a time.  Start with the leg, then you get the picture, right? Slade, now writing with his daughter Rebecca, just keeps getting better.  HINT HINT To above title... Even though our usual hero, Robert DeClerq, is missing from this story except for a brief cameo, the book has the estimable Zinc Chandler pairing with a Seattle detective, Maddy Thorne, to catch the notorious hangman.  A pivotal character is the narrator, Jeff Klein, a lawyer out to make his name on a big case, and what could be bigger than the Hangman.  Add his partner, Ethan, his brother Justin Winfield, the luscious Alex Smith (girlfriend to Zinc), and a bunch of other secondary characters, and you have a remarkably infectious whodunit.  As always, Slade researches and researches, and gives us a ton of information on executioners, particularly hangmen, of the past.  Even though the Hangman's game is fairly easy to guess, it doesn't deter from the identity of the hangman and other people's involvement.  A great addition to the Special X series, and one you won't want to put down till you finish.

When I finished this typically excellent Alex Cross book, my jaw dropped and I thought to myself, &quot;What?&quot;  So I went back and read the last chapter again, and still managed to say &quot;What&quot; again!  Patterson pulls a real corker on us at the end of this one, and if you think it's far-fetched, just think back to previous books and I think you'll find it makes sense.  But, oh what a ride!  This is exceptional Patterson, filled with more nasty villains, and an evil genius called The Mastermind.  If you have lived through the previous Cross novels, you won't be disappointed in this one; you'll be anxiously awaiting &quot;Violets Are Blue&quot; due out in November to find out what tricks the Mastermind has up his sleeve!

That was until I started reading Michael Slade's DeClerq series.  Slade's bad guys are rotten to the core, and vicious, unrelenting, and completely psychopathic.  In &quot;Burnt Bones,&quot; we are treated to the devilish Mephisto, a man so bent on finding an ancient &quot;hoard&quot; (a silver medallion) that he will go to any lengths to find out where it is.  He buries one man alive to find out; he drops another one into the ocean to find out; and he even manages to capture one of our staunchest heroes, Nick Craven, and torture him for what he wants.  Aided by one of the vilest women in recent fiction, Donella, Mephisto lures the Mounted Police, a local cop (Jenna Bond), and the FBI into his web of terror.  Addditionally aided by three druids (who are really a rock band) who viciously rape and murder women, Mephisto seems poised for success.  If that weren't enough, he's even managed to get his hands on a super virus that could wipe out the world.  Yipes, where's Superman when you need him? Once again, Slade inundates us with extensive history about Romans, Druids, Celtics, etc.  A tremendous amount of research and one has to give Slade credit for the time he must spend in digging up these historical anecdotes.  I noticed that with this book, Slade is now only one author's pen-name, instead of two.  No evident change in style is noticed, so Slade must still be a potent writer on his own.  This one doesn't have as many twists and turns as other Slade books, but the two Wicker Man deaths are surprising in who is getting cooked!  And, of course, the ending leaves us wide open for future encounters of the worst kind with the evil Mephisto.  I'm doing &quot;The Hangman&quot; next, so I'll find out if Mephisto waltzes through this one; although remember, there were several books between the two Headhunter cases.  Please, Michael, don't make us wait too long to find out what happens to Mephisto!!!o long to find out what happens to Mephisto!!!	2001-08-06

After reading &quot;Headhunter,&quot; you of course know who the Headhunter is.  Only in this book is that notorious killer brought to justice, and in a very complex, but interesting, series of events.  Also Katt from &quot;Ripper&quot; is back, being as flippant and basically obnoxious as many teenagers are, although she does mature quite nicely after going through one heck of a life threat, both from an irate grizzly bear and a snowbound psychotic named Winterman Snow.  The double plot does have a tie-in, although you don't see it coming, or at least I didn't. The enormous amount of history on the Indian lore tended to slow the pace of the book down, and unless you're a real history buff, is not of any real importance to the book. Once the Headhunter is brought to a close, though, the book continues to propel us into a nightmare world of a mad hunter in the frozen wastelands of Northern Canada.  The identity of Winterman Snow is a real shocker, but that's not the final one in this book.  The last few pages reveals another shocking twist that I never saw coming in a million years!  Slade is certainly adept at pulling some real doozies! All in all, a fascinating entry in this DeClerq series.	2001-08-04

I assume (?) that this is the first in the Robert DeClerq series, but was puzzled if &quot;Ripper&quot; is the follow-up?  At any rate, on its own &quot;Headhunter&quot; is a mesmerizing look into a serial killer's demented life.  We are introduced to the killer early in the book identified as &quot;Sparky.&quot;  The book flip-flops back and forth into different times and we meet some characters whose presence is mystifying until the book reaches its last several pages.<br />DeClerq is a haunted, fragile man, whose dedication to solving the headhunter crimes is plummeting him into an abyss of self-doubt, remorse, and vengeance.  His lovely wife, Genevieve, stands by him and demonstrates a marital union rare in books these days.  The Headhunter task force is peopled with vastly different characters including the sexist Rick Scarlett; the aggressive and career-driven Katherine Spann; the brutish Rabidowski; and the comical Bill Whipple.  Not to mention Rusty Lewis and Monica McDonald, whose characters are kind of left up in the air by the book's denouement.  Several nasty villains appear including John Hardy, an outrageously self-centered pimp; Suzannah, a completely demented dominatrix; and a strange voodoo sequence whose presence is questionable, considering the outcome of the book. It is an ambitious undertaking, and the cliff-hanging ending will certainly surprise most readers. Sometimes the book seems to wander off its course, and some of the scenes of riot, violence, and such are padding and not really that interesting to the story. But overall, &quot;Headhunter&quot; is a stunning work, and certainly worth a read.	2001-07-31

But, how many years have passed since the &quot;Silver Tongue&quot; case?  All of a sudden, Kate has a son who is in school, and we have no real idea of how long Metcalfe has been in the slammer.  That's a pretty big &quot;hole&quot; in the opening of this rather plodding thriller.<br />The serial killer in this one has a sad history of extreme child abuse from both his father and mother, and the mother's lover.  Starling has a keen sense of characterization in this regard, but once you get into the book, the killer's identity is pretty obvious.<br />Although the corresponding storyline of Kate's surviving a ferry disaster is original, it seems to take up too much of the time that should have spent on the murders.  They are graphic, but not as graphic as in &quot;Messiah,&quot; and the motivation/pattern is not as interesting as the Silver Tongue's agenda.<br />This book doesn't move as well as its predecessor, and doesn't have the visceral impact.  However, it is a book that holds your attention, if at times you find yourself disliking Kate's whining and stubbornness.  She's not the most ideal heroine in the world, but her flaws and imperfections aren't as extensive as Red Metcalfe.<br />I hope Starling continues the series, though; they have been enjoyable.	2001-07-29

I gotta hand it to Michael Slade's \\"Ripper.\\"  There's enough plot lines and stories going on in this book, it could be two or three books in one!  And one can't help but admire his blatant rip-off of Agatha Christie's \\"And Then There Were None.\\"  The whole thing on the island mystery murder trip is a novel in itself, and Slade pulls the stops out on the way he disposes of the writers who have come there.  Ironically, the killer's identity follows very similarly the path of Ms. Christie's classic, so don't be too surprised when the identity is revealed. With that said, what can one say about a book that features not only this, but two gruesome serial killers, a devil cult that goes back many years, witches, sadism, bestiality, and some of the most descriptive gore and sexual perversion ever captured on ink.  Whew!  This book does demand a lot of bending the rules.  Give it to Slade, though.  It's good, and well developed.  The characters of LeClerq, Craven and Zinc Chandler are exceptional.  Of course, since this is a series, this thriller leaves some storylines unfinished, but hopefully they will be resolved in his next one.  This is my first Slade; Some of his earlier works are very hard to acquire, but I do have the follow-ups to \\"Ripper\\" so I'm anxious to see if he maintains his bold approach to the genre.	2001-07-21

Granted, Westlake is a good writer, but &quot;The Ax&quot; is a pretty far-fetched, tedious, and unpleasant read.  How can one &quot;root&quot; for the hero, who so blatantly kills innocent people just so HE can get the job he wants?  Maybe Burke Devore needed to pay more attention at the downsizing &quot;seminars&quot; on the best way to get a job.  The murders are almost comical in their execution.  The use of his Voyager to eliminate one of his competitors is especially mean and inexcusable. His last murder, the one who has the job HE REALLY WANTS, is nothing short of cruel and horrendous. I would have felt differently towards this character and the book had Devore gone after the managers who downsized him, rather than the other poor fellows who were in the same boat. The ending is especially disturbing.  Why three stars?  In spite of all this, you can't help but read it and finish it, as there are some interesting scenes and one can't help but wonder how Burke's going to get away with everything.  That is to Mr. Westlake's credit.  Still don't think it deserves the kudos, though.	2001-07-21

What in the world has Dave Elliott done to deserve this?  In Garber's ferociously entertaining &quot;Vertical Run,&quot; you join Dave in his quest to find out what in the world has happened to his life.<br />I liked Elliott's character, even with his shady past, and he comes across as a Die-Hard/Arnold type of hero, but he's cool, and I like the way he finds out the mystery behind the sudden looniness of his friends and family.<br />The pace moves well and there are some nasty villains, most notably of course, Mr. John Ransome.  The climactic ending is satisfying, although the epilogue (a copy of a facsimile) is a little too &quot;convenient,&quot; and it almost makes you want a sequel to find out what Dave and friends do for revenge.<br />This would make a great movie; are there still plans for it, does anyone know?<br />And where is Mr. Garber's follow-up book?<br />That's a mystery too. Garber's obviously a very talented and commercially accessible writer.  Let's hope for more in the future.	2001-07-13

The characters of Sarah and John Logan are fun to see develop and avoid the obvious romantic entanglement that awaits them by the denouement.  Monty the dog and Maggie the wolf are about as believable as Heckle and Jeckle, but hey, it's a book, right?  You have to suspend belief in a story like this.  Supporting characters of Galen and Bassett are fun, also, and the twists and turns involving who is really the &quot;Judas&quot; are well done, too.  The villain is a cardboard character; one can almost see him in one of those silent movies, where we would hiss and boo him.  His final confrontation with Logan is rather hasty and anticlimactic, but the whole novel works mainly because it's so entertaining in its simplicity.<br />I will try and go back and read previous novels with these characters.	2001-07-08

And amazingly enough, the reason is just what some of our fellow customers found irritating:  it moves a little slower, and Jack seems a little more human (that's almost hard to imagine sometimes) in his previous books.<br />Jack is a superhero, let's face it---isn't that what we want?  I mean, here's this big guy, who can pretty much take on the world single-handed, but this time, he doesn't have many physical brawls at all.  His showdown with the assassins actually makes him seem a little more vulnerable this time.<br />Jack meets up with this mysterious woman, Carmen Greer, who tells him this tale of spouse abuse by a husband who will soon be getting out of prison.  Is her tale true?  Jack believes her, and there are points in the book, where you might think, &quot;Jack, what a fool you are!&quot;<br />Jack takes on a job at the Greer ranch to kind of watch out for Miss Carmen, who is hated by the family because she's Hispanic, and obviously unworthy of their sterling son.  Jack's attempts to pass himself off as a wrangler are pretty funny, and his assistance from little Ellie is fun to read.<br />The character of Alice is a refreshing change of pace for Reacher; she's a lesbian, so there's no nooky for Reacher this time.  This is probably the first book where Jack doesn't hop in the sack with somebody.  Refreshingly different, for a change.<br />The identity of the true culprit is telegraphed early, and the biggest clue comes froma  FedEx package, and Carmen's use of a strange word for a more familiar one.  It's fun, though, and I enjoyed this book.<br />Jack is definitely a loner, and I've adjusted to the fact that the man will never make a long-term commitment, but if he did, there wouldn't be any more books!<br />Child is a great writer in capturing the tempestous heat and emotions of this Texas town, too.<br />Jack is back and better than ever!	2001-07-06

Our hero, Campbell Knight, is a frustrating one to say the least.  He starts out mad at the world (justifiably so, in losing his eye sight in such a horrible fashion); then once he agrees to the experiment with Shadow, the wonder eye dog, he becomes more mellow and starts falling in love with his heretofore unappreciated neighbor, Hope.  However, once Campbell starts sharing visions of a crazy woman murdering children, he returns to being an obnoxious, self-pitying bore.  Fortunately, for the reader, Campbell does become a likeable hero by the end of the novel.<br />The premise of Campbell sharing Shadow's visions with a dog from his same litter, is original, and even though Ellis sometimes takes a good while in getting to the meat of the plot, it's an enjoyable read, and it has a tragic ending, one that disappointed me, but was effective nonetheless.<br />I'm not sure the crazy woman, Ellie, is a truly developed villianess, but she is effective, and the child, Teresa, is a worthy opponent.<br />Atmospheric, and occasionally creepy, this book is a great read for the beach or a rainy night.	2001-06-27

Take one reformed alcoholic graphic artist, Harry Griffin; throw in one likewise reformed RICH alcoholic, Bud Maston; add a sensually promiscuous wife, Jesse, her two mixed-up younguns, Chris and Becky; and then a sheriff from hell, Larry Emery, and you have a volatile cast of characters.<br />The plot moves rather slowly, but once it picks up speed, it maintains interest and moves to a nice climax, although as one reviewer noted, highly unlikely.<br />Logan is a &quot;writer's writer,&quot; filling the book with rich descriptions of the Minnesota countryside; unusual word games; and some really complex characters.  There is a reality entrenched in the plot, although the way some of the main characters behave is far from believable.<br />As a mystery, it's not easily figured out, but when the identity of the true culprit is revealed, you're not totally surprised.  The hero, Harry, is vaguely reminiscent of John Sandford's Lucas Davenport, and Lee Child's hero, whose name eludes me at this point.  However, it's not a bad read; it doesn't make me want to pursue further Logan books, however.	2001-06-23

As we get involved with Jackson Kinley and his search for the truth behind a 30 year old crime, we find ourselves intrigued and mystified.  As Kinley researches old court transcripts, interviews people, and starts putting the pieces together, we enter a labyrinthine maze of vast proportions.<br />Cook, whose specialty has been journeying back to previous crimes, outdoes himself in manipulating the reader into finding many suspects and many possible solutions to the question:  did an innocent man die in the electric chair for a crime he didn't commit?  Was a murder even committed?  Who is behind the suspected cover-up?<br />Although the ending does have an air of ambiguity, when revisiting the novel mentally, one can see how everything ties together in the end.<br />A superb work by Mr. Cook.	2001-06-19

The critical endorsements by such authors as Stephen King indicate that this is &quot;one of the most frightening books ...ever read..&quot;.  I expected a lot more out of it, but once you get through the whole thing, you can look back on it and say it's a worthy ghost story.

I found the &quot;master mind&quot; behind the crimes a surprise, although there are others involved that aren't so surprising. Nonetheless, Tess keeps you riveted to the plot.  She is able to inject medical information that is important without becoming too &quot;technical&quot;.  The characters of Abby, the detective Kashka, and the young Yakhov are the most interesting characters, and the climax is both shocking and touching.<br />My only &quot;criticisms&quot;:  the ending happened so fast, it would have been nice to see Abby's reaction to how things ended up; and what happens to Kashka and Yakhov?

However, the central plot is rather mesmerizing, and although the true villain of the piece is rather obvious, Mason takes his time in revealing the identity, and when it comes, it is more &quot;tragic&quot; than &quot;surprising.&quot;  I agree that the central characters are very unsympathetic, merely victims of their own lusts, desires, and inconsideration of other people they are supposedly close to. Ella takes Charles away from Sarah just to show you can; then James takes Ella away from Charles, and then enter gay Eric, whose love for James seems the most genuine in the book.  Alas, Eric's fate is pretty obvious, and after his untimely departure, he is merely a skeletal shadow, obscured by James' continued obsession (not love) with the exasperating and ultimately demented Ella.  James is rather self-pitying, and even though in the beginning we know he has murdered his wife, you have to wonder why he even stayed married to her for forty-five years.<br />A dark, brooding expose, a character study, it offers very little suspense or chills; it is a cozy, wordy foray into the triangle of love, written by an obviously talented young man.<br />If he can remember to give his readers a firm understanding not only of the characters, but of the times in which they live, he just may be a great writer.	2001-05-29

It doesn't have the complex plot twists or non-stop action Deaver has mastered lately.  The hero, John Pellam, is upstaged in this book by Donnie Buffett, an incredibly complex and multi-facted character.  Buffett's character dominates the book, while Pellam is left being abused and mistreated by the ever nasty FBI and the local police force. The identity of the mystery blonde is pretty evident, if you remember those film noirs of the forties and fifties; the big boss' reason for wanting Vince Guadia dead is pretty obvious, too.  The back and forth mob activities get confusing at first, and then downright, mediocre.  The elimination of one of Pellam's friends is also predictable and the hitmen Bales and Steve From end up reminiscent of Laurel and Hardy, or the Two Stooges. I admire Deaver's writing style, which is evident in this book; it's just that it's such a cliche-ridden book, I was disappointed knowing how great Deaver is now!	2001-05-23

Granted, it's not as good as &quot;It,&quot; &quot;Salem's Lot,&quot; or &quot;The Dead Zone,&quot; but &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; delivers.<br />King is very good with developing characters that you care about, and in this novel, he creates some of his best:  Duddies, the Down Syndrome child, and the human dreamcatcher; Jonesy, Henry, Beav, and Pete,four friends who really did stick together through thick and then; Roberta Cavell, Duddies' touching and sincere mother; and Owen, the Army &quot;traitor&quot; who aids Henry in his quest to rid the earth of this dreadful new alien species.<br />King borrows liberally from many horror books/movies: &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers,&quot; &quot;Aliens,&quot; &quot;The Cobra Event,&quot; and others, but in using them he pays homage to and expands their influence.  The chief villain, Kurtz, is loathsome and despicable, and gets his just desserts.<br />There are several scenes of out and out horror; touching human confrontations, and a satisfying, if somewhat ambiguous, denouement.  At times, King tends to pad a little, but overall, King demonstrates why he is the &quot;King&quot; of horror.	2001-05-18

In &quot;The Blue Nowhere,&quot; he once again gives us a suspenseful story with dynamic characters and a pulse-pounding scenario.<br />The story behind this one is enough to make you trade in your computer for an old typewriter..although, how would we write reviews?  Oh, well, keep telling yourself IT'S ONLY A BOOK, IT'S ONLY A BOOK.<br />I particularly liked the relationship that develops between hacker Wyatt Gillette and detective Frank Bishop.  Although they start out as something less than friends, they do become good buddies and I liked Bishop's character quite a lot.<br />I have to admit though, that I don't think this entry is up to par.  Possibly intimidated by critics accusing him of throwing in too many unbelievable twists, he minimizes the twists in this one, and I have to admit, other than the identity of Shawn (which is pretty far-fetched!), I saw all the other twists coming early on.  Also, Mr. Phate's fate is rather anticlimactic, and doesn't deliver the chills most of Deaver's climaxes have given us.  I smell a sequel coming, which wouldn't be that bad.  It's a good book, just not Deaver's best.<br />DON'T YELL AT ME, FELLOW CRITICS...I GOTTA BE HONEST.	2001-05-16

In this thriller, Lucas Davenport (our favorite lustful detective) faces two killers of indescribable evil. Michael Bekker is a handsome, soulless pathologist who works with a deformed &quot;troll,&quot; Carlos Druze, in kind of &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; twist. Druze kills Bekker's wife, and Dekker decks Cruze's mean boss. But it doesn't stop there, oh no...more gruesome murders occur and Bekker turns out to be one of the most vile villains in this genre. The taking of the eyes of the victims to appease Bekker's warped conscience is chilling and quite disturbing. Davenport's usual supporting characters, including Chief Daniel, Sloan, and Lester, all return, and the plot twists move quicker and faster than in the other &quot;Preys.&quot;<br />The best in the series to this point.	2001-05-07

Cross returns to face the bizarre killings of &quot;Jack and Jill.&quot;  They start out killing recognizable &quot;celebrities&quot; of different areas, and then we realize the real target:  The President of the United States. Meanwhile, children in Alex's neighborhood school district are being killed; do these murders relate?  The pace as always is rapid-fire; the dialogue crisp and economic; the characterizations rich and complex.  There are some really unique plot twists and the identity of Jack and Jill should come as a surprise.  The Sojourner school killer likewise. This is mystery fiction at its best.

The plot revolves around some killings being done by a band of Indians, out to wipe out a politician who years before had assaulted a Native American woman.  And of course, Lucas falls for NYPD Lily Rothenberg, and spends much of the book trying to get into her illustrious pants!<br />I have to hand it to Sandford, though.  His plots are compelling and you can't help but finish them.  Fortunately, this series gets better with each installment.  This is not one of the best, and it has a wooden ending, no pun intended.<br />Things get better with &quot;Eyes of Prey&quot; and &quot;Silent Prey.&quot;<br />Stick with him if you haven't given up on him yet.	2001-05-06

Lucas is a cop who will resort to any means to nab his criminal:  planting evidence; using dope dealers and prostitutes to further his cause; he sleeps it seems with any woman who'll have him; he's fathered a child, and still beds one of the serial killer's survivors; and in the end, he...well, not to spoil the ending, he just proves he is NOT your usual upright detective.<br />The book is peopled with characters you can like (Carla, Sister Elle, to name a couple) and characters you can really hate:  Jennifer Carey, Anna McGowan, and of course, our serial killer, Louis Villion.<br />I found Villion's murders seriously under-motivated.  We never really know why this respectable, if ineffectual, lawyer is killing these women.  And although he starts off brilliant and seemingly uncatchable, by the end of the book, he makes so many stupid mistakes, you have to wonder how he got as far as he did.  The nightlight faux pas is particularly stupid, and Lucas' catching of Louis quite far-fetched.<br />All in all, though, you do get hooked in this book, and I will continue the series unless Sandford gets too off base with Lucas and company.	2001-05-01

John Sandford is obviously a prolific and talented writer, as evidenced by the success of his Lucas Davenport &quot;Prey&quot; series.  However, with &quot;The Night Crew,&quot; I have to wonder why all the hoopla?  Granted, this book has a very interesting and unusual premise---following a bunch of &quot;reporters&quot; who film unusual or bizarre accidents/murders/arsons, as they occur.  The main character, Anna, is sympathetic and you can relate to her, in some ways.  The book's best character, Jake, the ex-cop, is also quite different and interesting.<br />Alas, however; the plot gets so confusing and the identity of the murder is so &quot;convenient,&quot; yet unexplained.  The ending, both in regards to what occurs with Anna and Jake's relationship, and Creek's strange visit to Anna's ex-boyfriend, is just frustrating.  No closure!<br />Now, if Sandford intends a series, this ending might work, but if he doesn't, he's robbed the reader of the all-important resolution of vital closure.  A real disappointment.	2001-05-01

Once again, Alex finds himself embroiled in this dastardly scene, because his lovely niece, Naomi, is one of Casanova's &quot;collections.&quot;  The story goes from Chapel Hill to L.A., and back, and Patterson has plenty of surprises and suspenseful scenes to satisfy even the most hardboiled cynic.<br />While the identity of the Gentleman Caller is established right away, Casanova's real identity is left to the very end of the book, and it is a surprise to say the least.<br />Of course, what makes this work so beautifully is the wonderful characterizations Patterson gives us in his recurring characters of Cross, his family, his friend John Sampson, and the heroine, Kate McTiernan.  Don't let the movie influence you in reading this book.  While the movie is an okay thriller, the book far surpasses it in giving us much more background and suspense.<br />&quot;Kiss the Girls&quot; is top notch thriller at its best!	2001-04-27

Alex Cross, along with Lincoln Rhyme and Myron Bolitar, is one of the finest literary creations in the thriller genre of our time!  Patterson has given us a hero with flaws, a wonderful family and personal relationship with his friends, a man with moral conviction and a fierce determination to bring criminals to justice.<br />&quot;Along Came a Spider&quot; is the first in the series and it is a whopper of a tale.  We meet the extremely heinous Gary Soneji, a murderer, a kidnaper, who seemingly can't make any mistakes.  He kidnaps the children of a prominent politician and a movie star, and then proceeds to feign his crimes under the &quot;multiple personality&quot; umbrella.  What a sickie!<br />What makes Patterson so great is that he weaves tales with brisk, short chapters; characters that have more than one dimension, and a wonderful sense of timing.  He pulls lots of plot twists, not quite as sinuously as Jeffrey Deaver, but still they are lulus!  I can't imagine anyone not enjoying these books.  They are the creme de la creme of the lot!<br />Enjoy, but be prepared to get hooked.<br />One aside:  I agree that the casting of Morgan Freeman as Cross in the two films is questionable.  Freeman is a marvelous actor, but I think casting a younger actor, such as Denzel Washington or even Cuba Gooding, Jr., would have allowed the movies to follow the books' characterization more fully.  But don't blame Freeman.  He does an outstanding job, as always.<br />And as always, the book is ALWAYS better than the movie!	2001-04-26

I did find, however, that after a while, the Indian tales got to be a little tedious, and hard to follow.<br />Diana Ladd and David Ladd (come on, Jance, both of these names are well-known actors, wouldn't it have been better to use something a little more original?) are very shallow and unsympathetic characters in this book.  I don't know how they came off in the first book, but they don't evoke a lot of sympathy in this sequel.  The husband, Brandon, comes across very brutish and callous in the beginning, and even when he mellows out as tragedy befalls his family, the change isn't very believable.  The character of Quentin, his son, is irreprehensible, and I don't know why Jance allows him to hang around at the book's ending.<br />The villains, both Andrew Carlisle and Mitch Johnson, are mere effigies of villains given us by masters Jeffrey Deaver and James Patterson.<br />I haven't read Ms. Jance's series novels, but this one doesn't really entice me to do so.<br />This is not by any means an awful book, but it is a difficult read and does not move as fast as it should.	2001-04-25

Goldy is back, and unfortunately, so is her ridiculously cartoonish ex-husband, John Norman, and her increasingly annoying fourteen year old son, Arch.  Her usually enjoyable husband, Tom, is merely a plot device in this one, and none of his usual charm and security is evidenced.  I don't know why Davidson had to give Tom an ex-lover mysteriously returned from the dead, and if Goldy really loved Tom as much as she says, how could she doubt him on such little evidence?<br />The murders in this book are so under-written that you find yourself not really caring if they are caught, and when the culprit is revealed, I found myself saying, &quot;Big deal...who else could it have been?&quot;<br />And as for the recipes, which once were novel and entertaining, they are now merely interruptions in the plot.  And, besides, who would really eat this kind of &quot;snobbish&quot; food?  Let's have some good basic recipes, or better yet, why don't we retire Goldy from the catering business.  Let her go nuts and shoot and kill her ex-husband, send Arch off to a disciplinary boarding school and she, Tom and Marla can open their own detective agency.<br />It's sad to see a good series start to fail so miserably as in &quot;Sticks and Scones.&quot;	2001-04-23

I liked the way the plot switched back and forth from Manhattan to Atlantic City, and the dark noir feel is certainly captured in some of the street scenarios.  It's also interesting too in how the villain gets his final comeuppance.<br />A nice entertaining read, and a good precursor to Patterson's later efforts.	2001-04-21

The inclusion of Kenny's nephew in the story adds a different twist, and actually, ends up saving the heroes' lives at one point.<br />The killer is a nasty one, shooting out the eyes of former or current police officers.  Phillips pulls some surprises in that he allows some of the officers we've become familiar with in both novels to come to rather unexpected ends.<br />The final twist is a real big one, and Phillips handles it expertly and believably.<br />Looking forward to more Candiotti and Marks escapades in the future.

It figures so prominently in the story that it almost takes on its own mystique and charisma.  Needless to say, the Hitchcockian influenced climax on the GGB is stunning and terrifying, too!<br />Jane Candiotti and her partner Kenny Marks, are very interesting and credible police detectives, with a history of their own.  Jane finds herself falling in love with a man accused of murdering his rich wife because she was going to leave him.  This all happens by the husband mouthing off to a stranger he meets on the train about how much he wishes his wife were dead.  Aha, &quot;Stranger on a Train&quot; revisited.<br />From there on, the plot takes several twists, turns and pseudoclimaxes before its breathtaking finale.<br />Phillips creates a very &quot;noirish&quot; feel to this well-executed first novel, following it up with an exceptionally good book called &quot;Blindsided.&quot;  Read them both---they're excellent!	2001-04-18

Ms. Wood has a very good sense of the vernacular and creating flesh and blood characters with believable eccentricities and hang-ups.<br />The eight friends in this book have been friends for years; they are all rich and seem to have little in life to worry about.  The main character, Myra Ludens, has had an unhealthy fear of her basement for years and decides the best thing to do is to renovate it, and hopefully banish all her fears.  Even her friends who come over for bridge every week don't like the basement---even after the $30,000 renovation job!<br />Myra's sleuthing reveals that the body of a woman hanged as a witch in the late 1600's is buried right underneath Myra's basement.  The renovator admits later that they even found the woman's bones but didn't want to tell anyone in fear of losing business.  (I'm not sure about that one?).<br />At any rate, Myra is then &quot;possessed&quot; by the witch's spirit or has gone mad, or perhaps even has her own paranormal talents.  This is something Ms. Wood never fully reveals, thus leaving the reader unsure of the real reason behind the deaths seemingly caused by Myra's &quot;wishes.&quot;<br />It's got some good points---excellent characterizations, some real suspenseful scenes and a few original twists---but overall, &quot;The Basement&quot; is a novel in search of a better ending.	2001-04-16

His cold, calculating approach to murder goes beyond what most of us have experienced in other serial killer novels.<br />Philpin and Sierra have given us a credible coda to the first book, bringing the notorious Wolf back in a highly believable manner.  Matching the evil Wolf is the less than perfect hero, Lucas Frank.  His understanding of the dark side of evil is enhanced by his own dark thoughts and obsession with solving murderous crimes.<br />The authors use effective narratives in the first person by Lucas, his daughter Lane, and Wolf.  Much suspense and mystery are piled on throughout and the resolution, although a little quick, is satisfying.<br />A great entry in the serial killer genre.	2001-04-03

I found myself completely engrossed in Harry Bosch and the complex plot.  Connelly deftly balances courtroom intrigue and police procedurals, not relying on a lot of crimes being committed during the course of this novel.  He refers instead to a previous crime which he thought was over, but has now resurfaced as the victim's widow has filed suit against him.  A really good writer, Connelly entangles us in several breathtaking courtroom confrontations and &quot;dirty&quot; cop scenarios.<br />Bosch is a great character, his relationship with Sylvia is very believable and you want it to work out.  Add Money Chandler, the vicious defense attorney, who is one of the best &quot;hero/villains&quot; I've read in a long time.  <br />All the characters are well-fleshed and even though I thought I had the mystery figured out, Connelly pulls a very credible surprise on us!<br />I can't wait to get the other Bosch books now.

Dr. Michael Stone's wife and daughter, Sarah and Ronnie, are held hostage by a madman named Mr. Jack, who has some devastating plans for his old enemies, the &quot;Japs&quot; as he calls them.  His henchman, Moss, is a despicable muscle-bound moron, who takes pleasure in beating up women and perhaps even children?<br />&quot;Fire and Ice&quot; is a good read, a little technical in spots, that tends to slow down the action and the pacing.  However, the story holds your interest and even if the slam-bang ending seems a trifle far-fetched, it delivers.<br />My biggest complaint is that the novel ends so abruptly; there is one villain we don't know what happens to him, and the heroes future seems up in the air as well.<br />If the ending had a stronger resolution, I would have gone with five stars.  Worth the read, though.	2001-03-23

One cannnot deny that Mr. Crichton as always has done some remarkable research into what goes into making an airplane safe.  The novel opens briskly with a very unusual air disaster, resulting not in a crash, but still three corpses and over fifty injuries.  Casey Singleton is a very well drawn character and I found myself involved in her dilemma.  The only other characters that I found remotely likeable, however, were her secretary Norma, and her some-time lover Ted.  The rest of the characters are merely duplicitous, irritable and just plain nasty. The story takes a long time to develop and little suspense is demonstrated, particularly in the seemingly unnecessary &quot;union scares.&quot; All in all, this is not one of Michael's better books, but if you are a frequent flyer, you might want to check it out and see why I love terra firma!	2001-03-18

It is quite different from most of his previous works, but in this one, Dean manages to bring to life some really memorable characters, and with the exception of one (ironically, the villain Enoch Cain), very believable characters.<br />The characters of Agnes and Joey Lampion are very touching; even if Agnes seems to be too good to be true, she is so warm and such a vital character in this novel that you cannot help but feel for and with her.  She possesses a quite strength, an unflinching determination, and a love for her family that is heartwarming in this day and age of such cruelty and violence.  Joey, although only in the book briefly, is wonderfully drawn and his presence is felt as the book progresses.<br />Add Jacob and Edom, Agnes' two rather unusual brothers (both of them are paranoid about natural and/or personal disasters), and you have a family scenario rarely found in this genre.<br />Next, we have the wonderful and complex character of Thomas Vandium, a cop with unusual &quot;magical&quot; talents, and a desire to bring a sick killer to justice.<br />Okay, let's keep going...we meet Seraphim White and her sister, Celestina.  Seraphim bites the dust early, but not before giving birth to Angel, whom Celestina adopts.  Angel is the product of a rape by a vicious hedonist named Enoch Cain.  Yes, the same one that will soon become a relentless serial killer.  And of course, the stalker throughout the book, looking for the mysterious Bartholomew, whom he feels is going to kill him or something worse.<br />Other rich characters include Paul Damascus, a friend of Agnes; Maria, a Hispanic friend, who learns English from Agnes; Wally Lipscomb, a widowed doctor who finds love in the White family; Harrison and Grace White, Seraphim's parents, who never come across as typical African-American baptists.<br />And of course, there is Bartholomew, the child prodigy who is the core of the novel.  He is a heartbreaker, but unforgettable.  Add the equally precocious Angel, and you have some of the best characters Koontz has graced us with.<br />The plot sometimes borders on ludicrous, but in the context of Dean's spiritual direction, you can believe if you suspend your belief.<br />Unfortunately, although Enoch Cain is a typically disgusting Koontz villain, we never fully understand why he does the strange things he does in the book; what made him such a despicable person capable of such violence and hate?  Even a brief mention of child abuse by his mother does not fully validate the actions of Mr. Cain.<br />Also, what do the mysterious ailments that afflict Enoch (violent vomiting, violent diarrhea, boils, etc.,) really mean?<br />Koontz has a lot of religious symbolism in this novel (look at the names of some of the characters--the villain is Cain (Abel's murderous brother); Paul Damascus (St. Paul was converted on the road to Damascus); Serpahim and Celestina (angelic names); Thomas (the doubter); and of course, Bartholomew (one of the lesser known apostles).<br />Koontz' vision may be deemed too optimistic, and maybe the ending is forced, rushed and not totally credible, but I loved the book.  It touched me and made me think; and it made me care for people that I would like to meet.<br />Don't expect a typical serial killer gorefest; relish instead the relationships of some of these wonderful characters.<br />And then go out and try walking between the raindrops!!!cross as typical African-American baptists.<br />And of course, there is Bartholomew, the child prodigy who is the core of the novel.

However, Burkett's talents as a developer of characters and plausible scenarios is minimally evidenced.<br />The plot revolves around what happens when a scientist predicts disaster from solar flares.  (Burkett must go through the effects of a flare at least two dozen times, enough is enough, Larry.)  Of course, we have our staunch heroes and our nasty villains.  They are so stereotyped, they become laughable.<br />Also, Mr. Burkett spends a great deal of time philosophizing and offering obvious personal political beliefs.  Some of what goes on at the evacuation camps at the end is pure hokum, and stretches credibility.<br />It is refreshing to have no foul language or sex scenes, but there is some violence, although not gratuitous.<br />The book is long, overdrawn and ultimately boring.  The last few sections maintained my interest because I had spent so much time with the book I felt obligated to see how it resolved.<br />I don't recommend this book for seasoned readers who find plot and character development essential; however, if you want something to make you feel a little more &quot;uplifted,&quot; it's not too bad.	2001-03-06

This latest entry in the popular Joe Grey series is a delightful read, as always!  Reading Ms. Murphy's tales is just pure and simple fun.  The mysteries themselves always take backseats to the amazing antics of Joe, Dulcie, and the new Kit (nameless as of yet!).<br />The plot in this one finds our beloved Max Harper, Chief of Police, framed for the brutal murder of two riding companions.  Of course, we know Max didn't do it, but Joe and Dulcie (and the kit) are raging mad, and they do their best to find the real culprits.<br />The identity of the killer is not that surprising, but the way Joe and friends bring them to justic is wonderful.  The addition of a wild cougar on the loose and the return of Kate Osborne, the cat/human from the first book, makes this a joy to read and relish.<br />Have fun, and can't wait until Joe and Dulcie and the kit return!	2001-03-03

I found one of my main problems with this book is that it seems incredibly slow, even when there is action going on.  I guess it's because the perils of the trapped students at the excavation site are predictable and it seems to take forever to resolve them.  I thought &quot;If there's one more attack by these &quot;pale creatures,&quot; I was going to lose it!  The characterizations are as stereotypical as you can get, and the villains are predictably nasty.<br />A nice element of the story, however, is the relationship between Professor Henry and Dr. Joan.  Their &quot;twilight&quot; romance is refreshing and touching.  Sam's relationship or lack thereof with Maggie is not as effective.  The elimination of one of the focal characters midways through the book is also disappointing, but not surprising.<br />All in all, EXCAVATION is not a bad read; it's just not that original or exciting.	2001-02-25

Cloning is a fascinating subject, and has been the setting for many recent thrillers.  John Darnton's &quot;The Experiment&quot; is a frightening look at what could happen if the experiment goes awry.  I was very impressed with Mr. Darnton's early scenes that focused on the relationship between Skyler and his friends on the island---Raisin, Julia and the Gullah man, Kutua.  However, once the novel adds the characters of Jude Harley and Tizzie Tierney, the craftmanship weakens, although not enough to keep this from being a riveting and entertaining thriller.<br />One problem I found is that even though Jude and Skyler are both presented as heroic figures, Darnton fails to reward Jude in the novel's bittersweet ending.  I also found the identity of the mysterious Dr. Rincon to be a little irrational to say the least.  Why wasn't the key factor of Dr. Rincon's identity ever announced earlier?  The ending seems a little forced and loses a lot of the emotional impact Darnton had established early on.<br />However, overall, this is a worthwhile read, and certainly shows why Mr. Darnton has won a Pulitzer.	2001-02-22

Obviously, the man has done a tremendous amount of research focusing on ancient Mayan/Incan legends, and his story utilizes these legends intricately.  However, there is so much information to absorb, that at times, the plot seems to move at a snail's pace, and your interest wanes.  At those points, though, Alten brings you back into the plot with several jolting sequences.<br />The character of Michael Gabriel is an interesting one, and he is geared for future adventures, as evidenced in the announcement of the sequel to this book, &quot;Resurrection.&quot;  Dominique Vasquez, the romantic interest, is also fairly interesting, although the development of her character seems more plot-motivated then sincere.<br />The portrayal of the world's leaders ready to engage in nuclear weaponry is chilling in istelf.  The connection between all the ancient pyramids, etc., is fascinating and does make one wonder about the December 21, 2012 date.<br />A good read, I guess I was wanting a little more suspense and action.	2001-02-16

Mr. Carr must have wanted to shake he reputation for writing stories set in the past really bad!  Well he did get the last of that sentence right, really bad.  There is no real point to this story.  The writing is not bad and he does have a good beginning characterization.  But, for the most part, the reader only gets a superficial look at the characters.  The ending was dismal.  Almost like the author say, \\"well that is enough pages, I need to end this thing `.  I really hope that Mr. Carr doesn't plan on another one of these \\"future\\" books.

I'm not going to bore you with another rendition of the plot of this book.  Four other reviewers have done an excellent job.  I will say that a reader should start at the beginning of this series to get the full enjoyment of this story.  Fremont Jones is a wonderfully fleshed out character.  Ms. Day is a wonderful and entertaining writer.  She does a great job of characterization and plotting in her books.  The author is also great at giving her books a good feel for the times.  Weather it be, social, physical or emotional.  The reader gets the added plus of comparing East and West Coast in this installment.  Ms. Day is right, there is a vast difference between the two.  May be next time Fremont can go to Southern California, once again there is a vast difference.  It would be interesting to see Fremont's take on that one.  The mystery in this installment is a good solid one.  Who did what or did it happen at all?  Then the why, Ms. Day as always does an excellent job of closing the plot and explaining the why of this story.  Once again, I wholeheartedly recommend this book and series.  One note to the previous reviewer, read \\"The Strange Files of Fremont Jones\\" to find out about the Fremont relation.  One does not have to have children to have people related to them.	2001-02-13

I'll just about take any paperback home if it meets these two standards.  I found a lot of really good and fun books like that.  \\"Raven\\" is one of the best I've done this with.  I didn't know where Mr. Swiniarski came from but I hope he will always grace us with a vampire story every once in awhile.  This is a great book!  I don't usually read vampire books and when I do they have to be special.  Not your run of the mill, evil master, innocent people chased and the hero kills the vampire for the ending.  This story has those elements, but the author has added many more levels to his story.  Mr. Swiniarski does a fantastic job of developing characters and plot in \\"Raven\\".  I read this book in January 1997 and it has stayed with me since.  (I've also been hoping for another one with this hero, Kane Tyler.)  If you are ever lucky enough to find a copy of \\"Raven\\" get it.  Even if your are not a total vampire or horror fan.  This is a great read.  I did find out recently that Mr. Swiniarski has two other pen names, S. Andrew Swann, which he uses to write science fiction.  Another pen name is Steven Krane, in which he has written \\"Teek\\".	2001-02-13

I do think, however, that an astute reader can pick out the identity of the serial killer early in the book, but even so, the climax maintains some punch anyway!<br />&quot;The Visionary&quot; is a graphic novel, so be forewarned; however, if you like a good sit by the fire thriller and a few goosebumps, this one delivers.	2001-02-09

However, David Searcy's &quot;Ordinary Horror&quot; is probably the worst book I have ever read, and I have read thousands in my estimable lifetime!<br />First of all, there is no horror in this book at all.  Searcy is obviously an intelligent, well-learned writer, but he has no idea how to communicate with his audience.  Searcy rambles on with hundreds of run-on, compound sentences and establishes little credence in this far-fetched plot....which is WHAT?<br />There is NO PLOT and the resolution is completely baffling!!!  What is the point of a book that meanders about demonstrating nothing but the writer's command of the English language?<br />The characters---Mr. Delbanano, the Getz's and any other subordinates, are total washouts, and merely cardboard expressions of humanity.

Not that there is ANYTHING wrong with Christian literature; I love good literature, and embrace a novel that can open my eyes and make me think about my own beliefs and/or doubts.<br />&quot;The Visitation&quot; succeeds on that level, as it explores the many doubts and questions of a burned out minister named Travis Jordan.  When a charming self-proclaimed Messiah appears in the small town of Antioch, Washington, Travis ultimately is the one called on to get to the bottom of his seemingly miraculous visitor.<br />The novel takes a long time (too long, perhaps) in becoming a &quot;suspense&quot; novel.  There are many flashback scenes, and many pages spent on religious theory discussions.  By the time the suspense arrives, you may feel you had to wait too long.<br />The second half or so of the book, however, does pick up steam as we learn more about the &quot;Messiah&quot; and the people of the town.<br />Perretti has done a very good job in sketching the townspeople and how these miracles affect their lives.  It is very reminiscent of Stephen King's &quot;Needful Things&quot; in that the people get what they wish for, but at a price.<br />Overall, this is not a bad book, but a challenging one.  Challenging in its pace, and also in challenging the reader to re-think Jesus, faith, their church, and ultimately, their lives.	2001-02-03

If you can find a copy, however, it is a brilliant character study by a gifted English writer.<br />There are a few plot holes in the plot, and the pace is typically British &quot;slow.&quot;  However, one cannot deny the power of the characterizations.  There are five outstanding examples.<br />*Marianne Cadogan - the eleven year old protagonist of the story is a complex mix of child and adult.  You may at first be irritated with the way she entwines herself in the life of one Ryan O'Donnell, a convicted child molester who rescues her from a certain death in the first chapter.  However, once you learn more about Marianne, you can't help but admire the child's tenacity, spunk, and ability to warm the hearts of even the coldest of people.  As Marianne leads Ryan on a seemingly futile search for her estranged mother, she develops a maturity way beyond her years, and can only share her desperation and hope as she comes so close to a reunion. *Ryan O'Donnell - a remarkable study in social alienation and heroism.  Ryan starts out avoiding Marianne's friendship, but in  the end, he is persuaded to assist Marianne in her quest.  As we learn more about Ryan, it becomes hard to view him as a hero.  He DID commit the crime he was imprisoned for at the age of fifteen.  But in journeying with him to Germany, we discover much more about him, and as he does everything he can to help Marianne, he becomes the true hero of the book, and the ending is gutwrenching in its poignancy and sadness. Three other characters well-fleshed out are the mother, Anneliese Cadogan, whose descent into madness and irreparable harm, is chilling; Patrick Cadogan, the father of Marianne, is also expertly drawn, and he too undergoes a metamorphosis that can only be deemed as inevitable, in light of what he must go through to re-unite with his daughter; and finally, the police detective Jennifer is also a sharp characterization, a mix of professional apathy and human sympathy, too.<br />All in all, this book is worth reading to simply experience the rich characterizations of Gallagher's pen.ective Jennifer is also a sharp characterization, a mix of professional apathy and human sympathy, too.<br />All in all, this book is worth reading to simply experience the rich characterizations of Gallagher's pen.	2001-01-22

I wasn't expecting the duel story line.  What a wonderful surprise the history story line is.  Again, I hung on to every word that Mr. Sullivan wrote in this tight plot.  Ghost Dance is more complex than The Purification Ceremony.  The author does a great job at weaving everything together.  I loved the visions, ghost, etc.  I love this type of story any way.  You can never out run the past.  Mr. Sullivan does a great job of explaining Native American lore and how it intertwines with modern believes.

The plot centers on the murder of an elderly Indian shaman, and his revenge, which takes the form of tremendously hostile and predatory wind.  The Williwaw is out to seek revenge on the city of Seattle, and does so in a ferocious and vindictive fashion.<br />Kersey has shaped some suspense-filled scenarios, and he pulls out the stops in his depiction of the devastation wreaked by this incredible natural force.<br />The characters:  Paul Judge, a Native American who is now a lawyer, and hesitant to relive his own heritage---Paul turns out to be quite a superhero, but is an intense and likeable character.  Denise Baker---the &quot;heroine&quot; of the story is the mother of a deaf, but gifted, young boy named Evan.  Evan is somehow the key to the revenge and the wind is out to get him and offer him as a sacrifice.  Other characters are stock supporting characters, i.e., the lecherous assistant to the Mayor who puts the moves on Denise; the Mayor himself who is self-centered, arrogant, and sexist---and does an amazing twist at the end to become almost Angelic; a tough and durable old lady named Helen who experiences the wrath of the wind early on, losing her dog in the process, and becomes obsessed with exposing the wind as something more than a weather phenomenon.<br />All in all, &quot;Soul Catcher&quot; is a cleverly plotted, if formualaic, novel.  It's out of print, so you may have a difficult time finding a copy.  If you stumble on to it, you won't be disappointed, if you're not expecting Koontz/King/Deaver quality.	2001-01-20

And I would be hard pressed to think that they weren't entertained by this whimsical, different thriller.<br />Darwin Minor and Syndey Olsen are great characters, and even if Simmons pulled some of the accidents off the net, who cares?  They are pretty funny.  The bizarre killings are also imaginative and quite interesting to those of us who have never imagined the life of an accident reconstructionist.<br />If there are plot holes, inaccuracies (legally or whatever), the average reader doesn't care as long as he is entertained.  And I found this to be one of Simmons' most entertaining novels.<br />Maybe he'll even start a Darwin Minor series; why not?

Sure, there are some cliches but they certainly don't underwhelm Mr. Deaver's incredible writing abilities.<br />This book doesn't have the usual trademark plot twists that have abounded in books such as &quot;Devil's Teardrop&quot; and the Lincoln Rhyme series, but there some sufficient surprises to satisfy the Deaver in all of us.<br />The change in the characterizations of the Collier family is believable, and especially Bett, who turns out to be quite a heroine.  The addition of Joshua as Megan's lover is also a nice twist, and the scenes in the abandoned mental hospital are effectively creepy.<br />So chill out and enjoy the chills!	2001-01-16

However, the pace is amazingly slow, and the lead character, John Corey, can sometimes be a little egotistical and arrogant.  The case itself is an original idea, but there are no real surprises and the denouement seems forced and lethargic.<br />Not a bad read, but nothing special.	2000-12-03

The hero, Nat, is a likeable protagonist, and his involvement with the wealthy twins, Izzie and Grace, is complex and ultimately doomed.  Add Freedy Knight to the mix and you have one crazy plot evolve.  Freedy is a great character, and Abrahams' motif of letting us get inside Freedy's rather warped mind is a treat.<br />The plot moves a little slowly at the beginning, but by the time it picks up, it is involving and ominous.  The book's two biggest &quot;twists&quot; however are very obvious, and don't really surprise the reader.  These twists involve the identity of Freedy's father and a key plot mechanism involving Izzie and Grace and their kidnapping scheme.  Poor Nat, he is pretty blind not to see the obvious in this one!<br />However, it is a diverting read, not a classic, but not a dud either!	2000-11-18

Well, other than having a psychic heroine, there is very little resemblance between the movie and the book.  The movie was good on its own, but I think the book is a little more involving and coherent.<br />We meet Eve Stein who has been &quot;blessed&quot; or &quot;cursed&quot; with psychic abilities.  While visiting her estranged husband at his new lakeside residence, she touches a swing and flashes on a vision of a woman being killed nearby.  We learn the killer's identity early and he is certainly a cold, heartless murderer.<br />Eve tells her vision to a local cop, Dave Levotsky, an almost local legendary detective, who doesn't believe her until she touches him and tells him things about himself that no one could possibly know.<br />From thereon, Wood takes us on a deep, disturbing journey as the killer learns of the psychic's ability and does everything he can to find her and kill her --- but not before he forces her to reveal what horrible thing happened in his childhood that left him with serious physical and mental scars.<br />While I usually dislike writers who try to justify their villains' heinous crimes and make you feel sorry for them, Wood pulls this one off nicely.  Adam Fuller DID have a horrible childhood and one can certainly see why he feels compelled to murder.<br />The final confrontation between Adam and Eve (ha!) in the cemetery is chilling and even touching.  However, I was kind of disturbed at Eve's sudden &quot;sympathy&quot; for the man who was going to kill her, but the open-ended ending lets you know that things will work out for Eve.<br />A good solid thriller and highly recommended.  Watch &quot;In Dreams&quot; too even though it's nothing like the book!	2000-11-13

It opens brilliantly with a vivid, if graphic, depiction of the three dead girls of the title.  From there on, Dobyns weaves an intricate and complex novel of just what makes up the members of the sleepy little town of Aurelius, New York.<br />When reading the novel, you don't realize until late in the book that you have no idea who your narrator truly is.  His name is never mentioned, and at times, you wonder if the narrator isn't the one responsible.  Is He?  No spoiler here, hopefully.<br />The amount of detail of the characters is overwhelming at times, and you have to really pay attention to what you are reading.  There are many wonderfully drawn characters and some real scenes of chilling suspense.  While some of the situations and characters may initially appear &quot;over the top,&quot; the way Dobyns weaves them into the story is highly commendable.<br />The book, as good as it is, remains a downer.  The ending is totally unexpected, and you have to wonder where the pivotal character is heading.  The dark secrets and the way suspicion destroys this town is depressing, to say the least.<br />As a novel, it is a remarkable work; as entertainment, be warned---it's one of those books that disturb you more than entertain.<br />Worth a read if you're into cerebral mystery!	2000-11-10

Although I hate to be picky, there is one disturbing error in this book.  In the first novel, one of the main characters was EDWIN Fulton.  In this book, the character's name mysteriously changes to EDMUND.  Is this an author's faux pas or an editors?  In any case, it is a shoddy booboo!<br />Also, in this book, Alex doesn't really do much of the private investigating at all, leaving it up to Leon Prudell, who emerges as more of an interesting character than McKnight.  McKnight seems to be a whiny, pessimistic, self-pitying failure in this book, and his &quot;devotion&quot; to finding the missing Dorothy is rather tiresome and unmotivated.<br />The inclusion of the Russian Molinov and the scene in the ice cabin is way over board.  The resolution, likewise, is too pat and contrived.  Seems like McKnight should consider his choice of friends in the future, since in both books, they certainly aren't what they seem.<br />I do agree that Hamilton's descriptions of the frigid Michigan weather is stunning and evocative; unfortunately, the story and pacing in this one is tepid.<br />I also have a problem with Hamilton continuing to toy with us on McKnight's plans for revenge on his foes from the first book.  Get with it, Hamilton.  Stop manipulating and use your extraordinary writing abilities to deliver good reading.	2000-11-08

Michael Prescott has demonstrated a very keen ability to create very convincing and resourceful damsels in distress; villains that are thoroughly disgusting and evil; heroes that pop out of nowhere; and in &quot;The Shadow Hunter,&quot; a truly surprise villain that comes out of nowhere for a real stunner!<br />The novel focuses on a private security firm that specializes in aiding victims of stalkers.  The book opens nicely with our heroine, Abby Sinclair, trying to keep a female stalker from killing an actor who jilted her.  Unfortunately, things don't go well for Abby, and as she re-enters the story, she is assigned to track a particularly nasty stalker hounding a successful and beautiful newscaster.<br />From this point, the novel twists and turns into several surprising plot devices.  Abby finds herself being stalked after she discovers that the stalker has an informant who knows her every move.<br />The identity of this informant is truly surprising, and the climax is taut and terrifying.<br />This is Prescott's best book to date, and should firmly entrench him in the forefront of today's suspense writers.	2000-11-07

The main character, Alex McKnight, is an interesting, if flawed, hero, one minute being Superman and the next Supersensitive.  But he's likeable and he seems real.<br />The background of Alex's shootout with a madman named Rose is fascinating in that a bullet was left lodged in his heart, although his partner died in the onslaught.<br />Fourteen years later, McKnight is back home in the upper Michigan peninsula, running cabins his late father built, and becoming a reluctant PI assisting a smooth lawyer named Lane.<br />McKnight is then embroiled in a thick noir plot involving his somewhat best friend millionaire and his wife, whom McKnight once had an affair with.<br />The book moves at a very quick pace, and as it appears that the madman responsible for his injury is somehow murdering bookmakers, the plot thickens.<br />The denouement is unusually abrupt, but it certainly does smell of a sequel.<br />All in all, a very good read and I'm looking forward to reading the second entry in the Alex McKnight series, which I shall do as soon as I finish this review.	2000-11-07

How these two men become involved with each other is well-written and mesmerizing.<br />The novel has a great ensemble of characters, and has some truly frightening exorcism scenes.  The finale is a whopper set in the remains of a hotel destroyed by an unexplained fire.<br />This is a great first novel and one can only hope Ms. Hall returns with another one soon!<br />The only reason I didn't give it FIVE STARS is that I was a little disappointed with the resolution between Father Michael and his love interest, Tess.  Maybe it's because I'm a Catholic!<br />At any rate, this is a wonderful novel, full of suspense and some well-placed humor.	2000-11-04

There are plenty of interesting secondary characters, a pretty vile grandfather, and assorted villains and heroes.<br />&quot;Mystery&quot; is well constructed and maintains interest a little better than its predecessor, &quot;Koko.&quot;  With &quot;The Throat,&quot; Straub finally hits his mark and makes the trilogy a worthwhile, if difficult, journey.	2000-11-03

I would highly recommend this book to any one who is interested in the Catholic Church.  I married a Catholic and began attending Mass with him.  Most of what was going on I didn't understand at all.  I bought this book because of the title and the light hearted approach the author took in explaining the Catholic Church.  After reading this book, I converted to Catholic Church.  This book give me a great understanding of the faith and history of the Catholic Church.  With the knowledge that this book gave me, I now have a better understanding of my church than some &quot;cradle&quot; Catholics.  I would recommend this book to any one who has an interest in the Catholic Church.  Weather you are a Catholic or not.  Plus, it is fun to read, Mr. Johnson explains his topics in lay terms.

As some reviewers noted, the identity of Koko is spotted easily early on, and even though it doesn't totally eliminate the suspense, it makes it harder to get involved in the book.  A couple of riveting scenes are truly frightening, but overall, this is a vastly overrated novel.  The lack of a resolution in the end is disappointing too, although I understand this is the first in a trilogy of novels that includes &quot;Mystery,&quot; and &quot;The Throat.&quot;  I will have to reserve final judgment until I read those two.

Cook has proven to be a very accomplished author, giving us many chilling tales of past events haunting his characters in their present lives.  &quot;Places in the Dark&quot; is another entry in Cook's psychodramas.<br />Unfortunately, this one doesn't have any &quot;heart&quot; in it.  The story is interesting, but there is such gloom and pessimism throughout, that one knows the happy ending is not going to come.  I also found the characters of Cal and Billy, while vastly intriguing, to be stereotypical and predictable.<br />Dora March is another character who displays so little soul, one has to wonder why either brother falls in love with her.<br />As we venture with Cal throughout the story to find out if Dora murdered Billy, we meet some interesting characters, but all of them are mainly depressing and heartless, too.  Even the boys' parents behave in a rather ridiculous manner, never really dealing with why they got married if they were so different.<br />The ending is also one of Cook's weakest.  It's like he threw it together because he didn't know who else to pin the &quot;murder&quot; on.<br />I like Cook, but this book is average fare, and certainly not up to Cook's Edgar-winning standards.	2000-10-23

Westlake doesn't give us anyone to really &quot;root for&quot; in the novel and without that, you're left with a professional study of two obsessive and equally demented minds.

The resolution at the end, however, does make you both wince and smile!<br />A good quick read.	2000-10-20

Suffice to say, it has everything an action book should have, and would make one whale of a movie (no pun intended!).<br />It even has a heroic seal named Wendy!  A mathematical whiz kid in Kirsty.  And an indomitable, fearless, ingenuous, gentle, deformed, masculine hero that has you rooting for him all the way through.  Shane Schofield is his name, and he is a great literary creation.

Mr. Hecht is certainly a master of unique characterizations and neurological information.  Although I think the book is really &quot;Over-rated&quot; by the majority of literary critics, it IS a great read.  Sometimes the dialogue is a little repetitive, and some of the scenarios are a little too lengthy to help maintain the suspense, but overall &quot;Skull Session&quot; is a worthwhile read.<br />There are many superlative characterizations.  Of course, the leading characters of Paul and Lia are rich and provocative; sympathetic and believable; tragic and heroic.  Along with them are some really excellent supporting characters, the most effective being Morgan Ford, the detective who becomes embroiled in the complex plot involving the vandalism of a wealthy woman's historic lodge and the mysterious disappearances of several teenagers.  Mo (as he is called) has a disturbing past, and carries this along with the weight of his divorce.  His insecurities, the desire for female companionship again, and his mania over resolving the case in his own &quot;renegade&quot; manner is intelligent and gripping.  His ultimate fate, however, is a very disturbing part of the book that I wish Hecht had redirected, although it does have a tremendous emotional impact.  Also very interesting is Heather Mason, a teenage girl with severe emotional problems who provides clues in the case, in spite of her parent's objections.  Peter Rizal, a macho cop, is also quite well-drawn.  Royce, Aunt Vivien, Demory Corrigan, Janet Skoglund, Mark Skoglund, the list could go on---there are richly drawn characters, which is what makes this book so rewarding in the long run.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is it's a little too lengthy and I really hated what happens with Morgan Ford.  But, hey, what the Hecht?  This is a very good book!	2000-10-10

What is really unique about this book is the complexity of the characters and the inability to really make them either good or bad, although certainly the villain is definitely bad.  The usual childhood traumas are used to justify the mental illness, but even then Prescott doesn't offer this as an excuse, merely as a reason.<br />I particularly found the characters of Marge and Andrew very well drawn.  Marge is the lieutenant who felt she should have gotten the chief position when crusty old Paul retired.  But instead, they bring in an outsider from New York with his own hidden secrets.  The method in which the sour Marge turns to respect her new boss is done with credibility and sensitivity.  The transformation is satisfying.<br />Likewise, we have Andrew, the husband of the heroine who married her for money, and has a criminally colorful past.  Although you immediately want to despise him, as the story progresses, he becomes a flesh and blood character, driven by past greeds, but in the end, turning into a rather surprising force in the novel.<br />The scenes in the cave are at times tedious and drawn out, but they enhance the feeling of our heroine as she tries desperately to battle her evil brother.<br />This is a great read--I found myself saying things out loud, like &quot;You just did something stupid,&quot; or &quot;Come on, Erica, don't be so silly...&quot;<br />This is good reading; although after reading &quot;Stealing Faces,&quot; I think Prescott tends to supply his leading characters the same formulae, but hey if it works, why not?	2000-10-06

Richard Montanari has created a complex, suspenseful and frightening look at a serial killer.  &quot;The Violet Hour&quot; opens with a shocking beginning, and then just moves on, page to page, with one twist after another.  It's almost Jeffery Deaver-like, but Montanari's twists are a little subtler and not as &quot;unbelievable&quot; (but don't get me wrong, Deaver is one of my favorite writers!).<br />The story centers around this killer getting revenge on five people who twenty years earlier did something awful to the girl he loved.<br />There are many good clues in this book, but he has camouflaged them so well, you only remember then once the book is read.  One of the most amazing is this:  you won't get one of the clues unless you say a particular word out loud to yourself.  Great plot device there!<br />The identity of the killer is surprising, yet if you read back, you can see all the evidence pointing to them.  There are also some great subplots, and an ending that floored me!  I wasn't expecting it.<br />The characters are well-developed, and interesting.  Nick Stella is a compassionate hero, who sheds his &quot;scoop of the century&quot; mode to assist in a bizarre series of deaths.  Amelia Saintsbury is a good heroine, and her private dilemmas are intermingled well with her potential doom.<br />All in all, can't say too much, would not want to give anything away!  But, this is a GREAT book and I eagerly await Mr. Montanari's next.  Am also going to go back and read &quot;Deviant Way.&quot;  If it's half as good, it's worth the bucks!	2000-09-30

Harlan Coben has given us some of the best characters in modern suspense fiction:  sports agent Myron Bolitar, a very human, fallible, and sensitive creature; the cold, calculating but extremely loyal (to Myron and Esperanza) sidekick who doesn't mind breaking a few legs to send a message; Esperanza and Big Cyndi, the ladies who are there to support Myron; and of course, Myron's parents, who are a refreshing addition to this genre.<br />In this novel, what is different is that it is the most &quot;cerebral&quot; of Coben's books; there's not a whole lot of action or fisticuffs or violence in this one.  The story is unique and heartwrenching.  Myron finds out he is a father, finds out that his own father had a massive heart attack, and has to deal with his nemesis Greg Downing and his wife.  Their secrets from the past rise like a phoenix in this novel, threatening to destroy everyone, including Myron's son, who is a product of his affair with Emily on the night before her wedding to Greg.  I don't want to rehash the plot; you can get that in the overall review.<br />What is so refreshing about Coben is his ability to stage not only remarkable action and suspense scenes, but such dynamic interpersonal scenes as well.  This novel has several:  Myron trying to talk to his dad about his heart attack--their awkwardness in what appears to be a shifting of roles; Myron and Greg have a short but powerful scene where Greg tries to apologize for what he did to Myron, and Myron's reaction to that apology; Myron's meeting with his son, Jeremy, and how he tries to tell him the truth; there are many, many of this types of scenes in this book.<br />My only &quot;complaint&quot; is that I don't know whether the identity of the real murderer is revealed or not; it's a labyrinthine story, and by the time it's over, you don't know who did what to who.  This could be a ploy of Coben's to follow-up in a sequel, or maybe he wants everyone to make their own decision.  I also find the character of Therese Collins, Myron's new love interest, to be tedious and boring; we know very little about her, which I'm sure Harlen plans on addressing in future Bolitar novels.<br />But, hey, what a great book in an excellent series.

Calistra Marley is a forensic pathologist, and hubby Plato (that's right) is a geriatrician, a doctor who specializes in the treatment of the elderly.<br />This first mystery establishes right away how &quot;perfect&quot; and &quot;cute&quot; Cal and Plato are for each other.  Sometimes this cuteness becomes tedious, but at the same time, their love for each is refreshing and necessary to make this type of fiction work.<br />In this story, our heroes are attending a geriatrics conference at a rambling lodge outside of Cleveland (a novel setting, to say the least).  Assembled there are various physicians, some of them with dark secrets, others just out and out cantankerous, conceited, or obnoxious.  When one of the physicians dies under mysterious circumstances, our heroes jump in to see if homicide was prescribed.  And then, another physician---a pretty obnoxious one----meets his fate mysteriously on the tennis court.  Now homicide seems a definite occurrence.<br />The murder weapon was obvious to me right away, and the identity of the killer, as well, although Pomidor does throw a few red herrings here and there.<br />The resolution is kind of fitting, and all in all, this is an entertaining, if not exciting or original, entry in the medical cozies.  I've noticed that Pomidor hasn't written any more in this series since 1998?<br />I wouldn't rush out to buy this, but if you like an easy read, it's enjoyable.	2000-09-26

In &quot;The Revelation,&quot; a reissue of his first Bram Stoker Award-winning horror fest, the killers are babies and feti (fetuses?).  These babies are those who have died over the years from either abortion, stillborn, or just dropped off by their parents. After a confusing opening centering on some Anasazi Indians (ever notice how in horror books, the Anasazis are the only Indians ever used---what happened to the Cherokees and the Iroquois?).  Oh, well, once you get through that prologue, the novel creeps along very mysteriously, building a lot of suspense and doom.  The character of Brother Elias is a little over the top, and some of the characters speak and behave in cliche manners, but as far as horror books go, what do you expect.<br />Be warned, though.  This is a very graphic novel, and the body count is astronomical, especially for such a small town.<br />There are also some scenes that can be interpreted as blasphemous to serious Christians.  For example, the crazed (or is he?) Brother Elias mocks the Last Supper by making the heroes eat portions of a dead fetus and drink the blood of one of their buddies.  This particular scene is questionably in bad taste, and if it had been left out, the book would not have suffered. There were also some characters introduced so briefly, you wonder why Little did it!!<br />All in all, though, Mr. Little does deliver frenetic,  unusual books, loaded with social satire and dark humor.	2000-09-24

First and foremost, Lee Child is a very good writer, and although this one moves a little slower than its predecessors, it still maintained my interest---and also &quot;riled me up&quot; a little.<br />I think Mr. Child definitely has a poor opinion of the FBI.  This is the third of the series that has some really nasty FBI agents---bribing, blackmailing, insinuating absurdities, and even more!  (If you've read the previous three, you will know what I mean!).<br />The plot is great; the killer's m.o. is quite unusual and even if really far-fetched, works in that the reader never knows how the victims died!  However, I must admit, that I had the killer figured out very early.  Oh, yes, Lee did try to throw us some red herrings (including the enigmatic appearance of an Army chaplain, who comes out of nowhere, and disappears back, without any explanation!).<br />And maybe I'm getting old fashioned, but come on, Jack.  You have turned into a really self-centered, insensitive, self-pitying moron who refuses, yes REFUSES, to live in a civilized, realistic world.  I know many readers think that Jack's meandering all over the globe makes him a free spirit, an independent guy, no chains to hold him down.  It also makes him shallow and annoying.  He says he loves Jodie--bull, Jack.  You love the sex you have with her.  If you really loved her, would you be so enamored with FBI agent Lisa Harper?  And all this gobbledygook about commitments and normal living, it's just more self-centered crap focusing on your inability to live in a real world.  And Child should be chastised for making Jodie the culprit in the end of the book.  Oh, Jack, I had really started to like you, but even in &quot;Tripwire,&quot; I started seeing a side of you that made me respect and enjoy you less and less.<br />You are a great detective, a remarkable physical presence, but society doesn't need guys who take the law into their own hands without any moral ramifications, and a man who uses women for his immediate pleasure but just can't bring himself to face the truth that he isn't worth their time.<br />Now, with that out of my system, it's still an entertaining read, but I don't think I'll venture along with Jack any further.  I enjoy escapist entertainment, after all, that's what it's all about.  But don't give me a hero who breaks all the rules and invites us to see him as a hero.<br />Goodbye, Jack!ake the law into their own hands without any moral ramifications, and a man who uses women for his immediate pleasure but just can't bring himself to face the truth that he isn't worth their time.<br />Now, with that out of my system, it's still an entertaining read, but I don't think I'll venture along with Jack any further.

You can certainly expect exciting action  scenes, plenty of fisticuffs, and a large dose of graphic violence.  &quot;Tripwire&quot; is no exception.  The book is an excellent read.  Reacher finds himself caught up in the investigation of a star helicopter  pilot missing in action in Vietnam and assumed dead.  The boy's parents, in  grief for thirty years, send a PI to find Reacher, only to have the PI  killed hours after meeting with Reacher.  From that point on, the plot  twists and turns, always sustaining your interest.  Although the ending is  easily predictable from the start, it's fun riding along with Child on the  inevitable denouement.  Hook Hobie is an extremely nasty villain and  presents a formidable challenge to Mr. Reacher.  His henchman are likewise  pretty despicable.  Some of the supporting characters are really well  written, particularly the victimized Marilyn Stone and her real-estate  agent friend, Sheryl.  Marilyn displays quite a bit of spit and vinegar and  loyalty to her milktoast husband, and plays a hard game with Hobie, for a  while.  Sheryl, meanwhile, displays a tremendous amount of loyalty to her  friend.<br />A great book but some additional points of concern or discussion.  I have found it hard to accept Jack Reacher's obvious inability to  function &quot;normally&quot; in the world.  A drifter at heart, he doesn't  seem to want to belong in anyone's world----he falls in love at the drop of  a hat, but is not willing to make any commitments, always seeming  self-centered in his inability to be &quot;tied down.&quot;  He doesn't  have a job, he's never had a home of his own, and he avoids reality as it  were a plague.  While this makes for a dynamic and &quot;legendary&quot;  type of hero, it leaves Reacher the man hollow and almost apathetic.  Finally, in &quot;Tripwire,&quot; his romance with Jodie awakens Reacher to  these facts and as the book comes to a close, he starts acting like a human  being, thinking of settling down, having a house, etc.  I'm sure  &quot;Running Blind&quot; will pick this up and hopefully develop it.  Jack  Reacher is a great character, and I like him, but if he becomes a little  more human, it will make him even more likeable.<br />Disappointments:  What  happens to Marilyn, Chester, and William Curry.  They are pivotal victims  in the climactic scene, and at its resolution, we don't know what happens  to them.  The Stones part in the novel are integral to the plot, and we  come to care about what happens---especially to Marilyn.  This lack of  resolution is downright criminal, Lee!<br />Also, where did Hobie get his  contacts in Hawaii and Hanoi?  It's never explained---they just exist.  Hobie doesn't seem to have a &quot;worldwide&quot; scam going, just a local  one.<br />And what about Tony, his mysterious &quot;is he gay?&quot; aide?  What is their relationship, and how did it begin?  Tony intimates he's  known Hobie for a long time, but there's never any connection between the  two.  Tony obviously cares a great deal for Hobie, but there is no  development of this relationship.<br />Maybe minor quibbles, but I feel valid  ones.<br />At any rate, if you've followed Jack Reacher this far, as I have,  you will undoubtedly want to read &quot;Running Blind,&quot; which I will  start soon!facts and as the book comes to a close, he starts acting like a human  being, thinking of settling down, having a house, etc.  I'm sure  &quot;Running Blind&quot; will pick this up and hopefully develop it.

Earthquakes in London and Scotland.  Steaming geysers erupting all over the  world.  Sandstorms, tsunamis, cyclones.  The disasters are plenty in James  Herbert's amazing view of an ecological apocalypse.  So far, out of all the  Herbert books I've read, this is his finest hour.  In ways, it is much more  accessible and believable than Stephen King's classic &quot;The  Stand.&quot;  Herbert captures you from the very beginning, and sketches  some very believable characters:  James Rivers, at first a skeptic and then  a believer, finds out the frightening truth about the ecological disasters  that are threatening the world as we know it; Diane Poggs is a woman with  two adopted children possessing extraordinary psychic powers; Hugo and  Bibby Poggs are her father and mother-in-law; supporting characters in  various scenarios are given powerful moments.  And, the villain of the  piece, the gargantuan Mama Pitie' is a frightening and disturbing  antagonist.  The rush to save the world from ultimate disaster is filled  with very frightening scenes of the earth's awesome power and terror.  The  &quot;lights&quot; in the book at first frightening and disturbing  transform into harbingers of hope by the end of the story.<br />This is a  fantastic read, and certainly deserves more attention than it received.	2000-09-12

Nonetheless, it has some pretty nasty villains,  and some intriguing plot twists and action scenes.  This time around, Child  decided to use third person for his narrative; that may be what makes this  one a little weaker.  There was something about seeing everything through  Jack's eyes in &quot;Killing Floor.&quot;  This story, however, would not  have worked in the first person.<br />Both novels have relied on some pretty  far-fetched coincidences to hurl Reacher into the plot, but this is  fiction, and the suspension of belief is something required in this type of  novel.<br />With all that said, Child still is a writer to reckon with.  This  book is entertaining and has a satisfying, if somewhat rushed,  resolution.<br />Definitely worth reading, though.	2000-09-07

Lee Child has given us perhaps the most interesting and  complex hero in some time.  Jack Reacher is Clint Eastwood, John Wayne and  Arnold Schwarzenegger rolled into one...but with much more personality and  pizzazz!  I'm only sorry it's taken me so long to read Mr. Child's book!<br />The story is a riveting one, focusing on Jack's involvement in a crime  in a small town in Georgia.  Boy, does he make a mistake in deciding to  stop off in this little burg, just to find out about a blue singing legend  named Blind Blake.  But, what a story unfolds.  The dialogue is brisk,  economical, and very involving!  Along with Jack, there are a ton of  characters that are so remarkably fleshed out and described, you would  think this was a true crime story!<br />There are scenes of nail-biting  action; very graphic and disturbing scenes of violence; and amidst all this  some really well-written scenes of sensitivity and poignancy.  Jack's  meeting with an old lady who once knew the old blues legend is outstanding  in its emotional punch!  Paul Hubble, the neurotic banker; Roscoe, the  beautiful policewoman; Finlay, the chief of detectives; and the evil  villains are some of the best written characters in recent mystery  fiction.<br />What is so amazing about this book is the way Lee Child has not  only woven a complex murder mystery, but also a chilling tale of greed,  madness, and lost loves and lives.<br />This is an emotional, wrenching debut,  and I cannot wait to start in on the rest of this series!<br />An outstanding  piece of fiction!	2000-09-05

The team of Preston and Child have written some  great stories, and ironically, this one is the most &quot;different&quot;  of their tales.  The concept is typical Child/Preston:  give us a huge cast  of characters; a seemingly impossible challenge; a truly nasty villain; and  some breathtaking moments of action and suspense.  The story is fairly  simple:  a huge meteorite has been discovered on the Isla' Delacion, near  the end of the world (Antarctica).  Fanatical billionaire/trillionaire  Palmer Lloyd wants the meteorite in his own private museum, and so hires a  remarkable team of specialists to transport the humongous meteorite back to  New York City.  Wow, what a challenge!  The pacing of this book is much  more deliberate and methodical than previous Child/Preston books; and  that's not negative in the least.  We're given some complex characters,  human and imperfect.  The scenes in the little village of Puerto William  are awesome in their descriptive power.  Never has a book so enthralled me  with its ability to transport me into a world I will probably never see,  but find fascinating and spellbinding.  The scenes depicted on the stormy  and icy seas are truly nervewrecking and draining.<br />What makes the book  work, however, is its characters.  First and foremost is the fascinating  Eli Glinn; not a villaint/not a hero, just a perfectionist whose brilliance  is unmatched.  It is his inability to accept failure that makes him such a  tragic character; Rachel is a beautifully drawn female character, with  definite hangups and frailties, but she's marvelous; Sally Britton, the  indomitable captain with her own history of failure, is likewise remarkably  drawn.  The Chilean Villain (nice rhyme?) is despicable and you can't wait  for him to meet his just desserts.  His manic drive to revenge the death of  his first mate, so to speak (no plot giveaways here), is frustrating and  unnerving, because you can't believe how close he comes to his goal.<br />In  reading the book, it was amazing.  I wanted the team to succeed; sure we  have our typical crazy wealthy man sacrificing human life for his own  needs, but the characters are so committed to making it work, that I felt  like I was right there with them.<br />It's amazing:  Preston/Child give  away the novel's &quot;secret ending&quot; early on in the book, but you  don't know it until you reach the end.  And, oh what an ending.  I should  have known----it needs a sequel!  They can't just leave us hanging, can  they?  Let's hope not.<br />&quot;The Ice Limit&quot; is unique in its  exploration of human drive, determination, and refusal to give up.  Although tragedy certainly results and some memorable people are gone, the  spirit of success and adventure far outweigh the greed and manipulation.<br />Read this for an interesting change of pace.rustrating and  unnerving, because you can't believe how close he comes to his goal.  <br />In  reading the book, it was amazing.

From there, we meet the hero, Jeremy Ross, a  brilliant young medical student working in the ER in New York City.  An old  flame, Robin, arrives and asks Ross' help in finding out the true cause of  her father's death---her father being the aforementioned Defense secretary.  What entails is a cat and mouse game of espionage, genetic evils, hardcore  villains, and the always present evil government agencies and agents.  Mezrich moves the story at a good pace, and has some fine moments of  sizzling action and spooky suspense.  Ross' major flaw is the  &quot;superhumanity&quot; of his heroes, Jeremy and Robin.  It's hard to  believe that these two young people can single-handedly defeat some of the  world's most seasoned killers, and save the day in such Marvel Comics  fashion.  I liked the characters, and the story definitely held my  interest.  The final showdown between the mad scientist and our heroes,  however, seems forced and slightly anti-climactic.  I also had problems  with the three stages of the viral menace.  The first two are obviously  very deadly, but the final stage seems less threatening, although its  magnitude is certainly frightening.  All in all, a tense thriller, and  shows that Mezrich has a talent to be reckoned with.	2000-09-04

I have to admit there are some truly hilarious scenes and situations in the book, but there  are times when Fitzhugh bogs it down with his relentless insistence on  letting us know how Bob feels about his work, his wife, and his child.  Bob  comes across as a selfish, inane, inept, and generally ridiculous man.  Each time one of his cross-bred non-pesticide attempts fail, he seems  dumber and dumber.  But, he's your hero, and you have to wish him well.  The assorted supporting characters are wonderful, particularly the suicidal  #1 hitman, who befriends Bob; the clothes-conscious Jean, assistant to  Marcel, the hit negotiator; and some of the other assassins, particularly  the French beauty who has a hilarious moment when looking for gourmet  chocolates in a quick-stop place.  Another interesting moment occurs when  the transvestite dwarf killer comes on to an overweight, underloved woman,  who wants to make out while eating peanuts.  This is a rather  &quot;touching&quot; and poignant moment, almost out of place in this  frantically paced novel.  Give Fitzhugh credit, though--it's vastly  entertaining, and you can forgive it's obvious flaws because it does make  you laugh.	2000-09-04

Mr. Racina is a good writer and he maintains your interest throughout.  Even though you know the murderer right away, he weaves an intricate story  on just how he plans to get away with it.  There is an underlying cruelty  to the story; the murderer is in love with the daughter of his victims, or  should I say &quot;obsessed with lust&quot;.  Some of the violence and  sexual descriptions are graphic, but do supply additional reasons to really  dislike the villain.  There are points early on when you really do kind of  like Matthew Hinson.  That's scary, and a credit to Racina's writing.  Racina does well too in the fact that he doesn't go deep into Matt's psyche  to rationalize his behavior.  As one of the characters says, 'You're the  exception...you were born nuts!&quot;  How refreshing in this day of  writers who feel you have to feel sorry for their sick, depraved characters  because of something that happened to them in their childhood.  All in all,  the story is compelling, but it is rather unbelievable that Matthew can  fool the heroine with such obvious bull....Oh, well, I shall not complain.

What a shame.  I can't  imagine having to live with a family like this.  But as far as a novel  goes, E.W. Summers has constructed a strong narrative, told from the  viewpoint of Richard Corey Hayes.  He's the brother to a woman who murders  her abusive husband.  Claire is her name, and due to this murder, Richard  spins a story of a family that would make anyone's skin crawl.  Not only is  one of the parents extremely abusive and sexually perverted, the other  parent takes delight in watching the perversion go on.  There's also a gay  brother, Max, and a runaway sister, Elizabeth, and a deceased sister, Tina,  who committed suicide as her means of escape.  Ms. Summers moves between  the present narrative into flashback episodes very smoothly, and the book  has a haunting quality.  I find it hard to really like any of the  characters, although I wouldn't be human, if I didn't admit I felt pity for  them.  Even though the happy ending seems a bit contrived, and the just  desserts are not meted out, at least it keeps the novel from being a real,  real downer.  Ms. Summers first novel demonstrates a great talent; let's  hope her next novel is NOT based on any dysfunctional families.  It's  comparison to &quot;Prince of Tides&quot; is irrelevant when one considers  the story is based on true facts.<br />Michael Butts	2000-08-18

Bill Pronzini spins a tale of two men, both of  them harboring deep secrets and hurts from their pasts, who will come to  meet in an absorbing tale of deception.  Pronzini's prose is crisp, terse,  and gripping.  The characters of Cameron Gallagher, a man haunted by the  tragic deaths of his parents, and Nick Hendryx, the husband of a woman  comatose from a hit and run accident, are complex and very human.  There  are times when you're rooting for one character and then find yourself  rooting for the other.  The supporting characters are interesting too,  particularly Cameron's sister, Caitlin, and Cameron's wife, Hallie.  Nothing is what it seems as the plot flows effortlessly on, and by the end  of the book, you're finding yourself surprised at how the twists work.  A  deep, dark, unsettling, but excellent read.<br />Michael Butts	2000-08-14

With &quot;The Uncanny,&quot; Klavan  attempts to revamp the traditional ghost story by setting it in modern  times and giving us &quot;hip&quot; characters like Richard Storm and  Sophia Eberling.  Somehow, for me, it just didn't work.  The setting at the  &quot;Bizarre&quot; magazine was novel, but not all that interesting.  The  ghost story itself was lame and poorly conceived.  Although the book has  flashes of brilliance, they are far too few, and overall, you're left with  a rather unsatisfying ghost story.  Read Peter Straub's &quot;Ghost  Story&quot; for better chills!<br />Michael Butts	2000-08-13

It's rare when a sequel outdoes its original, but with Steve Alten's  &quot;The Trench,&quot; he proves it can get better the second time around.  This is a much more inventive and exciting story than the first book,  &quot;Meg.&quot;  We get to know the characters a lot better around this  time, and Alten has given us two really despicable villains - Benedict  Singer and the absolutely sociopathic Celeste.  There are so many times in  the book I want to punch her lights out, that it gets to be real fun just  waiting to find out how she will get her demise!  And she does.  Jonas is a  human character with fears and flaws, and he carries the book nicely.

The plot is so contrived that any of its intricacies and  complexities are lost in slow moving scenes and unbelievable characters.  Farris has his typical gore, murders, double crosses, and chase scenes.  What is missing, though, is any characterization.  Full of stereotypes, and  he loses it big time with the characters of Rosalind and Sarah.  Such  wicked ladies, and yet, he tries to make us like them in spite of their  wickedness.  The novel starts off great, and has some riveting suspense in  what happens to Shay Waco and her daughter Pepper.  Once they find the  murdered families, though, it's downhill.  Typical drug pushers; typical  crooked federal agents; and a typically disgusting brother for the sheriff.  Even the character of Vida, Sheriff Bonner's adopted son, is wasted.  His  relationship with Rosalind is pure hokum and a mere plot contrivance.  I  hope Farris gets back on track after this disappointment.  He can certainly  do better!<br />Michael Butts	2000-08-11

At that point, however, I found it impossible just to stop  reading it!  Good thing I didn't!  This is an unusual book in its plotting,  pacing, and the complexity of its characters.  The whole premise of a  &quot;reincarnated Hitler&quot; is far-fetched, indeed, but Boyll handles  it with finesse and you as the reader know that there is something deeper  than this hypnosis-induced confession.  The book is populated with some  very likeable and dislikable characters. Hank and Rebecca Thorwald are  interesting victims, in that they try to react in ways that would get them  out of their predicament.  Rebecca is particularly resourceful, determined,  and a strong female character.  Karl Von Wessenheim, Ronno Ulgard, and his  mother are villains of the most unusual sort.  There are times when you  actually root for Karl and Ronno; but the mother is reminiscent of the  Angela Lansbury character in &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;---what a  witch!  (Substitute a b for the w in this one!).  A strong supporting  characters is Dutch, a retired cop who helps Rebecca out.  And of course we  can't forget Alan Weston, the epitome of the t.v. tabloid host.  A bitter,  caustic, and lonely man, Alan emerges as a very focal character in the  book.  It's scary to think that Adolf Hitler could still have such an  influence on any society, and that Americans would react in such a violent  way.  However, in reading the papers recently, I can see where something  like this could unfold easily.  But read this book, and enjoy it's  excellence.  The semi-climax on the train is breathtaking; the final scene  with von Wellenheim is priceless.  Look for more expert stuff from Mr.  Boyll!<br />Michael Butts	2000-08-09

A serial  killer on the loose.  Alex Kava's &quot;A Perfect Evil&quot; uses this  setting to unravel a disturbing and compelling story of perfect evil.  I  admit that I had a hard time putting the book down, finishing it in one  day, so that's definitely a sign it's an above average thriller.  The plot  has been laid out in other reviews, so I won't bore you with more.  I can't  give the book five stars, though, for two reasons:  the dialogue and  description of Nick and Maggie's romance is reminiscent of a Barbara  Caitland romance novel, which is out of place in such a graphic,  well-plotted novel.  It tends to lessen the suspense, even though the  characters are well developed and likeable.  I just wish Alex would have  stayed more within the confines of her novel.  The other is that even  though Ms. Kava takes us on several &quot;red herrings&quot; and twists,  the killer's identity is much too obvious early in the book.  To her  credit, she plants some other possible suspects, but if you've read  mysteries a lot, the identity is way too easy to spot.  The ending  obviously leaves room for her sequel, coming next year:  &quot;Split  Second.&quot;  I don't know if she'll keep both Maggie and Nick for the  sequel, but I hope she does.  They are great characters who I really liked.  They could ditch Christine though.  Her &quot;conversion&quot; to a  likeable character didn't work for me; she still remains a victim of her  own ambition, and even though she transformed, I'll bet she returns to her  real self if she's in the sequel!  But, anyway, this is a very good debut,  and one worth reading!<br />Michael Butts	2000-08-03

John Saul got started writing masterful tales of families that go beyond being merely dysfunctional.  I have often wondered if Mr. Saul had a good childhood, after reading his novels focusing on evil children, weak  parents, stifling relatives.  John left that behind for a while, but  returned with the rather disappointing &quot;Right Hand of Evil,&quot; and  now his latest shocker, &quot;Nightshade.&quot;  Since the plot has been  discussed several times, no need to summarize.  Suffice to say, this is a  nasty little novel, full of incest, sexual frustrations, murder, gore, and  extremely unlikeable characters.  Saul is very good with this genre, and he  is at his best in this novel.  Although there are lapses in suspense and  evidence of some &quot;padding,&quot; the novel works as an eerie ghost  story----and you have to ask, are we dealing with possession or split  personalities?  Who is the child in the beginning of the book?  What  happens at the end with Kelly and Matt?  As usual, Saul infuriates us with  the demise of one of the most likeable characters in the book, but he has  always done this.  You know when you read a John Saul book, no one is safe  from the grim reaper.  But enjoy the book for what it is---an offering from  a master at creating really unearthly families!	2000-08-01

Once upon a time in a little town called Windale, Massachusetts, three witches were hanged by the neck until dead.  They were Elizabeth Wither, Rebecca Cole and Sarah Hutchins.  And these were not poor, innocent women  executed because they look cross-eyed at some leering magistrate.  These  women were bad, really bad.  Especially the Widow Wither.  (Try saying that  five times in a row fast!).  And as any good witches should, they didn't  die when they were hanged.  No sirree..good thing, too, as there wouldn't  have been a book by this wonderful writer J. G. Passarella (two writers?  according to the copyright).<br />&quot;Wither&quot; is a spell-binding  foray into a nightmare world of withcraft and chicanery.  This is an  excellent first novel, and one that will greedily consume much of your time  as you struggle to read it in just one sitting.<br />As in horror king  Stephen King's earlier books, the premise of &quot;bad things not happening  to good people&quot; is thrown out the window with maniacal relish!  You  don't know who's going to come out ahead in this one.  Suffice to say, the  villainesses are rotten to the core; the writing is economical and  original; and the characters fleshed out just right.<br />Read this one with  the lights on (as if you could read it with them off?), but enjoy---it's  one of the best horror novels in years!<br />Michael Butts for MikeRachelButts	2000-07-30

The addition of  the giant bat, in spite of what other reviewers say, is a great twist.  As  in any book of this type, the characterizations are secondary to the  monster and the attacks.  I found the characters very interesting, and  Rovin's pace is tight and enjoyable.  I anxiously awaited the movie version  of this book, and have yet to see it materialize.  I hope the dreadful  &quot;Bats&quot; with Lou Diamond Phillips doesn't discourage the ultimate  filming of &quot;Vespers.&quot;  It would be a great fun flick!	2000-07-29

This is a very good book, although I liked Rovin's first book, &quot;Vespers&quot; a  little better.  It is obvious from the start that the predators are  sabre-tooth cats, so there's no real suspense in that in itself.  However,  Rovin cleverly unfolds his plot in a tense and effective manner.  Rovin  does very well in establishing characterizations, even in those characters  whose presence is only to be victims of the cats.  The characters of Jim  Grand and Hannah Hughes are very well developed, and readers can identify  with their personal &quot;hangups&quot;.  Grand's devotion to his departed  wife is especially credible and touching; it shows how hard it is to let go  of someone you loved deeply.  Hannah is feisty, yet vulnerable, too.  Sheriff Malcolm Gearheart is a little too cliche and predictable, but  offers the necessary antagonism.  The denouement is chilling and upbeat,  which is nice in these days of cliffhanger endings.  All in all, a good  read.	2000-07-29

All of Garrison Allen's &quot;Big Mike&quot; mysteries/comedies are some of the best and most entertaining reading I've encountered in some time.

The food  fights, the things he does to Tweedledum and Tweedledee are priceless  feline encounters.  So, where is the latest Garrison Allen installment?

The first four books in this series were very entertaining, fresh, and full of fun!  However, in this one, Anne George loses that magic.  One of  the problems is the many sub-plots that only drag the book down:  Her son  and daughter-in-law's marital problems; her dog getting bit by a possum;  the investment club plot that doesn't really go anywhere.  Also, in this  one, the sisters aren't really involved enough to be in any danger.  They  merely provide the supporting encouragement to the accused, who you know  didn't do it.  The revelation of the culprit is hasty, and ill-defined.  She's also wearing some of her inside jokes pretty thin.  I'm kind of tired  of hearing about Vulcan's butt in every chapter.  Ms. George continues to  have some funny dialogue with her sisters, but overall, this book is  tedious, and easy to put down.  Hopefully, the next one &quot;Murder  Carries a Torch&quot; will resurrect the magic.	2000-07-27

Anyway, back to FALSE MEMORY.  Dean Koontz is undoubtedly a prolific and  smart writer.  He doesn't pretend to be a great writer; he is successful  because he is an ENTERTAINING writer, and &quot;False Memory&quot; with all  of its implausibilities, loop holes, and seemingly endless scenes, is still  a darn good read.  The characters of Dusty, Martie, Skeet and Fig Newton  are very likeable and readers should empathize with the horrible plight  they have been placed.  Also, the character of Susan Jagger is a remarkably  sympathetic character, in a very small but important supporting role.  The  story opens with Martie taking her agoraphobic friend Susan to the  remarkable Dr. Mark Ahlstrim.  Next thing you know Martie confronts her own  phobia:  autophobia, fear of oneself.  Now that's one to knock your socks  off.  Granted, the scenes in which Martie rushes through the house to get  rid of any potential weapon are a little too long and overwrought, they  establish the depth of her paranoia.  Koontz reveals the villain early in  the book, and even though you know what's going on, you don't have all the  gory details until a showdown late in the book with Dusty's parents.  And  the villain of this piece (I WON'T TELL!) is one of the vilest Mr. Koontz  has presented us with. And you know what's nice--Koontz doesn't try to make  us feel sorry for the guy because of his pathetic childhood existence.  Nor  does Koontz leave us hanging with any loose ends in this one.  That is  certainly refreshing after having just finished Stephen Dobyns' &quot;Boy  in the Water&quot; and Peter Straub's &quot;Mr. X&quot;.  Mr. Koontz has  learned through his years of successful writing that ultimately you have to  please your audience; scare them, puzzle them, but don't leave them hanging  in the air with presposterous literary shenanigans.

I really enjoyed this book, up until its climax and prologue.  The story is unique and riveting.  The book opens with the discovery of a body floating in a  swimming pool of a private school.  Two individuals discuss the body and  you know from the start that they are villains and despicable.  You also  know that they want to make sure that the school's new headmaster vacates  the premises.  From there, we get a very tangled web of deception, greed  and general nastiness.  Mr. Dobyns' has created some very interesting and  well-developed characters.  Most of them have dark, deep secrets; many of  them are out and out unlikeable!  What was disappointing about this novel  is that by the end, we get the impression that the nastiest villain of all  is excused because of his upbringing and society's general ineffectiveness.  I am frankly getting tired of writers wanting you to feel sorry for their  villains!  Another weakness, in my opinion, is that the prologue does not  effectively resolve the story.  It is told from the point of view of one of  the supporting characters, and you don't know what happens to the main  characters.  Unless Mr. Dobyns plans a sequel, this is very disappointing.  But enough sour grapes, it's definitely worth a read; it's atmospheric,  spooky and quite original.	2000-07-12

One of the most rewarding things about reading a Jeffery Deaver is that you never know where he will take you by the time you've finished.  And this is a great way to lure readers back.  And he's done it again with  &quot;The Empty Chair.&quot;  Although I didn't find it as satisfying and  thrilling a read as &quot;The Devil's Teardrop,&quot; it is nonetheless an  extremely well-written and plotted thriller.  As in the past, Deaver piles  on plot twist after plot twist, and even when you're only three or four  pages from the end, he throws in one last clinker.  They're always  believable, and you want to slap your head and say, &quot;I should've seen  that.&quot;  This book's strengths (aside from the aforementioned twists)  is its characterizations.  Rhyme, Amelia and Thom remain intricate,  complex, vulnerable, human and interesting.  The supporting cast in this  one is top-notch, particularly Garrett Hanlon, the Insect Boy; Lydia  Johansen, an early kidnap victim; Lucy Kerr, a very sympathetic cop with a  secret history of her own; and Ben Kerr, a college student  &quot;volunteered&quot; to assist Lincoln in his search for the villains.  The villains are as always vile and contemptible, and no one is who they  seem to be as in any Deaver novel.  All in all, it's a great read, and you  won't be sorry you read it.  If you are, then you're not a true Deaver fan!	2000-06-16

In reading some of the customer reviews, I found myself wondering if we were reading the same book?  &quot;Praying for Sleep&quot; was my introduction to the talented Mr. Deaver, and I found that it was just as  exciting and intense (albeit in a different way) as his later releases.  I  don't know whether people who read his newer works were expecting too much,  or what.  But the fact is, just like any Deaver novel, &quot;Praying for  Sleep&quot; is definitely worth reading. It's gripping, full of surprises  and in my opinion, extremely well-paced.  While maybe not his best work, it  is still an extremely well-written book, and beats the pants off most of  the other so-called &quot;thriller writers&quot; out there!  I suggest some  of these people go back and read it again---maybe it was the mood they were  in?	2000-06-16

His dark, pessimistic view of life,  particularly of youths and their parents, has always been a little  disturbing, but his stories have held our interest and got us caught up in  the plots effectively.  Not so with this book.  John has written this book  so many times, I have to wonder why he bothered.  It's so predictable!  Hopefully, his upcoming release will exonerate him from this pedestrian  effort!	2000-05-08

It's to Mr. Savage's credit that  another integral plot twist is a little more unexpected.  With that in  mind, though, it is definitely worth reading.  Savage lures you into his  plot very quickly and his characters are interesting.  And as in his  previous works, nothing, no one is always exactly as they seem!  No more,  though...hate people who give away too much, don't you?  Savage fans will  be happy anyway, and new readers should go back to &quot;Precipice,&quot;  &quot;Valentine,&quot; and &quot;The Inheritance&quot; to see Mr. Savage at  his peak!	2000-04-27

Unusual Setting, not many book set in Jerusalem which mades it more fun.  That changes with a move to L.A.  Add all the adjustments the hero has to make. Plus a very good mystery.  If you can find this book, it is worth the read.	2000-04-04

His discriptions of the wonderful foods on this City made me hungry the entire book.  Mr. Heck weaves a very good mystery.  He also  understands the culture of the time and explains it very well.  The author  captures Mark Twain's humor in his characters, many times I laughed out  loud. Mr. Heck's books are worth the read.	2000-02-24

Harlen Coben has created the most realistic, complex, likeable, yet human, character in crime fiction.  Myron Bolitar is somebody I'd like to meet and get to know.  Sure, he has his  faults; that's what makes him so interesting!  All the novels have been  layered with brilliant plotting, clever denouements, and some of the most  fleshed out characters I've ever had the pleasure to read.  This one is a  gripping and suspenseful entry in this wonderful series!  Harlan should try  and put out two of these a year, they're so good.  Of course, if that would  mean sacrificing the incomparable quality, I guess I'll just have to wait  for my yearly fix.  By the way, my wife introduced me to Harlan about eight  months ago, and I read all of his books at once.  I see now why she was so  anxious to get his books once a year.  I had the pleasure of getting them  all at once!  Keep up the amazingly good work, Mr. Coben.  I may be your  greatest NEW fan!	2000-02-14

This one is no exception.  The thrills keep coming.  Dirk Pitt is a great hero.  And the messes he and Al get into and out of are just plain fun.  With the added bonus of the  historial information that Mr. Clussler packs into his books is first rate.  Mr. Clussler does a lot of research to get his facts right which makes his  books even more fun.  I look forward to another book by Mr. Clussler, soon  I hope.	2000-02-01

From the first novel we read by him, &quot;Praying for Sleep&quot; right up to this riveting thriller, Deaver has proven himself the master of plot and characterization.  &quot;Devil's Teardrop&quot; is undoubtedly his best  work yet.  The plot is mesmerizing, intricate without being labrynthine,  and full of surprises and twists.  I pity the poor lady reviewer (recorded  here elsewhere) who found this a poor vacation book!  This is a great  read---everyone who likes a GREAT SUSPENSE TRIP should hop on the Deaver  bandwagon.  He's the best there is!	1999-10-16
